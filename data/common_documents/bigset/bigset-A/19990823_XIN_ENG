<HEADLINE> Minister: Russian Troops Block Militants in Daghestan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Russian federal troops have
blocked off and partially surrounded several villages in the
Daghestani district of Botlikh where Islamic militants remain,
Russian Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
An access route to the neighboring Vedensky district in
Chechnya, along which militants received food and ammunition, has
been severed, the Interfax news agency quoted Rushailo as saying.
</P>
<P>
Federal forces have almost taken control over the Tsumada
district, he said.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no frontal assault," Rushailo said, adding that
special units and equipment will be used in the operation to root
the Islamic militants who have been haunting the Daghestani
villages bordering the breakaway Chechen republic since August 7.
</P>
<P>
He said that mercenaries from other countries, notably "Saudi
Arabia, certain Pakistani circles and the (United) Arab Emirates,"
are taking part in the fighting in the mountains of Daghestan.
</P>
<P>
The Russian law enforcement agencies have asked their
colleagues in the United States, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Israel
for information support, as well as operational and investigative
support when necessary, the ministry said, adding that the
countries have all expressed readiness to help.
</P>
<P>
As federal forces continued their assault on the militants,
Shamil Basayev, the Chechen field commander leading the Islamic
gunmen in Daghestan, Sunday launched another operation against
federal authorities code-named "Imam Gamzat-bek."
</P>
<P>
"This stage sets far-reaching military and political
objectives," Interfax quoted Sirazhdin Ramazanov, prime minister
of the so-called Islamic State of Daghestan, as saying.
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and the country's top
law enforcement leaders met Sunday to focus on the situation in
the North Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, Federal Security Service
Director Nikolai Patrushev, Chief of the General Staff Gen.
Anatoly Kvashnin, and Rushailo, the interior minister, attended
the meeting that covered strategy, tactics, rear operations, the
political situation and assistance to refugees.
</P>
<P>
Putin also held a separate meeting with Daghestani State
Council leader Magomedali Magomedov on the efforts of the
Daghestani authorities to exterminate the bandit formations and
end the fighting, Interfax said.

<HEADLINE> Tupras Plant in Northwest Turkey After Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISTANBUL, August 22 (Xinhua) -- A few hundred meters away from
the three giant oil storage tanks, which had been in flames since
Tuesday morning till Saturday night, one can still see the terror
of the newly-extinguished inferno in Tupras, northwest Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Under the instruction of a guard, who declined our direct
access for safety reasons, we drove a big C-turn around the
state-run oil refinery to arrive at a grassland which was
separated from the plant by a wire netting and a half-deserted
light railway and which overlooks the fire-stricken part of
Tupras.
</P>
<P>
There, 200-300 meters ahead, fire engines were still shooting
water at the three neighboring storage tanks to try to cool them
off and prevent them from rekindling.
</P>
<P>
After five days of raging fire, the three tanks were totally
destroyed. Scorched and smoked, their iron frames, previously
white coated and now black, were distorted and compressed like
crushed paper bags.
</P>
<P>
The fire at Tupras was once a major concern of officials and
people living in quake-striken Izmit, an industrial center in
northwest Turkey and which was one of the worst ravaged area in
Tuesday's 7.4-degree quake which has so far killed over 12,000
people.
</P>
<P>
A five-kilometer zone was evacuated around the plant since
Tuesday under the fear that the flame could have engulfed the
entire field of 30 giant storage tanks and even spill over to a
nearby fertilizer facility with 8,000 tons of dangerous ammonia,
thus touching off an environmental disaster.
</P>
<P>
In the fertilizer plant nearby, water was spilling over
several giant spherical ammonia-containing tanks from valves set
at their tops, in an effort to cool them off. A seagull of the
adjacent Marmara Sea was perching on one of the tanks for a short
rest.
</P>
<P>
Since fire erupted in Tupras Tuesday, firefighting planes had
been dropping chemical foam to try to quell the flames. But the
flame and smoke, which leaped hundreds of meters above, were
taken under full control only on Friday and were finally put off
later Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Tupras plant, built in 1961 under United States
supervision, provided over one third of the retail and industrial
fuel in Turkey.

</P>
<P>
Kocaeli is the most seriously devastated province after the
monster quake hit the western Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Dismisses U.S. Announcement of Suspending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Sunday dismissed as "a
game of words" the U.S. announcement that the U.S.-British air
raids against Iraqi targets in the no-fly zones will be suspended
if Iraqi air defenses stop targetting allied warplanes.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Ministry of Information and Culture said
in a statement said that the remarks made by Pentagon spokesman
were aimed at continuing the U.S. and British violations of Iraqi
airspace, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the the U.S. spokesman attempted to spread
a false understanding that Iraq has accepted the no-fly zones
implicitly.
</P>
<P>
He affirmed that Iraq totally rejects the no-fly zones and
will go on firing at the enemy planes violating its airspace,
"because this is our legitimate right to confront any
aggression."
</P>
<P>
"He who kills the innocent Iraqis, destroys their civilian
installations and ruin their houses must never be trusted or
believed, therefore we will carry on our confrontations against
enemy warplanes to defend our land and sky," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon announcement of conditional suspension of air
strikes against Iraqi targets came after U.S. and British
warplanes bombed some residential areas and targets outside of
the no-fly zones and killed 20 Iraqi civilians and injured 10
others.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi spokesman said that the U.S. must immediately
abolish the no-fly zones imposed on Iraq unilaterally by the
U.S. and Britain without the authorization from the U.N. Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones were imposed on Iraq by the U.S.-led western
allies following the 1991 Gulf War with the claimed aim of
protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the
south against attacks by Iraqi government troops.
</P>
<P>
Since last December's U.S.-British airstrikes against Iraqi
targets, Iraq began to fire at U.S. and British warplanes
patrolling the no-fly zones.
</P>
<P>
And U.S. and British warplanes have been targetting ever since
Iraqi civilian and military targets in the no-fly zones, causing
severe civilian casualties and property damage.

<HEADLINE> Another Earthquake Occurs in Western Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Another strong earthquake with
a magnitude of 5.0 struck western Turkey on Sunday, the
semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted officials of Bogazici University Kandilli
Observatory as saying that the quake, which happened in Sakarya
(Adapazari), was confimed as an aftershock following the
devastating earthquake measuring 7.4 on the Richter scale on
August 17.
</P>
<P>
The aftershock occurred at 17:30 local time (14:30 GMT), but
no serious damage or injuries from the jolt have been reported.
</P>
<P>
The epicenter of the aftershock was about 130 kilometers about
east of Istanbul, the largest city of Turkey,
</P>
<P>
Over 60 aftershocks measuring at least 4.0 on the Richter
scale have occurred since the quake hit western Turkey
in the early hours of August 17.
</P>
<P>
The massive quake has killed over 12,000 people and injured
over 33,000 others in the region since then.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Meets with Opposition Faction Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Palestine
Liberation Organization (PLO) Yasser Arafat met here on Sunday
with the leader of the opposition Democratic Front for the
Liberation of Palestine (DFLP).
</P>
<P>
Arafat led a delegation of his Fatah movement, PLO's most
powerful faction, to the meeting with a DFLP delegation headed by
Nayef Hawatmeh, secretary general of the group, in a bid to mend
the fences between the groups.
</P>
<P>
This is the first encounter of the two men since the signing of
the Oslo accord in 1993 between the Palestinians and Israel. The
peace accord forms the main basis of the peace talks between the
two sides.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters before the meeting, Palestinian Minister
of Planning and International Cooperation Nabil Shaath described
the session as an opportunity to "open the door for Palestinian
comprehensive national dialog." Shaath, a key member of the Fatah
central committee and negotiator with Israel, also attended the
talks.
</P>
<P>
The Arafat-Hawatmeh meeting is part of Arafat's effort to reach
Palestinian national reconciliation and unite the Palestinian
position on the final status talks with Israel on thorny and
significant issues including Jerusalem, Jewish settlements and the
Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
In an earlier step on August 1, Arafat met with a delegation of
the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), another
opposition group, in Cairo. The two sides agreed to continue
dialog and called on other groups to join the process.
</P>
<P>
Fatah is the main force to support the Oslo accord and the
peace process while the Damascus-based DFLP and PFLP are both
opposed to the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived in Cairo Sunday after an earlier meeting with
President Hosni Mubarak in Egypt's Mediterranean port city of
Alexandria on the latest development of the Palestinian-Israeli
talks. Hawatmeh flew into the Egyptian capital on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Iran Expects Economy to Grow 6 Percent Annually </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Head of Iran's Plan and Budget
Organization Mohammad Ali Najafi said Sunday that the country's
annual economic growth in the next five years will reach 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Najafi, who is also vice president, said the growth rate is
envisaged by the third Five-Year Development Plan (March 21,
2000-March 20, 2005), compared with the annual average of 3.2
percent in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a gathering of heads of Iran's representative
missions abroad, he said the third development plan expects
non-oil exports to top 34.5 billion U.S. dollars in the
five-year period.
</P>
<P>
During the second development plan period, non-oil exports
reach 17 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Imports in the third development plan are estimated at
112.5 billion dollars, compared with 82 billion in the second
development plan, he stated.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, inflation will be put down to 15.9
percent from 26.5 percent in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Najafi said 1.35 million job opportunities were created in
the second development plan period, and 3.7 million more will be
added in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
He also expected an influx of foreign investments as a result
of the country's detente policy, which he said would reduce the
amount of public investments.
</P>
<P>
Iran's economy, which relies heavily on crude exports,
suffered a setback this year because of low oil prices on
the international market.
</P>
<P>
With inflation freewheeling, there have been complaints about
government's handling of economic affairs and that reforms have
not been translated into economic fruits.

that one chimney in the refinery had collapsed.

<P>
Germany, Azerbaijan, Greece, France, the Netherlands,
Kazakistan, Ukraine and Russia participated in the fight against
the blaze that threatened to engulf the entire field of the 30

Turkish experts are expected to make research about the
pollution caused by the burning, which has spread to large
areas around the Izmit Refinery.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Artists Calls for Setting up Art School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Zambian artists have urged the
government to set up an art school at any of the country's two
universities so that the development of art into an industry and
major tourist attractions can be accelerated.
</P>
<P>
A group of artists made the call when they met here Saturday to
discuss the forthcoming art exhibition to be held in the capital
later this month, according to Sunday Mail.
</P>
<P>
They said that art in Zambia has not been given the necessary
exposure to fully develop and encompass it as a major tourist
activity that can earn the country lots of money.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of an art school will encourage a lot of
people to fully develop their art skills and produce international
quality materials that will earn the country more money, they
said.
</P>
<P>
"We are getting into fourth decade of independence but we still
don't have an art school in university. We're probably the only
country in this part of the world that is denying the development
of creative thinking that goes with the teaching of art at higher
institutions of learning," an artist complained.
</P>
<P>
The art exhibition to be held is aimed at depicting the African
blend of culture as well as the technical aspect of the artists.
</P>
<P>
"We want to show the people that art is a profession like any
other form which you can earn a living," said the artist.

TEHRAN, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Foreign Ministry
spokesman on Sunday denied that Pakistani Embassy in Tehran was
attacked, saying it was a robbery near the embassy.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Hamid-Reza Asefi said several thieves attacked Law
Enforcement Forces soldiers in a street leading to the embassy to
rob the guns, and they fled after clashes.
</P>
<P>
"The attack had nothing to do with Pakistani Embassy," he
said, quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency. But he did not
mention whether the attackers have been captured.
</P>
<P>
Tehran and Islamabad have been trying to mend fence. They were
at odds because of their support to different factions in
Afghanistan's civil war. A series of terrorist murders of Iranian
nationals in Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban's killing of Iranian
diplomats and a reporter worsened the situation.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani interior minister is to start a four-day visit to
Tehran Monday at the invitation of his Iranian counterpart. Asefi
hoped the visit would help remove misunderstandings between the
two sides.
</P>
<P>
The visit is part of regular exchanges between the two sides
on important issues, including punishment of murderers of
Iranians in Pakistan and bilateral cooperation in fighting drug
trafficking, Asefi said.
</P>
<P>
But he added that issues concerning Afghanistan, India and
Pakistan would not be on the agenda.

The Supreme Court has confirmed the death sentences on the

extortion, rape and abduction. But no details were given about
them and their crimes.
</P>
<P>
Four other accomplices were sentenced to prison terms ranging

</P>
<P>
The condemnation seemed to be timed to warn against a surge of
crimes.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Senator Opposes to Disarmament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The chairman of the Nigerian
Senate Committee on Defense Sunday expressed his disagreement with
planned cuts in the size of the country's armed forces, saying it
would undermine its role as a regional power.
</P>
<P>
Senator adolphus wabara said in capital Abuja that he did not
see any " sense" in the plan, announced last week by defense
minister, retired general Theophilus Danjuma.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the across the board cuts would
affect the three services -- army, air force and navy, reducing
the country's armed forces from about 80,000 to 50,000.
</P>
<P>
"as a regional power, Nigeria needed a strong army to play its
role (and)
</P>
<P>
I don't see any sense in the planned reduction," wabara of the
country's upper house of legislature said.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria provided the bulk of the regional peace-keeping force
during two peacekeeping operations in neighboring Liberia and
sierra leone.
</P>
<P>
In liberia the Nigeria dominant forces helped restore democracy
to end a 7-year civil war and in sierra leone, it helped sustain
president tejan kabbah before the July 7 agreement with rebels of
the revolutionary united front.
</P>
<P>
Wabara said the cuts could only be justified if "accompanied
with a formidable reserve force" of civilians exposed to
compulsory military training between the ages of 18 and 20.
</P>
<P>
The chairman also criticized the defense budget in president
Olusegun Obasanjo's supplementary budget before the national
assembly, describing it as inadequate for the country's defense
needs.
</P>
<P>
"the equipment used by the military is extremely expensive
(while) most of its equipment is grounded. I am ashamed to say
Nigeria has an air force or navy that has no planes or warships,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He proposed a 33 billion naira supplementary expenditure to
take care of the recurrent and capital needs of the country's
military, about 14 billion naira more than the19 billion naira in
the budget.

although remaining at the top of the overall standings.
</P>
<P>
Makinen retired on Saturday after a transmission failure on his
Mitsubishi vehicle. With 48 points, he finished 10 points ahead
of Auriol's Toyota while Sainz and Kankkunen each have 34.
</P>
<P>
Kankkunen began Sunday's race in the lead and never looked in
danger even facing a late charge from Burns.

<HEADLINE> Technology Innovation Key to China's Development: People's Daily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- China's flagship newspaper,
People's Daily has prepared an editorial for tomorrow's edition
hailing the opening of the national technology innovation
conference.
</P>
<P>
The editorial points out that restrained by limited resources,
China with one fourth of the world population must devote itself
to developing new and high technology and upgrade its capability
of innovation in order to become one the world's medium-developed
countries in the first decade of the next century. It is doomed to
failure to simply pursue expansion of scale and quantities.
</P>
<P>
Scientific researchers should make breakthrough in some key
industries and important fields by giving a full play to their
wisdom and creativity. China should develop high-tech industries
with its own intellectual property right (IPR) and promote
renovation of the traditional industries with high technology.
</P>
<P>
Innovation of technology, development and industrialization of
high technology must be motivated by reforms, it says, adding that
technology innovation is the result of the socialist market
economy.
</P>
<P>
"We should speed up establishment of a modern enterprise system
and perfect the technology innovation system in enterprises by
deepening the nation's economic restructuring," the editorial said.
"We should strengthen research and development focusing on market
demands and national security by promoting the reform of
scientific and technological system."
</P>
<P>
Most scientific research institutes should be turned into
enterprises and scientific researchers encouraged to carve out in
the competition.
</P>
<P>
The article calls for efforts to cultivate and improve the
innovation consciousness and ability of the whole nation by
reforming the education system and practicing quality-oriented
education.
</P>
<P>
The role of small and medium-sized enterprises which are based
on science and technology should be played in intensifying
technology innovation and developing high technology. Such
businesses are highly specialized and flexible with less burden,
it says.
</P>
<P>
"We'll make full use of the current situation under which some
scientific research institutes are in the transition period and
the economic structure is being adjusted," it says. "Scientists
and technicians should be encouraged to run science- and
technology-based small and medium-sized businesses and to develop
competitive products or services with their own IPRs."
</P>
<P>
Young people should be given more opportunities to undertake
the historic mission of technology innovation. The editorial calls
upon the whole society to participate in and support the national
campaign of technology innovation.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan NPC Deputies Finish Visit To Southern Chinese Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, August 22 (Xinhua)-- A delegation of 9 Taiwanese
deputies to China's National People's Congress today urged Yunnan
province to improve its investment environment and further expand
economic and cultural exchanges between the province and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The delegation arrived the southwestern China province on April
12 to look at some Taiwan ventures and ethnic villages in the
cities of Kunming and Dali and the investment and living
conditions of Taiwanese business people there.
</P>
<P>
The deputies praised the Yunnan government for its efforts to
attract investment from Taiwan and to protect the rights and
interests of Taiwan compatriots and said that governments at the
province and county levels have done well in using tourist
resources to attract a large number of visitors and investors from
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen of the province's districts and prefectures have Taiwan
ventures and a majority of the 322 Taiwan ventures in the province
have been showing good results.
</P>
<P>
But, in comparison to the more advanced coastal areas, Yunnan
still lags behind in both the quantity and quality of investment
from Taiwan, the deputies pointed out, suggesting Yunnan to make
an effort to learn more about Taiwan and help solve difficulties
of Taiwanese business people.
</P>
<P>
Provincial Governor Li Jiating said that their advice was
practicable and that he would put it to use.
</P>
<P>
The delegation concluded its visit today.

<HEADLINE> China Trying to Improve Fire Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINGDAO, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Importance needs to be placed on
public fire services to improve fire control in cities and towns,
according to participants at a national meeting on the public fire
service here today.
</P>
<P>
More than 230 cities in China lack funds to develop public fire
services. As most of the existing fire-fighting facilities are
outdated and cannot meet fire control needs, serious fires are
often reported in these cities, according to participants.
</P>
<P>
Up to 51 large stores, markets, hotels, and restaurants burned
up in the period from January last year to July this year as the
direct result of a lack of public fire services.
</P>
<P>
Participants called on governments at all levels to give equal
attention to the construction of fire-fighting facilities and the
development of cities and towns, which was echoed by Construction
Minister Yu Zhengsheng at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Public Security Minister Jia Chunwang also seized the
opportunity to urge police and fire fighters of the country to
improve the control of fire-fighting equipment and make full use
of the facilities.

<HEADLINE> 2 Israeli Soldiers Wounded in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Two Israeli soldiers were
wounded Sunday morning in south Lebanon during attacks by
Lebanese guerrillas, Lebanese security sources said.
</P>
<P>
The two Israelis were slightly injured when Lebanese
guerrillas fired mortars toward their position in the central
sector of the Israeli occupied border zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, said in a
statement that its fighters attacked Israeli troops near Sojud
in the central sector.
</P>
<P>
Its guerrillas also launched assaults on nearby Israeli
positions at Melikh and Armata villages with heavy machine-guns
and mortars.
</P>
<P>
In response, Israeli artillery troops fired shells toward
suspected Hezbollah targets in the border enclave, destroying at
least four civilian houses.
</P>
<P>
Since the start of this year, 13 Israelis have been killed in
south Lebanon and 44 others wounded, while 19 Lebanese guerrillas,
mostly from Hezbollah, have been also killed.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon' resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to oust Israeli occupation forces out
of the country.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia: Capital Exit Levy Remains, But No New Restrictions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia said Sunday that
the capital repatriation levy imposed on February 15, 1999, would
remain, but no new restrictions on capital flows would be imposed.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's National Economic Action Council (NEAC) announced
the stand in a statement issued here following a joint economic
and financial briefing for over 50 fund managers and analysts here
last Friday on the performance and policy direction of the
Malaysian economy and issues in the run-up to September 1, 1999,
the first anniversary of Malaysia's adoption of selective capital
controls.
</P>
<P>
The NEAC emphasized that the repatriation levy would remain,
saying it was not deterring potential investors into the country
as it was designed to encourage longer-term investments.
</P>
<P>
"What we need to do, perhaps, is to simplify further the
administration of the levy system. So far, we have experienced a
net inflow of funds from abroad after the implementation of the
levy system on February 15, 1999," it said.
</P>
<P>
The NEAC, however, stressed that Malaysia would not impose new
restrictions on capital flows if there was continued net outflow
of funds.
</P>
<P>
It said Malaysia was well-positioned to withstand the potential
outflow of funds after September 1 when the one-year ruling on
holding portfolio capital ends.
</P>
<P>
The exit levy, which was favorably received by the market,
facilitated a more graduated outflow of funds prior to September
1, the NEAC said.
</P>
<P>
It said that even more encouraging was that there was an inflow
of new portfolio funds amounting to 4.2 billion ringgit (about
1.105 billion U.S. dollars) since the implementation of the levy.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Hunting for Fraudulent Power Meter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The state-owned Tanzania
Electric Supply Company (TANESCO) has embarked on a massive hunt
for culprits who temper with the electricity meters by conducting
fraudulent checks
</P>
<P>
TANESCO managing director Baruany Luhanga said in Dar es Salaam
Sunday that a syndicate, including current and former employees of
his company, played tricks with the meters and extorted money from
customers.
</P>
<P>
Luhanga disclosed investigations have so far given positive
results and some culprits have already been netted.
</P>
<P>
The investigations have been made following complaints from
customers that they are harassed and extorted by people believed
to be TANESCO workers or former employees of the company, he said.
</P>
<P>
The complainants claimed that some people visited their houses
saying they were on routine checks of electricity meters and
deliberately tempered with the devices.
</P>
<P>
A few days later the same or another group of people came and
said that they discovered that customers have played tricks with
the meters, an offense that is liable to a fine of 500,000
shillings (about 625 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The customers, who felt cheated, went to the TANESCO head
office to make complaints but could hardly clear their name as the
company feels difficult to judge what happened.
</P>
<P>
The swindlers then told the customers that a payment of 200,000
 shillings could make the malfunctioning meters come back to
normal.
</P>
<P>
The managing director called on all customers to be alert on
people who come to check their electricity meters and if the
customers are in doubt they should demand identity cards from the
inspectors or even seek assistance from the police or the TANESCO
office.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's Deputy Minister
of Labor and Youth Development William Lukuvi has urged youths of
his country to bear the society's need in mind and not to be
choosy about jobs, media reports said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 26th graduation ceremony of Splendid Secretarial
College in Dar es Salaam Saturday, Lukuvi said youths should
engage themselves in any legal activities that can earn them
incomes.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister said there has been a tendency among
Tanzanian youths of not doing menial jobs at home but rather doing
the same kind of jobs abroad.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, he said, "Here in Dar es Salaam we have witnessed
a change of attitude among young people. Some of youths that have

<HEADLINE> Greek FM Stresses Friendship With Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister George
Papandreou stressed Monday in the southern Greek island of Crete
the great importance of the friendship between the Greek and
Turkish peoples.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou said although the old problems on bilateral
relations still remain unchanged, events taking place during the
past few days following the fatal earthquake in Turkey when the
Greek people have shown enormous sympathy and willingness to help
Turkish victims, demonstrated that there was a great stock of
friendship between the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
This has given rise to a perspective of peaceful coexistence of
the two countries, the minister was quoted by the semi-official
Athens News Agency (ANA) as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Let us hope that prospects for peace, cooperation and sincere
friendship indeed emerge from the tragedy," he said.
</P>
<P>
The earthquake, measuring more than 7.4 on the Richter scale,
hit northwestern Turkey early Tuesday morning and has claimed over
12,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis sent a message of
condolences on Tuesday to his Turkish counterpart, Bulent Ecevit,
to express Athens' willingness to assist Turkish earthquake
victims.
</P>
<P>
Several Greek Air Force C-130 transport planes have flown
medical and other supplies to quake-ravaged northwestern Turkey,
and Greek rescue teams with sniffer dogs have joined similar units
from other countries in helping look for survivors.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, have been at odds for
decades over their disputes on territorial waters, air space
limits, the continental shelf in the Aegean Sea and the Cyprus
problem.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believed that Turkey's deadly earthquake has
generated huge sympathy in Greece and the tragedy may help improve
relations between the two neighboring countries in a long term.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Visiting South Korean Foreign
Affairs and Trade Minister Hong Soon Young and Japanese Foreign
Minister Masahiko Komura held talks Monday to exchange views on a
wide range of issues.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers reaffirmed the agreement reached between the
two countries during South Korean President Kim Dae Jung's state
visit to Japan last October to build up a "new partnership toward
the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
Among specific undertakings, they agreed to start full-fledged
negotiations next month toward concluding a bilateral investment
treaty, a Japanese Foreign Ministry official said.
</P>
<P>
As tangible cooperation between Japan and South Korea, Hong and
Komura agreed to set up a hot line between their foreign
ministries and to conduct joint rescue drills in October between
their maritime police authorities following a similar exercise
recently staged by their naval forces, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Hong, who arrived here on Sunday for a three-day visit to Japan,
also met with Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and Chief
Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka later in the day.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Hong, Nonaka sought to allay concerns
in South Korea that Japan might be moving politically to the right,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to keep in mind the time in history when we
caused trouble to the people of China and the Korean Peninsula,
and will also make efforts from the point of view that Japan's
peace, security and prosperity should be achieved within the peace,
security and prosperity of the region," Nonaka was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Japan's recognition of the Hinomaru as the national flag and "
Kimigayo" as the national anthem, two sensitive symbols for their
links to the country's imperial system and wartime militarism, as
well as a proposal to look into allowing official visits to
Yasukuni Shrine dedicated to Japan's war dead, have raised
concerns in its neighboring Asian countries, including South Korea.

GENEVA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has requested the United
Nations to help it obtain 45,000 body bags as a consequence of the
devastating earthquake last week, according to the U.N. disaster
relief agency here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sergio Piazzi, head of the European desk at the U.N. Office for
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), told a news briefing
that the request had been received from Ankara on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Piazzi said Turkish authorities feared the death
toll in the quake could reach 40,000. The body bag request
appeared to indicate that they now believed the final figure could
go higher. The latest confirmed death toll was over 12,000.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Asked to Exert Influence on Turkey on Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides Monday said he expects the international community,
especially the U.S., to exert influence on Turkey for a settlement
to the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Receiving the credentials presented by the new U.S. Ambassador
in Nicosia Donald Bandler, Clerides said his government is willing
to participate in negotiations based on U.N. resolutions, but will
never accept the preconditions set by the Turkish side.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared in 1983 a breakaway
"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" that is recognized only by
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, backed by Turkey, has
refused to participate in peace talks on Cyprus unless "the
Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" is recognized.
</P>
<P>
He also demands the establishment of a "confederation of two
states" on the island, a position rejected by the Cypriot
government.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said the solution to Cyprus issue must be based on a
bizonal and bicommunal federation formula set by the U.N., and the
respect of the human rights of both the Greek Cypriot and the
Turkish Cypriot communities.
</P>
<P>
Bandler said that achieving a settlement to the Cyprus issue
remains one of the "major foreign policy priorities" for the U.S.
</P>
<P>
He said it is a task for the people of Cyprus themselves to
accomplish, but the U.S. will do all it can to help them.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Promotes Youth Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will host the World
Youth and Student Travel Conference 1999 (WYSTC) here next month
to promote youth tourism which it views as a vastly potential
market, the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
The organizers expect the conference, to be held from September
29 to October 2, will serve as an occasion to demonstrate the
emerging tourism destinations of Thailand and the Greater Mekong
Subregion countries, according to TAT.
</P>
<P>
The conference will provide the participants with an
opportunity to establish links with language centers, health and
meditation retreats, small hotels and motels, adventure travel
agencies and medium-sized tour operators, TAT said.
</P>
<P>
One of the conference highlights will be the introduction of
"ServEx", the year-around internet on-line travel market that will
enable buyers and sellers to do round-the-clock business, free of
charge.
</P>
<P>
TAT said it has established the Youth Travel Division to
encourage travel by both domestic and international young people,
who have longer than average lengths of stay and spend more money
in provincial areas.
</P>
<P>
Youth tourism, well established in North America, Australia,
New Zealand and Europe, is expected to enjoy the fastest growth in
the East Asia and Pacific region because of the small base there.
</P>
<P>
According to the World Travel Organization, youth tourism is
expected to make up 20 percent of global tourism market by the
year 2000, with a total estimate of 148.25 million youth trips,
excluding South Asia.
</P>
<P>
The Thai youth tourism market will increase from 8.7 million
trips per year in 1997 to 9.9 million in 2001, according to TAT.

LONDON, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Irish Foreign Minister David
Andrews said on Monday that he and Britain's Northern Ireland
Minister Mo Mowlam believed the Irish Republican Army's (IRA) two-
year-old truce was still intact.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks following his 90-minute talks with Mowlam

But Mowlam, who is assessing the state of the IRA ceasefire
after recent incidents, said she needed more information before
reaching a verdict.
</P>
<P>
She said she was awaiting additional information from America
and from the Irish before she makes a final decision.
</P>
<P>
With the province's peace accord stalled and a crucial review
starting in September, politicians are waiting anxiously for the
outcome of Mowlam's assessment -- which follows the murder of a
Belfast taxi-driver last month and claims of a plot to smuggle
guns to Ireland from the United States.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 23 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese legislator of
China has said that the country needs tougher measures against
illegal move in and out of the country and passport forgeries and
tighter entry and exit controls.
</P>
<P>
Zou Jiahua, the vice-chairman of the National People's Congress
(NPC) Standing Committee, told an NPC Foreign Affairs Committee
meeting on the exit and entry control law here today that there
needs to be stricter enforcement of entry and exit procedures
because illegal emigration has become serious in some coastal
regions.
</P>
<P>
The committee members discussed illegal emigrations and
passport forgeries and the misuse of passports with officials from
the foreign affairs and public security ministries and the State
Council's Legislative Affairs Office. The committee took a close
look at law enforcement late last year and asked these government
offices to deal with some problems they discovered.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, police stationed at coastal
ports discovered 668 cases of illegal emigration involving 3,651
people and police at mainland ports of entry stopped 3,915 people
who tried to cross the border illegally.
</P>
<P>
Police departments have intensified border inspections and have
set up information systems and improved management of agencies
that help people going abroad, according to a Public Security
Ministry official.

BANGKOK, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Thai people living overseas will
have the first opportunity to take part in elections in absentia
in next year's senatorial polls, the official Thai News Agency

voting units at Thai diplomatic representations and establishing
extra units in countries and regions in which large number of
Thais live, including the United States, Taiwan and Israel.
</P>
<P>
There are some 210,000 Thais living overseas.
</P>
<P>
According to the Election Commission, even if no Thai has
registered to vote in a particular country, the ballots will still
be organized in all countries where there are Thai diplomatic
representatives.

<HEADLINE> British Foreign Secretary to Back Pro-Europe Campaigners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 23 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook will speak out for a cross-party political campaign promoting
strong British engagement in Europe, said a local report Monday.
</P>
<P>
Cook, who was formerly seen as an influential Euro-sceptic,
will make a speech to the Britain in Europe movement which has
already won the support of Prime Minister Tony Blair and two
prominent opposition Conservative politicians, a Reuters report
said.
</P>
<P>
"He will certainly be involved in the campaign. It's something
we are delighted about," the report quoted a spokesman for Britain
in Europe as saying.
</P>
<P>
"His views are very influential, so it's very good news from our
point of view," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Cook's involvement in the campaign came after a growing Labor
drive against Conservative leader William Hague's more sceptical
Europe policies, especially on British euro entry.
</P>
<P>
The Labor government's increased confidence in tackling the
thorny issue of Europe follows a careful shift of emphasis after
it was defeated in June European elections, when the Conservatives
won on a "save sterling" platform.
</P>
<P>
Blair agreed to support Britain in Europe only after it agreed
to campaign on the broad benefits of EU membership instead of
pushing for quick entry to the single currency.
</P>
<P>
The broader emphasis was clear in the movement's welcome Monday
for Cook's backing.
</P>
<P>
"(Cook's) views are very much in tune with the campaign, that
Britain has benefited greatly from membership of the European
Union and that we should maintain a credible option to join the
single currency if the economic conditions are met," the Britain
in Europe spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"That is obviously in tune with the government's position," he
said.
</P>
<P>
But he declined to say when Cook's pro-Europe speech was
scheduled to take place, nor exactly when the delayed launch of
the Britain in Europe campaign would finally take place.

<HEADLINE> Unionist Leaders Says Peace Needs End to Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The Northern Ireland peace
process can only move forward if there is an "complete and final"
end to paramilitary violence, said the pro-British Ulster Unionist
leader David Trimble Monday.
</P>
<P>
"There can be no killing or maiming, neither on the terrible
scale experienced at Omagh nor on a smaller day by day scale,"
Trimble said during a visit to the Omagh International Summer
School on his first public engagement since his summer holidays.
</P>
<P>
"Part of the regeneration of Northern Ireland must be a
complete and final cessation of all violence for political ends, "
he added.
</P>
<P>
"The task of politicians from all parties is now to
reinvigorate the agreement and to realize the promise which the
agreement presented on that historic Good Friday," he said.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam is due to make a
statement on the state of the IRA ceasefire this week.
</P>
<P>
The Unionists have accused the Irish Republican Army of
breaking its ceasefire following the murder of a Belfast taxi
driver last month and allegations of arms smuggling to Ireland
from the United States.
</P>
<P>
With the province's peace accord stalled and a crucial review
starting in September, politicians are waiting anxiously for the
outcome of Mowlam's assessment.
</P>
<P>
The IRA declared a complete cessation of hostilities in July
1997 in its long war to oust Britain but the murder and the
gun-running plot claims have thrown a new spotlight on whether its
truce is intact.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Lashes Out Lee Tung-hui's Remark (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 23 (Xinhua) -- People's Daily, China's leading
newspaper, will carry a signed article tomorrow refuting the "two
states" remark of Taiwan's Lee Tung-hui, stressing the
internationally accepted fact that there is only one China in the
world and Taiwan is part of it.
</P>
<P>
This basic fact is safeguarded by the Chinese and widely
recognized by the international community, it says, but some
people in Taiwan have attempted to defend Lee Tung-hui and his "
two-states" remark, saying that it was meant to improve the level
of cross-Straits dialogues and to establish a democratic and
peaceful system.
</P>
<P>
The article says that this preposterous utterance is still
negating the One China principle.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of China (CPC) has always adhered to
peaceful negotiations for the reunification of the country based
on the One China principle which has served as the guideline in
cross-Straits negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan authorities would be entitled to equal positions in
cross-Straits dialogues and negotiations if they abided by the One
China policy and stood firmly against "two Chinas" or "one China,
one Taiwan" ideas.
</P>
<P>
The article mentions a series of CPC principles for the Taiwan
issue since the early 1980s and says that what Lee has attempted
is not to improve the level of cross-Straits dialogues but to up
the level of divisiveness.

<P>
WASHINGTON, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Hurricane Bret was downgraded
to a tropical storm Monday but it continued to drench southern
Texas State of the United States with heavy rain.
</P>
<P>
The storm, the biggest hurricane to strike Texas in nearly 20
years, continued to drench the region with thunderous squalls
Monday, but no injuries have been reported since Bret made
landfall about 6 p.m. (local time) Sunday in sparsely populated
Kenedy County.
</P>
<P>
Up to eight inches of rain had fallen in some areas by early
Monday and flooding was expected, the National Weather Service
said. There was still a chance of isolated tornadoes.
</P>
<P>
As daybreak approached, damage assessment teams were getting
ready to comb the seven counties where Texas Governor George W.
Bush declared emergencies Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Damage was substantial in Falfurrias, about 100 kilometers
southwest of Corpus Christi, Mayor Michael Guerra said.
</P>

Power outages also were reported from the state's southern tip
near Brownsville and McAllen to the counties surrounding Corpus
Christi, said Jessica Mahaffey, spokeswoman for Central Power and

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Lashes Out Lee Tung-hui's Remark (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The reunification of China is an interior issue, the article
says. Taiwan has been part of Chinese territory for ages and has
never been a sovereign country. This basic fact can not be changed
by anyone, it says, and the reunification of the country could be
peaceful under the One China principle.
</P>
<P>
Under the principle, the position and level of Taiwan and the
Mainland in negotiations are equal, and the form, name and place
of negotiation can be flexible. Lee vainly hoped to deny the One
China principle with his "two-states" remark, but alienated
himself from the Chinese nation and from everything possible in
peaceful negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The article warns Lee that anyone attempting to negate the One
China principle to divide the country will be a sinner in the eyes
of the Chinese people who will not offer such a person any
position or conduct any dialogue with him at any level.
</P>
<P>
Lee was up to his old tricks in making the "two-states" remark,
but he has forgotten two essential facts: that the Chinese people
will make every effort to safeguard the integrity and sovereignty
of the country, and that foreign countries have their own
strategic interests that precede all decision making.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people as a whole will not allow Lee to gamble with
the interests of Taiwan compatriots and anyone who tries to get
foreign backing for his dirty tricks will come to a bad end, the
article says.
</P>
<P>
The article finally advises Lee to take back his remark, return
to the One China position, and do what any Chinese honestly would
do for the country's reunification.

GAZA -- Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said Monday
that Israel has agreed to release Palestinian prisoners in two
stages, the first batch in early September and the second on
October 8.
</P>
<P>
However, the two sides failed to reach agreement on the number
of prisoners to be released in each phase.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, Erekat said the two sides agreed to set up a
joint committee to follow up all issues related to detainees in
Israeli jails and to suggest further releases.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side is demanding that Israel set free 650
Palestinian prisoners, whereas, the Israeli side insists that the
number to be released will not exceed 250.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, differences are still there, particularly on the
timetable of Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank, he said.
</P>

The two sides are working out a "memorandum on the timetable

BAGHDAD -- A number of Iraqi civilians were killed on Monday in
U.S. and British warplanes' attacks on civilian targets in
northern Iraq, said a source in the Iraqi Ministry of Information
and Culture.
</P>
<P>
The source told reporters on condition of anonymity that U.S.
and British warplanes bombed some civilian facilities in the
northern no-fly zone on Monday morning, killing a number of
civilians and injuring some others.
</P>
<P>
The source did not give the exact figure of casualties. The
Iraqi military spokesman who usually announces incidents of this
kind has not made any comment.
</P>
<P>
The latest U.S.-British bombardment of Iraqi targets came five
days after the Pentagon announcement that the U.S.-British air
raids against Iraqi targets in the no-fly zones will be suspended
if Iraqi air defenses stop targetting allied warplanes.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Iraqi Ministry of Information and Culture
said on Sunday that Iraq totally rejects the no-fly zones and
would go on firing at the enemy planes violating its airspace.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon made the announcement of conditional suspension of
air strikes against Iraqi targets after U.S. and British warplanes
bombed some residential areas and targets outside of the no-fly
zones last week and killed 20 Iraqi civilians and injured 10
others. (Iraq-US Attacks)

ROME, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Napoli's Russian international Igor
Shalimov has tested positive for the banned anabolic steroid
nandrolone and has been suspended from Italian soccer, the Italian
Football League revealed on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The League said in a statement that Shalimov failed a drug test
after a Serie B match between Napoli and Lecce on May 16.
</P>
<P>
The League said after an executive meeting on Saturday that the
former Spartak Moscow and Inter Milan midfielder had been
suspended as a cautionary measure.
</P>
<P>
Shalimov, 30, made his debut for Spartak Moscow aged 17 and
played for them between 1986 and 1991 before moving to Italy where
he joined Foggia, then in Serie A.
</P>
<P>
He moved to Inter Milan a year later and after two seasons at
the San Siro was moved to Germany's MSV Duisburg and Switzerland's
Lugano. He returned to Italy in 1995 and played for Udinese and
Bologna before joining Serie B side Napoli last season.
</P>
<P>
Shalimov made his international debut for the Soviet Union at
the 1990 World Cup. He played his last match for the Russians
last year.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Sets Targets on Poverty Alleviation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo has set specific human development targets and is
determined to achieve significant improvements in the living
standards of the people.
</P>
<P>
Concluding deliberations at an inter-ministerial forum at the
weekend, the president said that his government would in the next
three years aim at raising by at least 20 places Nigeria's
position on the Human Development Index (HDI) which has fallen to
146th out of 174 countries, according to a Vanguard report on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Human Development Report Nigeria 1998" issued by the United
Nations Development Program (UNDP) said in capital Abuja last week
that Nigeria had slipped from its ranking of 142nd in the last
year's report of the UNDP to 146th out of 174 countries in the
world.
</P>
<P>
The president told the forum which focused on poverty
alleviation in the country that to achieve this objective,
priority attention must be given to meeting specific goals in
areas such as education, health, water supply, electricity supply
and general income levels.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the health sector, his government would aim at
raising the percentage of children covered by the National
Program on Immunization from 30 percent to 100 percent before the
end of its tenure.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government, Obasanjo said, will also seek to raise
the level of adult literacy in the country from 48 percent to 60
percent within the same period.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that his government would work towards
raising the number of Nigerians who had access to potable water
from 30 percent to 60 percent of the population and the number
with access to electricity from 33 percent to 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo stressed that ultimate victory in Nigeria's war
against poverty must be based on a national movement "from
dependence on oil to the soil".
</P>
<P>
It is only through the massive development of the country's
huge agricultural potentials, could Nigeria rapidly raise its
employment levels, the productivity of its populace and general
income levels, he said.
</P>
<P>
The present administration, Obasanjo said, will remain focused
on the urgent revitalization of the country's agricultural sector
as the nucleus of all its programs and policies for poverty
alleviation.
</P>
<P>
The forum held in capital Abuja at the weekend was attended by
senior government officials, the special adviser to the president
on economic affairs and agriculture as well as the heads of the
various government poverty alleviation agencies.

<HEADLINE> Township Enterprises Now Key Part of China's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Township enterprises have become
a major force in China's rural economy after 20 years of
development, according to Qi Jingfa, vice-minister of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Qi reported today on the development of township enterprises to
the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Committee of the Ninth National
People's Congress (NPC), where he said that there were more than
20 million townships enterprises by 1998, employing 125 million
rural laborers.
</P>
<P>
These rural businesses contribute 60 percent of added value in
rural areas, 28 percent of the country's gross domestic product,
and 30 percent of farmers' incomes, and play an important role in
providing work for surplus rural laborers and in the industrial
sector, he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the NPC passed its Township Enterprise Law to protect
enterprises' rights and interests. However, Qi said, the
development of township enterprises is limited by poor product
quality, outmoded technology, serious pollution problems,
difficulty in getting loans, and unnecessary fees.
</P>
<P>
He also talked about problems in implementing the Township
Enterprise Law and about enterprise rights being violated and
enterprises behaving irresponsibly.
</P>
<P>
Buhe, vice-chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, said at the
same meeting that there should be better law enforcement because
township enterprises are becoming more important to national
economic development.
</P>
<P>
He said that the NPC is considering investigating the
implementation of the law and asked governments at all levels and
related authorities to give full support to township enterprises.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Two U.N. agencies Monday signed
an agreement in Arendal, Norway, in a bid to reduce the risk of
environment- related diseases, according to a news release
reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) Chief Klaus
Toepfer and the World Health Organization (WHO) Director General
Harlem Brundtland expressed the need for further cooperation in
environmental health when they signed the Memorandum of
Understanding.
</P>
<P>
"The partnership between the two bodies dealing with
increasingly crucial issues is heartening evidence of a new era
of inter-agency cooperation ushered in by United Nations reform,"
said Toepfer.
</P>
<P>
Brundtland noted that people face formidable challenges to
health and the environment on a global basis, adding that WHO and
UNEP working together can make real contribution to securing "our
common future" with healthy lives for peoples all over the world.
</P>
<P>
Infectious diseases currently cause about 37 percent of all
deaths worldwide, according to the U.N. statistics.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 40 percent of deaths can be attributed to various
 environmental factors, especially organic and chemical pollutants
and 2.5 million children die each year from diarrhoea caused by
contaminated water and food, the statistics showed.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will open up for cooperation in areas including
climate change and health, global surveillance of
environmentally caused diseases, environmental health of the
people in the Arctic region, environmental emergencies and health
and environmental effects of transport.
</P>
<P>
UNEP is headquartered in Nairobi.

NICOSIA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' Defense Minister
Yiannakis Chrysostomis Monday tendered his resignation to
President Glafcos Clerides "for reasons of dignity and
sensitivity."
</P>
<P>
Speaking to journalists at the presidential palace after a
brief meeting with President Clerides, Chrysostomis said the
president accepted his resignation.
</P>
<P>
Chrysostomis criticized the media for reporting a cabinet
reshuffle while the ministers themselves were kept in the dark.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he was led to this decision following reports alleged
he was going to be reshuffled, he said "a minister cannot carry
out his duties under such conditions."
</P>
<P>
However, he acknowledged that it is the president's prerogative
to replace his ministers.
</P>
<P>
Chrysostomis, a former supreme court judge and district court
president, was appointed to the defense ministry on january 5,
1999.

ISLAMABAD, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Some 4,000 Islamic activists
Monday ringed the American consulate in Lahore, Pakistan, to
protest the U.S. hunt for alleged terrorist Osama bin Laden.

The protesters were holding placards reading "Down with
America", "Osama is a Muslim world hero" and "We will protect
Osama with our blood", said sources from Lahore.

Local officials said security had been tightened around the
U.S. consulate, the American Center and residences of U.S.
nationals in the city.

<P>
The JUI has threatened to take revenge if the United States
conducts any military action against Afghanistan targeting Osama,
who is accused by Washington of involvement in the bomb blasts at
U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania last August. Osama is

</P>
<P>
Serezis told the press that the president had accepted his

<HEADLINE> Draft Gun Control Law Not Aborted: S. African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 23 (Xinhua) -- South African Safety and
Security Minister Steve Tshwete Monday denied newspaper reports
that controversial draft gun control policy had been scrapped.
</P>
<P>
Tshwete's spokesman, Andre Martin, told South African Press
Association that the process of drafting a new firearms control
policy document had not been halted, and the department would
present a final draft to Tshwete this week.
</P>
<P>
If the minister approved of the measure and its contents, the
document would then be presented to the cabinet for approval,
after which it would be published for public comment.
</P>
<P>
He said it was not possible to put a time frame to the process
at this stage.
</P>
<P>
But, Monday's Business Day newspaper reported that Tshwete had
halted the process because of "a deeply flawed process of drafting
and public participation".
</P>
<P>
The proposed legislation, aimed at curbing the spread of
illegal firearms, limits the gun licenses to one person, increases
the license fees and demands already-licensed gun owners reapply
for licenses.
</P>
<P>
The legislation also suggests that future applicants may be
required to undergo psychometric tests to determine whether the
applicant has the suitable traits to become a gun owner.
</P>
<P>
The legislation sparked controversy in the society. Anti-gun
lobby group, Gun-Free South Africa, welcomed it, saying it has
been asking for this kind of legislation for a long time.
</P>
<P>
It said almost 31 people die of gunshot wounds every day.
</P>
<P>
However, other interest groups such as the South African Gun
Owners' Association, claimed the legislation could drive the arms
retail and manufacturing industries to the wall.
</P>
<P>
There are also people who claim that if the legislation becomes
law, it will infringe upon a citizen's right to own a gun either
for self protection or for sporting purposes.
</P>
<P>
In a statement on Monday, opposition New National Party leader
Marthinus van Schalkwyk, said it was quite clear that the draft
legislation confused responsible, legal gun ownership with
criminal, illegal gun ownership.
</P>
<P>
The outcome of this process would have effectively outlawed gun
 ownership for ordinary self-defense, and would have severely
restricted participation in hunting and other shooting sports, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The government, however, believes that since most illegal guns
start life as legal guns, it is necessary to reduce the
proliferation of both.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Faction Leader Urges Joint Effort in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian people must join
in the process of the final status talks with the Israelis, a
hard-line Palestinian faction leader said here on Monday after a
reconciliation meeting with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Nayef Hawatmeh, secretary general of the Syria-based Democratic
Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP), suggested a
coalition representing all Palestinian factions be formed to
direct the final status talks and work out mechanisms for the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who is Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)
chairman, is currently directing the talks.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, leading a delegation of his Fatah movement, met Sunday
with a DFLP delegation headed by Hawatmeh. The meeting was the
first between the two men since the signing of the Oslo Accord
between the PLO and Israel in 1993, seeking to bridge gaps between
the two groups and reach national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
DFLP is opposed to the Oslo Accord.
</P>
<P>
Hawatmeh said the two factions had agreed to continue talks in
the near future, and that he hoped they will include other
factions.
</P>
<P>
Hany al-Hassan, member of Fatah's Central Committee, said the
movement is seeking a dialog that includes all Palestinian
factions "to strengthen the internal Palestinian front in the
coming negotiations with Israel."
</P>
<P>
It was still not clear whether all of the eight Syria-based PLO
factions, known as "rejectionists" because of their opposition to
the Oslo peace accord, would take part in such a dialog.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Arafat held talks with another Syria-based
hardline group, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine
(PFLP). Fatah and the PFLP have agreed to end years of rivalry.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's Rupee Loses 55 Paisas in 20 Days </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani currency of
rupee witnessed further erosion of seven paisas to 54.25 against
the U.S. dollar in the open market Monday, bringing the total loss
to 55 paisas during the last 20 days.
</P>
<P>
"It is all due to rising inter-bank rates," said a leading
currency dealer while justifying the upward revision in the dollar
rates by open market dealers.
</P>
<P>
The dollar was being bought and sold by currency dealers at
54.20/54.25 paisas in Kerb market as compared to 54.15/54.18 last
Saturday and 53.50/53.70 on August 3, according to open market
dealers.
</P>
<P>
Importers have resorted to huge buying while exporters have
held up transfer of their dollar proceeds into rupee accounts,
currency dealers said.
</P>
<P>
They further alleged that the financial institutions were also
lifting stocks from open market.
</P>
<P>
A treasury official from the State Bank of Pakistan, however,
brushed aside the allegations of Kerb market dealers and said that
they were very much in close liaison with the central bank.
</P>
<P>
"We had tried even to stabilize the rupee-dollar parity in the
inter-bank market," one official from the State Bank said.
</P>
<P>
The dollar witnessed maximum and minimum trading at 51.80 and
51.74.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the dollar rate will drop to 51.70 levels in the
forthcoming session," the official said, adding that debt
repayments by Pakistan scheduled for September this year might be
reason for some speculative activity in the currency market.

<HEADLINE> Three More World Records at Pan Pacific Swimming Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just a day after breaking the 400 meters freestyle world record,
Australian Ian Thorpe, 16, added the 200 meters mark with a time
of one minute 46.34 seconds in the same pool to be used for next
year's Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Less than 10 minutes later, American Jenny Thompson erased the
second oldest record on swimming's history books when she clocked
57.88 seconds in the women's 100m butterfly final to improve the
previous record set in 1981 by Mary T. Meagher.
</P>
<P>
Earlier South African Penny Heyns, 24, improved her own 100m
breaststroke world record. The dual Olympic champion had set four
world records in two days at a meeting in Los Angeles and
continued her amazing form when she arrived in Sydney, slicing
almost half a second off her 100m mark with a time of 1:06.52 to
set her fifth world record in as many swims.
</P>
<P>
Thorpe had collected the men's prize for his 400 meters victory
on Sunday, erasing the five-year-old world mark set by Australia's
Kieren Perkins.
</P>
<P>
Thompson, who has a record five Olympic relay golds but has
never won an individual Olympic title, had spent years chasing
Meagher's record. The 26-year-old swam the second fastest 100m
butterfly in history, in 58.15 seconds, a fortnight ago in
Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
She was 0.81 seconds under Meagher's time at the halfway point
of Monday's race. Although she slowed down on the final 50 meters,
she still reached the wall 0.05 of a second under the old record.
</P>
<P>
Brooke Bennett led an American one-two in the women's 400m
freestyle final taking the gold in 4:08.39, ahead of her
compatriot Lindsay Benko.
</P>
<P>
The only other two finals contested on Monday were both won by
Australians with Simon Cowley taking the men's 100m breaststroke
in 1:02.06 and Matthew Dunn the 400m individual medley in 4:16.54.

<HEADLINE> S. African Economy Continues to Grow in 2nd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 23 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) increased during the second quarter of the
year - for the third straight quarter in a row, figures released
Monday by Statistics South Africa showed.
</P>
<P>
The annualized increase in GDP for the second quarter, compared
to the first, was 1.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
For the preceding two quarters, the figures were 0.6 and 0.2
percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Annette Myburgh, Chief Director of Economic Statistics at
Statistics South Africa said, "About a quarter of the increase was
due to increased the transport and communications sector. Another
quarter was due to finance, real estate and business services. And
about half was due to agriculture."
</P>
<P>
The increase in agriculture, she said, was mainly because of
"good performance in some field crops... as well as rapid
expansion in poultry production."
</P>
<P>
The quarter-on-quarter increase within the agriculture sector
was about 4.6 percent, or 19.7 percent when expressed in
annualized terms.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Faces Food Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania faces food
shortages this year due to erratic rains, reduced use of improved
seeds and fertilizers and an outbreak of insect infestation.
</P>
<P>
A report released by the Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO) estimates that Tanzania's total cereal production comprised
of maize, rice, wheat, sorghum and millet in 1999 may reach 3.76
million tons, about nine percent below last year's output.
</P>
<P>
The report says that Tanzania has recorded food deficits in
several regions, especially in the northern Shinyanga Region where
cash and food crop production is anticipated to fall as much as 40
percent from last year' s.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is more serious than last year ... and effects
of the situation will really start to unfold from late September,"
Daily Mail Monday quoted a FAO official as saying.
</P>
<P>
But prospects for non-cereal crops, such as pulses, potatoes,
cassava and bananas, are reported to be satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
FAO experts also predicted bleak prospects for livestock
rearing with the onset of dry season in central and northern parts
of the country and reduced pasture and water supply.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's Economic Intelligence Unit (EIU) also forecasts an
impending food shortage in the country. It says in a report: "The
government now forecasts that around 600,000 tons of cereal
imports will be required in 1999."
</P>
<P>
FAO analysts, however, double the figure at 1.2 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Other southern African countries facing food shortages include
Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, Zimbabwe and Zambia where cereal
production in 1999 have been categorized as below average.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania was forced to import over 550,000 tons of cereals to
curb food shortages, compared with 210,000 tons in 1994/95 and
480,000 tons in 1997/ 98.
</P>
<P>
The government is now building up reserve stocks, trying to
import 175, 000 tons, 50,000 of which have already arrived. But
what worries the authorities is that so many countries this year
are facing cereal shortages, making competition for food handouts
from international community stiff.

<HEADLINE> China Jacking Up Financial Support For Housing Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 23 (Xinhua) -- China is trying to commercialize
the housing sector and boost housing sales by setting up housing-
related banks, funds, loans and mortgages.
</P>
<P>
To stimulate housing purchases and develop the housing market,
it is necessary to set up housing-related banks on a trial basis
in a number of cities that are expected to provide financial
guarantees, loans and mortgages, according to Vice Minister of
Construction Liu Zhifeng.
</P>
<P>
China has been in a major bid over the past few years to
transform its welfare housing system into a commercial housing
market where people have to buy their housing.
</P>
<P>
At present, China is still suffering from slack housing sales,
with 68.86 million sq.m. of housing lying idle, said Liu, who
attributed the lackluster market to a shortage of funds to
purchase houses and high housing prices.
</P>
<P>
He said China's financial departments have recently cut an
array of taxes on real estate transactions, in a bid to lower the
existing housing prices to a rational level.
</P>
<P>
The Vice Minister stressed the importance of strengthening the
public housing fund system to boost the purchasing power of
consumers.
</P>
<P>
China has initially established a nationwide public housing
fund system covering 225 cities above the prefecture level and 443
cities at county level. The country's accumulated public housing
fund totaled 123.1 billion yuan in 1998, up 54 percent over the
previous year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Arctic Expedition Encountering Polar Bears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SNOW DRAGON SHIP, August 23 (Xinhua)-- A helicopter had just
dropped six scientists who are part of China's first Arctic
expedition off at their research site, when three polar bears
suddenly came up to them on a floating piece of ice in the Arctic
Ocean today and startled them.
</P>
<P>
They stared at each other for about five minutes and then the
bears turned leisurely away, says Kang Jiancheng, a member of the
group who were collecting ice core samples today.
</P>
<P>
Sun Junying, a female member of the team, says that after she
heard Kang shout, she ran over to him and saw the bears a hundred
meters away, clearly distinguishable but without any sign of
hostility. They were apparently a mother bear playing with her two
cubs.
</P>
<P>
Xia Limin, who responsible for the safety of the team, raised
his gun immediately. If they had came any nearer, he says, he
would have fired, but as it turned out, he was very happy that the
ordeal ended peacefully. "It's their home, not ours," he says
</P>
<P>
The scientists have encountered these Arctic denizens several
times and they always cause some anxiety for expedition members.
The Polar bear is one of the largest land mammals, and it can run
faster than a man, but they can only be shot if they get within
100 meters and are about to attack.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian President Differs on Army Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo has expressed slightly different views Sunday with his
defense minister on proposed army cuts, reported the Vanguard, a
major Nigerian newspaper Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the National Television Authorities, Nigeria's
official television station, the president said it would not be
very correct for somebody to say of the cut that the size of the
military should be reduced to a certain strength.
</P>
<P>
"What we are doing is to redefine the role of the military," he
said.
</P>
<P>
But Gen. Danjuma, the country's defense minister told the
Washington Times journalists in Lagos last week that the planned
reduction in the size of the military was necessitated by the
economic crunch facing the country.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to reduce the military to a total strength of 50,000:
Army 30, 000; Air Force 10,000 and Navy 10,000. Right now we are
80,000. The decision is economic," he said, adding that "Nigeria
could not afford too large an army," said the minister last week.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo also said in the television interview that " there are
old people in the military. Some have spent 35 years or more in
the military and those who decide to leave on voluntary grounds
will also be considered."
</P>
<P>
The proposed cuts in the military has generated quite a lot of
 controversy in the country. Some senators at the weekend accused
the gesture of endangering the country's role as a regional
power.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Form Presidential Conscience Commission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Monday that he expects to complete in two weeks the
composition of the newly-created Presidential Clemency Conscience
Review Commission.
</P>
<P>
The president said he wants the commission, which he approved
to help him exercise his constitutional power of clemency, to have
balanced representation from all concerned sectors.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that he is eyeing Carina Agarao, director of
the Crusade Against Violence as a member.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Estrada approved the suggestion of creating the
commission, a brain child of his spiritual adviser Mike Velarde,
who is a leader of the Catholic charismatic group El Shaddai.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview, Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said
Estrada is waiting for recommendations regarding the membership of
the committee.
</P>
<P>
Also, Zamora reiterated that the conscience commission's powers
would be merely recommendatory and advisory, particularly to guide
the president "on whether to use his power of reprieve or power to
parole."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zamora said it is up to the Congress to decide on
the calls from some sectors to abolish the death penalty, saying
that the capital punishment has been brought back through
legislation.
</P>
<P>
"That is a debate that will be determined by Congress and, of
course, by the people who send congressmen and senators to the
legislature," he said.

<HEADLINE> Israel Denies Crisis in Talks with Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy Monday denied crisis occurred in the ongoing
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, saying attempt by the
Palestinians to enlist U.S. pressure on Israel would fail, Israel
Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
"There's no crisis. There is apparently a sort of tactics,"
he told the radio, referring to a trip by top Palestinian
officials to the U.S. Monday.aeb
Erekat flied to Washington to brief U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright on the latest development on the tak's hard-line predecessor
Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel has to
hand over 13 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians in
three stages over a period of 12 months. Netanyahu froze the
agreement after carrying out its first stage.
</P>
<P>
Oustemaining two stages of the Wye agreement, but he has
proposed some changes to the timeline.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have reluctantly accepted his proposal to
restart the timetable of Wye in September and to carry out
the second troop withdrawal in October.
</P>
<P>
But they have rejected Barak's suggestion that the final stage
of redeployment be postponed until early 2000, when the
final-status talks dealing with thorny issues like Jerusalem and
settlements are supposed to have been well under way.
</P>
<P>
After meeting Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Arafat said
Sunday that the Palestinians were insisting the implementation of
the Wye agreement be completed by November 30.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Palestinian prisoners, the local daily Haaretz
said Monday that the two sides have reached agreement on the
timeline, under which the first batch of prisoners will be
released on September 1 and the second on October 8. But dispute
remains over the number and terms of the prisoners to be released.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians demand that Israel release another 650 Palestinian
political prisoners, those jailed for anti-Israel activities. They
accused Netanyahu of including 150 common criminals in the first
group of 250 prisoners released last year while the verbal
agreement between the two sides stipulated the Wye accord
did not specify what kind of prisoners should be released and it
would continue to include common criminals in the remaining 500
prisoners to be released.
</P>
<P>
Arafat called on Washington Sunday to intervene to narrow the
garicating a crisis atmosphere
in a bid to enlist U.S. pressure to force Israel make additional
concessions.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Free Palestinian Prisoners in two Stages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb
Erekat said Monday that Israel has agreed to release Palestinian
prisoners in two stages, the first batch in early September and
the second on October 8.
</P>
<P>
However, the two sides failed to reach agreement on the number
of prisoners to be released in each phase.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, Erekat said the two sides agreed to set up a
joint committee to follow up all issues related to detainees in
Israeli jails and to suggest further releases.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side is demanding that Israel set free 650
Palestinian prisoners, whereas, the Israeli side insists that the
number to be released will not exceed 250.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, differences are still there, particularly on the
timetable of Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank, he said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are working out a "memorandum on the timetable
for implementing the Wye River accord," said the Palestinian
official.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli side is demanding a duration of eight months for its
troops withdrawal and this is unacceptable to the Palestinian
side, he said.
</P>
<P>
Erekat asserted that the Israeli side had no reasonable
justification to postpone withdrawal from Palestinian territories,
adding that all attempts to merge the transition with final status
talks are doomed to fail.
</P>
<P>
He refuted Israeli news reports that unofficial talks were
under way to re-schedule the final status talks, describing them
as unfounded and saying that such matters were never discussed.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators are due to resume their talks Monday, which will
take up such issues as redeployment, release of the greatest
number possible of Palestinian detainees in the two
instalments.
</P>
<P>
Also to be discussed are matters related to a "safe passage"
between the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Gaza port, Palestinian
rights as specified in the Hebron Accord signed in 1997, and the
cessation of settlement activities.

<P>
Jiang said all members of the Communist Party of China and
people from various ethnic groups should keep in mind that the
implementation of the strategy of rejuvenating the nation through
the promotion of science and technology and technological
innovation are of great importance for the prosperity and
invigoration of the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
He said that the escalation of the global market competition
also requires innovation-backed improvement of products and
efficiency, in a bid to strengthen the ability to resist various
kinds of risks.
</P>
<P>
The president called for early building up of the national
innovation system and fostering a great number of high-quality
personnel capable of introducing innovation.
</P>
<P>
Other Chinese leaders including Li Peng, Zhu Rongji, Li Ruihuan,
Hu Jintao, Wei Jianxing and Li Lanqing attended today's opening
ceremony of the conference.
</P>

launch large operations.
</P>
<P>
He said that during the 1950s and 1960s China experienced a
lack of necessary materials and suffered from a sluggish economy.
</P>
<P>
However, by taking full advantage of the socialist system,
Chinese scientists overcame the difficulties caused by economic
blockade imposed by the imperialist powers and successfully
exploded the country's first atomic bomb and first hydrogen bomb
and launched it first satellite.
</P>
<P>
Jiang added, "Under the new conditions realized during the
process of building a socialist market economy,we should take
advantage of the socialist system politically and focus on
scientific research fields that may push ahead economic and social
development, help maintain social stability, improve productive
forces and comprehensive national power."
</P>
<P>
The president stressed the importance of innovation in key high-
tech fields and speeding up the development of high-tech ventures,
especially ventures involving new industries.
</P>
<P>
He said China should combine the superiority of the socialist
system with the market economy and realize a rational combination
of funds, personnel, technology and management.

<HEADLINE> Renovated UNITA Satisfied with SADC Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Luanda, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Commission of Renovation (CR) of
the National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA)
expressed its satisfaction with decisions made by the Summit of
the Southern African Development Community (SADC) held last week,
local press reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
SADC decision of excluding Jonas Savimbi, head of the
rebellious UNITA, from all efforts for peace in Angola is a "great
victory" for the Angolan government, said Jorge Valentim,
secretary of International Relations of the commission.
</P>
<P>
"We are satisfied with the first results," commented Valentim
upon the decision made by SADC on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
These decisions will make Savimbi, who has begun begging for
logistic and other support, some of them "psychological", feel
more lonely, said Valentim.
</P>
<P>
At the 19th Summit of SADC, Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos
Santos reiterated that there were "nothing to negotiate" with
Savimbi. According to Valentim, the government obtained moral,
political, diplomatic and humanitarian support from other 13
member countries of SADC, which announced Savimbi "not qualified
as an interlocutor".
</P>
<P>
SADC will be completely and profoundly engaged itself in the
conquest of peace in Angola, said the high-ranking official of the
Commission of Renovation, which was founded in September in 1998,
sacking its president Savimbi and insisting on peace negotiation.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Has Potential for Mushroom Cultivation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has a potential
for mushroom cultivation although internal demand for the fungus
is low at present, according to a report by the Tanzania
Commission for Science and Technology (COSTECH).
</P>
<P>
Over 30 edible mushroom species have been identified in
Tanzania and many tribes include them in their diet, the
commission said in its 1999 report on Cultivation of edible
mushrooms on agro-waste.
</P>
<P>
Mushrooms growing in the east African country is seasonal,
being confined only to the rainy season, The Guardian Monday
quoted the report as saying.
</P>
<P>
The report reveals that mushroom cultivation in Africa is still
in its infancy because of insufficient knowledge on the science of
the technology.
</P>
<P>
The demand for fresh mushroom, however, is likely to increase
with the expansion of the tourism industry and the construction of
more hotels, it says, adding that therefore there is need to
cultivate it to make it available throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
Mushroom cultivation can be done in Tanzania on a small scale
as well as at an industrial level like it is done in Europe, North
America, China and Japan, the report says.
</P>
<P>
Africa produces much agro-waste that is potential for mushroom
 cultivation. The report mentions some of the waste as
agro-industry plant residues such as maize cobs, coffee pulp,
sisal pulp, rice husks and crop residues namely cereal straws and
banana leaves.

<HEADLINE> Shortage to Abundance: China's Market in 50 Years (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Editor's note: This year is the
50th anniversary of the People's Republic of China and, over the
past 50 years, China's achievements have attracted worldwide
attention, with comprehensive national strength increasing and
earth-shaking changes taking place in all sectors.
</P>
<P>
The Xinhua News Agency will release about 20 reports on these
developments and provide the latest information on the nation's
economy. The first of the series was released on August 17. This
is the fourth:
</P>
<P>
Over the last 50 years, China has shaken off the scant
commodities supply which has long plagued it and a buyer's market
is now taking shape.
</P>
<P>
All Chinese above 35 years old can clearly remember the days
when they bought things with government coupons. Li Xihua, deputy
director of the Commerce Research Center under the State
Administration of Internal Trade, recalled that under the shortage
economy, almost everything, even items as large as steel, cement
or as small as matches, was under government ration. The
government also set prices for all goods, he said.
</P>
<P>
"In those days, the monthly expenditure for most Chinese
families was less than a hundred yuan (about 12 U.S. dollars)," he
said. Li's three member family once lived on his salary of 56 yuan
(some 7 dollars) a month.
</P>
<P>
The latest figures from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS)
show that the income of urban and rural residents has surged by
several times from two decades ago, with their purchasing power
significantly increased.
</P>
<P>
Major reforms in the agricultural and industrial sectors have
also provided solid foundations for the booming market and the
variety of commodities has increased from several hundred to more
than 100,000 at the present time.
</P>
<P>
According to Li, the Chinese government now only regulates
prices of less than 5 percent of commodities, and nearly 100
percent of commodities on the market are in sufficient or even
over-supply.

<TEXT>
<P>
Diversified ownership has been another big market change over
the past half century, according to Guo Shouzhong, a market
analyst.
</P>
<P>
Figures show that in 1978, 98 percent of the country's retail
sales was from public-owned and collective-owned enterprises. But
now, nearly 80 percent of the total retail sales are from non-
state-owned businesses.
</P>
<P>
Over the 50 years, retail sales in urban China have surged by
140 times while that in rural China increased by 81 times.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investors have also wanted to share a slice of the
huge pie. Recently, China introduced the Regulations on Overseas
Investment in Commercial Business for Trial Implementation, a step
to further open up the commercial sector to overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
"This is the key to China's diversification of commercial
businesses' ownership," Guo commented.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that the number of retail sales outlets in
China will hit 20 million by the end of this year, with over 58
million people working in the sector.
</P>
<P>
Chen Fengrong, a citizen in Tianjin in north China, said, "
During the early years of new China, many department stores with
hundred-years history had been replaced by state-owned stores. But
now, we see chain stores, supermarkets, franchised stores
increasing day by day."
</P>
<P>
As China further steps up the opening-up and people's living
standards reach a new level, Chinese consumers will demand better
quality of life, according to Guo Shouzhong.
</P>
<P>
"This urges domestic enterprises to improve product quality and
come up with diverse goods to cater the tastes of different
consumer groups," he added.
</P>
<P>
"China's market potential was huge beyond estimation," Guo said.
"As many overseas investors have said: China is a huge market left
untapped on earth."

<HEADLINE> Sensex Gains in Bombay Stock Exchange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The sensitive index rose 83.97
points Monday on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) in the wake of
hectic buying support from operators as well as fresh purchases
from Foreign Institutional Investors.
</P>
<P>
The fresh upsurge was due to sustained boost in South-East
Asian stock markets. The Nikkei Stock Average had climbed by
277.67 points in the morning session on the back of strong yen
against the U.S. dollar that fell to a seven-month low, after the
average closed up by 218.37 points on last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The BSE-30 share sensitive index opened with a wide gap at
4713.34 from last Friday's close of 4645.81 and later moved in a
range of 4766.79 and 4713.34 before closing at 4729.78, netting a
sharp rise of 83.97 points.
</P>
<P>
The BSE-100 index also went up by 47.17 points to 2137.03 from
previous close of 2089.86.
</P>
<P>
The BSE-200 index and the Dollex were quoted remarkably up at
492.28 and 188.33 compared with last weekend close of 480.90 and
183.85 respectively.
</P>
<P>
The BSE-500 index shot up by 36.84 points to 1460.13 from last
Friday's close of 1423.29.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Targets Bombed Again by U.S.-British </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 23 (Xinhua) -- A number of Iraqi civilians
were killed on Monday in U.S. and British warplanes' attacks on
civilian targets in northern Iraq, said a source in the Iraqi
Ministry of Information and Culture.
</P>
<P>
The source told reporters on condition of anonymity that
U.S. and British warplanes bombed some civilian facilities in the
northern no-fly zone on Monday morning, killing a number of
civilians and injuring some others.
</P>
<P>
The source did not give the exact figure of casualties. The
Iraqi military spokesman who usually announces incidents of this
kind has not made any comment.
</P>
<P>
The latest U.S.-British bombardment of Iraqi targets came five
days after the Pentagon announcement that the U.S.-British air
raids against Iraqi targets in the no-fly zones will be suspended
if Iraqi air defenses stop targetting allied warplanes.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Iraqi Ministry of Information and Culture
said on Sunday that Iraq totally rejects the no-fly zones and
would go on firing at the enemy planes violating its airspace.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon made the announcement of conditional suspension
of air strikes against Iraqi targets after U.S. and British
warplanes bombed some residential areas and targets outside of
the no-fly zones last week and killed 20 Iraqi civilians and
injured 10 others.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones were imposed on Iraq by the U.S.-led western
allies following the 1991 Gulf War with the claimed aim of
protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the
south against attacks by Iraqi government troops.
</P>
<P>
Since last December's U.S.-British airstrikes against Iraqi
targets, Iraq began to fire at U.S. and British warplanes
patrolling the no-fly zones.
</P>
<P>
And U.S. and British warplanes have been targetting ever since
Iraqi civilian and military targets in the no-fly zones, causing
severe civilian casualties and property damage.

<HEADLINE> Britain's Cancer Victims Call For Better Job Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of cancer sufferers in
Britain are to be given protection against unfair dismissal amid
growing concern that employers are using a "loophole" to sack them
before they become sufficiently ill to be protected by law.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph newspaper reported on Monday that Britain
is reviewing a new disability protection act which could give
cancer sufferers better job protection.
</P>
<P>
Proposed amendments to the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA)
would prevent employers from sacking cancer patients when they
first learn about the illness and before they become ill enough to
be protected by the law.
</P>
<P>
So a woman newly diagnosed with breast cancer would have
increased protection against an employer trying to get rid of her
because of her illness and the treatment it will entail.
</P>
<P>
"She would be able to look to the DDA for protection from
discrimination if her employer chose to dismiss her as soon as he
learned of her diagnosis," a government spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The DDA offers protection for people who are already suffering
disabilities from the disease but not for people newly diagnosed.
Under the proposed changes, cancer sufferers who are sacked would
be able to take their case to a tribunal.
</P>
<P>
Unlike cases heard under normal tribunals there are no time
restraints or damage award limits in cases heard under the DDA.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 26,000 people in Britain are diagnosed with cancer
each year.

<HEADLINE> China Looking into Major Cases of Local Protectionism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese courts will soon begin a
thorough investigation of major cases of local protectionism to
try to overcome long-standing problems with a lack of enforcing
rulings, according to Li Guoguang, vice-president of the Supreme
People's Court.
</P>
<P>
Li said here today that, from 1995 to 1998, higher provincial,
regional and municipal people's courts encountered 3,473 serious
cases of refusing to enforce court rulings and 2,378 court
policemen were wounded and four killed while trying to deal with
these problems.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June 1999, more than 850,000 court rulings had
yet to be carried, which involved unpaid debts and fines exceeding
259 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
There are many difficulties plaguing Chinese courts, Li said
and cited a lack of legal awareness by the general public and
problems with many state-owned enterprise debts, as examples.
</P>
<P>
But the main law enforcement problem is in local and
departmental protectionism, by which the payment of a debt by an
enterprise to one area or department means a loss of revenue for
or infringement on the interests of another area or department. So
some authorities are not interest in whether court rulings are
carried out successfully.
</P>
<P>
To deal with this problem, the Supreme People's Court has told
local courts to review local regulations that affect law
enforcement to declare them null and void if they conflict with
the law. Local courts also need to get the support of Party
committees, legislators, and governments to deal with law breakers
and to bring them to justice if a crime is committed.
</P>
<P>
Among the many ways of dealing with the problem, courts are
being encouraged to make full use of any means of compulsion
allowed by the law and to seek assistance from the media to
improve this aspect of society.

<HEADLINE> British Home Secretary Pledges to Turn Asylum System Around </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Home Secretary Jack
Straw Monday rejected charges that the immigration system has
broken down under the pressure of record applications from people
seeking asylum in the country.
</P>
<P>
"The system is not being overwhelmed but the numbers are high,"
he told BBC radio.
</P>
<P>
Straw's remarks followed warnings from the Immigration Service
Union that the system cannot cope, and attacks from the
Conservatives over what they say is Labor's "complacency."
</P>
<P>
He said Britain was 11th out of 15 European Union countries in
terms of asylum seekers as a proportion of population.
</P>
<P>
The immigration service union on Monday said its members could
not cope with an influx of asylum seekers, not least from war-torn
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Tensions have flared most obviously in the Channel port of
Dover. Eleven people were injured in clashes last week, where 800
asylum seekers are living among the town's 41,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
Straw said he went to Dover three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
"It's not out of control but there is no question that the
staff are under very severe pressure and so is the citizenry," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Straw added that the government had responded by putting 120
million pounds (194 million U.S. dollars) into turning the system
around over the next three years and recruiting an extra 600 staff.
</P>
<P>
But his opposition Conservative counterpart, Ann Widdecombe, on
Monday accused Straw of "phenomenal complacency" by waiting for
his controversial asylum and immigration bill to pass through
parliament next April.
</P>
<P>
Rejecting charges of complacency, Straw said Widdecombe had
been part of an administration that had "degraded" the immigration
service by reducing staff numbers.
</P>
<P>
Straw retorted that he had spent two years clearing up the "
shambles" left by the previous Conservative government.
</P>
<P>
"He cannot blame us for the increase in applications under his
policy," Widdecombe fired back.
</P>
<P>
The Labor government is pushing its asylum bill through
parliament and has already rowed back on key details in the face
of a threatened revolt from backbench MPs.
</P>
<P>
Ministers say the bill will overhaul a cumbersome system and
allow faster processing of asylum claims. The current system
takes months, sometimes years, to decide if a claimant has a
legitimate claim for asylum or is an economic migrant.
</P>
<P>
But the government backed down on a key section which said that
asylum seekers would be denied all state benefits and must survive
on food and clothing vouchers plus one pound a day for adults and
50 pence for children.
</P>
<P>
Straw warned it would take time to improve the system, saying
the improvement would not be seen overnight.

BEIJING, August 23 (Xinhua)-- Proposals have been tabled for
legislation to protect the legal rights and interest of overseas
Chinese ventures, according to the Overseas Chinese Affairs
Committee, a subcommittee of the National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
The motion was presented here today at the tenth plenary
meeting of the committee which says it hopes to wind up
preliminary discussions as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
"The law will have a positive impact on attracting investments
from overseas Chinese and the development of overseas Chinese
ventures in China," the committee said, adding that the drafting
of the law has been listed as one of the current session's most
important tasks.
</P>
<P>
Committee members have investigated the investment situations
of overseas Chinese ventures in some ten cities and provinces
including Shanghai in a bid to assess the investment environments
and obstacles facing these ventures.
</P>
<P>
A proposal to revise the Law on the Protection of the Rights and
Interests of Returned Overseas Chinese and the Family Members of
Overseas Chinese, which was put into effect nine years ago, was
also discussed at today's meeting.
</P>
<P>
The committee plans to draw up the official revised draft after
wide consultation before submitting it to the NPC Standing
Committee.

<P>
NEW DELHI, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The Reserve Bank of India
(RBI) Monday decided to take measures to reduce possible temporary
demand-supply gaps emerging in the foreign exchange (forex)
markets due to uncertainty or speculation in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
The RBI said that arrangements have been made to meet fully or
partially forex requirements for import of crude oil by the Indian
Oil Corporation, and government debt service payments directly as
necessary and in case of temporary demand-supply gap.
</P>
<P>
It indicated that arrangements have also been made to intervene
directly or sell dollars through the State Bank of India in order
to augment supply.
</P>
<P>
All transactions undertaken by the central bank would be at the
market rate, it added.
</P>
<P>
It also noted that the country's forex reserves are comfortable
and more than adequate to meet any genuine requirements of forex.
</P>
<P>
The total forex reserves stood at 33.2 billion U.S. dollars as
of August 21, 1999, 6.6 billion dollars higher than the same
period last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Unemployment in Latin America and
the Caribbean, which is rising fast, is expected to affect as many
as 9.5 percent of the region's regular workforce this year.
</P>
<P>
The International Labor Organization (ILO) in a news release
issued here Monday said that the figure surpassed the peak jobless
rates in the region in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Despite decade-long reforms, the ILO report said, the economic
growth and price stability in the region have not produced a
significant improvement of the employment situation.
</P>
<P>
"The outlook for 1999 is not encouraging," said the report,
forecasting a 0.4 percent drop in the growth rate in the region
this year. "The less dynamic world economy will thwart growth in
the region even further."
</P>
<P>
The report, entitled Decent Work and Protection for All:
Priority of the Americas, was prepared for the 14th Regional

<HEADLINE> HK Consumer Price Decreases 5.2 Percent in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Consumer prices of Hong Kong
registered a year-on-year decrease of 5.5 percent in July 1999,
larger than the 4.1 percent decline in June.
</P>
<P>
The Census and Statistics Department released Monday the
Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures for July 1999.
</P>
<P>
Analyzed by component, clothing and footwear, which dropped 24.
1 percent in the Composite CPI, registered the largest year-on-
year rate of decrease in July 1999.
</P>
<P>
Following the clothing and footwear were housing, durable goods
and food, which report decline of 8.4 percent, 7.4 percent and 4.7
percent in the Composite CPI.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, small year-on-year rates of increase were
recorded for alcoholic drinks and tobacco, up 0.9 percent in the
Composite CPI, and transport, up 0.2 percent in the Composite CPI.
</P>
<P>
A government secretariat spokesman noted that the larger
decrease in consumer prices was not associated with any weakening
in consumer demand, as the performance of retail sales had in fact
improved visibly in the more recent months.
</P>
<P>
For the month of July it was attributable mostly to the relief
measure of the government, specifically the one-off reduction of
50 percent in the rates payable for the third quarter of this year,
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman commented that moderation in consumer prices
generally helped contain the cost of living and raise the real
purchasing power of consumers.
</P>
<P>
Taking the first seven months of 1999 together, the Composite
CPI declined by 3.3 percent as compared to the same period in 1998.

<HEADLINE> China's Policy Towards Minority Groups A Success (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Since its founding 50 years ago
the People's Republic of China has successfully forged a well-
balanced relationship among all its nationalities featuring
equality, unity and mutual assistance.
</P>
<P>
The long-term harmony and shared development of all
nationalities in China has become a model for handling relations
and problems among different minority groups throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
As President Jiang Zemin has said China has practiced the best
possible policy towards minority groups, which has proved to be
very successful.
</P>
<P>
On May 1, 1947, China set up its first autonomous region for
minority groups in Inner Mongolia under the leadership of the
Chinese Communist Party, inaugurating the great practice of
regional autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Today, 44 minority groups in China are practicing regional
autonomy in five autonomous regions, 30 autonomous prefectures and
120 autonomous counties.
</P>
<P>
China has also drafted a series of legal regulations concerning
regional autonomy for all minority groups, which have all been
protected by the Constitution and the Law on Regional Autonomy for
China's Ethnic Minorities since new China came into being in 1949.
</P>
<P>
As regards equality, unity and shared prosperity among all
nationalities, China's minority groups have gained unprecedented
rights and become the country's masters, instead of being
oppressed and discriminated against.

<HEADLINE> Kenyans Free to Report Tribal Identity in Census </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Kenyans are free to decide
whether to tell enumerators their tribal backgrounds, John Kekove,
project manager of the upcoming national census, has said.
</P>
<P>
The East African Standard daily Monday quoted Kekove as saying
that such information would be useful and be appreciated if
residents are willing to report.
</P>
<P>
Kenya is one of a few African countries where ethnic harmony
and national unity are emphasized and peace has prevailed since
independence.
</P>
<P>
The 1999 census from August 24 through 31 is the first of its
kind over the past 10 years. According to the 1989 census, Kenya
had a total population of 21 million.
</P>
<P>
Kekove said that most people will be counted on the nights of
August 24 and 25, adding that it was not realistic to expect the
census to be completed in one night.
</P>
<P>
Those who are not counted during the period have a
responsibility to report to the local provincial administration,
Kenove added.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Import Maize to Ease Famine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Agriculture Minister
Musalia Mudavadi has said the private sector in the country will
import two million bags of maize (90-kg bag) in the July to
November season.
</P>
<P>
During a fund-raising held Sunday at Kitale town out of the
capital Nairobi, the minister said the importation had been
brought about due to army worms which invaded maize farms and
destroyed the crop at an early stage.
</P>
<P>
The government-owned Kenya Times Monday quoted the minister as
saying those allowed to import the maize would have to pay tax in
order to avoid indiscriminate importation.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest projections by the Ministry of
Agriculture, Kenya will harvest only 1.7 million tons of maize
after this year's long season (March to June), representing a 25
percent drop in maize production this year compared to the 1998
figure.
</P>
<P>
In reacting to questions about the criteria the government was
using to import maize while local farmers were preparing to
harvest and sell, the minister said the country's National
Cereals and Produce Board has reserved money to purchase maize
from local farmers.
</P>
<P>
At the end of July, the Kenyan government lowered the duty
levied on imported maize from 32.5 percent to 25 percent to
encourage grain traders for importing the cereal from outside in
a bid to make up the shortfall of crop production caused by the
drought and crop pests.

<P>
Editor's note: This year is the 50th anniversary of the
founding of the People's Republic of China (PRC). Xinhua News
Agency is releasing a series of stories about 50 Chinese men and
women, young and old, to present a picture of the changes that
have taken place in China over the past half century. These people
will describe their own experiences and how they fit into the
changes in the motherland. This is the second article in the
series.
</P>
<P>
URUMQI, August 23 (Xinhua) -- For centenarian Yumale, Mao
Zedong is still a momentous name, and like many other Chinese
people, he describes the memory of "Chairman Mao" as one on which
the sun never sets.
</P>
<P>
"Thanks to Mao, who helped found the People's Republic of China,
tens of millions of people were able to have enough grain, meat,
clothing and many other hard-earned items," explained the farmer,
who lives in the township of Pakhatakary of Shufu County in
southern Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Yumale still lives in the reflection of Mao and is proud of a
portrait of the late chairman hanging high on a wall in his house.
Whenever Mao is mentioned the old man bubbles over with excitement.
</P>
<P>
"It is Chairman Mao who gave me ploughland nearly 50 years ago,
" this ordinary farmer of the Uygur ethnic minority said, a mere
month ahead of the 50th birthday of the People's Republic.
</P>
<P>
Before liberation, Yumale had no land whatsoever, the most
valuable of possessions for a Chinese peasant, and had to support
a big family by working a landlord's land. The vicious landlord
took most of the grain yield from the family and they usually
suffered from hunger.
</P>
<P>
In 1953, Mao sent officials to the countryside to confiscate
the landlords' land and properties and give the farmers what they
had longed for.
</P>
<P>
"This was why I and several other farmers decided to write a
letter of thanks to Mao after we were granted one hectare of land
each," he recalled.

<HEADLINE> Opening Up Rejuvenates China (4) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the past 20 years millions of overseas tourists have come to
visit China, and at the same time Chinese have gone abroad to work,
study and travel. In their quests to sell more goods, an
increasing number of Chinese firms are beginning to invest
overseas.
</P>
<P>
Continuity of the open policy is the key to China's success.
Facing intensified competition for international capital, the
Chinese Government is formulating a range of preferential policies
to attract more overseas funds. Governments at all levels are
required to provide good, standard and convenient services for
greater work efficiency, and improve procedural openness and
policy transparency.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said when conditions are ready, foreign-funded
enterprises will be treated exactly the same as domestic firms.
</P>
<P>
A fairer, freer and more open market is emerging in China. The
country is committed to taking part in the process of free capital
flow as prescribed by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
Organization and reducing its average tariff rates for industrial
products to 10 percent by 2005; and it has always held a positive
view about joining the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
By continuing to vigorously push ahead its opening policy,
China is set to play an increasingly important role in the
international business community and emerge as a world economic
power.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Ends Weaker Ahead of US Rate Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar meandered
through Monday's trading session to finish a touch weaker ahead of
a key meeting to consider U.S. monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
Deutsche Bank currency strategist Tim Moloney said the local
currency had done little Monday and would remain subdued until at
least mid-week.
</P>
<P>
The local unit finished the day at 63.71 U.S. cents from 63.85
at Friday's close, spending the session between 63.67 and 63.98.
</P>
<P>
In the money market, the 90-day bank bill rate was at 4.95
percent from 4.94 percent and the 180-day bill was 5.12 percent
from 5.14.
</P>
<P>
Also at the local close, the Australian dollar was buying
0.5982 euro from 0.5992 at Friday's close and 70.57 Japanese yen
from 71.32.

<P>
He did not expect that Mao would himself reply but that
actually happened. In the letter, the busy but considerate leader
encouraged Yumale and his fellow villagers to work hard to raise
the grain output and gradually improve agriculture.
</P>
<P>
"I hope you will be more united under the catchwords of
patriotism and high yields," Mao wrote.
</P>
<P>
"Life has become better since then," Yumale said, adding that
now everyday his 90-year-old wife is able to buy mutton and
vegetable which were extravagant things half a century ago.
</P>
<P>
Mao died in 1976, passing on his legacy to Deng Xiaoping, who
then introduced the dynamic reform and opening up policy.
</P>
<P>
But for the whole nation, Mao's influence can never be just a
distant memory. Like Yumale, many people have great respect for
him as a leader as well as great regret for his errors, which
caused chaos in his later years. To most Chinese, Mao was a man
who had changed the lives of almost three generations of his
countrymen, as well as the history of China and the world.
</P>
<P>
However, Yumale said that after Mao passed away life did not
stop progressing. Nowadays in his village almost every household
has bought TV sets, refrigerators and tractors and they all live
in well-constructed brick-houses. His village has also become a
famous mutton and vegetable production and processing base in
Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
"So one day some fellows in my village came up with an idea to
write a letter to our current leader Jiang Zemin as life is
becoming even better," he said.
</P>
<P>
Soon Jiang wrote back. Jiang said he was happy that the
villagers are living such a comfortable life and hoped that all
ethnic peoples would get along with each other in a more
harmonious way. He also stressed that the economy should be
developed faster to ensure a well-to-do life for all the people.
</P>
<P>
"It is wonderful that these two great leaders have written
letters to such small potatoes like us. Now, my last remaining
dream is to travel to our capital, where Mao declared the founding
of New China 50 years ago and his mausoleum is now situated,"
Yumale concluded.

<P>
BEIJING, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Overseas delegates to the 22nd

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Records Trade Surplus With U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 23 (Xinhua) -- South Africa recorded a
77.8-million- dollar trade surplus with the United States in June,
the sixth month in a row that the former's exports to the latter
have outstripped imports, Business Day newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
For the first half of this year, South Africa's surplus was 332
million dollars, including U.S. "domestic exports" -- goods made
or finished in the U.S. and then shipped to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The string of monthly South African surpluses is unprecedented,
which would have extended back to last November but for the
376-million-dollar purchase of three aircraft by South African
Airways late last year, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials see low South African growth and the weakness of
the rand as the chief factors. However, concerns persist that U.S.
suppliers may be losing out to European and other competitors and
that this could be exacerbated by the European Union-South African
free trade agreement, which is expected to be implemented next
year.
</P>
<P>
The South African surplus, though good news for the balance of
payments, did not imply a boom in exports to the U.S., the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
South African exports were down three percent in the first six
months.
</P>
<P>
U.S. imports of South African iron and steel were down 19.3
percent to 192 million dollars and imports of South African
platinum group metals, unusually high last year, were off 7.4
percent in the first half of the year from 525 million dollars to
486 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
South African fruit seems to be finding space in U.S.
supermarkets, with overall exports to the U.S. reaching 31.7
million dollars, according to the paper.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 23 (Xinhua) -- China's top 10 container ports
had accumulatively handled 7.58 million TEUs by the end of July,
1999, up 38 percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
 According to the Ministry of Communications, this represents
a significant and swift growth over the past two years and the
sector looks like maintaining the momentum.
</P>
<P>
 The leading port of Shanghai saw its handling capacity hit
370,000 TEUs in July, an average of 12,000 TEUs daily.
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the port of Shenzhen, second in the league table,
kept a growth rate of over 60 percent last month.
</P>
<P>
 Qingdao port in east China's Shandong province, which ranks
third in the country, also saw an annual increase of 24.2 percent
and looks like speeding up that growth.
</P>
<P>
 The other seven ports showing significant progress are
Tianjin, Guangzhou, Xiamen, Dalian, Ningbo, Zhongshan and Fuzhou.
</P>
<P>
 Despite the flooding on the Yangtze River in July, the
throughput of China's container ports will grow further, thanks to
the country's effective measures for stimulating domestic demand,
activating state-owned enterprises, adding investment to
infrastructure construction and expanding export, shipping
analysts believe.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines has identified
prerequisites for the establishment of a special economic zone on
information technology (IT), Philippine News Agency reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The PNA quoted sources from the National Information Technology
Council as saying that such a move, which is aimed at boosting the
growth of the nation's IT industry, is necessary before an IT zone
is set up.
</P>
<P>
Reliable and good quality electric power should be available at
all times while reliable telecommunications system and the need to
be "wired" with the use of fiber optic are also vital, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The IT zone would be the primary economic zone that will
attract foreign and local entrepreneurs to invest in this
industry.
</P>
<P>
The zone should be designed based on a "campus-like" layout
that would include services and accommodations for young families.
</P>
<P>
Also, the zone should be ideally located near a university that
could supply the potential manpower.
</P>
<P>
Among the activities that will be supported by the IT zone are
software and constant development for business, education,
electronic commerce and entertainment, the reported concluded.

<HEADLINE> HK Tourism Commissioner Optimistic About Future Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Mike Rowse, commissioner for
tourism of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR),
said here Monday that tourism still has a bright future in Hong
Kong despite the current economic situation.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 5th Asia Pacific Tourism Association Conference,
he said Hong Kong is a leading tourist destination in Asia and
tourism is a leading industry in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He said, "The World Tourism Organization has forecast that
China will be the leading tourist destination, and the HKSAR will
rank in the top 10 destinations by year 2020."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he noted, Hong Kong must prepare for this future and
not lose sight of the need to train and ensure it have sufficient
manpower to meet market demand.
</P>
<P>
"Geographically, Hong Kong is ideally located and we must use
this to our advantage. Furthermore, Hong Kong's transport
infrastructure is efficient and world class," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the SAR government and the tourism industry have used
this economic downturn to take stock of our tourism product and
explore opportunities to bring in or develop new attractions and
products such as international events, cultural heritage, and an
international performing arts center.
</P>
<P>
"More recently, we have been involved in negotiations with the
Disney Corporation to establish an international standard theme
park at Penny's Bay on Lantau Island," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tourist arrivals in Hong Kong for the first half of 1999 showed
a sign of recovery with an 8 percent increase over the same period
of 1998. But the earnings are still flat.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Politicians Urged to Refrain From Using Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Defense Minister Gen.
Wiranto Monday urged politicians to refrain from using terrorism,
pressure and other forcible actions to impose their will on
others.
</P>
<P>
"Terrorism is not acceptable in achieving political
objectives," said Wiranto, who is also Armed Forces Chief.
</P>
<P>
He said parties in power will not be recognized as legitimate
by the people, particularly the military, if they used terrorism
and assault in gaining that power.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the terrorizing of election winner Indonesian
Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) leaders Kwik Kian Gie and
Dimyati Hartono, Wiranto said: "We will not tolerate such
actions."
</P>
<P>
"A threat against Kwik Kian Gie is a threat against the PDI-P
because Kwik is one of the party's leaders and his revelations
(relating to the Bank Bali scandal) were made on behalf of the
PDI-P," PDI-P leader Haryanto Taslam was quoted by The Indonesian
Observer Monday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the threat was made by former student activist
Hariman Siregar.
</P>
<P>
Hariman asked Panda Nababan from Forum Keadilan magazine last
Thursday to tell Kwik Kian Gie he would "shoot" the PDI-P leader
over his accusation that one of the 16 people allegedly involved
in the scandal was a brother of the incumbent president.
</P>
<P>
"Although I didn't directly receive the threat, from what I
hear, when giving the threat, he (Hariman) took out a handgun and
put it in on the table in front of the 'messenger'," Kwik Kian Gie
said.
</P>
<P>
Kwik Kian Gie last week told a press conference the PDI-P has
collected hard evidence showing the direct involvement of 16
people in the Bank Bali scam.
</P>
<P>
The Bank Bali saga began when a top official of the ruling
Golkar Party colluded with high ranking officials to help Bank
Bali collect interbank loans totaling 904 billion rupiah (129
million U.S. dollars) from a liquidated bank at a huge fee of 546
billion rupiah (78 million dollars), although under the
recapitalization scheme, the government fully guarantees interbank
borrowings.

<HEADLINE> Opening Up Rejuvenates China (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Chinese Government has recently approved the establishment
of five Sino-foreign joint ventures that engage in foreign trade.
Overseas funds are also welcomed in sectors previously thought
crucial to the national economy and thus tightly controlled, such
as docks, airports and railroads.
</P>
<P>
The country's banking sector has also gradually opened up. By
now overseas financial institutions have set up 191 operational
units in China. With approval from the People's Bank of China, the
country's central bank, 19 overseas-funded banks in Shanghai and
six in Shenzhen have been allowed to conduct banking business in
the Chinese currency, the renminbi.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, by the end of 1998, a total
of 324,000 overseas-funded enterprises had been established in
China, with their pledged investment hitting 573.2 billion U.S.
dollars and an actual input reaching 265.6 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
For the more than 1.2 billion people, benefits of the open
policy come in the form of more and better consumer goods as well
as increased incomes. They have access to goods they never dreamt
of owning in the past, from color TV sets and telephones to air
conditioners and even cars.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps more importantly, the open policy has enhanced the
economic strength of the country. Thanks partly to the presence of
foreign businesses, which have brought with them capital,
technology and management expertise, the Chinese economy has been
able to grow at an annual average rate of more than nine percent
since 1979. By the end of 1998, the country's GDP had registered a
more than six-fold increase over 1978.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices up, Dollar Down in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Share prices continued rising in
Tokyo Monday, boosted by moves to reorganize Japan's banks and
sharp gains in Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange surged 135.44 points, or 0.75
percent, from last Friday's close to end at 18,233.55.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, advanced 19.78 points or 1.32 percent to 1,
518.72, marking the highest close for the year.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section expanded to 965.63 million shares
from 841.99 million shares last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Yasuda Trust and Banking, a subsidiary of Fuji Bank, was the
day's volume leader.
</P>
<P>
Financial issues had the best performance, after Dai-Ichi
Kangyo Bank (DKB), Fuji Bank and the Industrial Bank of Japan (IBJ)
announced last Friday they will establish a joint holding company
in the fall of 2000.
</P>
<P>
The banking industry remained strong throughout the day,
surging 11.57 percent. It was the largest gain of all business
sectors, with the three banks that announced the alliance plan
closing at price stops.
</P>
<P>
Export-oriented technology issues, which had been generally
higher in the morning, however, turned down in the afternoon, hit
by the weak dollar, traders said.
</P>
<P>
Of the issues listed on the First Section, gainers surpassed
losers 699 to 503, with 117 issues remaining unchanged.
</P>
<P>
On the Tokyo Foreign Exchange, the U.S. dollar fell to a seven-
month low as robust performance on the stock market led to demand
for the Japanese currency.
</P>
<P>
The dollar was quoted at 110.73-76 yen at 5 p.m., down from 111.
08-11 yen at 9 a.m. in Tokyo, and from 111.15-25 yen in New York

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading French Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers on Monday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The national secretary of the French Communist Party Robert
Hue has sharply criticized the French Greens for threatening to
withdraw from the leftwing majority over the government's nuclear
policy. Hue said that a departure by the Greens from the
government will not affect the strength of the ruling majority.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The French political parties are resuming their work one
after another after the summer vacation, in a ritual aimed at
absorbing the shock from the European Parliament elections in June,
and in an early preparation for the 2001 municipal elections and
the 2002 legislative and presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
-- While the Turkish authorities said that 12,000 people have
been killed and 32,000 wounded in last week's earthquake, the
teams of international rescuers are abandoning their hope of
finding any more survivors. The mechanical shovels have begun
wiping up the rubbles to avoid an outbreak of epidemics from the
decaying corpses, which are estimated at 35,000.
</P>
<P>
Les Echos:
</P>
<P>
-- The merger of three major Japanese banks (IBJ, Fuji Bank and
DKB) last week, which created the world's largest commercial bank,
has given confidence to the whole banking profession of Japan and
is expected to encourage other mergers in the sector. Masao
Nishimura, the president of the newly merged bank, said that with
1,200 billion euros (1,260 billion U.S. dollars) in terms of
assets, the merger should re-establish the status of Japanese
commercial banks in the world.

<HEADLINE> Relief Efforts Directed at Turkey Quake Survivors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISTANBUL, August 23 (Xinhua) -- With hope for finding more
people alive under the rubble growing slimmer, the Turkish
government is shifting its priority on helping the hundreds of
thousands of survivors who were left homeless by last Tuesday's
catastrophic earthquake.
</P>
<P>
A miracle happened Monday when a small boy was rescued by an
Israeli rescue team after six days trapped under the rubble.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, a couple of survivors had also been rescued in
Golcuk, one of the hardest hit provinces which lies 180
kilometers southeast of Istanbul, and in Adapazari, where the
7.4-degree tremor was located.
</P>
<P>
But experts said these were exceptional cases and some foreign
search and rescue teams have begun pulling out.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government is convinced that it is to the benefit
of the surviving quake victims that the clearance of debris start
immediately.
</P>
<P>
Bulldozers and tracks are moving into more quake-hit sites to
haul away mountains of rubble, preparing for setting up more
makeshift tents and for future reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
The possibility of an outbreak of epidemic is one of the major
concerns of the authorities. Health officials are grappling with
ways to block possible spread of diseases like typhoid fever,
cholera and dysentery.
</P>
<P>
Officials were spraying disinfectants over stricken areas where
stench of corpses can be smelt mixed with dusts. They have also
started spreading purifying lime on rubble, roads and cemeteries
where bodies of quake victims were buried.
</P>
<P>
Water purification tablets were distributed in some regions.
</P>
<P>
Relief items are also in the process of being
distributed. Medical teams from Turkish hospitals as well as
foreign countries are travelling in quake-stricken areas to
provide medical aid to victims in tents.
</P>
<P>
According to the Turkish Red Crescent, the Muslim equivalent
of Red Cross, blood donations are not required at this stage.
</P>
<P>
About a quarter of a million people were left homeless by the
quake and have to stay in makeshift tents or even sleep in open
fields for an unforeseeable period of time.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated that in Adapazari alone, 70,000 homes have
been demolished or rendered uninhabitable.
</P>
<P>
In other quake-stricken provinces, tallies were staggering as
well with 42,391 homes destroyed or damaged in Izmit, an
industrial center of the country, 1,815 on the edges of Istanbul,
1,143 in the resort area of Yalova and 752 in Bolu.
</P>
<P>
Official casualty accounts have put the death toll from the
quake at over 12,000 so far. But government officials fear that
the number might clime over 40,000 as tens of thousands are still
buried under crashed buildings.

<P>
ISTANBUL, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Some 2,000 rescue workers and
medical staff from more than 30 countries have been dispatched to
Turkey in the wake of last Tuesday's massive earthquake, Turkish

</P>
<P>
Nearly 20 other countries have contributed with financial and
humanitarian aid, the English-language Turkish Daily News said.

</P>
<P>
Another field hospital is scheduled to arrive from Spain on
Monday, the paper said.

German Interior Ministry Undersecretary Claus Hans Henning said
Germany was ready to accept victims of the quake and that the
German government was considering lifting visa restrictions to
the child victims. The final decision would be taken on Monday, he
said.

"Bloodshed is quite possible before and after the announcement
of the ballot results because neither conflicting factions nor
their supporters are ready to accept a defeat. This phenomenon can

HONG KONG, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), Monday
expressed concern about the plane crash accident, which has so far
killed two passengers and injured over 200.
</P>
<P>
On a visit to the accident victims at the Princess Margaret
Hospital Monday morning, Tung said the Hong Kong SAR government
and the concerned departments responded very efficiently after the
accident happened.
</P>
<P>
The police, the Airport Authority and fire fighters all handled
the accident very quickly in a very organized and professional
manner, he said.
</P>
<P>
"From that point of view, Hong Kong has been put to a test and
I think we came through it," he noted.

At 12:00 Monday, some 60 persons who have been injured to
varying degrees are in hospitals. Of them, two are in critical

BEIJING, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Two Chinese firms listed on the
Shanghai Stock Exchange have been punished by the China Securities
Regulatory Commission (CSRC) for providing false information on
profits in their 1997 interim reports, a press official from the
watchdog confirmed here today.
</P>
<P>

fine of 30,000 yuan.
</P>

yuan of the said profit actually did not exist.
</P>
<P>
The Feilong Industrial, based in Hengyang City of central China
's Hunan Province, was found guilty of providing false information

<HEADLINE> China to Set Natural Science Fund Priority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 23 (Xinhua) -- An international workshop aimed
at setting the frontiers for science and priorities for the
foundation of natural science in China at the beginning of the
next century opened here today.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 well-known Chinese and foreign scientists,
including some Nobel Peace winners, are attending the three-day
meeting, which is expected to influence the plan for China's
natural science foundation from 2001 to 2005 and the long-term
program of science and technology development.
</P>
<P>
In a report delivered at the meeting, Zhang Cunhao, director of
the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NNSFC) and an
academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), said part of
basic research should be focused on new and high technology in
China.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China should ensure that basic research provides
an important basis for innovating and upgrading the conventional
industries, and pose radically new ideas for implementing the
national strategies of "advancing the country via science and
education" and "sustainable development".
</P>
<P>
"It is also a duty for basic research in China to foster and
encourage senior scientists and engineers as there is a severe
shortage throughout China," added Zhang.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang Xinshi, vice-director of the NNSFC, 16
subjects including biotechnology, information science, China's
water problem in the 21st century, life science, global change and
agricultural sustainable development and physics, are on the
agenda for discussion.

<P>
HARARE, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe, Zambia and Mozambique
are set to boost tourism, trade and interaction among their
citizens through a trans- border natural resources management
initiative, the daily Herald Monday reported.
</P>
<P>
The initiative between Guruve in Zimbabwe, Luangwa in Zambia
and Zumbo in Mozambique will allow the uniform protection and
sustainable utilization of wild animals and natural resources.
</P>
<P>
Senior government officials from the three countries formed the
 committee for the initiative in Harare last week at the closing
of a two- day workshop.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's Deputy Minister of Mines, Environment and Tourism
Edward Chindori-Chininga told the Herald that Guruve, Luangwa and
Zumbo districts boast vast wildlife and natural resources which
would certainly change the social and economic lifestyle of the
people in the three districts if they are fully tapped.
</P>
<P>
He said the initiative was a result of the understanding that
sustainable natural resource management in one country could not
be implemented in isolation of its neighbors.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Africa and the Asia/Pacific last
year topped the list for humanitarian needs because of conflict,
the International Red Cross (IRC) has revealed.
</P>
<P>
Monday's Times of Zambia newspaper quoted a report from the
organization as saying the IRC provided food, shelter and drugs to
more than 450,000 refugees from Burundi and the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
The humanitarian aid organization indicates that most refugees
assisted were running away from war in the DRC into western
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
"In Lungufu camp for Congolese refugees, the IRC provided camp
management, relief food, health care, clean water supplies and
sanitation facilities," the report said.
</P>
<P>
At least 112,000 Burundian refugees were maintained at Ngara
Center inside Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The IRC had to cope with requirements for humanitarian aid
because of the volatile situation in the Great Lakes region and
the DRC.
</P>
<P>
"The need for humanitarian assistance was immense as many were
displaced internally, while thousands more sought refuge in
neighboring countries," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone, Guinea Bissau were cited as conflict-plagued
countries in West Africa where thousands of people suffered
similar fate like the Congolese and those from the Great Lakes
region.
</P>
<P>
The IRC also observed that cholera had become endemic mostly in
eastern Africa and the Horn of Africa due to heavy flooding
calling for huge requirements for humanitarian aid.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, the capacity of national Red Cross
societies would be strengthened, options and strategies drafted so
they could work with governments and donors, said the report.

BEIJING, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Beijing, China's capital, is
welcoming more than 2,200 guests from over 200 countries and
international organizations who are taking part in the 22nd
Universal Postal Congress which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more than 250 of the world's leading conglomerates
have submitted applications to participate in the Fortune forum to
be held in Shanghai next month.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 years' opening up to the outside world has shaped
a brand new image for China, attracting not only many
international conferences, but also numerous business leaders from
all over the world. Statistics show that up to 100 conglomerates
have moved their regional headquarters to Beijing, Shanghai,
Guangzhou and some other big Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping, the architect of China's opening and reform
policies, said in the early days of the opening and reform drive
that opening up and reform were "the two legs with which China is
to achieve modernization"; facts have proven that he was right.
</P>
<P>
China's implementation of its opening up policy began with the
establishment in 1980 of the four special economic zones (SEZ) of
Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shantou and Xiamen along the Chinese coast. In
1988, Hainan Island, China's second largest offshore land mass,
was made the country's fifth and largest SEZ.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, numerous economic and technological
development zones were established on the outskirts of open
coastal cities. Currently the number of state-level economic and
technological development zones has reached 32, all of which have
evolved into centers of industrial production and high-tech
development with concentrations of foreign investment.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Closes Border with Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
has ordered for the immediate closure of the troubled Kenya-Somali
border citing insecurity.
</P>
<P>
Moi Sunday told all Somali warlords to go back to their country
and sort out the mess they had created as he addressed the nation
in the capital Nairobi during the 21st anniversary memorial
ceremony for the late president Jomo Kenyatta.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers Monday quoted Moi as saying the action which
is also meant to check criminal activities especially the
proliferation of illegal firearms from Somalia into Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Moi noted that the move to close the entire border routes and
Kismayu entry point in north eastern province with Somalia was
necessary in order to curb the illegal smuggling of goods into the
country, and ordered all imported goods should go through the
Port of Mombasa.
</P>
<P>
The president said that he would soon meet the factional
leaders from the war-rocked country so as to implore them to form
a government for national unity.
</P>
<P>
He said that he would press factional leader to form a
government that will represent the warring clans in the country
that has not experienced peace since the fall of former dictator
Siad Barre in 1991.
</P>
<P>
According to Kenyan Police Commissioner Philemon Abong'o, a
combined force of security personnel had been dispatched and took
charge of Kenya's common border with Somalia in compliance with
the presidential direction.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya-Somalia border closed earlier last month following a
group of the Somali militiamen crossed the border and snatched
the arms and equipment from the Kenyan troop, and the border
reopened in early this month.

<HEADLINE> S. African Cement Sales Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Concrete and cement sales
are continuing to show downward trend in South Africa, reflecting
one of the worst crises in the constructing industry in years,
Business Day newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sales were down 8.5 percent in the 12 months as for July from
the previous year, according to figures from the Cement and
Concrete Institute. However, export sales rose from 247,378 tons
to 385,575 tons.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the year, domestic cement and concrete
sales totaled about five million tons compared with 5.6 million
tons in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Business Day quoted an analyst as saying the cement and
concrete sector suffered major setbacks as a result of last year's
market turmoil.
</P>
<P>
He said the outlook for the rest of the year remained bleak
despite the expected economic recovery and continued lowering of
interest rates. This was because of the lag effect in the
construction industry, he said.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown in the South African economy led to reduced
construction work and cement and concrete production volumes.
</P>
<P>
This was aggravated by the cut in public sector infrastructural
 developments.
</P>
<P>
The Building Industries Federation of South Africa said because
of the crisis, the industry stood to shed about 30,000 jobs this
year after losing 20,000 last year, amounting together to 25
percent of the industry's workforce.
</P>
<P>
The industry expects to see 450 company liquidations, compared
with 350 last year.
</P>
<P>
Cracks in the sector emerged in 1997 when domestic cement sales
dropped more than one percent from 9.3 million tons in 1997 to 9.2
million tons in 1998.

Deng Xiaoping's inspection tour of southern China in 1992
prompted further opening and reforms. During the tour he called
for accelerated economic development and opening wider to the rest
of the world.
</P>
<P>
Following Deng's tour, the government declared the opening of
the Yangtze River Valley, the economically vibrant heartland of
China. Spearheading the move was the opening of Pudong in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
According to government plans, Pudong is expected to develop
into a high-tech industrial zone and an international financial
center. Out of the world's top 500 companies 98 have invested in
Pudong, while 59 of the world's top 100 companies have set up
business offices there.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this March, Pudong had attracted 5,581 foreign
direct investment projects involving a total investment of 28
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In Chinese terminology, China's opening is now "all-directional
" -- foreign-funded enterprises can be found everywhere in the
country, and Sino-foreign cooperating fields have been
increasingly expanded, including mining, banking, retailing,
insurance and some other sectors that foreign businesses were
restricted more or less in the past.
</P>
<P>
Retailing was once off limits to foreign investors. Now things
have changed, an increasing number of big international retailers,
including Wal Mart and Price Smart of the United States, Carrefour
of France and Makro of the Netherlands, have now entered the
largest Chinese cities. Carrefour alone is expected to have opened
20 stores in the country before the end of this year.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Cypriots Meet in Nicosia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The 11th World Congress of
Overseas Cypriots, which will last for five days, opened here
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
The opening ceremony of the congress was attended by Cyprus
Parliament Speaker Spyros Kyprianou, Foreign Minister Ioannis
Kasoulides, leaders of the Cypriot communities abroad, Cypriot
party leaders and Greek Deputy Foreign Minister Gregoris Niotis.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus is going through the most crucial phase in its history,
said Kyprianou, stressing the need for "unity of purpose, goals
and planning."
</P>
<P>
"We shall be faced with a terrible dilemma: either sign for a
geographical and ethnic division or continue our struggle," he
warned.
</P>
<P>
Expressing virtually no faith in pledges given by world
leaders to Cyprus, he cautioned against adverse developments and
stressed that nobody has the right to tell Cypriots to sign up to
unacceptable solutions.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
It is obvious now that the international community wishes and
wants to see the Cyprus issue solved as soon as possible, said the
foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
But he warned that one should show restraint in one's
expectations, given Turkey's intransigence.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Cyprus are boosting their defense cooperation in
the context of a joint defense pact between the two countries,
Niotis said.
</P>
<P>
He said Greece considers the Cyprus issue as its top national
priority.

<HEADLINE> Protection of Forest Urged in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Philippine House speaker Manuel
Villar warned his nationals Sunday that the nation's remaining
forest cover would be destroyed in 37 years unless measures are
taken to curb forest destruction.
</P>
<P>
Villar said "some thing has to be done fast to help rejuvenate
our forests," the newspaper the Philippine Star reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Speaker added that in 1972 the country had about 10.4
million hectares of natural forests which covered 34 percent of
its total land area of 30 million hectares.
</P>
<P>
Today, forest cover is down to 6.16 million hectares, or
roughly 20.5 of the nation's total land area, he noted. "This
means that the annual rate of forest destruction is 163,000
hectares."
</P>
<P>
The Speaker called for swift action on environmental
protection-related measures pending in the House, including the
proposed Sustainable Forest Management Act and a bill seeking to
regulate the ownership and use of chainsaws.
</P>
<P>
He said under the forest management bill, indigenous
communities and other residents of forested areas will be urged to
undertake a reforestation programs.
</P>
<P>
The bill also provides safeguards against illegal loggers, such
as the imposition of stiffer penalties, including imprisonment of
up to 14 years, on them.
</P>
<P>
However, the proposed forest management bill would still allow
tree-cutting by licensed loggers, he added.

<HEADLINE> Ban on Imported Chicken Recommended in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA August 23 (Xinhua) -- A Philippine government agency has
 recommended for the permanent banning of imported chicken meat
from being sold in the country's major duty-free shops,
Philippine News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The recommendation was made by the Economic Mobilization Group,
in coordination with the Department of Agriculture, which readily
consented to the agency's move in order to save the local poultry
industry from dying a natural death.
</P>
<P>
According to Trade and Industry Undersecretary Ernesto Ordonez,
also chief of the economic agency, the recommendation came about
after many disgruntled poultry growers in the country complained
that imported chickens are directly competing with their local
produce to the detriment of their livelihood because they are much
cheaper to buy.
</P>
<P>
Ordonez said Agriculture Secretary Edgardo Angara already
heeded the government agency's recommendation by directing the
management of the Subic Bay Freeport in Zambales and the Clark
Economic Zone in Pampanga to stop importing frozen chicken meat.
</P>
<P>
He said the Agriculture Department's order will immediately be
implemented in the above-mentioned duty-free shops.
</P>
<P>
Notably, the poultry industry here plays a significant role in
the lives of the many Filipino farmers because it provides them
ample income, aside from providing steady supply of chickens and
eggs in the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
However, importers have expressed concern over the government
agency's move considering that this is contrary to the country's
observance of its trade liberalization policy, not to mention the
rules set in the World Trade Organization.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Government's Intervention  In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has criticized the
 Zimbabwean government for its direct intervention in agricultural
marketing, production and technology, saying this is detrimental
to the sector, the daily Herald reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
World Bank Resident Representative Thomas Allen Sunday told the
Zimbabwe Farmers' Union Congress in Masvingo, south of the
country, that the delivery of agricultural services has been
undergoing radical changes in a number of countries.
</P>
<P>
It was sad that the government believed in direct intervention
in marketing through parastatal marketing boards and producer
price fixing, he said.
</P>
<P>
Allen, however, admitted that there was a legitimate concern
that the withdrawal of direct support by the government would lead
to service gaps in the smallholder farming sector.
</P>
<P>
He said, "It is only through such competition that all service
providers -- government, public and private -- will stay focused
on the farmers' real needs and provide competitive services."
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has set a goal with the International Federation
of Agricultural Producers of "partnerships between farmers,
governments and other stakeholders in every World Bank-supported
agricultural services project by the year 2001".

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Military to Take Security Measures Ahead of Ballot in E. Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Armed Forces (TNI)
Commander Gen. Wiranto Monday said TNI would take any necessary
security measures to guarantee the U.N.-sponsored East Timor
autonomy ballot going well.
</P>
<P>
"We will take any necessary security measures in order the
ballot running well," Wiranto told reporters after a plenary
session with the House of Representatives here.
</P>
<P>
He said TNI would stay neutral among rival factions, citing it
would keep pushing them to make reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
"Reconciliation is needed and must be done to secure ballot and
create safety situation after that (ballot)," Wiranto said.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto, also Minister of Defense, called on any parties not to
blame the U.N. Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) due to allegations
the body wasn't neutral in proceeding its activities.
</P>
<P>
"Don't blow it (neutrality) up, because I know that UNAMET
institutionally have been working hard to create peace and conduct
direct ballot as well as possible," he said, adding that it was
inevitable some UNAMET officials acted their vested interests in
the mission since they came from any parties.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, East Timor Military Commander Col. Noer Muis warned
of possible bloodshed in the territory following the autonomy
ballot due to the absence of a strong commitment among the warring
factions to a reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Violence has continued in many areas in East Timor. A string of
clashes in Maliana, Bobonaro, Ainaro and Viqueque last week left
at least five people dead and many others injured.
</P>
<P>
Under a U.N.-brokered agreement with Portugal, Indonesia agreed
to hold the autonomy ballot on August 30. More than 450,000 people
in and outside East Timor are expected to go to the polls to
decide whether they remain with or break away from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, with a population of some 800,000 and an area of
15,000 square kilometers, had been a Portuguese colony until 1975.
It became an Indonesian province in 1976, but the U.N. never
recognized the move.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Peso to Normalize This Week: Senior Banker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 23 (Xinhua) - The Philippine Central Bank (PCB)
said Monday that the peso is expected to normalize this week after
last week's depreciation due to some factors that were inevitable.
</P>
<P>
However, PCB Governor Rafael Buenaventura told reporters that
this optimism is still shrouded by the effects of the recent
floods and heavy rains which caused an unexpected rise in the
inflation rate which the National Economic and Development
Authority predicted to hit at about 6 percent this month.
</P>
<P>
He said the inflation rate expectation could also trigger an
increase in the country's interest rates which will eventually put
pressure on the peso.
</P>
<P>
The peso references rate hovered between 39.00 and 39.592 pesos
to one U.S. dollar as of last Sunday's weighted average recorded
in the Philippine dealing system.
</P>
<P>
The situation may also be triggered by the expected rise in the
 interest rates in the United States because they do not want the
economy to overheat, Buenaventura said.
</P>
<P>
The recent holding of the rallies in the country brought
instability in the minds of foreign investors, he noted, adding
that they equated the rallies to what happened in the local
equities market.
</P>
<P>
The PCB official stressed that investors will again be closely
 monitoring the Treasure Bills auction set to take place Monday at
the Bureau of Treasury.
</P>
<P>
If the bureau will reject a desired-level of bids during
Monday's tenders, it will determine the attitude of investors in
the way the market will react as to how much the government will
entertain during the formal bidding, he said.

"However, grain storage projects are the only ones exclusively
funded by treasury bonds," Tang said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, China has enjoyed steady grain production with an
annual output of 500 billion kg, but which has left the country's
grain storage capacity unable to cope with the demand.
</P>
<P>
"By the end of this year, granaries with a total storage
capacity of 25 billion kg will be ready," Tang said.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the quality of construction, the government has
appointed the China International Engineering Consulting Corp (
CIECC), the leader in its field, to supervise the work and it has
so far sent some 3,000 supervisors to construction sites across
the country.

<HEADLINE> hke082318-Bangladesh High Court Asks Govt to Remove Slum Dwellers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's High Court
authorities have asked the government to evacuate the squatting
slum dwellers from their compound for the sake of discipline and
security at the county's highest seat of justice, press reports
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Home Minister Mohammad Nasim admitted the receipt of an
official letter from the High Court on Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the High Court letter, the minister said he had
referred it to the Law Ministry and the Attorney General for legal
opinion.
</P>
<P>
It was unwarranted that slum dwellers trespassed into and
raised slums in the Supreme Court ground, which under no
circumstances could be acceptable, he said. "I am considering it
with utmost importance since the High Court expressed concerns and
raised the point of discipline and security."
</P>
<P>
The police last Thursday turned down a request made by the
court through telephone for removing the poor people swarming in
the court premises. "We need a written order from the court,
otherwise we feel it would be in violation of the court orders to
purge the former slum people," a police official said.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of evicted slum dwellers who entered the Supreme Court
premises in central Dhaka last Wednesday night have built
makeshift homes there like their demolished shanties, refusing to
leave the area until their demand of immediate rehabilitation was
met.
</P>
<P>
They were evicted from slums in the capital city early this
month by law-enforcing agencies, on the ground that the slums had
become dens of terrorists and criminals. Nearly 70,000 people were
evicted from the slums.
</P>
<P>
The High Court later directed the government not to remove any
more slums in the capital city till the court resumed hearing of a
writ petition, filed by non-governmental organizations and slum
dwellers, challenging the legality and authority of the demolition
of slums and the eviction of inhabitants without arranging
alternative accommodation and without any prior notice.
</P>
<P>
It was said there are about 2 million slum dwellers in the
Bangladeshi capital, home for some 9 million people.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the High Court Division would resume hearing of the
writ petition on the slum eviction Monday afternoon, and the slum
people, now staying in the court premises, would bring out a
procession Monday to protest against their eviction from the
slums.

<HEADLINE> More Lawyers Offer to Help the Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Most lawyers are willing to take legal aid cases," said Gong
Xiaobing, deputy director of the Legal Aid Center under the
Ministry of Justice.
</P>
<P>
Under the system, impoverished litigants who want to protect
their legitimate rights can get free legal assistance.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers' associations, which represent the interests of lawyers,
are leading the movement to make the handling of legal aid cases
compulsory for the nation's 110,000 lawyers.
</P>
<P>
"This is a matter of a lawyer's duty to the society," said
Huang Wu, president of the Guangdong Lawyers' Association.
</P>
<P>
The nation's first provincial legal aid regulation containing
punishments will take effect in the province on September 1, which
stipulates that lawyers could have their permits revoked for from
three months to a year if they fail to handle a required number of
legal aid cases.
</P>
<P>
All cases involving legal aid will be filed with local legal
aid institutions, where their quality will be assessed during an
annual trade inspection.
</P>
<P>
Because of a shortage in legal aid funding, lawyers can get a
maximum of 400 yuan (about 48 U.S. dollars) in compensation for
their services per client. This hardly covers the costs of pre-
court investigations.
</P>
<P>
In China, most legal aid centers are state- or locally-funded,
which depend largely on the affluence of the localities. So far,
29 of the country's 31 provinces, municipalities and autonomous
regions have already established legal aid institutions.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the 500 or so legal aid centers across China, from
provinces down to counties, dealt with more than 60,000 cases of
legal aid and provided consultation to more than 800,000 people.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Bret Hits U.S. Texas State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Hurricane Bret, the largest
storm to hit Texas State of the United States over nearly 20 years,
roared ashore Sunday night, bringing heavy rains and high winds,
said reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The rapidly developing storm made landfall around 6 p.m. (local
time) in sparsely populated Kenedy County, about 110 kilometers
south of Corpus Christi.
</P>
<P>
Businesses and homes were shuttered from Brownsville to north
of Corpus Christi, and highways leading inland were packed with
bumper-to-bumper traffic for several kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Winds of 180 kilometers per hour, with gusts even higher,
extended 65 kilometers out from the storm. Forecasters warned
about tornadoes spawned by the storm, a foot or more of rain and a
storm surge that could approach eight meters.
</P>
<P>
Corpus Christi declared a state of disaster and called for a
general but voluntary evacuation of the city of 300,000 residents,
said city spokesman Ted Nelson.
</P>
<P>
Most residents had left coastal Padre and Mustang islands,
where a mandatory order was issued and police went door-to-door
urging people to leave.
</P>
<P>
No hurricane had ever hit Texas since October 1989 when
Hurricane Jerry killed three people there. But the state's 520-
kilometer-long coast have since been struck by tropical storms
including Charley, which dumped 45 centimeters of rain and killed
19 people in August 1998.

<HEADLINE> KFOR French Commander Admits Failure to Disarm KLA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Most ethnic Albanian militants
in Vucitrn and Srbica, Kosovo, are defying the demilitarization
accord and have refused to disarm themselves, a French commander
of the international peacekeeping force in Kosovo (KFOR) admitted
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
General Bruno Cuche, commander of the French peacekeeping zone,
said this in Kosovoska Mitrovica where the headquarters of the
French brigade is based.
</P>
<P>
According to the Tanjug news agency, there are 450 ethnic
Albanian militants in Vucitrn and Srbica, 250 of whom are members
of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA).
</P>
<P>
These militants forced the Serbs and other non-Albanian
Kosovars to flee their homes, seized government buildings and
civilian residences as their barracks, and even established their
own "rules and law," Tanjug said.
</P>
<P>
KFOR has warned repeatedly that the Serbs should not take the
risk of proceeding from Kosovoska Mitrovica to Srbica and other
dangerous areas, because KFOR soldiers could not guarantee their
safety, even the safety of themselves, along the Kosovoska
Mitrovica-Srbica route where there are ethnic Albanian snipers
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
Under the United Nations resolution adopted on June 10, KFOR
should disarm KLA. But KFOR failed to fulfill the task in the two
months since their arrival.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, acts of violence against non-ethnic Albanians
by the KLA have increased sharply in the past two months.
According to Yugoslavia's official data, about 200,000 non-ethnic
Albanians have been forced to flee their homes, more than 200
people murdered, 400 persons wounded, 40,000 civilian residences
and more than 40 Serbian Orthodox churches and abbeys looted and
burned.

<HEADLINE> Jiang's Address at 22nd UPC (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Chinese Government always attaches great importance to the
development and improvement of postal services. Thanks to its
unremitting efforts over the past fifty years since the founding
of the People's Republic, especially the hard work in the last two
decades since the introduction of reform and opening-up, China has
made great headway in its postal services. A postal network that
links China's urban and rural areas, covers the entire country and
connects the rest of the world has come into being. And the
network is now in a continuous process of modernization. China's
postal service has been separated from telecommunications, and has
become a separate sector of independent operation in the country's
national economy. The age-old postal services in China are
therefore taking on a brand new look of vigor and vitality. We
will continue to proceed with the modernization of China's postal
industry so as to make it serve the people better both in China
and the world.
</P>
<P>
The development of international postal services should follow
the principles of consultation on an equal footing, seeking common
ground while shelving differences, mutual support and mutually
beneficial cooperation. Only by adhering to these principles can
all countries possibly achieve common progress and prosperity. In
this connection, the pressing task in the international postal
cooperation should be to help developing countries overcome
difficulties in their development of postal services and to narrow
the gap between the developing and the developed countries in this
field. The Chinese Government is ready to strengthen exchanges
and cooperation in postal services with other UPU member states on
the basis of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit so as to
make its due contribution to promoting the hi-tech development and
application in the field of postal services and to advancing
postal services in the world.
</P>
<P>
Finally, I wish the 22nd UPC a complete success and wish all of
you a pleasant stay in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Now, I have the pleasure to declare the 22nd Universal Postal
Congress open.
</P>
<P>
Thank you.

<HEADLINE> Lapentti Rallies Past Spadea to Win RCA Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Eleventh seed Nicolas
Lapentti of Ecuador beat unseeded American Vince Spadea 4-6, 6-4,
6-4 to win the RCA Championship, the $745,000 U.S. Open tuneup
event, Sunday in Indianapolis, the United States.
</P>
<P>
Spadea gone 7-1 against players ranked in the top 10 this
season, but Lapentti came back from a set and 2-4 down in the
second to claim his second career ATP Tour title and $122,500
first prize.
</P>
<P>
"It's definitely the best preparation for me for the Open,"
said Lapentti. "I'm going to be there with a lot of confidence."
</P>
<P>
Today's win boosted Lapentti's 1999 record to 42-14. Known as a
claycourt specialist, he has shown an ability to play on hard
courts, especially with his surprising semi-final run at the
Australian Open.
</P>
<P>
Lapentti, 23, was appearing in his second ATP Tour final this
year, following a runner-up finish at last month's Gstaad Open
clay in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
In a sloppy match that featured a combined nine service breaks
and 71 unforced errors, it was Spadea who had the early advantage.
He broke the Ecuadorian twice in the opening set, including the
final game.
</P>
<P>
It was the second runner-up finish of Spadea's career as he
remains winless on the ATP Tour. Spadea, 25, fell to 27-19 in 1999,
but his run to the final featured a quarter-final win over world
No.1 Peter Sampras, who retired during the match with a hip injury.

<HEADLINE> Agassi Beats Kafelnikov to Win Legg Mason Tennis Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Andre Agassi today all but
ended Yevgeny Kafelnikov's hopes of snagging the second seed at
the upcoming U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
Agassi, the second-seeded American, posted a convincing 7-6 (7-
3), 6-1 victory over the top seed from Russia at the $725,000 Legg
Mason Tennis Classic here. It was his third tournament win of the
season, the 42nd of his career and fifth in the naitonls capital.
</P>
<P>
Agassi also gained revenge for a semi-final loss to Kafelnikov
in the semi-final of the du Maurier Open two weeks ago. Since the
start of the French Open -- which he won -- Agassi has captured 28
of his last 32 matches. His only losses in that span were to
Kafelnikov and world No. 1 American Peter Sampras.
</P>
<P>
With the U.S. Open beginning in eight days, Agassi is expected
to follow Monday's ranking when assigning seeds.
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather be on the opposite end of the draw of Sampras,"
Agassi said before describing his preparation for the year's final
grand slam perfect."
</P>
<P>
Despite the chance to win his third title of the year and 20th
of his career, Kafelnikov is feeling good about his form. He lost
for only the fourth time in his last 18 matches and his 1999
record fell to 41-19, 22-6 on hard courts.
</P>
<P>
"Andre was on the top of his game today," the Australian Open
champion said. "Obviously, it is a big disappointment. I made a
couple of erros at the wrong time, but I'm still feeling confident
heading into the Open. It should be very exciting with all the top
four players doing so well."
</P>
<P>
Kafelnikov likely will be seeded third at the U.S. Open and
will continue his preparations at the Hamlet Cup on Long Island.

<HEADLINE> Former NBA Star Rodman Arrested for Public Intoxication </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Former NBA star Dennis Rodman
added another chapter to his next book on Saturday night, when he
was arrested for public intoxication in California.
</P>
<P>
Rodman was asked to leave Woody's Wharf restaurant and bar
because owners said he was causing a disturbance. Police were
called after Rodman refused to leave, according to Sergeant Jim
Kaminsky of the Newport Beach department.
</P>
<P>
Kaminsky said the Rodman was arrested in the morning and booked
for the misdemeanor. He was released on his own recognizance six
hours later.
</P>
<P>
The 38-year-old Rodman has won five NBA championships and seven
rebounding titles but has become more known for his antics on and
off the court. This year alone, he was released by the Los Angeles
Lakers and filed for divorce from wife Carmen Electra.
</P>
<P>
Rdoman is infamous for his ever-changing hair color, tattoos,
unpredictable mood swings and history of ignoring team rules and
codes of conduct.
</P>
<P>
In January 1997, he was suspended 11 games by the league for
kicking a cameraman in the groin. During the NBA Finals that
season, he made obscene, insensitive comments regarding Mormons as
his Chicago Bulls battled the Utah Jazz.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Investigate State-owned Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government will set up
an independent committee to investigate the management and lending
practices of the state-owned Krung Thai Bank (KTB), Channel 9,
Thailand's state television station reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry of Thailand has said in a statement that
it was in the process of approaching qualified people to serve in
the probe team.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also outlined its normal monitoring processes in
the statement, which include internal examination by the bank,
examination by an audit committee in line with regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), examination by the Bank
of Thailand, the Auditor-General's Office and outside experts.
</P>
<P>
The report said KTB was saddled with about 84 percent of
non-performing loans (NPL) and would need provisions of 364
billion to 394 billion baht (9.8 billion to 10.6 billion U.S.
dollars) to cover the potential losses.
</P>
<P>
However, the bank said its NPLs stood at 59.3 percent by the
end of June, no higher than the average NPLs level of Thai banks.

<HEADLINE> 7 Islands in Indonesia's Thousand Islands Chain Sink </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Seven islands in the Pulau
Seribu marine resort area, popularly known as Thousand Islands
chain, off the North Jakarta shore have perished and eight more
will follow shortly if the administration fails to take necessary
preventive measures.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Pulau Seribu district Waluyono said the seven
missing islands and the eight troubled islands were among 82
islands determined as a national sea park according to a 1982
decree by the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
"The seven islands were ruined by sea water abrasion and
illegal sand mining. The same thing is now happening to eight
other islands," he was quoted by The Jakarta Post Monday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Waluyono said his men could not monitor the illegal sand mining
in Pulau Seribu because the district did not have enough boats to
patrol the area.
</P>
<P>
Head of Commission D for development affairs Ali Wangso Sinaga
called for an end to the illegal sand mining, allegedly carried
out by businessmen who privately owned the islands in the area.
</P>
<P>
He said the sand, which has been used to develop the private
islands and tourism resorts on nearby islands, was taken from the
perished islands.
</P>
<P>
He called on the city administration and security authority to
improve the monitoring mechanism to prevent more islands from
sinking.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Explore Trade Potential World over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will study the
potential of trade links with nations the world over as a vital
approach towards developing the national economy, Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Malaysia, as a trading nation, need to look for more trading
partners as we cannot always depend on our traditional ones,"
Mahathir told a news conference on his return here after visits to
Russia and China.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia could not consider any place as devoid of potential,
he said, adding "At first we did not see the potential but if we
make a study we can have useful information which can help to
increase our trade."
</P>
<P>
Since Malaysia forged links with nations of the South which
were at first considered weak and without any potential, the
country's bilateral trade has increased to 90 billion ringgit
(about 23.684 billion U.S. dollars), he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said his visits to Khabarovsk and Buryatia in the
Russian Federation were successful in efforts to increase trade.
The visit to parts of Russia would enhance Malaysia's relations
with the Russian Federation as a whole, he added.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said his visit to China was to commemorate the visit
made 25 years ago by late Prime Minister Abdul Razak, paving the
way for the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
During the visit Mahathir met with Chinese President Jiang
Zemin and held talks with Premier Zhu Rongji on bilateral and
international matters.

</P>
<P>
Jiang said that he is confident this Congress will be
remembered as a splendid chapter in the annals of the
international postal services.
</P>
<P>
"Peace and development remain the trend of our times. A lasting
peace and universal prosperity, however, requires joint efforts
from all peoples in the world. Postal services must serve as an
important force for the lofty cause of world peace and development,
and play a positive role in promoting the establishment of a new,
equitable and rational international order," he said.
</P>
<P>
In order to adapt to the new circumstances of economic
development and social progress and to play a bigger role, postal
services must go through restructuring and technological
renovation, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"The development of international postal services should follow
the principles of consultation on an equal footing, seeking common
ground while shelving differences, mutual support and mutually
beneficial cooperation," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Only by adhering to these principles can all countries possibly
achieve common progress and prosperity, Jiang said. In this
connection, the pressing task in the international postal
cooperation should be to help developing countries overcome
difficulties in their development of postal services and to narrow
the gap between the developing and the developed countries in this
field, he added.

<HEADLINE> Slovakia's Jobless Rate Hits Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Unemployment in the Slovak
Federal Republic hit a record high of 19.19 percent in July,
according to the latest official statistics.
</P>
<P>
The figure is 4.29 percentage points higher than the same
period of last year, said the National Office for Labor.
</P>
<P>
In July, the number of registered jobless people in Slovakia
for the first time totaled 510,000, which is 122,000 more than a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate is expected to exceed 21 percent in the
first quarter next year. In 1998, the average monthly unemployment
rate in Slovakia was 15.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Around 60 percent of Slovakia's economy had been privatized by
1993. Since then the economy has declined due to the incompetence
of many of its factories. Latest figures show its GDP in the first
quarter this year was 178.2 billion korun (4.14 billion U.S.
dollars), only 1.8 percent higher than last year.

<P>
BEIJING, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Following is the full text of
Chinese President Jiang Zemin's address at the Opening Ceremony of
the 22nd Universal Postal Congress (UPC).
Distinguished Guests,Ladies and Gentlemen,
</P>
<P>
Today we are gathering here for the grand opening ceremony of
the 22nd Universal Postal Congress (UPC) at a time when golden
autumn is embracing Beijing, bringing refreshing and pleasant
breeze to the capital city. This Congress is the first of its kind
ever convened in China in the 125-year history of the Universal
Postal Union (UPU) and in the past 85 years since China's
accession to the organization. On behalf of the Chinese Government
and people, and in my own name, I wish to extend our sincere
congratulations on the convocation of the Congress and our hearty
welcome to all the deputies and guests.
</P>
<P>
Mankind now stands at the threshold of the 21st century. At
this important moment, it is of great significance that you meet
here and discuss the postal services development strategies and
programs of action for the new century. I am confident that this
Congress will be remembered as a splendid chapter in the annals of
the international postal services.
</P>
<P>
As modern science and technology are experiencing explosive
development and the trend towards multi-polarization and economic
globalization is gaining momentum, the human society and its
progress are now at a critical historical juncture. Countries in
the world are faced with both opportunities and challenges. Peace
and development remain the trend of our times. A lasting peace and
universal prosperity, however, requires joint efforts from all
peoples in the world. Postal services must serve as an important
force for the lofty cause of world peace and development, and play
a positive role in promoting the establishment of a new, equitable
and rational international order.

<TEXT>
<P>
Reaching each and every family at all corners of our globe,
postal services play a significant role in promoting the
development of political, economic, scientific and technological,
cultural, educational and other undertakings of mankind. Modern
information technology, which is developing with each passing day,
has brought fresh vitality to the development of the international
postal services. The three basic functions of postal services,
namely, information communications, goods delivery and capital
circulation, are being enriched and constantly broadened. There is
a brilliant and broad prospect for the further development of
postal services.
</P>
<P>
In order to adapt to the new circumstances of economic
development and social progress and to play a bigger role, postal
services must go through restructuring and technological
renovation. Given the difference among countries in the level of
economic development, historical and cultural traditions and
social systems, and the state of their respective postal services,
it is impossible for all countries to adopt a single model for
their postal service reform. Therefore, it is important that all
countries explore vigorously ways of reform or take reform
measures in the light of their respective national conditions and
for the purpose of meeting social demand, promoting social
progress and realizing universal service.

<HEADLINE> China Advancing Toward Prosperity, Says Pakistani Diplomat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The short but glorious period
of 50 years of new China has opened a new chapter in the nation's
history of civilization to advance toward a powerful and
prosperous nation, said senior Pakistani diplomat Akram Zaki.
</P>
<P>
Akram Zaki, chairman of the Standing Committee of Foreign
Affairs in the Senate, served from 1987 to 1991 as Pakistan's
ambassador to China.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, he described himself as
"China's admirer."
</P>
<P>
Zaki said that he traveled extensively in China during his
tenure of office and witnessed the tremendous changes on Chinese
soil since China's adoption of the reform and opening up policy
initiated by late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
"The founding of the People's Republic of China (PRC) is one of
the events which are of the greatest importance in the history of
the Chinese nation as well as in the world of this century," said
Zaki.
</P>
<P>
During the past 50 years, the Chinese people, under the
dedicated and wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, have
made tremendous achievements which have attracted world wide
attention and won the respect of the world people, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Zaki, who has a thorough study and wide-range knowledge about
China, said China, as a nation with more than 5,000 years of
civilization, had experienced glorious periods in the history.
</P>
<P>
"However, the past 50 years since the founding of the PRC is
the most splendid period in the history of the nation," said Zaki.
</P>
<P>
During the last five decades, China has experienced three
generations of collective leadership with Mao Zedong, Deng
Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin as their respective nucleus.
</P>
<P>
"The unity and wisdom of the collective leadership is the
guarantee for China's stability, development and growing strength,
" Zaki said while recalling the major political developments in
China and other parts of the world since the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
"Political stability is the most important thing for a
developing nation like China, and it is especially so in the
current international situation," Zaki said.
</P>
<P>
He said that "the stability of China is not only of the utmost
importance for China itself but also for Asia and the world as a
whole."
</P>
<P>
Recalling his own experiences during his visits to various
parts of China, Zaki said that "the smooth and fruitful
implementation of the reform and opening up policy during the past
two decades should be attributed to political and social stability.
"
</P>
<P>
Referring to China's foreign policy, Zaki said that the work
done by China in the diplomatic field during the past 50 years
cannot be summarized simply by a word of "tremendous."
</P>
<P>
Zaki said that the independent and peaceful foreign policy
always pursued by China, together with its firm stand against
hegemonism and power politics, has won itself high respect and
appreciation from the international community.
</P>
<P>
Zaki, who is well versed in the Chinese history, dismissed the
so-called China threat, saying that it is "a malicious fabrication
" by some people.
</P>
<P>
"China is a peace-loving country," he said, adding that "China
has been a major peace force in the world today. China's stability
and development are the major contributions to the world peace."
</P>
<P>
Zaki spoke highly of the performance by China during the Asian
financial crisis, saying that "China acted as a mature and
responsible nation. What China had done for ending this crisis
should always be remembered by the people in this region and in
the world."
</P>
<P>
He also said the whole world is watching China closely. "Along
with its constant economic development, China will play a more
important role in world affairs and will be a major power in the
multi-polar world in the coming century," he said.

<HEADLINE> East Timor Military Commander Fears More Bloodshed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- East Timor Military Commander
Col. Noer Muis Sunday warned of possible bloodshed in the
territory following the autonomy ballot due to the absence of a
strong commitment among the warring factions to a reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
"Bloodshed is quite possible before and after the announcement
of the ballot results because neither conflicting factions nor
their supporters are ready to accept a defeat. This phenomenon can
be seen in the continuing clashes between them during the ongoing
campaign period," he said in Dili, capital of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Under a U.N.-brokered agreement with Portugal, Indonesia agreed
to hold the autonomy ballot on August 30. More than 450,000 people
in and outside East Timor are expected to go to the polls to
decide whether they remain with or break away from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Violence has continued in many areas in East Timor. A string of
clashes in Maliana, Bobonaro, Ainaro and Viqueque last week left
at least five people dead and many others injured.
</P>
<P>
Muis said tension was mounting in Suai, south of Dili, with the
number of local people taking refuge in churches increasing to
around 3,000, from 1,700 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The refugees have complained about the absence of food and
medical supplies," he was quoted by The Jakarta Post Monday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Muis, who replaced Col. Tono Suratman early this month, called
on the two conflicting factions to continue promoting the ballot's
purpose of establishing peace in the territory regardless of the
results of the autonomy ballot.
</P>
<P>
East Timorese leaders agreed on August 11 to establish a
25-person commission to foster reconciliation and cooperation in
the territory until the results of the ballot are implemented.
</P>
<P>
Members of the commission will be nominated by each of the
warring factions and appointed by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan. The consultative body will be inaugurated on August 31.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, with a population of some 800,000 and an area of
15,000 square kilometers, had been a Portuguese colony until 1975.
It became an Indonesian province in 1976, but the U.N. never
recognized the move.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia early this year announced it would grant East Timor
independence if the people in the territory reject Indonesia's
offer of a wide-ranging autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Fighting between the pro-integration and the pro-independence
forces has escalated since the announcement.

<HEADLINE> Greene, Jones Win 100m Golds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEVILLE, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The world fastest man and woman
Maurice Greence and Marion Jones produced the day's most
spectacular performances at the World Athletics Championships,
sprinting to glory in a sizzling time here on the Seville track
Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Jones finished her first leg of planned four-goal
haul by taking the women's 100m at 10.70 seconds, her American
countryman Greene ran the second-fastest 100m meters in history at
9.80 seconds, just 0.01 off his own world record which was set on
June 16 in Athens.
</P>
<P>
For Jones, her victory further consolidated her status in the
sport of athletics as the American sprinter became the first women
sprinter to defend the title in 100m dash.
</P>
<P>
Since the world championships were inaugurated in 1983 in
Helsinki, no women runner had defended the title for the distance.
</P>
<P>
Jones, remaining unbeaten in the past two years, equalled the
fifth fastest time ever and only the world record holder late
Florence Griffith Joyner and Jones, herself, had ever run faster.
</P>
<P>
Her teammate Inger Miller, who had a false start in the final,
had the silver medal at 10.79 and Ekaterini Thanou of Greece the
bronze at 10.84.
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian Zhanna Tarnopolskaya-Pintusevich, who won the silver
in the 100 meter and gold for the 200m two years ago in Athens,
was fourth in 10.95.
</P>
<P>
Two times Olympic champion Gail Devers of the United States was
fifth in the same time as Pintusevich ahead of European champion
Christine Arron of France.
</P>
<P>
Jones could not hide her joy for the victory and sent kisses to
her husband, C.J. Hunter, who let out a huge roar from the stands
after she crossed the finish line. Hunter won the men's shot put
title Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The former basketball player is aiming at an unprecedented four
titles including the 200m, one of the relays and long jump, which
she had qualified for Monday's final.
</P>
<P>
In the men's event, Greene, who made his name by defeating
Canadian Dorovan Bailey to win the 100m at the Athens
championships two years ago, held off a strong challenge from
Canada's Brunny Surin to retain the title.
</P>
<P>
The fastest runner trailed Surin for the first half of the race
until he sped up in the final 50 meters and stormed past Surin at
the finish line.
</P>
<P>
Surin took the silver at 9.84 and Dwain Chambers of Britain was
third in a career best of 9.97.
</P>
<P>
As soon as he crossed the line, Greene took a glimpse over the
timing board and only at this time did he realize how close he had
been to setting a new world record.
</P>
<P>
He shook his head and kneeld on the track, holding his head in
his hands for a moment. Once he stood up, he splashed a glamorous
smiling to the crowd and looked up at his training partner Ato
Boldon in the stands. He then had a victorious lap around the
track with the American flag.
</P>
<P>
In other events of the day, France's Eunice Barber defeated
Britain's Denise Lewis to win the heptathlon by 120 points.
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Leone-born Barber, who became a French citizen
earlier this year, virtually wrapped up the title in the
penultimate event by throwing 49.88 meters in the javelin.
</P>
<P>
Lewis, the European and Commonwealth champion, managed a throw
of 47.44m.
</P>
<P>
After six events, Barber held a points lead of 5,977-5,857 over
Lewis, which meant the Briton would need to garner nearly nine
seconds edge in the final event, the 800 meters, to take the gold
away from her.
</P>
<P>
In the long jump event of heptathlon Sunday morning, there was
a controversy over Lewis's jump.
</P>
<P>
Officials initially ruled that Lewis had fouled on her third
jump which was measured at 6.64 meters.
</P>
<P>
After Lewis argued against the decision, the jump was ruled
legal, then disallowed again. A few hours later, an appeals jury
accepted a protest by the British federation and ruled that the
jump would stand.
</P>
<P>
Lewis said after the final event that she would not complain
with the silver medal. "I've put everything I had into this
competition. It's been an up and down two days but I think
generally, while I won't say I'm happy, the highlights have been
high and the lows have been low," she said.
</P>
<P>
"With the silver medal, I can't complain," she added.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, Karsten Kobs of Germany celebrated a win in the
hammer event by throwing himself in the steeplechase water hurdle.
</P>
<P>
The enormous German produced a distance of 80.24 meters with
his first throw in the day.
</P>
<P>
Zsolt Nemeth of Hungary won the silver with 79.05 meters and
Vladislav Pinkunov of Ukraine took the bronze with an attempt of
79.03 meters.

<HEADLINE> Greene and Jones Win 100m Golds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEVILLE, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Maurice Greence and Marion Jones
sunshined the dark sky of south Spain by taking the men's and
women's 100 meters sprints at the World Athletics Championships on
Sunday evening respectively.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Jones had her a quarter of dream realized by
taking the women's 100m at 10.70 seconds, Greene ran the second-
fastest 100m meters in history at 9.80 seconds, just 0.01 off his
world record which was set on June 16 in Athens.
</P>
<P>
For Jones, her victory further consolidated her status in sport
of athletics and the American sprinter thus became the first women
sprinter to defend the title in 100m dash.
</P>
<P>
Jones, remaining unbeaten in the past two years, equalled the
fifth fastest time ever and only the world record holder Florence
Griffith Joyner and Jones, herself, have ever run faster.
</P>
<P>
Her teammate Inger Miller, who had a false start in the final,
took the silver medal at 10.79 and Ekaterini Thanou of Greece had
the bronze at 10.84.
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian Zhanna Tarnopolskaya-Pintusevich, who won the silver
in the 100 meter and gold for the 200 two years ago in Athens, was
fourth in 10.95.
</P>
<P>
Two times Olympic champion Gail Devers of the United States was
fifth in the same time as Pintusevich ahead of European champion
Christine Arron of France.
</P>
<P>
Jones could not keep her joy for the victory and sent kisses to
her husband, C.J. Hunter, who let out a huge roar from the stands
after she crossed the finish line. Hunter won the men's shot put
title Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The former basketball player in Seville is aiming at an
unprecedented four titles including the 200m, one of the relays
and long jump, which she had qualified for Monday's final.
</P>
<P>
In the men's event, Greene, who made his name at the Athens
championships by defeating Canadian Dorovan Bailey to win the 100m
two years ago, held off a strong challenge from Canada's Brunny
Surin to retain the title.
</P>
<P>
The fastest runner trailed Surin for the first half of the race,
but he sped up in the final 50 meters and stormed past Surin at
the finish line.
</P>
<P>
Surin took the silver at 9.84 and Dwain Chambers of Britain was
third in a career best of 9.97.
</P>
<P>
As soon as he crossed the line, Greene had a glimpse on the
timing board and only at this time could he realize how close his
time he has clocked to setting a new world record.
</P>
<P>
He shook his head and kneeld on the track, holding his head in
his hands for a moment. Once he stood up, he showed to the crowds
a glamarous smiling and looked up at his training partner Ato
Boldon in the stands. He then had a victorious jumping and walking
around the track with the American flag.

Eunice Barber captured the title of the women's heptathlon at the
7th World Athletics Championships here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Barber, who became a French citizen in February this year,
collected 6,861 points for the title.
</P>

1995 World Championships and 1996 Olympic Games, won the bronze
with a total of 6,500 points.
</P>
<P>
"fter the shot competition, despite my poor performance I still
felt happy because y philosophy is always to keep going until the
end," Barber said.
</P>
<P>
Lewis said: "I've put everything I had into this competition.
It's been an up and down two days but I think generally, while I
won't say I'm happy, the highlights have been high and the lows
have been low.
</P>
<P>
"This competition shows my competitive abilities. They were
never in doubt but it's good to reconfirm them after so many
injuries."
</P>
<P>
Shouaa, who has been plagued with injuries since 1996 Olympics,
said: "With all my injury problems coming here and winning the
bronze is like winning the gold for me personally. Now I can
concentrate on Sydney."

<P>
SEVILLE, August 22 (Xinhua) -- American sprinter Marion Jones
set the fastest time this year at 10.70 seconds when she became
the first women runner to retain her 100m title at the World
Championships in Seville on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old, who is undefeated in the 100m since 1997, said:
"I nailed my start today. That was perhaps the reason that I
pulled off the victory.
</P>
<P>
"I put it all together today and executed my race."
</P>
<P>
Another American Inger Miller won silver in 10.79 seconds and
Ekaterini Thanou of Greece claimed bronze at 10.84.
</P>
<P>
With the time, Jones also set a new championship record, 0.06
seconds faster than her old mark - as her massive husband CJ
Hunter cheered her from the stands.
</P>
<P>
The hotly-tipped American athlete has now completed the first
leg of her attempt to win an unprecedented four world golds, in
the 100m, 200m, long jump and 4x100m relay.
</P>
<P>
Jones's continued form is all the more amazing considering she
was nearly lost to professional basketball.
</P>
<P>
But two broken legs - one of which required a permanent metal
screw - turned her back to sprinting in 1996.

SEVILLE, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Maurice Greene successfully
retained his 100m title with a blistering run in the men's final
at the World Championships in Seville on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The American never looked in doubt - even when he appeared to
stumble from the blocks. He simply blew the field away with a new
championship record of 9.80 seconds.
</P>
<P>
"I missed a step, but I didn't panic," said Greene.
</P>
<P>
"I kept control of myself and just took it easy. I knew I would
come back at the end....the main thing is to have fun out there
and to please the fans and I believe I did that," he added.
</P>
<P>
Bruny Surin of Canada took silver with a time of 9.84 seconds,
while 21-year-old Briton Dwain Chambers - the youngest runner in
the field - set a new personal best with a run of 9.97 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Greene's time was just 0.01 off his world record set at the
last championships in Athens.
</P>
<P>
When he saw how little he had missed the mark by, he said: "
Damn" and kneeled on the track, holding head in his hands for a
moment.
</P>
<P>
After he stood up again, what he brought to the crowds was a
joyful face and glamrous smiling. He then looked up at his
training partner Ato Boldon in the stands before setting off a
victorious trek around the track with the American flag.

<HEADLINE> S. African Ruling Alliance Intact: Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The tripartite alliance
among the African National Congress (ANC), the Congress of South
African Trade Unions (Cosatu) and the South African Communist
Party remains intact despite disputes between the ANC and Cosatu,
party officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the ANC-led government and Cosatu appeared
tense as the country enters a period of active industrial action
led by Cosatu.
</P>
<P>
However, both ANC National Chairman Patrick Lekota and Cosatu
Secretary- General Zwelinzima Vavi told state television that the
alliance remains strong.
</P>
<P>
"The alliance is very, very strong. As a matter of fact, South
Africa has no history, no future without the alliance," Lekota
told the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) television
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
Vavi, in his turn, said: "I agree with that absolutely. We
committed to the alliance."
</P>
<P>
He said a special congress of Cosatu this week reconfirmed the
long-held position that the alliance must be continued and
strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Lekota criticized Cosatu for the "lack of revolutionary
discipline" at the special congress. He chided the alliance
partner for publicly criticizing the government.
</P>
<P>
Lekota, however, told the television Sunday that disputes
between his party and Cosatu are tactical. Both parties agree on
the general objective of deepening democracy in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"The question of differences of opinion in the alliance is not
new whatsoever. It has been there over the decades since it was
founded," Lekota said.
</P>
<P>
He said a consensus position is not necessarily a unanimous
position and that debate on tactics can be "healthy and welcome".
</P>
<P>
"There must continue to be people who are maybe not happy about
that (position). They review that, they raise criticisms, they put
forward new suggestions. That is all that is happening. It is a
perfectly healthy exercise."
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment on new Cosatu President Willy Madisha's
remarks that socialism is the only solution for South Africa's
problems, Lekota said the ANC is a broad liberational organization
and it is "not specifically committed to socialism".
</P>
<P>
Vavi said his organization knew from the very beginning of the
alliance that the ANC and Cosatu had different ideas. He said the
ANC was neither anti- nor pro-socialist.

<HEADLINE> Tears in Quake Victims' Graveyard </HEADLINE>

ISTANBUL, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Yeni Kanarya Cemetery, located
in western Istanbul, was not very big. But after the killer
earthquake struck northwest Turkey early Tuesday, its enclosing
walls were torn open by the municipal authority for an
enlargement.
</P>
<P>
Yeni Kanarya was expanded to accommodate those who had perished
in Tuesday's quake which ripped through populous provinces by the
Marmara Sea in northwest Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Over 12,000 people have been confirmed dead in the quake,
registered at 7.4 degrees on the Richter scale. In Istanbul,
Turkey's largest city which straddles Asia and Europe, about 980
lives were claimed.
</P>
<P>
In Yeni Kanarya Sunday, we counted 125 graves containing quake
victims. Their names were painted on the grave tablets or
tombstones.
</P>
<P>
A bulldozer was busy digging new graves, all 1.5 meters deep
with a north-south direction.
</P>
<P>
About one hour after we had arrived, hearses of quake victims
began driving in, accompanied by wailing families and friends.
</P>
<P>
Philis, a 24-year-old Kurdish woman, threw herself onto the
ground in front of three graves, lying side by side, as her
relatives opened three crudely-made coffins and were going to lay
three bodies, wrapped in white cloth according to Muslim
tradition, down into the graves.
</P>
<P>
"Dear father, mother, and brother, why are you gone in such a
hurry? Why don't you wait for me?" she cried.
</P>
<P>
While leaving the cemetery supported by her relatives with
hands, Philis, who had fainted three times crying, looked back
over and again and moaned: "Dear father, mother, brother, I will
come back to see you often. Please rest in peace."
</P>
<P>
Lying on a covered grave, an anguished woman was crying her
heart out in the bereavement of her daughter and son-in-law. A
girl was weeping for her elder sister and brother-in-law.
</P>
<P>
Relatives of a perished couple, which left behind them two
children, 9 and 4, were throwing rice on the grave, hoping that
birds would stop over here and eat the rice, thus bringing the
souls of the dead to heaven.
</P>
<P>
Stench of corpses, which were fast decaying in the sweltering
heat, came pouring out of the coffins once the covers were opened.
The whole cemetery was filled with the nauseating mixed smell of
decayed bodies and disinfectants.
</P>
<P>
Similar scenes could be seen in other graveyards in the
quake-hit areas. Many unidentified corpses, wrapped in bed cloth
or blankets, were carried into tombs without a gravestone.
