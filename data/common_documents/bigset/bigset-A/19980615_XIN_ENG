<HEADLINE> Japan, U.S. Must Do More to Help Asia Out of Crisis: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, Chief Executive of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) has urged
Japan and the United States to do more to help stabilize the
troubled Asian economies.
</P>
<P>
In an address to the Asia Australia Institute in Sydney Sunday
night, the visiting chief executive said Japan, as the largest
economy in Asia and the second largest in the world, "must do more
to help stabilize the region by maintaining positive growth and
stability in the yen."
</P>
<P>
"The recent dramatic fall in the value of the yen is very
damaging, not just to Asia but to the economy around the world,"
Tung told a high-powered audience of about 200 businessmen and
politicians, including former prime ministers G. Whitlam and Bob
Hawke.
</P>
<P>
"I know we in Hong Kong and the leaders in Beijing have been
urged by many around the world to maintain stability of our
currencies," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There needs to be similar urgency in stabilizing the yen," he
added.
</P>
<P>
"In addition to economic stimulus packages, the Japanese
Government must urgently come out with credible policies in the
reform and liberalization of her banking sector," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The (Asian) financial crisis cannot be solved by official
funds alone. The IMF (International Monetary Fund) must provide
funding and conditionality, in combination with voluntary
rollovers by private sector banks."
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, there is still U.S. legislative reluctance to
provide capital to the IMF."
</P>
<P>
"Now is not the time not to provide adequate water to the
global fireman," he said.
</P>
<P>
On other essential conditions for an Asian recovery from the
current crisis, Tung said, "there must be clear signs that the
Asian economies are generating trade surpluses, instead of
deficits."
</P>
<P>
He said the stability of the (Chinese currency) Renminbi and
the Hong Kong dollar must be maintained as the anchors of currency
stability in Asia.
</P>
<P>
"No one should doubt the tremendous sacrifice that both Hong
Kong and the mainland of China are bearing to prevent the problems
of currency depreciation from escalating," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said: "everyone in Asia must press ahead with reforms to cut
out the inefficiencies and post-bubble effects that led to the
Asian crisis".
</P>
<P>
Tung, who arrived in Australia Sunday morning for a three-day
visit to Sydney and Melbourne, also spoke about how Hong Kong had
coped with the turmoil through its strong financial position, the
determination to defend the HK-U.S. dollar link.
</P>
<P>
During his address, the chief Executive also briefed the
audience about Hong Kong's first year as a Special Administrative
Region of China, and the successful implementation of the "One
Country, Two Systems" concept.
</P>
<P>
Tung is scheduled to meet Australian Prime Minister John
Howard, Deputy Prime Minister and Trade Minister Tim Fischer,
Finance Minister John Fahey and some state government leaders.
</P>
<P>
Tung will end his visit to Australia on Wednesday and fly from
Melbourne to New Zealand for a three-day visit.

<P>
TOULOUSE, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Japanese head coach Takeshi Okada
said he was disappointed about his team's 1-0 defeat to Argentina in
their first ever World Cup match.
</P>
<P>
"The defeat by just one goal, we can accept that as a fact of
life. But I really regret that we have ended up without any goals,
regardless of whether we won or lost." said Okada.
</P>
<P>
Okada said:"The players were positive and aggressive and I
really feel very disappointed that we couldn't score at all."
</P>
<P>
"We all know that Argentina are stronger than us but we always
think that we had a chance of winning or drawing," said Okada,
"(But) in the world cup, the result is all that matters. In that
sense we were unfortunate."
</P>
<P>
Okada's Argentine counterpart Daniel Passarella was happy with
the win.
</P>
<P>
"We are very satisfied because it is important to win the first
match and it is always difficult." Passarella said.
</P>
<P>
"I feel satisfied, but not completely, because we could have
improved some things." said Passarella.
</P>
<P>
Passarella said:"I think that the Japanese team have changed
their tactics from the qualifying round. Maybe they were not
offensive enough in this match."

<HEADLINE> Hamas Refuses Offer to Join PNA Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Hamas founder and spiritual
leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin has turned down an offer to join the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA), Hamas leaders in Gaza were
quoted as saying Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Media and Communication Center (JMCC), an East
Jerusalem-based Palestinian news service, reported that Yassin
announced his rejection Sunday in Sudan, where he is waiting for
Israeli permission to return to Gaza from a regional tour.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Sunday, a Palestinian officials confirmed to Xinhua
that PNA President Yasser Arafat has asked Hamas - the militant
Islamic Resistance Movement - to join the PNA Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
To have political talks with the PNA is one thing, Yassin said,
but to join the PNA cabinet is not in line with Hamas policy.
</P>
<P>
The JMCC quoted unnamed Hamas leaders in Gaza as saying that
Yassin would inform Arafat at a scheduled meeting next week of his
decision.
</P>
<P>
Hamas strongly opposes the Oslo peace accords signed between
Israel and the Arafat-led Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO),
and has launched scores of suicide bombings in Israel since the
current Israeli-Palestinian peace process began in 1993.
</P>
<P>
It has rejected previous offers to join the PNA self-rule
government and boycotted Palestinian elections in 1996, stressing
that its only goal is to destroy Israel through armed struggle.
</P>
<P>
PNA Cabinet Secretary Tayeb Abdel Rahim clarified in Gaza
Sunday that Hamas and other Palestinian political parties are
invited to hold consultations only on the current political
developments in the territories, not on their participation in the
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will start a four-day dialogue next Tuesday with leaders
of other political factions to discuss national reconciliation and
the peace process. The PLO's Executive Committee will later
evaluate the results of such consultations, Rahim said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will listen to the parties' comments and views on the
PNA's past performance, future improvement of the PNA work, as
well as the planned reshuffle of PNA Cabinet, he added.
</P>
<P>
The PNA has forwarded Arafat's request to the Hamas officials
in Gaza on Saturday, saying Arafat planned to meet Hamas leaders
as part of a wide-ranging effort across the Palestinian political
spectrum on forming a new government.
</P>
<P>
Arafat agreed at a meeting of the PLO Executive Committee in
Gaza on Thursday to shuffle his cabinet. The decision came days
ahead of a June 15 deadline set by the Palestinian Legislative
Council (PLC) for Arafat to reform his administration over alleged
corruption and misrule or face a no-confidence vote in the PLC.
</P>
<P>
Arafat requested on Saturday the PLC to delay the no-confidence
vote for 10 days to allow him time for broad talks on reshuffling
his Cabinet, which PLO officials said could take place on June
25.

ANKARA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Rebels of the outlawed Kurdish

<HEADLINE> GCC Oil Ministers to Meet For Oil Price Hikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Oil ministers of the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) member states will gather in Saudi
capital Riyadh Tuesday to discuss ways of bolstering oil prices,
GCC General Secretariat announced Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming meeting comes amid moves by members and
non-members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC) to slash oil production to shore up prices on world markets.
</P>
<P>
The ministers will assess the current situation and decide what
measures will be taken accordingly in view of another round of oil
production cut spearheaded by Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and non-OPEC
Mexico, reported Kuwait News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The three countries clinched a deal on June 4 to further slash
their output by 450,000 barrels per day (bpd) from July 1 to
improve the still sluggish oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Their first try was a deal in March to reduce their production
in order to trim world oil supply by 1.6 million to 2 million bpd
as oil prices slumped to a nine-year low.
</P>
<P>
The move was followed by the OPEC decision to cut 1.25 million
bpd starting from April 1 till the end of the year. But the world
market was little moved by the cut.
</P>
<P>
The GCC, a regional political and economic alliance, groups six
Arab countries - Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman and
the United Arab Emirates - whose economy depends heavily on oil
earnings.
</P>
<P>
The GCC ministers will also discuss a string of joint projects,
including natural gas network, and explore ways to boost gas trade
with European Union member states.

BAGHDAD, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Iraq and the U.N. Special
Commission (UNSCOM) held another two rounds of talks on Sunday in
a bid to work out a program of priority tasks that Iraq should
fulfill before the sanctions can be lifted.
</P>
<P>
The two sides had held two rounds of talks on Saturday, but
both sides refused to comment on the outcome of their talks.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz and UNSCOM Chairman
Richard Butler headed their respective teams during these
talks. No details are available.
</P>
<P>
Butler arrived here Thursday and will leave on Monday. He said
at Thursday's press conference that Iraq has not provided adequate
information on its biological weapons program and that access to
information will be the main task for Iraq to fulfill.
</P>
<P>
However, Iraqi National Assembly (parliament) Speaker Saadoun
Hammadi on Saturday accused UNSCOM of pursuing a procrastination
policy, warning that U.N. inspections in Iraq would not be
endless, and that they would be resisted by Iraqi people and all
Arabs.

<HEADLINE> Iran Raps Israeli Activities in East Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Sunday condemned recent
Israeli settlement activities in the occupied East Jerusalem as a
desecration of Islamic holy places, the official news agency IRNA
reported.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi accused "the
Zionist regime (Israel)" for ignoring international regulations to
begin digging up the holy places in Jerusalem in order to build a
new settlement.
</P>
<P>
On June 8, a group of religious Jewish students moved into two
buildings in the Silwan neighborhood located in the Muslim Quarter
of East Jerusalem and triggered clashes with Palestinian residents.
</P>
<P>
The buildings were reportedly purchased by a extremist Jewish
organization, which is engaged in taking over Arab houses and land
in East Jerusalem through purchases in an attempt to Judaize the
city. A new settlement has been planned on the site.
</P>
<P>
But Israeli Antiquities Authorities announced Saturday the
discovery of remains of a medieval wall at the site, near the
Herod's Gate. It said the settlement construction should be
delayed at least for several months pending archeological diggings.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said Israeli actions to expand settlements indicated
the "aggressive and expansionist nature of the Zionist regime and
its illegitimate practices in the occupied Palestine."
</P>
<P>
He said this was proof that Israel is "the cause of the tension
and instability in the region." He added that Iran strongly
opposes any actions to change the traditional appearance of
Jerusalem, the third holy Islamic sites, after Mecca and Medina in
Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi urged the international community and Islamic states
to adopt measures to seriously deal with Israel over the issue,
warning that the absence of a serious response would "stimulate
the illegitimate greed of the Zionists in their unlawful wishes."

BAGHDAD, June 14 (Xinhua) -- A funeral procession was held
Sunday for 43 Iraqi children who died as a result of food and
medicine shortages arising from the U.N. sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Head of Iraqi Association for Children Support, Sultan
Ash-Shawi, told reporters that over 1.5 million Iraqis, mostly
children, have died since the sanctions began seven years ago
after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Ash-Shawi urged the international community to work for
lifting the sanctions to bring an end to Iraqi people's sufferings.
</P>
<P>
A memo of protest, addressed in the name of bereaved families
to the U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, denounced as "vicious
crime" against Iraqi children the U.S. action to keep the
sanctions in place.
</P>
<P>
People from all walks of life, including religious dignitaries,
took part in the funeral.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest statistics released by Iraqi Health
Ministry, nearly 5,000 Iraqi children under age five died in May
due to severe shortages of food and medicine.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Official Stresses Boosting Palestinian Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 14 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.S. official said
here Sunday that improving the economic situation in the
Palestinian self-rule areas is good for the regional stability.
</P>
<P>
Before meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
United States Undersecretary of State for Economic Affairs Stuart
Eizenstat stressed that a better economic situation in the
territories is also in line with the security interests of Israel.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. feels the Palestinian economy is "on the
rise" since more Palestinians have been allowed to work in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said about 110,000 legal and illegal Palestinian
laborers are currently working in Israel. Every year, the
Palestinian workers inject millions of dollars into the fledgling
Palestinian economy, which is dominated by Israel and often
suffers from Israeli closure of the borders.
</P>
<P>
But Netanyahu rejected the charges that Israel has restrained
the economic growth of the Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
He said his government has made efforts to help the
Palestinians advance their economy, noting that the year 1998 is
expected to be the best year for the economic growth in the
Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
Eizenstat, who arrived in Israel on Friday, will discuss with
Netanyahu the economic development in the region. He is also
expected to update Netanyahu on his latest report regarding the
Jewish gold, which was plundered by the Nazis and laundered in
Switzerland in World War II.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Returns to World Soccer Stage with Win over Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAINT-ETIENNE, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia returned to the World
Cup finals here on Sunday with a 1-0 win over Iran in Group F after
being left for six years in soccer wilderness.
</P>
<P>
Sinisa Mihajlovic, a free kick expert who plays for Italian club
Sampdoria, blasted a curvy, booming free kick from 25 meters towards
the goal 28 minutes into the second half.
</P>
<P>
Iranian goaltender Nima Nakisa dived in the right direction but
could not stop the ball flying into the bottom of net.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Ali Daei, with German Bundesliga side Arminia Bielefeld,
almost equalized with a header in the 41st minute but the ball was
captured by Yugoslavian keeper Ivica Kralj.
</P>
<P>
The two teams played totally different styles, with the Yugoslavs
advancing slowly looking for killing shots and the Iranians featuring
speedy counter-attacks masterminded by playmaker Mehdi Mahdavikia.
</P>
<P>
Defender Goran Djorovic nearly opened account for the Balkan nation
when his 15th-minute header hit the bar and another from midfielder
Slavisa Jokanovic in the 29th minute also brought scare to Nakisa
before soaring over the bar.
</P>
<P>
But after the opening 30 minutes, the Yugoslva offences were almost
totally thwarted by a well-organized Iranian defence, which heavily
marked Predrag Mijatovic of Real Madrid.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia had been left out in soccer wilderness for six years
because of civil strifes, missing the last two European Championships
in 1992 and 1996, and the last World Cup finals in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Peruvian referee Alberto Tejada Noriega showed yellow cards to
Yugoslavia's Zeljko Petrovic and captain Dragan Stojkovic during the
game held in Stade Geoffroy-Guichard.

<HEADLINE> Erekat Urges Pressure to Stop Israel's Illegal Acts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian chief negotiator
Saeb Erekat has called on the parties concerned to pressure Israel
to stop all its illegal acts that could further devastate the
deadlocked peace process.
</P>
<P>
Erekat made this call in a letter sent Sunday from Cairo to
Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh, U.S. peace envoy Dennis
Ross, European Union peace envoy Miguel Moratinos, U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan and a number of European and Asian leaders,
according to Jerusalem-based Palestinian news service JMCC.
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Erekat, also minister of local government of
the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), said that the illegal
Israeli actions in land confiscation, home demolition and murder
of Palestinians will have serious repercussions that would further
harm the deadlocked Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
He also urged Israel to revoke the decisions to form armed
militias in the settlements and the declaration Thursday to
upgrade the settlement of Ariel, located between Ramallah and
Nablus in the West Bank, into a city.
</P>
<P>
Several Palestinians have recently been stabbed to death in
East Jerusalem and other settlements. Since the beginning of this
month Israeli forces have demolished 34 Palestinan houses in the
PNA-controlled areas and East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
All these acts are considered as a dangerous development,
Erekat said in his letter.
</P>
<P>
All these activities were planned by the Israeli government for
the purpose of destroying the peace process and the international
community must intervene immediately, he said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Army Central Commander Uzi Dayan signed an order
Thursday for setting up civilian guards at Jewish settlements in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip to ensure the safety of the
settlers. Such forces will be operational within the next few
weeks first at the larger settlements including Ariel.
</P>
<P>
Erekat was in Cairo, accompanying PNA Chairman Yasser Arafat on
his visit to Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Women to Fight Domestic Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzania Media Women's
Association (TAMWA) will hold a week-long course on domestic
violence against women in Dar es Salaam starting Monday.
</P>
<P>
The course has come at a time when domestic violence cases
have increased tremendously, said the TAMWA Director Leila Sheikh
Hashim over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Hashim told the press in the city that 80 representatives from
TAMWA-run victim centers will take part in the course. It will be
opened by ambassador Gertrude Mongella, a well-known woman
activist.
</P>
<P>
According to a research made by TAMWA, the number of clients
in the centers have increased from an average of 30 to 120.
</P>
<P>
She said TAMWA plans to mobilize communities all over the
country to establish victim centers which will be responsible for
offering legal and other assistances to victims of domestic
violence.
</P>
<P>
TAMWA has assisted more than 180 victims of domestic violence
since September 1997. A survey conducted by the organization
shows that over the last six years, there were 1,992 reported
cases of domestic violence in the form of battery, threats and
use of abusive language.
</P>
<P>
A United States expert on gender violence and victim support
Colleen McGrath will facilitate the training program.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese PM to Visit U.S. on Israeli Pullout Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri is to pay an official visit to the United States Monday, to
focus on the Israeli proposal for a conditional withdrawal from
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Hariri will hold talks with U.S. President
Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright over the
lastest developments in the region, especially the Israeli offer,
the Orient Radio here reported.
</P>
<P>
On April 1, Israel decided to endorse for the first time in two
decades the United Nations resolution 425 calling for it to
withdraw troops from south Lebanon. But it conditioned the pullout
on Lebanese government's cooperation in security arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a 1,100-square-kilometer border strip in
southern Lebanon as the so-called Security Zone in 1985 in an
attempt to prevent cross-border guerrilla attacks. Anti-Israeli
guerrilla forces, especially the Iranian-backed Hezbollah (Party
of God), have been fighting to oust the Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon flatly rejected the Israeli offer, insisting that the
withdrawal must be carried out unconditionally as stipulated in
the U.N. resolution.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and the U.N. have welcomed the Israeli offer,
describing it as a "positive step" toward a resolution of the
long-running south Lebanon occupation.
</P>
<P>
Albright has also sent a message to Lebanese Foreign Minister
Fares Boueiz, urging Beirut to positively consider the Israeli
offer.
</P>
<P>
Hariri's visit to the U.S. is part of an international campaign
launched jointly by Lebanon and its powerful ally Syria to
confront so-called Israeli "manoeuvre."
</P>
<P>
Boueiz has already summoned ambassadors of the five permanent
members of the U.N. Security Council in Beirut to explain
Lebanon's stance on rejecting the Israeli withdrawal offer.
</P>
<P>
Syria, which has 40,000 troops deployed as peacekeepers in
Lebanon, is seeking a comprehensive deal which demands a
simultaneous Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights captured
from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in the U.S., Hariri will also go to New York to
meet U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to discuss the Israeli
pullout plan as well as Lebanon's position in the stalled Middle
East peace process.

<HEADLINE> Vitamin K Exerts Cancer-Killing Effects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Scientists at the University of
Pittsburgh have discovered how a novel form of vitamin K can exert
its cancer-killing effects in primary liver cancers, according to
The Journal of Biological Chemistry.
</P>
<P>
"One of the attractive features of this unique compound is that
it appears to stop cancer cell growth without producing toxicity.
We now are testing this compound against cancers in rats, and
given positive results, we hope to begin clinical trials of this
agent within two years," said Brian Carr, professor and director
of the Liver Center at the University of Pittsburgh Cancer
Institute.
</P>
<P>
The Pittsburgh research team found that a vitamin K analog, Cpd
5 blocks the activity of an important group of enzymes called
protein-tyrosine phosphatases inside liver cancer cells. These
enzymes normally add small molecules called phosphate groups to
selected proteins inside cells. The altered proteins, called
tyrosine phosphorylated proteins, are known to trigger a variety
of activities within cells. They exert anti-cancer effects but
inducing the shutdown and subsequent death of a cell, commonly
referred to as programmed cell death.
</P>
<P>
Liver cancer is thought to be one of the three commonest
cancers worldwide. The disease caused about 15,000 U.S. death in
1997 alone. Major causes of this cancer include infection with
either hepatitis B or C or chronic alcohol consumption.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Italian presidential envoy
Rino Aerri arrived here Sunday to mediate in the Ethio-Eritrean
border crisis.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said here that the visiting Italian envoy
went immediately into a closed-door meeting with Ethiopian
leaders after his arrival here from Asmara, capital of the state
of Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
No statement was made here after the meeting between Aerri
and Ethiopia Premier Meles Zenawi.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from Asmara, Eritrean President Isaias
Afwerki told the Italian envoy earlier Sunday that Eritrea is
ready for face-to-face talks with Ethiopia to seek an end to
the border war with its neighbor.
</P>
<P>
Aerri arrived in Asmara Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
The Italian envoy is reported to propose that both Ethiopia and
Eritrea de-escalate their conflict, cease all air strikes and
start negotiations to seek a peaceful solution to their border
conflict.
</P>
<P>
Addis announced Sunday to have killed or wounded more than
10,990 Eritrean soldiers in three-day ground fighting from June
9 to 11.
</P>
<P>
The border dispute between the two Horn of African countries
turned violent since May when either side accused the other of
invasion.
</P>
<P>
Their dispute centered on a rocky 400 square km triangle of
border land which both countries claim.

<TEXT>
<P>
SAINT-ETIENNE, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Iran's campaign in the soccer
World Cup will not be affected by the loss to Yugoslavia and the squad
will "fight to the last", said head coach Jalal Talebi here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We played a fair game and did our best," said Talebi. "There was
nothing shameful in this game for us."
</P>
<P>
"Our mission is not finished, we have to play against the United
States and Germany ahd we know they will be hard games," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Each game has a different meaning for us but we will fight to a
standstill. If we are going to go down, then we will go down fighting.
We will fight to the last," Talebi said.
</P>
<P>
Talebi standed by goalkeeper Nima Nakisa, saying he was happy with
his goalie overall.
</P>
<P>
"He is still very young and if we lost today it was because of the
inexperience throughout the team not just him," Talebi said.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav coach Slobodan Santrac was not satisfied with the team's
performance despite the victory on a free kick converted by Sinisa
Mihajlovic in the 73rd minute.
</P>
<P>
"I am happy with the fact that we won but I am not satisfied with
the performance of my team," he said. "Before the game I told my
players that Iran was a strong side but nobody believed me."
</P>
<P>
He added, "Iran played exactly as we expected them to but my
players did not do what they ought to have done."
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavian player Slavisa Jokanovic said, "It was a very difficult
game, they defended very, very tightly and it was difficult to ge
through. We were really lucky to get these three points."

<HEADLINE> Burundi Factions Delegates Arrive for Arusha </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ARUSHA, Tanzania, June 14 (Xinhua)-- The Burundi government
and the opposition factions, for the first time since Major
Pierre Buyoya took power two years ago, sent delegates
here on Sunday afternoon to take part in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, Rwandan President Pasteur
Bizimungu, and Zambian Vice President Christon Tembo also led
their delegations to attend the opening session of the talks
scheduled for Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Burundi delegation said that some 50
delegates had came here from Bujumbura.
</P>
<P>
"President Buyoya will come here tomorrow morning for the
meeting," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian officials said that Heads of State and Government
from Kenya, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Ethiopia as well
as from the host Tanzania will also be present at the session to
be held in Arusha.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks will be hosted by Tanzania's former President
Julius Nyerere, who has been facilitating the conflicts between
the Burundi government and the oppositions since July 1996 when
the above mentioned seven east and central African countries
imposed economic sanctions on Bujumbura after Major Buyoya
toppled a civilian government led by President Sylvester
Ntibantunganya.
</P>
<P>
Late last month, Nyerere met in Dar es Salaam separately with
all the Burundi factions leaders including the Speaker of the
National Assembly Leonce Ngendaknmana, former Presidents
Jean-Baptiste Bagaza and Ntibantunganya, chairman of the Front
pour la Democratie an Burundi (FRODEBU) Jean Minani, and Chairman
of the National Council for Defense and Democracy (CNDD) Leonard
Nyangoma as well as Buyoya.
</P>
<P>
They discussed all the preparations for the Arusha peace
talks, whose success may lead to an early lifting of the economic
sanctions on Burundi which has been imposed since August, 1966.
</P>
<P>
As a gesture to the calls by sanctions imposers to ease the
internal tension, Buyoya, an ethnic Tutsi, signed a new
transitional constitution, and named two vice presidents
including an ethnic Hutu leader of the main opposition party last
week, to replace the original premier.
</P>
<P>
More than 150,000 people, mostly civilians, have died in
bloody conflicts between the ethnic Hutu majority and the ruling
Tutsi minority since the assassination of Melchior Ndadaye, the
first president elected under a multiparty system in 1993.

<HEADLINE> France Opposed to Sanctions against Pakistan: Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The French Ambassador to
Pakistan, Yannick Gerard, said here Monday France was opposed to
the imposition of sanctions against Pakistan for its testing of
nuclear devices.
</P>
<P>
However, Gerard said it was very important that the world be
protected against the nuclear proliferation and it was for the
international community, particularly the big powers, to help
remove the conditions which impelled countries like Pakistan to go
nuclear even for the defense or settlement of outstanding issues.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release by the National Assembly
Secretariat, the French Envoy made the remarks during his talks
with Pakistan's Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly Jafar
Iqbal.
</P>
<P>
Gerard said that France was fully alive to the circumstances
which led Pakistan to undertake the recent nuclear tests and that
it was imperative for both India and Pakistan to settle their all
outstanding issues including the core issue of Kashmir peacefully
and through dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Iqbal said that all efforts initiated by Pakistan to have a
negotiated settlement of the core issue of Kashmir were frustrated
by India and it was after the inception of the new government in
India that Pakistan received serious threats from across the
border.
</P>
<P>
The Deputy Speaker highlighted the unfaltering demand of the
entire Pakistani nation to employ all possible options to ensure
security of the country and to live with dignity and honor as a
sovereign state in the sub-continent.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the continuing stance of Pakistan for peace and
security and appealed to the international community,
particularly, the big powers to come forward and help resolve the
core issue of Kashmir according to the relevant U.N. resolutions
and help defuse tension in the region.

<HEADLINE> India to Continue its Efforts to Resume Talks With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 15 (Xinhua) -- A Pakistani External Affairs
Ministry spokesman said here Monday that India would continue its
efforts to resume talks with Pakistan to resolve outstanding
issues between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Replying to question on the rejection of New Delhi's proposal
to hold foreign secretary level talks here on June 22 by
Islamabad, the spokesman said that India had made a "sincere
offer" to Pakistan for resuming bilateral talks in keeping with
the approach that a broad-based and sustained dialogue could
resolve outstanding issues.
</P>
<P>
Differences over modalities on mainly how to discuss the
Kashmir issue, the major dispute between India and Pakistan, at
the foreign secretary level's talks had created a stalemate last
Friday with Islamabad rejecting New Delhi's proposal for
resumption of talks here on June 22 and instead inviting Indian
foreign secretary to Pakistan for the dialogue on June 20.
</P>
<P>
The Indo-Pak talks had come to a standstill twice in 1994 and
1997 over the dispute of Kashmir issue. India has time and again
claimed that Kashmir is a part of its territory and it could not
be talked over while Pakistan maintained that the Kashmir issue is
a main dispute between the two countries. The ties of the two
countries could not be improved unless the Kashmir issue is
resolved.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a Pakistan high commission spokesman here
described as "pure speculation" a press report that the Pakistan
government would reduce its staff strength by 50 percent by the
first week of next month as part of an austerity drive to ward off
economic sanctions following its nuclear tests on May 28 and 30.

<HEADLINE> Butler to Brief Kuwaiti Leaders on Talks with Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Chief U.N. weapons inspector
Richard Butler arrived here Monday to brief Kuwaiti leaders on the
results of his mission with Iraq, Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival, Butler said "We have just come from very
important talks in Baghdad," during which he and Iraqi Deputy
Prime Minister Tariq Aziz agreed to a two-month work program as
"concrete steps" toward freeing Baghdad from U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
"I look forward to the opportunity to inform the senior
officials of the Kuwaiti government of what happened in these
talks and where we might go next," said Butler, chairman of the
United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) on disarming Iraq of
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on an Iraqi statement that visiting Kuwait was not
in his mandate, Butler said "Kuwait is a member state of the
United Nations and has an interest in the matter. It is completely
normal that I should come here and discuss these issues with
Kuwaiti government officials."
</P>
<P>
During his one-day visit here, Butler is scheduled to meet
Tuesday with the Kuwaiti Amir Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah,
Crown Prince and Prime Minister Sheikh Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Salem
Al-Sabah, and Parliament Speaker Ahmed Abdul Aziz Al-Sadoun.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Iraq and UNSCOM agreed to lay down a two-month
timetable to end U.N. disarmament activities in Iraq, a big stride
toward the lifting of the U.N. economic sanctions imposed on Iraq
seven years ago after its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
After their talks, Butler and Aziz told reporters that the two
sides would work together in the next two months and meet again in

<P>
Iraq and UNSCOM had been in a tug-of-war over weapons
inspections, which touched off a string of crises in the Gulf
region.
</P>
<P>
Iraq claims it has destroyed all the banned weapons in
compliance with the U.N. resolutions. But UNSCOM believes Baghdad
has not yet come clean in the areas of long-range missiles,
chemical and biological weapons, which dashed Iraq's hope to ease
the sanction when it was reviewed by the U.N. Security Council in
May.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council will allow the lifting of the
sanctions only after UNSCOM certifies that Iraq has scrapped all
its prohibited weapons.

Butler arrived in Baghdad last Thursday with a list of
obligations, known as "road map," that Iraq should fulfill, to
begin a fresh round of talks with Iraqi government.

Butler is due to deliver a regular report about his mission in
Iraq to the Security Council in October.

<HEADLINE> Attention: Correction: India to Continue its Efforts to Resume Talks With Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 15 (Xinhua) -- An External Affairs Ministry
spokesman said here Monday that India would continue its efforts
to resume talks with Pakistan to resolve outstanding issues
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Replying to question on the rejection of New Delhi's proposal
to hold foreign secretary level talks here on June 22 by
Islamabad, the spokesman said that India had made a "sincere
offer" to Pakistan for resuming bilateral talks in keeping with
the approach that a broad-based and sustained dialogue could
resolve outstanding issues.
</P>
<P>
Differences over modalities on mainly how to discuss the
Kashmir issue, the major dispute between India and Pakistan, at
the foreign secretary level's talks had created a stalemate last
Friday with Islamabad rejecting New Delhi's proposal for
resumption of talks here on June 22 and instead inviting Indian
foreign secretary to Pakistan for the dialogue on June 20.
</P>
<P>
The Indo-Pak talks had come to a standstill twice in 1994 and
1997 over the dispute of Kashmir issue. India has time and again
claimed that Kashmir is a part of its territory and it could not
be talked over while Pakistan maintained that the Kashmir issue is
a main dispute between the two countries. The ties of the two
countries could not be improved unless the Kashmir issue is
resolved.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a Pakistan high commission spokesman here
described as "pure speculation" a press report that the Pakistan
government would reduce its staff strength by 50 percent by the
first week of next month as part of an austerity drive to ward off
economic sanctions following its nuclear tests on May 28 and 30.

<TEXT>
<P>
MARSEILLE, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Tunisian coach Henri Kasperczak said
after their 2-0 loss to England here on Monday that the battle for a
place in the second round was not over.
</P>
<P>
He said, "For us the battle to enter the next round is not over
yet. We still have two games ahead. We will continue our campaign and
we still have chances."
</P>
<P>
He added, "This was a well-matched game. It was a true battle, but
the Englishmen were more effective. Conceding a goal near the end of
the first half was really difficult for us psychologically."
</P>
<P>
Kasperczak added, "We had played a good second half, but we had not
capitalized on several scoring chances."
</P>
<P>
The Tunisian coach was apparently impressed by the strength of the
English midfield which featured Paul Scholes, Paul Ince and Darren
Anderton.
</P>
<P>
"England had very fluent crossing in the midfield. They have very
good midfielders, which connected the ball well with the strikers."

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Vows No Yielding on National Interests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu vowed on Monday that nothing can change his positions on
issues concerning Israel's security and interests in dealing with
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that he is seeking a "total package" with the
Palestinians on the next troop redeployment in the West Bank and
further steps to advance the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made the remarks while talking to reporters at his
office after signing economic and telecommunications agreements
with visiting Bulgarian Foreign Minister Nadejda Nikolova, who
arrived here Sunday for a three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Asked about his reaction to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's
comments that he had "lost faith" in him, Netanyahu said he did
not mind what people says about him when it comes to the national
interests and security. He stressed that he would not change his
positions on those matters just because of other people's words.
</P>
<P>
Receiving Israeli opposition Labor Party's leader Ehud Barak in
Cairo Monday, Mubarak said that he has "received a lot of
promises" from Netanyahu but none of them has been fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak warned that if Israel can not reach an agreement on the
second redeployment with the Palestinians, the region could plunge
into a crisis. He urged Netanyahu to advance the peace process if
Israel does not want to damage the Israeli-Egyptian relations.
</P>
<P>
On the stalled talks on the second redeployment, Netanyahu said
the negotiations are focusing on a "total package" which would
combine the second and third stages of further withdrawal, and the
"Palestinian compliance with their obligations."
</P>
<P>
These echoed his remarks last week that the second pullback
agreement, if there is one, would be "the last agreement Israel
signs before the final status talks."
</P>
<P>
Reports said that Netanyahu has proposed combining the second
and third redeployment into a 15 percent troop withdrawal and then
entering into the permanent talks with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians interpreted Netanyahu's proposal as an attempt
to cancel or minimize the third redeployment which is stipulated
in the Hebron agreement signed in early 1997.
</P>
<P>
Since the U.S. has been urging Israel to accept a 13 percent
withdrawal in the second redeployment, Netanyahu's idea means that
the scope of the third pullback will be only 2 percent, which is
regarded by the Palestinian side as too marginal to be accepted.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the Israeli-Bulgarian relations, Netanyahu said
he is "very happy" to watch the successful reforms being
carried out in Bulgaria and he "sees no dispute" between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Nikolova expressed her satisfaction over bilateral relations,
saying she came to Israel to strengthen the traditional ties and
establish a partnership between the two countries.

PARIS, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The southern French metropolis of
Marseille is having two battlefields Monday afternoon: One at the
Velodrome Stadium where the English football team is playing their
Tunisian counterpart, another outside the stadium between the fans

<HEADLINE> Japan's Current Account Surplus Keeps Rising in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Japan's current account surplus rose
10.3 percent in April over the same period last year to 1.17
trillion yen (8.1 billion U.S. dollars), marking the thirteenth
straight month of increase, the Japanese Finance Ministry said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The rise in April, however, was the smallest in the past 13
months, signaling a slower rate of growth in the measurement and
this slow pace "is expected to remain in the months ahead,"
according to a Finance Ministry official.
</P>
<P>
The current account surplus increased because falling imports
outpaced the decline in exports, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Japan's exports fell for the first time in 33 months despite
the weakness of the yen against the U.S. dollar, but imports
declined more amid the stagnant economy, said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Exports in April edged down 2.4 percent compared with the same
month of last year to 4.21 trillion yen (28.8 billion dollars),
while imports fell by 13.8 percent to 2.85 trillion yen (19.5
billion dollars), a double-digit drop for the third consecutive
month.
</P>
<P>
Japan's exports to the United States and the European Union in
April marked a year-on-year expansion of 7.3 percent and 18.0
percent expansion respectively, but those to Asian countries fell
by 18.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
In goods and services trade, Japan posted a surplus of 726.3
billion yen (4.9 billion dollars), up 83.6 percent from a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
The surplus in merchandise trade grew 35 percent to 1.36
trillion yen (9.3 billion dollars), up for the thirteenth
consecutive month, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
In services trade, Japan posted a deficit of 632.4 billion yen
(4.3 billion dollars), up from a deficit of 610.5 billion yen (4.2
billion dollars) a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The current account measures the flow of goods and services, as
well as investment income and other monetary transfers.

CARDIFF, Britain, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Leaders from the 15
European Union (EU) countries began their summit in Cardiff,
Britain, on Monday morning focusing on reforms to revitalize the

</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who chaired the two-day
summit, told reporters that the Cardiff summit was designed to

"There is a growing consensus to say that the (European) Union
has no choice but to change if it wants to make a success of the
single currency and enlargement, if it wants to take on the
competition in global markets," Blair said.
</P>
<P>
The main task at Cardiff was to prepare the EU "for the
opportunities and challenges of the next century", Blair's
official spokesman told a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
The EU leaders would recommend broad economic guidelines and
discuss promoting employment and growth, as well as completing the
single market and encouraging small businesses, the spokesman said.

They would also discuss EU enlargement and institutional
reforms, and were expected to exchange views on the worsening

<HEADLINE> Food Shortage Becoming Serious in Southern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, June 15 (Xinhua) -- A serious food shortage is
affecting five regions in southern Somalia at the end of the
rainy season, a local organization said Monday.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the United Somalia Farmers Salvation, said
here Monday that the regions worst affected by famine and food
shortage are Bay, Bakol, Hiran, Middle and Lower Shabelle where
armed clashes, serious floods and less water have devastated the
crops of the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, Abdurahman Sidow Abdi, said that more than 60
percent of the farms have been destroyed by last year's unusual
heavy rains and floods after the two main rivers in Somalia had
destroyed 60,000 hectares of farmlands and all major food
reservoirs in Bay, Lower and Middle Jubba regions.
</P>
<P>
Unless something is done, Abdi said, the emerging food
shortage will bring about a general famine and the people will
detract from the main Somalia's economy generating resources of
farming and livestock.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the international community, non-governmental
organizations and the United Nations agencies to come out for
assisting the helpless Somali farmers.
</P>
<P>
Abdi said that less than 50 percent of the farmlands in
southern Somalia was cultivated this season after the water
levels of the rivers had lowered while hundreds of other small
and rain-fed farms were devastated by rats which exhumed the
sowed seeds.

<P>
The farmers who produce about 80 percent of Somalia's
essential crops such as the maize, sorghum and sesame are now on
the brink of total starvation and famine, following their
displacement by floods, or less water and plague of rats, said
Abdi.
</P>
<P>
The regional governor of Middle Shabelle, Nur Mohamed Shirbow,
confirmed last week that serious famine has hit his region.
</P>
<P>
The Rahanwein Resistance Army (RRA) said three people died for
famine near the town of Baidoa, the center of all conflicts
between Hussein Aidid's men and those of RRA last week.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people, mainly women and children, can be seen
now begging for food on the streets in Mogadishu where more
people are crowding in from the southern Somali regions,
especially Bay, middle and Lower Jubba which have been hit worst
by the recent natural disasters.

BEIJING, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese workers' annual incomes
averaged 6,470 yuan (about 855 US dollars) in 1997, up 1.1 percent
on a year-by-year basis, according to a report released here today
jointly by the State Statistics Bureau and the Ministry of Labor
and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
Wages for workers in urban areas last year climbed by 3.6
percent, while those for employees of state enterprises rose by
6.2 percent, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Big Fraud Unearthed in Uganda's Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan police have unearthed a
racket of defrauders who diverted Kampala City Council (KCC)
checks worth 180 million Uganda Shillings (150,000 U.S. Dollars)
to their own accounts.
</P>
<P>
According to a Monitor's Monday report, the defrauders had been
diverting KCC's checks destined for banking at Gold Trust Bank.
</P>
<P>
Police said that one man they had arrested but refused to give
his name for sake of the ongoing investigations was part of a big
racket at City Hall and he connived to defraud the financially
unstable council.
</P>
<P>
The ring had diverted the money on various
occasions after erasing the word "council" from Kampala city
council checks, and have replaced it with the word "courier",
said the report.
</P>
<P>
The big fraud was only discovered when KCC officials went to
withdraw money on the accounts to pay salaries.
</P>
<P>
Simon Muhumza, KCC's Public Relations Officer, explained that
it's not KCC the institution itself but some individuals
collaborating with criminals from outside KCC that had been
involved in or abetting the theft.
</P>
<P>
He said that a number of banks are involved in the racket of
clearing diverted checks.

<HEADLINE> England Beat Tunisia 2-0 in Group G Opener </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MARSEILLE, June 15 (Xinhua) -- England opened their World Cup
campaign with a 2-0 victory over Tunisia in the Group G opener at
Marseille on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The victory was marred by clashes between England fans, Tunisia
supporters and French police on the beach of Marseille.
</P>
<P>
The organisers asked the Tunisian supporters remain on the stand
of the Stade Velodorme for at least 15 minutes after the match when
the England fans take the time to leave the stadium.
</P>
<P>
The match itself was also tense with three yellow cards issued.
England had a slow start and took nearly 30 minutes to assume
advantage.
</P>
<P>
Alan Shearer looked sharp, Teddy Sheringham had a powerful shot
at the goal only blocked by Tunisian goal-keeper Chokri El Ouaer.
</P>
<P>
Shearer finally broke the deadlock as he headed home a free-kick
from Graeme Le Saux at the 42nd minute.
</P>
<P>
England continued their domination in the second half but failed
to score again until the 89th minute. Paul Scholes picked up a
loose ball just out of the area and beat the Tunisian defence line
and the goal-keeper with a right-footer to put England 2-0 ahead.
</P>
<P>
Scholes showed he was in brilliant form and had several attempts at
the goal denied by the Tunisian goal-keeper in the first half.
</P>
<P>
Teenager striker Michael Owen replaced Sheringham in the second
half but failed to make his mark in his first World Cup match.

<HEADLINE> China Releases Report on 1997 Employment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government announced
here today that the urban registered unemployment rate for 1997
was 3.1 percent, 0.1 of a percentage point higher than in the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, there were 5.768 million jobless
people in towns and cities who had been registered with their
local governments, according to a report released here today by
the Ministry of Labor and Social Security and the State Statistics
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
There were also 6.343 million workers laid off from
state-owned enterprises who had not found new jobs by the end
of 1997, the report added.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that at the end of 1997, China had a total
labor resource of 845.7 million people, among whom 696 million had
been provided with adequate work, including 146.684 million
workers and 26.69 million self-employed people in the urban areas.
</P>
<P>
Experts point out that China has an extremely large army of
surplus rural laborers, whose number exceeds 130 million even
according to conservative estimates.
</P>
<P>
Despite the massive layoffs in many loss-suffering state-owned
enterprises in recent years, the state sector remains the
predominant employer of China's urban residents.
</P>
<P>
Among China's 146.684 million urban workers, 107.659 million
worked in the state sector at the end of 1997, while another 28.17
million were employed by collective enterprises. Workers in the
non-public sector only totalled 10.855 million.
</P>
<P>
However, the report said that, compared with 1996, the number of
public sector employees in the cities decreased by more than 3.2
million in 1997, while the non-public sector hired nearly 1.5
million more people.
</P>
<P>
The year 1997 also witnessed the mushrooming of job placement
centers in various Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
The report said that there are currently more than 34,000
employment service institutions of various kinds across China,
which helped some 8.7 million people to find jobs and provided
vocational training for nearly three million people in 1997.
</P>
<P>
It added that the Re-employment Project carried out by
governments at all levels also helped more than 4.3 million
workers laid off from the state sector to find new employment
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The report also showed that by the end of 1997 the number of
retired workers nationwide totalled 33.5 million, an increase
of 1.39 million over 1996.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa, Russia to Enhance Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 15 (Xinhua) -- South Africa and Russia
Monday vowed to strengthen bilateral ties as their future as
custodians of the world's strategic mineral riches are
inextricably linked, South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
A lull in relations between the two belonged to the past and
the two countries should do everything in their power to elevate
their relations to a new level, Sergei Yastrzhembski, special
envoy for Russian President Boris Yeltsin, said in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting with South African Deputy Foreign Minister
Aziz Pahad, Yastrzhembski said that there had been a pause in the
relations between their two countries because the political
transition in Russia required undivided attention.
</P>
<P>
"Russia has now resumed speaking with a clear voice on
international issues," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pahad said that he hoped Yastrzhembski's visit will enable the
two countries to embark on decisive steps to extend bilateral
ties.
</P>
<P>
"South Africa and Russia possess the largest deposits of
strategic minerals in the world. Our futures are very linked.
What one does impacts on the other," Pahad said.
</P>
<P>
He said that a visit by Deputy President Thabo Mbeki to Russia
in September will give further impetus to the drive to strengthen
bilateral ties. Mbeki will be accompanied in the visit by Trade
and Industry Minister Alec Erwin and business leaders.
</P>
<P>
South Africa also has much to learn from Russia in the field
of technology, Pahad said, adding that Mbeki's visit will
hopefully result in economic, technical, cultural and other
agreements.
</P>
<P>
Yastrzhembski, who met Mbeki earlier in the day, said that
there were no differences in their discussion.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. Newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- The United Nations is opening a conference in Rome on Monday
to work out rules for an international court to prosecute crimes
against humanity. But issues of jurisdiction and accountability
are deeply contested.
</P>
<P>
-- The Asian financial crisis is spawning such desperation that
more people than ever seem willing to take grim or dangerous jobs
in sweatshops. Experts say the trend in Asia toward better working
conditions has sharply reversed, with workers competing for jobs
they would have scorned a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- Iraq and the U.N. Special Commission weapons inspectors
agreed Sunday on a two-month schedule of action on outstanding
disarmament work. Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler, who
came to Baghdad with a list of requirements to speed up final
verification of Iraq scrapping all its banned weapons, said the
two sides would meet again in 60 days.
</P>
<P>
-- The radical Palestinian groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad said
they would not join a new cabinet being set up by Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat. But Ismail Abu Shanab of Hamas said the
Muslim group had accepted an invitation to meet Arafat on Tuesday
when the Palestinian leader is to meet with political factions on
forming a new Palestinian Authority administration.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- The Yen's fall is frustrating the U.S.'s strategies for
Asia. But the booming U.S. economy is likely to keep the dollar
strong and the yen weak. Asian nations are stepping up pressure on
Japan as the yen's slide makes Japan's products more competitive
with other Asian countries' exports.
</P>
<P>
-- Clinton said a new tide of immigration threatens to divide
Americans unless they set aside the fear of foreigners and accept
the fact that there will be no majority race in the nation. The
president made the remarks at Portland State University in
Oregon.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Stock Exchange Unveils Strategic Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong
Monday (SEHK) announced a three-year strategic plan, which calls
for major changes to make the Hong Kong stock market
well-positioned for intense competition in the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
The plan, entitled "Positioning for a New Era," addresses two
concerns in the current stock market -- the low level of market
alignment and regulatory loopholes.
</P>
<P>
In this strategic plan for the years between 1998 and 2001, the
SEHK will develop a straight-through transaction process to create
better linkage between various institutions and systems in the
transaction chain and reduce cost, risk and delays.
</P>
<P>
The SEHK will also conduct a review of loopholes in the current
regulatory regime and make regulatory recommendations.
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive of the Exchange Alex Tsui said here Monday that
the rapid improvement on these two fronts will enhance the
Exchange's appeal to international investors, who are deeply
concerned about the cost and efficiency of transaction and
regulatory standards.
</P>
<P>
"The environment for the Exchange has become much more
challenging," said Tsui, who noted that the Hang Seng index has
gone down 50 percent from the peak of more than 16,000 points in
August last year and the Hong Kong bourse now ranks 12th rather
than 6th in the world in terms of market capitalization.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that it was more urgent than ever for Hong Kong to
strengthen its competitiveness and to satisfy demanding customers.
The new strategic plan will help Hong Kong deal with keen
competition and capitalize on opportunities for business growth,
Tsui added.
</P>
<P>
The SEHK is aimed at boosting its market capitalization to 6
trillion HK dollars (769 billion U.S. dollars) by the year 2000 by
listing 250 China-related companies.

ATHENS, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Two Greek soldiers died and another
was seriously injured as they were clearing land mines on the
country's northeastern border with Turkey on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The two soldiers, members of the Greek army's special mine
neutralizing squad, died instantly and the third was wounded in

post in Evros.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-three people have been killed in minefield accidents
along the Evros border in the past four years.
</P>
<P>
To prevent further accidental death or injuries, Greece has
begun fencing off the minefields along the Greek-Turkish border.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientist Invents New Fire-Extinguishing System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 15 (Xinhua) -- An automatic fire-extinguishing
system that does not need either electricity or manual labor has
been invented by a Chinese scientist, Piao Longkui.
</P>
<P>
The new system has been judged by a panel of experts from the
Ministry of Construction and the Ministry of Public Security as
capable of reducing over-reliance on fire engines and greatly
decreasing fire disasters.
</P>
<P>
The automatic fire detecting and fighting system is a
crystalization of 25 patented technologies owned by Piao, a
researcher at the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology. It
is produced by the Beijing Great Wall Sun Kwang Feed Water
Equipment Co., Ltd, a China-Republic of Korea joint venture.
</P>
<P>
The widespread use of electrical appliances and gas pipes in
modern life increases the potential for sporadic fires, and raises
an urgent demand for a fire-fighting system that reacts promptly
to fire disasters and quenches them at the earliest possible stage.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that China's current fire-extinguishing systems are
technically at the level common early in this century, while fire
hydrants and portable fire extinguishers are usually somewhat
complicated to operate for ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
They point out that fire engines which rush through heavy
traffic in cities usually arrive too late to save buildings which
are on fire.
</P>
<P>
A huge furniture shop in Southwestern Beijing caught fire on
May 6 and was burned to ashes despite the efforts of the crews of
more than 80 fire engines.
</P>
<P>
A report released today by the Ministry of Labor and Social
Security and the State Statistics Bureau says that fire poses as
great a threat to China as any other kind of disasters.
</P>
<P>
Last year, China saw over 140,000 fire disasters, excluding
those that took place in the forests and prairies, 3.8 times the
figure for the previous year. The fires caused direct economic
losses totalling 1.54 billion yuan, 49.5 percent more than in
1996.

<HEADLINE> Tung Chee Hwa On Asian Economic Crisis In Sydney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sydney, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Asia had not yet seen the worst of
the economic crisis and the next few quarters would become even
more painful for the region and its neighbors, said Tung Chee Hwa,
Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(HKSAR), Monday in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Tung, in an address to an international business luncheon, said
that the Asian economic turmoil had caused Hong Kong to experience
not only a higher interest rate and a downturn in tourism, but an
overall negative growth in the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
"The economy will be even more difficult in the next few
quarters," Tung told more than 300 audiences.
</P>
<P>
However, Tung remained confident about the prospects of Hong
Kong, saying when Hong Kong picks up the pieces, it would be much
happier, prosperous, healthier and fairer.
</P>
<P>
"We are going through a difficult period, but we will get
through it stronger and better than ever before," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Hong Kong would continue with its massive plan of
investment in capital infrastructure and education, specifically
in schools, information technology and the environment for the
future.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Tung called on the Japanese government to boost
the yen, saying the currency's dramatic fall was reigning the
financial turmoil and damaging economies throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
"We are all in this together, what we can do is to pursue the
Japanese government to get on with it," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The situation will get worse before it gets any better, that
is why I am here, to exchange views with the Australian
government."
</P>
<P>
Tung leaves for Melbourne Monday night and is due to deliver a
keynote address to the opening of the Australia Summit by Prime
Minister John Howard Tuesday.  Then, he will leave for New
Zealand on Wednesday morning to meet with Prime Minister Jenny
Shipley.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Aircraft Not Joining Show of Force near Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Canadian aircraft will not take
part in the scheduled show of NATO air power near the troubled
Kosovo region of Yugoslavia, The Globe and Mail newspaper reported
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Scores of NATO warplanes will conduct low-level flights on
Monday over Albania and Macedonia in a quickly organized show of
force designed to demonstrate alliance resolve and force Serbian
leader Slobodan Milosevic to cease the "ethnic cleansing" in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Although Canadian Defense Minister Arthur Eggleton said "we
certainly want to participate" last week when NATO unveiled plans
for exercises, Canadian air force planners were "still looking at
all the options" Sunday, according to a Defense Department
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
NATO moved too quickly for Canada to get a "six-pack" of its
CF-18 warplanes ready and across the Atlantic on short
notice. However, if the aerial exercises over Albania and
Macedonia continue as expected, there may eventually be Canadian
involvement, according to the Canadian newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Follows Japanese Yen's Slide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar followed
the Japanese yen down a slippery dip against the U.S. dollar
Monday to close more than half a U.S. cent lower.
</P>
<P>
The weakness in the Japanese currency and a lower gold price
impacted heavily on the Australian dollar, driving it to a low of
58.50 U.S. cents on the day.
</P>
<P>
At the close in Sydney the Australian dollar was trading at
58.59 U.S. cents, from 59.17 U.S. cents previously, and gold ended
at 285.00 U.S. dollars, down 2.90 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar's recent slide has put financial markets
on alert for a possible rise in official interest rates in Sydney
by the Reserve Bank of Australia, the nation's central bank.
</P>
<P>
Economists have suggested that a rate lift by the central bank
as a counter attack against the recent wave of selling of the
currency is unlikely, but market participants remain alert for
such a move.
</P>
<P>
With little in the way of economic data to look forward to this
week, the only release is the Australian Bureau of Statistics Wage
Cost Index on Thursday, and attention has turned to the fallout of
the One Nation Party's at least 10-seat win in the Queensland
state election over the past weekend.
</P>
<P>
Most economists contend that One Nation Party will have a
negative effect on financial markets as it implies increased
pressure on the ruling Liberal/National coalition to peg back its
tax reform, telecommunications giant Telstra' privatization and
business competition agenda.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was buying 85.41 Japanese yen, from 85.16
yen previously, and 1.0614 German marks, from 1.0690 marks.

<HEADLINE> Spanish Wines Enjoy Growing Popularity in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Total exports of wines and
spirits from Spain to Asia reached over 41 million U.S. dollars in
1997, jumping 91 percent over the previous year, the Spanish Trade
Commission said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Of this wine trade, 28 percent or 12 million U.S. dollars were
due to Spanish exports to China's inland areas, a 400 percent
increase over the previous year, while Spain's 1997 exports of
alcoholic beverages to Hong Kong soared a dramatic 584 percent to
5.7 million U.S. dollars, said Ernesto Tejedor, Spain's Trade
Commissioner in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
To further promote Spanish wines and spirits in the Asia
market, the Spanish Trade Commission and the Spanish Institute for
Foreign Trade (ICEX) have organized a Spanish Pavilion of 56
exhibitors at V&AMP;S Hong Kong '98, the first international wine and
spirits exhibition for the Asia Pacific taking place in Hong Kong
from June 16 to 18.
</P>
<P>
Over 38 different Spanish fine wines and spirits will feature
in the Spanish Pavilion, said Paloma Escorihuela Esteban, head of
ICEX's Wine Department.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is Spain's second largest export market in Asia. In
1997, total exports from Spain to Hong Kong amounted to over 614
million U.S. dollars, of which around 50 percent were re-exported
to the Chinese mainland.

<HEADLINE> Asia's Most Advanced Treasury Dealing Room Opened in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Standard Chartered Bank, one of
the three note-issuing banks in Hong Kong, opened Asia's most
advanced dealing room here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Seventy million HK dollars (8.97 million U.S. dollars) was
invested in the dealing room, which has space for 100 dealing
workstations, according to Stanley Wong, the bank's regional
treasurer for Northeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The main feature of the dealing room, located on the seventh
floor of the bank's Hong Kong headquarters in Central, is the 300
state-of-the-art flat-screen displays that are linked to 100
personal computers on another floor in the building, Wong said.
</P>
<P>
The main benefits are flexibility and speed -- dealers can
operate fully from any dealing position in the room and can react
at a moment's notice to changing market conditions, he said.
</P>
<P>
The bank's Group Chairman Patrick Gillam, who also officiated
at the opening ceremony, said the dealing room indicated the
international banking group's long commitment to Hong Kong. The
British-funded group has operated in Hong Kong for around 140
years.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is the most profitable of Standard Chartered Global
Treasury's network of 28 dealing rooms around the world. Last
year the bank's treasury operations in Hong Kong achieved a 45
percent increase in profits.

<HEADLINE> Christie's to Inaugurate Sale of Fine and Rare Wines in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Christie's will hold its
inaugural sale of fine and rare wines here Thursday as part of the
international wine and spirits exhibition (V&AMP;S de Vinexpo) to be
held between Tuesday and Thursday at the Hong Kong Convention and
Exhibition Center.
</P>
<P>
Expected to realize over six million HK dollars (769,231 U.S.
dollars), the exceptional sale offers a rare opportunity for
collectors to acquire quality wines at auction in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Duncan McEuen, director of Christie's London Wine Department,
said Monday at a press briefing that following a long tradition of
holding a Fine Wine Auction at the biannual Vinexpo in Bordeaux,
Christie's is delighted to have been invited by the V&AMP;S de Vinexpo
to mount a similar event at their inaugural wine fair in the
Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
"It is a particular pleasure to be able to take a superb
quality sale direct to the center of the rapidly expanding and
highly enthusiastic wine market that is now becoming established
in Asia-Pacific," McEuen said.
</P>
<P>
Highlights of the sale include 12 bottles of Chateau
Cheval-Blanc 1947, a superb jeroboam of the very rare Le Pin 1982,
cases of Chateau Petrus 1990, individual bottles of the same wine

<HEADLINE> Indonesian MP Urges U.S. to Act For Releasing IMF Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- An Indonesian legislator Monday
urged the United States to quickly respond to two letters sent by
Indonesian legislators last week on the immediate release of
International Monetary Fund's (IMF) loans to the country.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that there would be immediate answers from President
(Bill) Clinton and the U.S. Congress because U.S. Ambassador to
Indonesia J. Stapleton Roy has promised to convey our letters to
them," Abu Hasan Sazili said.
</P>
<P>
Six legislators delivered the two letters to Roy Saturday, with
one addressed to Clinton and the other to the U.S. Congress.
</P>
<P>
The two letters were signed by 89 of the 500 members of the
House of Representatives (DPR).
</P>
<P>
Sazili said that in the two letters, the legislators conveyed
their appreciation for U.S. aid given to non-government
organizations (NGOs) in efforts to strengthen human rights, the
environment and democratization in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
He said they, however, underscored control over the aid so that
it would not be exploited for the interests of certain groups and
expressed the hope that the U.S. would not meddle in Indonesia's
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The immediate disbursement of IMF funds could strengthen the
IMF's credibility and avoid the impression that the financial
institution is only "kidding" Indonesia, he said.
</P>
<P>
The IMF promised last October to provide 10 billion U.S.
dollars of a 43-billion-U.S.-dollar package which the agency
brokered to bail out Indonesia's ailing economy.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia received the first tranche of 3 billion dollars from
the IMF in November last year, but the second disbursement of 3
billion U.S. dollars scheduled for June was delayed due to riots
in Jakarta in May and the later political crisis in the country
which forced former president Soeharto to step down.
</P>
<P>
The IMF said it will disburse the aid early next month.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Expectation from Clinton's Hometown  (By Li Hongqi) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 14 (Xinhua) -- They are modest and amicable,
warmhearted and hospitable. When talking about President Bill
Clinton's upcoming visit to China, they feel proud of their former
governor and curious to know more about that Asian country.
</P>
<P>
"The world is too small," said local government officials,
educators and businessmen who were happy to meet the Chinese press
in Littlerock, where Clinton governed Arkansas for 12 years and
campaigned hard for his way to the White House. "A lot of people,
if not all, in his hometown will certainly watch TV coverage of
Bill's China trip," confirmed Skip Rutherford, director of the
Presidential Library Project.
</P>
<P>
"China is still a mystery to many people in the United States
and I think we should try to learn more about other countries
which might not share our belief, instead of trying to impose our
ideas," said the president's staunch supporter, who was believed
to contribute a lot to his success in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Skip said that the first thing he wants to do is to finance his
children's travels aboard, including trips to China, to enrich
their knowledge, if he's better off. He believes that President
Clinton's trip to China will help people understand the mystery
better.
</P>
<P>
Eventually it is no longer a mystery for all. Jim Dailey, mayor
of Littlerock, has travelled to China twice since his city
established a sistership with Chang Chun, provincial capital of Ji
Lin in Northeastern China, in 1994. He was astonished to notice at
his first trip that a sign of welcome held high by his Chinese
host at the airport wronged his city as "Little Stone." But when
he flew to Chang Chun for the second time and visited an
elementary school, he was very much touched to hear pupils
greeting him "Dailey, Welcome" in English.
</P>
<P>
Sharon Piest, Secretary of State of Arkansas, hasn't been able
to visit China so far. However, she knows the importance of
engaging that country in every field and supports Clinton's summit
meeting with Chinese President Jiang Zemin. "It is in the
interests of both side to understand each other better and
cooperate with each other better," said Sharon, who ranks third in
the Arkansas government.
</P>
<P>
Marolyn Chambers-Dorman, vice president of Riceland Lecithin
Division, shared the belief. She traveled to Shanghai recently to
assess the China's market potential for Lecithin, a nutriment
extracted from soybean. The conclusion was encouraging and she was
quick to realize that "Shanghai is a real business metropolis like
Tokyo and New York." She is now awaiting delegations from Shanghai
and Heilongjiang to explore the possibility of establishing joint
ventures.
</P>
<P>
Winrock International, a non-profit institute dedicated to
agriculture development worldwide, is working on The Lead21
Program with various Chinese partners. The program builds on
China's existing Ph.D. programs in agricultural economics by
strengthening course work and applied research at participating
institutes. "We lately opened an office in Beijing," said Mary
Laurie, public affairs director.
</P>
<P>
Academic exchanges are also gaining momentum, as described by
William Goolsby, Donaghey Dean of Business Administration of
Arkansas University. His faculty agreed in May to accept 35
students from Tianjin University of Finance and Economics this
year as a first step toward closer cooperative ties.
</P>
<P>
Arkansas University also set up a China-America center for
statistics and economic research, providing opportunities for both
Chinese and U.S. scholars to work together. The center has
launched a research program on cotton infestations and diseases in
Xinjiang and other places in Western China. The university's
Fulbright College of Arts and Sciences is also seeking expanded
China programs. "We are ready to accept Chinese students in
hundreds and to expand exchanges with our Chinese counterparts,"
said Mark Cory, associate dean.
</P>
<P>
Dave Mcmahen of Impuls company based in Russellville sounded
confident to succeed in his joint venture with China's Sundiro.
Motorcycle parts would be shipped from China's Hainan province and
assembled in Arkansas before the Chinese products go to the
American markets. "It is the first Chinese foothold in Arkansas so
far and I'm sure it will be enough competitive," said Dave at a
construction site. The plant will be operational in September.
</P>
<P>
People in Hope, Clinton's birthplace, are more enthusiastic
about the president's trip to China. "Bill is intelligent and
smart enough to tide over the controversy," said Joe Purvis, a
lawyer and President Clinton's childhood friend. He was referring
to the pressure brought on the president not to visit China this
time.
</P>
<P>
"That's really great," said in one tone Clinton's relatives,
friends and mayor Ramsey who gathered at a humble two-storey house
where President Clinton grew until age of four. They are anxious
to know if First Lady Hillary will be going with the president.

<HEADLINE> Peace March Needs New Impetus: Labor Leader Barak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Israeli opposition Labor
Party leader Ehud Barak said Monday that it was necessary to give
a new push to the Middle East peace process for the benefit of
Israelis and Palestinians alike.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak,
Barak said he had come out of his talks with an impression that
there was concern because of the slow pace in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
His meeting with Mubarak, he said, took place one day after
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat talked with Mubarak about their
anxiety over the stagnant peace process and their wish to give it
new momentum.
</P>
<P>
"This was also the wish of the Israeli Labor Party and the
majority of Israeli public opinion," Barak added.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on the latest American initiative to
reactivate the Mideast peace drive, Barak said he was of the view
that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu should go to
Washington at once, reach an agreement on a second stage
redeployment and move forward towards final status negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"The Labor Party supports the implementation of the second
stage redeployment of Israeli troops in the West Bank," he said,
adding the support has been conveyed to Israeli public.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli opposition leader did not wish to discuss figures
and percentages, but said the ideas contained in the American
offer "are good."
</P>
<P>
Barak said he told Mubarak about the feeling of the majority of
Israeli people and their wish to see the peace process continue so
that peace and security may prevail among the Israelis and
Palestinians and in the entire area.
</P>
<P>
He stressed his party believes that peace is the right course
to realize Israeli security and that negotiations with the
Palestinians could lead to an agreement on final status.
</P>
<P>
"It was necessary to continue direct negotiations on the final
status to avoid other alternatives which could lead to a
deterioration in the entire peace process," he added.
</P>
<P>
Barak disliked Netanyahu's idea to hold a referendum on further
redeployment in order to beat right-wing opposition within his
Likud-led coalition, saying it would be a waste of time and money.
</P>
<P>
"It would cost a lot of money and would take several
months. And we know the result in advance. We know that 75 percent
of Israelis want an understanding on carrying out a second stage
redeployment," he said.
</P>
<P>
Barak's visit to Cairo came on the heels of that of Israeli
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai early this month, who discussed
with Mubarak means of reviving the peace process on the
Palestinian track.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Labor Party lawmaker and assistant to
late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, Youssi Belein, arrived
here Sunday night for a hours-long visit during which he held
talks with Mubarak's political advisor Osama el-Baz on the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian-Israeli talks came to a halt in March 1997 when
Israel started construction of a new Jewish settlement in Arab
East Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan MPs Demand Govt to Explain Massacre </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Parliamentarians will
this week demand an explanation from the government on how the
rebels could burn over 80 students to death in a recent massacre
without receiving any resistance from the military.
</P>
<P>
This will be the latest expression of anxiety over security as
the Ugandan government comes under mounting pressure to open
peace talks with the rebels, the weekly East African newspaper
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Some members of parliament added their voices to calls by
human rights groups, opposition politicians, and religious
leaders for halting the killings in the insurgency-hit areas of
western and northern Uganda.
</P>
<P>
On June 8, a group of some 200 rebels of the Allied Democratic
Forces (ADF) mounted a pre-dawn attack on the Kichwamba Technical
Institute in Kabarole District in west Uganda, burning more than 80
students to death and abducting many others.
</P>
<P>
While the cruelty of the rebels has been a target of fierce
criticism from all walks of life in Uganda, the no-resistance
from the Uganda People's Defense Forces (UPDF) is more
ruthlessly blamed.
</P>
<P>
Novert Mao, an outspoken MP for Gulu Municipality which is
also frequently affected by insurgency, said, "The government
has to explain to parliament how such a thing happened."
</P>
<P>
"We shall summon these people to cone and explain how the
rebels attacked the students without any resistance from UPDF,"
Mao said.
</P>
<P>
The house will seek to know whether the funds allocated for
defense are justified if the army cannot defend the population,
he added.
</P>
<P>
In the 1998/99 budget unveiled last week, the defense spending
increased by 26 percent to 143 billion Uganda Shillings (119
million U.S. Dollars), accounting for 15 percent of the total
estimated revenue of 991.8 billion Shillings (826 million U.S.
Dollars), the biggest allocation of resources.
</P>
<P>
"What this latest attack has shown is that all the money we
are voting for defense is not justified. The army is not
accountable," he said. "The army's most vital problem is not
money but it's management. Those concerned will have to
explain."

<HEADLINE> 1997 Industrial Accident Toll Drops to 17,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 15 (Xinhua) -- In 1997 China saw fewer accidents
take place in its industrial enterprises, and railway and water
transportation, but many more cases of fire and traffic accidents,
according to a report released by the Ministry of Labor and Social
Security and the State Statistics Bureau here today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that in 1997 a total of 18,268 industrial
accidents occurred in enterprises nationwide, killing 17,558
people.
</P>
<P>
However, it said, the figures are respectively 12.5 and 9.8
percent lower compared with those in the previous year. The number
of major accidents also dropped 15.6 percent, to 696.
</P>
<P>
As usual, most of China's industrial accidents in 1997 occurred
in the mining industry, which suffered 7,266 accidents which
killed 11,265 miners. But even these two figures are 14.9 and 7.7
percent lower, respectively, than in 1996, said the report.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,600 accidents occurred last year in the country's
railway sector, three percent fewer than in 1996, said the report.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, fire and traffic accidents were the
greatest headache for China in 1997.
</P>
<P>
More than 140,000 cases of fire, not including forest and
prairie fires, were reported nationwide last year, 3.8 times as
many as in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The fire killed 2,722 people, injured 4,930 and caused direct
economic losses worth 1.54 billion yuan (nearly 200 million US
dollars). The figures represent 22.3, 43.8 and 49.5 percent up,
respectively, over the previous year, said the report.
</P>
<P>
China's civil aviation sector last year suffered four flight
accidents, which killed a total of 42 people, the report added.

<HEADLINE> Blair Links Euro Entry with National Interest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 15 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
on Monday restated that Britain's entry into the European single
currency should be based on the national economic interest.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with BBC radio, Blair said his government was
positive towards the concept of euro but would only join the
single currency if the British people wished to do so.
</P>
<P>
The first-round launch of the euro, agreed by 11 member states
from the 15-state European Union, will start early next year
without Britain.
</P>
<P>
The British government has ruled out joining the European
Monetary Union in the current term of parliament which ends in
2002.
</P>
<P>
"We are positive towards the overall concept of a single
currency. We are making preparations to allow Britain to join
should it wish to do so," Blair said.
</P>
<P>
However, Blair said the decision must be taken "on economic
grounds on the basis of what is in Britain's national economic
interest -- are the benefits of it clear and unambiguous".
</P>
<P>
"The reason for the delay is that we simply can't judge that at
this time," he said.
</P>
<P>
Blair's comments followed a statement on Sunday by Foreign

<HEADLINE> China to Launch Fourth Securities Investment Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 15 (Xinhua) -- China will launch its fourth
securities investment fund tomorrow, in another move to develop
institutional investors in the securities market.
</P>
<P>
The "Anxin Fund", which is also the first investment fund run
by a local fund manager, is expected to be issued at 1.01 yuan per
unit.
</P>
<P>
The three sponsors, namely the Shanghai International Trust and
Investment Company, Shandong Securities Co. Ltd and Hua'an
Fund Management Co. Ltd, are expected to purchase 60 million units
of the fund, while the remaining 1.94 billion units will be
offered to the public through the Shanghai Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
The closed-end fund has a 15-year term, and will invest 70
percent of the capital in stocks and 30 percent in treasury
bonds. The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China will be the
custodian of the fund.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts say the introduction of the fourth securities
investment fund shows clearly the strong determination of the
securities authorities to standardize and stabilize the stock
market by encouraging institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
The first three such funds, namely the "Jintai Fund", "Kaiyuan
Fund" and "Xinghua Fund", have been warmly welcomed by investors
due to the security and profitability an investment fund
promises.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Seoul stocks tumbled below the
300-point level Monday, the lowest in 11 years, due to a further
weakening of the Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
The composite index plunged 4.82 percent or 14.6 points to
close at 288.21, with 735 listings falling and 97 rising while 54
remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Of the losers, 198 dropped to their daily limit lows and a mere
20 issues rose to their daily permissible highs.
</P>
<P>
The weakening Japanese yen also affected South Korea's currency
markets, with the won was trading at 1,432 against the
U.S. dollar, compared with 1,403 won last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The yen dropped to 145 against the greenback on Tokyo's foreign
exchange market Monday, the lowest rate in seven years and eight
months.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here attributed the tumble in the stock and foreign
exchange markets to the fears of a further fall in the Japanese
yen and continued selling of stocks by foreign and domestic
investors.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
will travel to Washington next month to open the Egyptian-American
strategic dialog designed to speed up bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's Ambassador to the United States Ahmed Maher presented a
report Sunday to President Hosni Mubarak on Egyptian-American ties
in anticipation of the strategic talks, the Middle East News
Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The aim of this dialog is to create a fast communication
channel between the U.S. State Department and Egyptian Foreign
Ministry, Maher said after his meeting with Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
"It will enable each side to better understand the demands of
the other end to overcome any type of misunderstandings that might
arise and coordinate stances when required," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian ambassador said he also met with Moussa to examine
the agenda of the dialog, which will be dominated by the Middle
East peace process and the obstacles placed by Israel to the
implementation of a U.S. peace proposal.
</P>
<P>
An Egyptian delegation made up of Minister of Economy Youssef
Boutros Ghali and Minister of State for Planning Zafer el-Bishri
will be in Washington next week to discuss issues related to the
Egyptian-U.S. partnership and follow up the results of U.S. Vice
President Al Gore's last visit to Egypt on May 3.
</P>
<P>
The Mubarak-Gore meeting focused on ways to improve bilateral
economic relations, encourage American investments in Egypt and
reactivate the four sub-committees of the Egyptian-American
Presidential Council which has been idle since its creation three
years ago.

<HEADLINE> NATO Starts Air Exercise In Albania, Macedonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- NATO warplanes began air exercises
over Albania and Macedonia Monday morning, aimed to step up
pressure on the Yugoslavian government to end the crisis in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
A total of 80 aircraft from 13 of the 16 countries in the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization have been involved in the air
maneuvers, codenamed Determined Falcon.
</P>
<P>
Around 40 NATO warplanes have flown over Tirana, the capital
of Albania, as part of the exercise in Albania and Macedonia which
border the Yugoslav province of Kosovo. On the ground, the sound
of aircraft engines was deafening.
</P>
<P>
The operation, the largest air exercise held by NATO in the
Balkan Peninsula, includes fighters, reconnaissance planes,
airborne early warning systems, air refuelling tankers and
helicopters, operating from the Aviano airbase in northern Italy
and other airbases in southern Europe.
</P>
<P>
The exercise came as fighting continued in Kosovo over the
weekend between Serbian police and ethnic Albanians, who make up
90 percent of Kosovo population.
</P>
<P>
NATO is piling pressure on Yugoslavian President Slobodan
Milosevic to stop the "crackdown" on ethnic Albanians and prevent
the conflict from spreading through the southern Balkans.
</P>
<P>
"On Kosovo, let me be quite clear that NATO will not stand idly
by," warned NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana in a speech in
Warsaw on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We will not allow a repeat of the situation of 1991 in
Bosnia."
</P>
<P>
More than 300 people have died and some 65,000 people become
refugees since the Serb-led government of the Yugoslav
federation began "a military crackdown" on the ethnic Albanian
independence movement in Kosovo early this year.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Parties Divided on Transition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's five political parties
are now divided on transition to civil rule program following the
sudden death of their consensus presidential candidate, late head
of state, General Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
Local media reports said Monday that differences emerged at
the meeting between the parties and the new leader General
Abdulsalam Abubakar which lasted from Saturday evening until
early Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Four of the parties, namely, the Democratic Party of Nigeria
(DPN), the National Centre Party of Nigeria (NCPN), the Congress
for National Consensus (CNC) and the Grassroots Democratic
Movement (GDM) demanded the cancellation of the state and
national assembly elections held on December 6, 1997 and April 25
this year, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The four parties, which lost miserably to the United Nigeria
Congress Party (UNCP) in the said elections, accused some
government ministers of interferring in the elections in favor of
the UNCP.
</P>
<P>
Their suggestion was, of course, resisted by the UNCP.
</P>
<P>
The five parties, however, do reached preliminary consensus on
the point that the August 1 presidential election date should
maintain, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
They also objected the idea of dissolving them, as have been
canvanssed by the some sectors of the society, on the ground that
all the five parties are "government parties".
</P>
<P>
According to reports, the new Nigerian Head of State, General
Abubakar has urged the parties to reach a general consensus on
key issues concerning the transition program.
</P>
<P>
The parties were told to come with a common position at their
next meeting with Abubakar Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting at the weekend is part of the consultations held
by Abubakar as to how to continue with the transition program
introduced by Abacha three years ago.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar has promised to carry on with the transiton program,
even though he is left with less than two months to the
presidential election now deprived of its sole candidate.
</P>
<P>
The meeting were also attended the National Electoral
Commission of Nigeria, the Transition Implementation Committee,
as well as service chiefs and the Inspector-General of Police,
reports said.

GUIYANG, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Two young girls have been rescued
alive after being lost in a cave for 42 days in southwest China's
Guizhou Province.
</P>

Doctors called it a miracle that the two girls, Li Qingzhu, 16,
and Liang Xiaofei, could survive by living only on water for such
a long time.
</P>
<P>
They were found two days ago, when four other people entered
the unnamed cave to explore it. Li was conscious, but Liang was
not. The girls' companions, Huang Yan and a boy named Wang
Shunrong, had died.
</P>
<P>
The four entered the cave May 2, not having informed anyone of

<HEADLINE> Sino-Italian Joint Communique Issued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 15 (Xinhua) -- China and Italy are determined to
develop an efficient and long-term bilateral relationship in all
fields on the basis of faithful partnership
</P>
<P>
This was stated in a Sino-Italian joint communique which was
issued at the end of Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro's
state visit to China June 8-13.
</P>
<P>
Both countries promise to make concerted efforts to contribute
to the establishment of a new international political and economic
order featuring fairness and reasonableness, the communique said.
</P>
<P>
Since both countries bear important responsibilities in
regional and international affairs, the communique emphasized,
strengthened exchanges and cooperation between the two countries
in such global organizations as the United Nations not only
accords with their mutual interests, but is conducive to the
peace, stability and development of the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, both sides will devote themselves to establishing a
brand-new Asian-European partnership, through which both will
enhance their discussions and cooperation concerning world
affairs, while at the same time positively promoting China's
dialogue with the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Such key issues as United Nations affairs, security and
disarmament, proliferation of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass
destruction should be fully and frequently discussed, the
communique noted, adding that any crises threatening world
peace and stability should be promptly addressed.
</P>
<P>
As it is significant for leaders of the two countries to keep
in close and frequent touch, the communique said, both
sides decided to hold regular summit talks, as well as meetings
between the two foreign ministers at least once a year.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral economic and trade relations, hailed as an important
component of the Sino-Italian relationship, will be further
explored, especially in terms of bilateral trade, and industrial
and financial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed that the role of the Sino-Italian Joint
Economic and Trade Committee should be strengthened in enhancing,
coordinating and supervising the functions of cooperative agencies
in the two countries, and in deciding on special fields to
cooperate in and putting forward concrete suggestions.
</P>
<P>
Exchanges and cooperation between medium- and small-sized
enterprises are encouraged, while further cooperation between
large ones continue, the communique noted.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks Close Lower on Further Asian Weakness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The Australian share market
closed softer Monday on further Asian weakness despite the
spectacular and successful float of the AMP LTD, Australia's
financial services giant.
</P>
<P>
AMP's listing at the Australian Stock Exchange Monday afternoon
at 35.99 Australian dollars, up off a base price of 16 Australian
dollars, dominated market interest.
</P>
<P>
The ordinary shares of the company closed at 23.00 Australian
dollars, considerably higher than the 20 Australian dollars
predicted by many experts.
</P>
<P>
Trading in AMP so dominated the market that turnover in it
alone was higher than the value of trade in all other stocks
combined.
</P>
<P>
Overall, 277.47 million shares changed hands worth 987.24
million U.S. dollars but more than half of that was AMP-related as
its 35 million shares were worth 504.6 million U.S. dollars alone.
</P>
<P>
Falling shares outnumbered rising shares by 599 to 433.
</P>
<P>
However, as AMP is excluded from the all ordinaries index until
August 1, the float had no direct affect on an otherwise
lackluster all ordinaries index but its success limited broader
falls, according to brokers.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index closed down 4.2 points at 2567.5, the
all industrials gained 7.1 to 4481.7 while all resources softened
15.6 to 1027.0.
</P>
<P>
News Corp's ordinary shares closed 64.1 cents firmer at 11.201
Australian dollars and its preferred shares climbed 39.1 cents to
9.491 Australian dollars thanks mainly to its renewed strength in
the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
Banking stocks also ended the day higher but most other leading
shares gave up ground with the heaviest losses in the resource and
building materials sectors.
</P>
<P>
Bank shares ended 10.5 points higher overall at 5541.7 points
thanks mainly to a 34.7-cent rise in National Australia Bank
shares to 21.40 Australian dollars and the Commonwealth Bank of
Australia's 5.8-cent rise to 17.508 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
Other majors were all weaker with Westpac bank 17 cents lower
at 9.40 Australian dollars and ANZ bank down 12 cents to 10.50
Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
Resources giant BHP closed 11 cents lower at 13.12 Australian
dollars, Rio Tinto slipped 20.9 cents to 19.05 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The gold index also tumbled 2.4 percent (26.2 points) to 1063.6
while the gold bullion price was down 2.9 U.S. dollars to 285.00
U.S. dollars late in Sydney trade.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan and Turkey began here
Monday their annual defense talks with an emphasis on
strengthening bilateral defense cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The talks took place at the forum of Pakistan-Turkey Defense
Consultative Group, which was established in 1995 and meets once a
year for enhancing the defense cooperation between the two
countries, said an official press release.
</P>
<P>
In Monday's opening session, the two sides expressed their
resolve to explore the possibilities to promote collaboration and
cooperation in the fields of defense production and military
training, the release said.
</P>
<P>
It said that various working groups would be formed later to

<HEADLINE> Israeli "Kitchen Cabinet" Fails to Decide on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu held his "Kitchen Cabinet" meeting here on Monday to
discuss Israeli troop redeployment in the West Bank, but no
decision was made, a statement issued by the Prime Minister's
Office said.
</P>
<P>
The "Kitchen Cabinet" members National Infrastructure Minister
Ariel Sharon, Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and Industry and
Trade Minister Natan Sharansky attended the meeting, according to
the statement.
</P>
<P>
"They discussed the scope of the further Israeli troop
redeployment in the West Bank, but could not reach a conclusion on
the depth of the redeployment and so they decided to further
discuss this mater during the next few days," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The United States earlier this month gave Israel about 10 days
to make its decision on whether to accept the U.S. initiative for
the peace process, threatening to reconsider its policy toward the
process and announce its initiative as asked by the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
But as the so-called deadline comes nearer, the United States
has done nothing in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The English-language newspaper "the Jerusalem Post" reported on
Monday that Netanyahu is holding off his proposal for the next
Israeli troop redeployment in the West Bank until the middle of
July, to allow time for the PNA to meet his preconditions.
</P>
<P>
He reportedly wanted to make sure the U.S. administration will
be able to arrange a White House signing ceremony for the pullback
agreement with PNA President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a senior government source as saying that
Israel will make crucial decision on redeployment in the coming
three or four weeks while the Knesset (Parliament) is still in
summer session, which is to last till the first week of August.
</P>
<P>
The paper also said that Netanyahu is taking the advantage of
some international events for his delay in making decision on the
redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Such events include U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to
China, the ongoing crisis in Kosovo and the aftermath of the
Indian and Pakistani nuclear tests as well as the economic
instability in southeast Asia, which have been taking
precedence of the U.S. State Department's traditional concern
about the Middle East, according to the paper.

<P>
NICOSIA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' trade deficit rose by 50.8
million Cyprus pounds (101.6 million U.S. dollars) in 1997, up 4.2
percent than that in 1996, according to a report available here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report issued by the Department of Statistics and Research
said the 1997 trade deficit stood at 1,259.3 million pounds (2,518.6
million dollars) due to a 2.3 percent rise in import and 1.4
percent drop in export.
</P>
<P>
The imports in 1997 hit 1,899.3 million pounds (3,798.6 million
dollars), 41.8 million pounds (83.6 million dollars) up from 1996,
while the export fell to 640 million pounds (1,280 million dollars)
from 649 million pounds (1,398 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The report said the European Union (EU) remained the chief
exporter to Cyprus last year, but its market share fell by one
percentage point to 56.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The imports from the United States stood at 360 million pounds
(720 million dollars), while imports from Arab countries slid by a
drastical 48.6 percent to 36.2 million pounds (72.4 million
dollars) last year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' exports to Arab countries soared by 17.7 percent to
131.2 million pounds (262.4 million dollars) last year, following
the exports to European countries.

<P>
CHANGSHA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from floods caused
by continuous torrential rains in central China's Hunan Province
has risen to 40, according to the local anti-flood department.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that more than four million people have been
affected by the floods, which have wreaked havoc in 16 counties
and destroyed more than 100,000 houses in central and northern
Hunan.
</P>
<P>
The torrential rain began in the evening of June 12, causing
river water to rise sharply over the danger level, and cutting off
communications, traffic and power supply in some areas, and even
forced some enterprises to stop production.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has issued a circular calling on the
whole province to be on alert against floods.
</P>
<P>
A relief office has been set up by the provincial government to
coordinate the relief efforts.

<HEADLINE> Economists Recommend Easier Loans for Small Firms (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China's commercial banks were asked last month to set up
special departments lending to medium- and small-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Lin noted that it is better for local financial organizations,
such as the urban and rural credit cooperatives, to engage in
such work, instead of the national commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
"They are relatively familiar with the local situation, which
can greatly reduce their costs of investigation, evaluation and
supervision of local enterprises applying for loans." said Lin.
</P>
<P>
China's four-largest state-run commercial banks -- the
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the Agricultural Bank
of China, the China Construction Bank and the Bank of China --
occupy the dominant position in the country's financial system.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Qiu said, "Large banks have their own distinct
advantages, and so do the smaller ones. The latter are better for
their relatively flexible operations."
</P>
<P>
He suggested that China encourage the development of
small-sized financial firms in line with the local economic
situations, in a bid to support medium- and-small-sized
enterprises.

<P>
JAKARTA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J. Habibie
here Monday announced the replacement of the attorney general of
the country, a minister said.
</P>
<P>
According to a Presidential Decree, Attorney General Soedjono
C. Atmonegoro will be replaced by Maj. Gen. Andi Muhammad Galib,
said State Secretary/Minister Akbar Tanjung.
</P>
<P>
However, he did not disclose the details of the replacement,
but stressed that the move has no connection with the
investigation on the wealth of present and former government
officials, including former president Soeharto and his family.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Soedjono told reporters that the Attorney
General's office has formed a team led by the Junior Attorney
General to investigate the wealth of government officials.
</P>
<P>
When the investigations are finished, "the result (of the
investigations) of officials of both central and provincial
governments will be announced to the public," said a spokesman of
the Attorney General's office.

<HEADLINE> Marseille to Ban Sale of Alcohol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Marseille shops will be banned from
selling alcohol from 16:40 Monday, and bars will be closed by
23:00 instead of 04:00, said an official from
Provence-Alpes-Cote-d'Azur Jean-Paul Proust.
</P>
<P>
These measures were taken after violent clashes between drunken
English football hooligans and Tunisian fans erupted in the city
from Sunday night to Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
The English football team is now playing Tunisia at the
Velodrome Stadium of Marseille, a city with a great North African
community.
</P>
<P>
French police accused English fans of "group drunkenness" and
provoking fights with Tunisians, during which 37 were injured.
</P>
<P>
Beer bottles were used by the fans of both sides during the
fight and were thrown at police who tried to stop them.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some highly frequented bars along the breathtaking
river side of old port Marseille, including the famous Bar de la
Marine which was depicted by the great French writer Marcel
Pagnol, were closed Monday morning out of precaution.
</P>
<P>
But no accident took place Monday morning between the English
fans and Tunisian fans, who strolled under sunlight in the old
port.
</P>
<P>
Police have been checking arriving English fans at the
Saint-Charles railway station of Marseille, searching their packs
and giving safe guide when they go out of the station.
</P>
<P>
The state railway company SNCF is offering special rail lines
for the trains departing from Calais and Paris carrying English
fans, in order to let them ride in the best conditions.

<HEADLINE> Fluoridated Water Efficient to Prevent Tooth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Fluoridated water is the
"most efficient" way to prevent tooth decay, a senior official of
the South African Health Department said at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Nine out of 10 people in South Africa experienced tooth decay
by the time they reached adulthood.
</P>
<P>
"Tooth decay is the most common disease known to
humankind...yet it is a preventable disease," the Business
Day Monday quoted Johan Smit, Director of Oral health in the
Health Department, as reporting.
</P>
<P>
Fluoridated water would render tooth decay more of a "thing of
the past, and save the government millions, Smit said.
</P>
<P>
Smit said it had been scientifically proven that tooth decay
could be reduced by up to 60 percent with fluoridated water.
</P>
<P>
It would cost only about one Rand (One U.S. Dollar equals 5.30
Rand) per person annually, which was 18 times cheaper than
toothpaste and 61 times cheaper than filling a tooth, he said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the South African government's plan to
make use of fluoridated water has not been free of controversy.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Pan-Africanist Congress has criticized the
ruling African National Congress for not instead spending the
money on campaigns to reduce the consumption of sweets by
children and on making school meals healthier for their teeth.
</P>
<P>
Other detractors have citied studies showing fluoride posed a
cancer risk, although several international medical bodies
including the World Health Organization insist that it is safe at
low levels.

<P>
CAIRO, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Belarussian President Alexandr
Lukashenko arrived here Monday on a two-day official visit to
Egypt for talks with his Egyptian counterpart Hosni Mubarak on
bilateral ties and other issues of mutual interest.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at the Cairo International Airport, Lukashenko
was greeted by Mubarak and other senior Egyptian officials.
</P>
<P>
The talks between the two presidents are to focus on a number
of regional and international issues of mutual concern, the latest
developments in the Mideast peace process, as well as enhancing
bilateral ties, especially in economy, trade and investment,
according to media reports here.
</P>
<P>
They will sign a number of agreements on reactivating economic
and trade relations as well as encouraging foreign
investments. The two countries are also expected to sign a number
of other accords on preventing dual taxation and enhancing
bilateral cooperation in higher education.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by a number of businessmen on his first trip to
Egypt, Lukashenko will meet with Egyptian businessmen to discuss
bilateral cooperation in boosting trade ties.
</P>
<P>
Belarus is the most developed of the Commonwealth of
Independent States in the field of industry.
</P>
<P>
Trade exchange between the two countries stood at 63 million
U.S. dollars last year, including 3 million dollars of Egyptian
exports to Belarus and 60 million dollars of Egyptian imports
from Belarus.

<HEADLINE> Indo-U.S. Relations In For Difficult Patch: U.S. Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Ambassador to India Richard
F. Celeste said Monday that the bilateral ties between India and
the United States after India's nuclear tests are in for a
difficult patch, though the door is open for a high-level
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Press Trust of India (PTI) here,
Celeste said: "If we are realistic, I believe, we are in for a
difficult patch. There is a great deal of talk about sanctions and
also speculations here. The sanctions would be real and serious
and would have an impact on India and Pakistan."
</P>
<P>
He said that these sanctions were the first to be imposed under
the Glen Amendment of the United States and Washington had no road
map to guide it. "But perhaps, the most difficult aspect of these
sanctions is that they can be lifted only by an act of Congress,"
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Apart from their direct impact, the sanctions would also have
indirect fallout which could erode the confidence of investors
from the United States and other countries in India, he said.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether India's nuclear tests had put President Bill
Clinton's planned visit to India this November under a cloud,
Celeste said: "Well, just now it is under review."
</P>
<P>
"President Clinton has certainly expressed his desire to come
to India at an appropriate time," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was giving a great deal of personal time and efforts to
securing successful negotiations on the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty (CTBT) which is now awaiting ratification in the U.S. There
was a great deal of "disappointment and concern" in Washington
about the tests which had several dimensions on the global efforts
to reduce and eliminate nuclear weapons and increased tension,
danger and insecurity in South Asia, the U.S. Ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
"These are the two over-riding concerns driving the policy of
not only the U.S. government but many other governments who share
these concerns," he said.
</P>
<P>
When asked why the United States and key countries were
focusing on Kashmir and linking it with the Indian nuclear tests,
he said that this was due to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party
(BJP) talking about India exercising the nuclear option in its
manifesto which also referred to Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
"After the nuclear tests by India, Home Minister L. K. Advani
seemed to link the country's nuclear weapons capability with the
issue of Kashmir, which was followed by Prime Minister Atal Behari
Vajpayee traveling to the test site in the company of Jammu and
Kashmir Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah," Celeste said.
</P>
<P>
These factors "powerfully link" Kashmir with the nuclear tests
and it should come as no surprise to India that leaders in the
United States and elsewhere be very concerned about Kashmir, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Washington's policy on Kashmir was very clear. It should be
resolved through direct and constructive talks between India and
Pakistan, he added.
</P>
<P>
"We believe sooner the talks get underway, it will be better
for both the countries and for the stability in the
sub-continent," he stressed.

<P>
SINGAPORE, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Singapore will host the first
Asia International Book Fair (AIBF) in the year of 2000, according
to a press release issued Monday by the Reed Exhibition Companies
(REC).
</P>
<P>
The event scheduled for April 26-28, 2000, at the Singapore
International Convention and Exhibition Center is co-organized by
REC, Singapore, and TDB Holding Pte. Ltd., an investment
subsidiary of the Singapore Trade Development Board, it said.
</P>
<P>
The REC claimed to be "the world's leading organizer of trade

52 industry sectors."
</P>
<P>
Under the AIBF scheme, the trading of books and publishing
rights will be brought under one roof to fill the gap in Asia's
publishing industry, REC said.
</P>
<P>
It also said that a conference will be held in conjunction with
the exhibition to provide an opportunity for exchange of ideas
between industry professionals and education policy makers.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Uganda's New Budget Hurts Manufactures: Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's budget for the 1998/99
fiscal year, which favors importers and consumers, will
eventually hurt manufacturers in the country, a member of
parliament has said.
</P>
<P>
Manzi Tumubweine, Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee on
Finance and Planning, was quoted by Monday's East African Weekly
as saying that the reduction of taxes on imports, though easy on
consumers and importers, would ultimately hurt manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
"Unless other new measures are introduced, imports will be
cheaper than locally produced goods. One will need to be
patriotic to import raw materials," he said.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts here said that the import-oriented budget is
unlikely to promote poverty alleviation programs as it will take
money out of the economy.
</P>
<P>
"You cannot talk of poverty alleviation when you are
encouraging importation," a member of the Uganda Manufacturers
Association commented.
</P>
<P>
Even since the new budget was presented to parliament last
Thursday, manufacturers have been complaining about changes made
in the taxation system to accommodate COMESA. The taxes were
changed from a four-rate duty system of 0 percent, 5 percent, 10
percent and 20 percent to a three-rate regime of 0 percent, 7
percent and 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
Tumubweine said that the reduction in taxers will discourage
local manufacturing while promoting importation. Taxes on raw
material imports are now almost at par with finished goods.
</P>
<P>
Concern by the manufacturers and analysts also centered on the
government's failure to set up an investment fund for local
investors.
</P>
<P>
They also complain about the government's failure to come up
with measures to control smuggling.
</P>
<P>
Over the last two fiscal years, the government has lost up to
90 billion Uganda Shillings (7.5 million U.S. Dollars) of
projected revenue collection, partly due to rampant smuggling.

<HEADLINE> Lake Victoria Heavily Polluted by Wastes: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Mining activities have
heavily polluted Lake Victoria, the world's second largest
freshwater lake, said a Tanzanian environment official.
</P>
<P>
In some small mines on the shores of the lake, mercury is
contaminating ground and surface water, Monday's Daily News
quoted Angelina Madete, who works at the Environment Division in
the Vice-President's Office, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a workshop on prospects for sustainable management
of Lake Victoria over the weekend in Mwanza, Madete said that
environmentally-accepted method for panning requires the use of
special devices to separate mercury from pure gold instead of
open burning and washing.
</P>
<P>
The Mwanza municipality alone has 43 factories which discharge
untreated waste into the lake, said Madete.
</P>
<P>
However, the government lacks in legislations and pollution
control facilities to deal with this problem, she said.
</P>
<P>
Another major source of pollution in the lake is pit latrines
and septic tanks which are commonly used by local residents, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, heavy pollution has caused the rampant growth
of water hyacinth in the lake, hampering the free movement of
vessels.

<HEADLINE> HK Makes Sustained Efforts to Tackle Unemployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The seasonally adjusted
unemployment rate for the period February to April 1998 in Hong
Kong was 3.9 percent, Secretary for Education and Manpower Joseph
W. P. Wong said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Wong told a press briefing that the underemployment rate for
the same period was 2.2 percent. He added that the provisional
seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for March to May was 4.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
Acting government economist Elley Mao explained that the
increase in unemployment rate occurred mainly in retail,
restaurants and transport sectors.
</P>
<P>
By comparison, the unemployment situation in other major
sectors was "broadly stable," she added.
</P>
<P>
Wong noted that the government of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region was "very concerned about the employment
situation" and has announced a package of measures recently to
tackle the problem.
</P>
<P>
When the task force led by Financial Secretary Donald Tsang
meets again in July 9 to review the employment situation, Wong
said, further measures will be announced.
</P>
<P>
Admitting the high unemployment rate will last for some time,
Wong said employment prospects in foreseeable future are
"positive" since Hong Kong's economic fundamentals remain sound
and strong.
</P>
<P>
While reaffirming the government's commitment to creating more
job opportunities, he called for sustained, collective and
concerted efforts of the whole community to tackle the employment
issue.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Groups Emerge to Help Macao Transitional Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Grassroots communities and societies
in Macao have established more than 20 specialized groups to
collect opinions on Macao's transition and the preparation for the
future Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
Over the month since the establishment of the Macao SAR
Preparatory Committee in Beijing on May 5, various groups like
"working committee for the upcoming handover," "group embracing
Macao's return," "group following SAR preparatory committee's
affairs" have come into being in Macao.
</P>
<P>
Founders of these groups include such grassroots bodies as the
Macao Association of Neighborhood Communities, Macao Federation of
Trade Unions, Macao Women's Federation and the Macao Ambulant
Sellers Community.
</P>
<P>
Business and specialized groups as the Youth Committee of the
Macao Chamber of Commerce, the Association of Returned Overseas
Chinese in Macao, the Chinese Education Association, Factory
Owners Society, and the Macao Society of Economics Study have also
established similar groups.
</P>
<P>
The objectives of these groups, according to some founders, are
to collect opinions from members and make studies on certain
transitional affairs, and hand over proposals on those issues to
the Preparatory Committee.
</P>
<P>
"To create a better Macao SAR tomorrow, we need the
participation and creative ideas from all Macao residents," said
Pun Hun Veng, member of the Preparatory Committee, who heads the
working committee for the handover under the Macao Association of
Trade Unions.
</P>
<P>
"Our group is to listen to opinions from all our members on the
issues the Preparatory Committee is to address, and submit our
suggestions on those issues," Pun added.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said that his group will also make more efforts
to spread the knowledge of the Macao Basic Law among members and
other citizens in Macao.
</P>
<P>
The emergence of these groups has been applauded by local
media, which said it shows the enthusiasm of Macao residents for
the upcoming return to the motherland in 1999.
</P>
<P>
"These groups will help canvas opinions from all walks of life
in Macao," said a commentary in the newspaper Va Kio. "It also
shows the support and care for the work of the Preparatory
Committee and their great attention to the formation of the future
Macao SAR."

<HEADLINE> Cambodia's Constitutional Council Holds First Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The first meeting of Cambodia's
Constitutional Council, crucial to the forthcoming elections, was
held on Monday, with former Supreme Court President Chan Sok
chosen as its president.
</P>
<P>
Seven of the Constitutional Council's nine appointees attended
the meeting, which lasted nearly four hours, and Chan Sok won five
votes in a secret ballot.
</P>
<P>
Chan Sok, 69, said that the Constitutional Council could then
carry out its duty. The council, sworn in on June 2, is the final
arbiter on the constitutionality of laws.
</P>
<P>
Two attempts to hold such a meeting failed due to a boycott by
two senior members, Chau Sen Cocsal Chhum and Son Sann, who were
appointed by King Norodom Sihanouk.
</P>
<P>
The two were still absent at Monday's meeting, but it reached a
required quorum of seven.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was called and chaired by the third eldest royal
appointee, Pung Peng Cheng, who declared on Saturday that he would
resign after the meeting due to his old age.
</P>
<P>
Opposition critics, however, complained that most members of
the council were biased towards the Cambodian People's Party.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Eases in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The downward trend in inflation
that started in March continued into May in Kenya, said the June
edition of Monthly Economic Review by the Central Bank of Kenya
(CBK) available Monday.
</P>
<P>
The decline is a result of improved supplies of basic foods
during the second quarter of 1998, the sustained slowdown in the
expansion of money supply, and the general stability in the
shilling exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
The underlying three-month annualized inflation fell to 3.3
percent in May from 34.2 percent in March and 25.9 percent in
April.
</P>
<P>
The underlying month-on-month inflation declined to 10.8
percent in May from 12.3 percent in April while underlying
average annual inflation increased to 7.7 percent in May from 7.4
percent in April.
</P>
<P>
The response of the average index is slow because of the price
increases early this year.
</P>
<P>
Overall inflation also continued to decline, with the
three-month annualized inflation falling to 0.6 percent in May
from 34.7 percent in March and 13.1 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
The overall month-on-month and average annual inflation also
declined to 4.6 and 8.8 percent in May from 7.0 and 9.9 percent
in April respectively.
</P>
<P>
The month-on-month inflation for the lower income group fell
for the third consecutive month to 2.7 percent in May compared
with 7.1 percent in March and 5.9 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
The month-on-month inflation for the middle and upper income
groups however rose to 11.0 percent and 11.4 percent from 10.5
percent and 10.6 percent respectively in April.
</P>
<P>
The down in the underlying inflation was explained by the
sustained slow expansion of broad money supply consistent with
the slowdown in aggregate demand, said the CBK review.
</P>
<P>
The continued stability in the Shilling exchange rate also
helped to dampen the inflationary pressures implicit in import
pricing.
</P>
<P>
To confine the month-on-month inflation to the target range of
less than five percent by June, 1999, the annual expansion in
broad money supply should be maintained at below 10.0 percent,
said the bank.
</P>
<P>
The CBK also predicted that inflation is to continue declining
in the months ahead.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Near to Being Free of U.N. Sanctions: Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Chief U.N. arms inspector Richard
Butler said here on Monday that Iraq is near to being free of
trade embargo if it continues fulfilling its promises of
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"The light at the end of the tunnel is today more visible than
it has been for a very long time, and we all welcome that," Butler
told a press conference before ending his five-day visit to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"I am very positive about this, this is good news, provided
Iraq ... gives us access to the materials and documents" about the
weapons program, then "we will verify these materials quickly and
honestly," he added.
</P>
<P>
Butler is the chairman of the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM)
charged with overseeing the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
Only when the UNSCOM verifies that Iraq has destroyed the
banned weapons, will the U.N. Security Council lift the crippling
economic sanctions imposed on Iraq in 1990 after its invasion of
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Butler said the UNSCOM and Iraq have reached an agreement on the
program of work for the next two months. But he did not disclose
the details.
</P>
<P>
The UNSCOM and Iraq reached an agreement Sunday night on the
program of work, a timetable for the completion of work, on
outstanding disarmament issues for the next two months, Butler
said.
</P>
<P>
Butler arrived here last Thursday for talks with Iraqi
government officials.
</P>
<P>
He held "long and detailed" discussions with Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz on arms inspections "on a technical level and
on a policy level" in the past days, he said.

<HEADLINE> Economists Recommend Easier Loans for Smaller Firms (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Some of China's leading economists
have suggested that if the country is to achieve eight-percent
economic growth this year it should encourage non-governmental
investment and make it easier for medium- and small-sized
enterprises to obtain bank loans.
</P>
<P>
"Spurring non-governmental investment is quite important now,"
said Prof. Lin Yifu of Beijing University's China Economic
Research Center. "Most governmental investment is for
infrastructure construction, while that from non-government sources
goes mainly into the production sectors."
</P>
<P>
The economist noted that medium- and small-sized enterprises,
including joint ventures, and township and private firms, which
need less capital but can provide more working opportunities, have
so far been the major force speeding up China's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Qiu Zhaoxiang of the China Financial Institute agreed on
the vital role played by medium- and small-sized firms for China's
economic growth at a symposium on regional economic development
here.

<HEADLINE> S. African Govt to Unveil New Anti-AIDS Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 15 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's
special anti-AIDS team under Deputy President Thabo Mbeki has
developed an 80-million-Rand (15-million-U.S.-Dollar) plan, due
to be discussed at a national conference in August.
</P>
<P>
"In view of the seriousness of the HIV/AIDS epidemic,
the government will take a leadership role in mobilizing all sectors
in a comprehensive campaign to ensure a reduction in the spread
of HIV infection," the daily Citizen Monday quoted an official
summary of the plan as saying.
</P>
<P>
The plan goes into details of what different sectors of
the society should do as part of the mass campaign.
</P>
<P>
For example, the presidency "should incorporate AIDS-relevant
messages in all public speeches."  The South African
Broadcasting Corporation, as public broadcaster, "should carry
daily messages during prime time... and present information on
the subject of AIDS."
</P>
<P>
The document said that 0.76 percent of South Africans were
infected in 1990, but since then the figure has increased more
than 21 times, to 16 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
According to a 1997 antenatal survey, 16 percent of women
attending antenatal clinics tested HIV-positive.
</P>
<P>
This showed that the epidemic
was spreading across the country in an alarming rate.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 2.8 million of the 38 million population
have been infected with the virus and an average of 1,500 South
Africans are being infected every day.
</P>
<P>
"It is projected that by the year 2000, more than three
million people will be infected with the virus," the document
said.
</P>
<P>
The death of economically active people in the age group from
25 to 45 years has resulted in an estimated 8.2 million orphans
across the world, with 100,000 of these in South Africa's
Kwazulu-Natal province alone.
</P>
<P>
Kwazulu-Natal has the highest infection rate in South Africa.
According to the antenatal survey, 26.9 percent of women
attending antenatal clinics in the province were HIV-positive.
</P>
<P>
Health Minister Nkosazana Zuma attributed the fast
spread of the disease to poverty, lack of education, migrant
labor, high rates of sexually-transmitted diseases,
discrimination against infected people, and the breakdown of the
moral fiber of the society.

<HEADLINE> FIFA Condemns Marseille Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
PARIS, June 15 (Xinhua) -- World governing body of football FIFA
condemned the violent clashes involving English fans at Marseille.
</P>
<P>
FIFA president Sepp Blatter said:"What can we do to combat these
individuals? We must get rid of them, stop them from entering
stadiums and return them to their countries. Football is a game and
must bring joy to the whole world."
</P>
<P>
In the routine FIFA briefing on Monday, FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper
said:"The fear is that the better-known ringleaders are still on their
way to Marseille. The fact that they are coming so late proves that
they are not interested in the football, only what comes after."
</P>
<P>
Some 1,900 policemen were patrolling Marseille, anticipating
more violence before the England-Tunisia match.
</P>
<P>
The violence was also condemned in England, but England soccer
officials denied the possibilities the England team withdraw from the
World Cup.
</P>
<P>
Brian Hayes, English Football Association security advisor,
said: "That's absolute rubbish. The England team have been training
for years, they've qualified, they're here as of right. This is
nothing to do with football, this is just sheer hooliganism and
drunkenness."
</P>
<P>
In the clashes at Marseille, 50 people had been arrested, at
least 30 of them from England and the others from Tunisia.
Altogether 37 people were injured, including an English man who had
his throat slashed.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's IT Industry Lagging Behind: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Kenya remains east Africa's
largest information technology (IT) market valued at some 63.5
million U.S. Dollars but it is growing much slower than Uganda
and Tanzania, according to a Kenya-based IT firm's survey.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's IT sector is depressed with a growth rate of only four
percent compared to 25 percent and 18 percent respectively in
Tanzania and Uganda, the East African weekly quoted the survey by
the Telecom Forum Africa company as saying Monday.
</P>
<P>
The survey estimates east Africa's market investment this year
at 18 billion Kenya Shillings (285.7 million U.S. Dollars), of
which more than 50 percent is in Kenya, 30 percent in Tanzania
and below 20 percent in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The survey predicts that 30,000 personal computers will be
sold in the region by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
"The 18 billion Kenyan Shillings (to be invested in 1998) are half
of the estimated potential. The Zimbabwe, Botswana region has
close to three times the value of the east African market," said
Marcel Werner, the Managing Director of Telecom Forum Africa.
</P>
<P>
The collective IT market in the region in 1997 was 99 million
U.S. Dollars of which Kenya has 64 million U.S. Dollars with
Uganda 19.9 million U.S. Dollars and Tanzania 14.8 million
Dollars. The sum is expected to grow to 108 million U.S. Dollars
this year.
</P>
<P>
Werner cited the slow liberalization of parastatal companies
in the region as a cause of the depressed market as well as high
interest rates in Kenya, which discouraged private investors
from buying computers.
</P>
<P>
The survey puts the use of computers in Kenya's private sector
is at a growth rate of 4.3 percent compared to 30 percent in
Uganda and 36.9 percent in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The highest PC users listed in the survey are governments and
parastatals.
</P>
<P>
Of the manufacturing companies surveyed, Compaq PCs were
ranked as the market leader in the region followed by IBM. Compaq
sales were pegged at 43 percent in the market while IBM were at
28 percent.
</P>
<P>
Other brands varied in rank from country to country including
Hewlett-Packard, ICL, Dell and others.
</P>
<P>
Francis Hook, research manager at the company, said that clone or
copy computers which had infiltrated the market at the onset of
computer use have been phased out to a share of just two percent
by the big brands.
</P>
<P>
Kenya is the biggest computer vendor with 2,400 units sold in
1997 in the east African region while 1,250 and 900 units were
sold in Uganda and Tanzania respectively.
</P>
<P>
The survey indicates that computer software sales comprised 16
percent of the IT market value or 15.4 million U.S. Dollars in
1997. Kenya leads the spending on software followed by Uganda
and Tanzania.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Jumps Above 146 Yen in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar jumped over two yen in
Tokyo on Monday, hitting 146 yen for the first time in almost eight
years, as Japan's weak economy continued to weigh down the country's
currency.
</P>
<P>
The dollar was quoted at 146.43-46 yen at 5 p.m. (local time), up
sharply from 144.63-66 yen at 9 a.m., and 144.15-25 yen late Friday in
New York.
</P>
<P>
During the day, the dollar hit a high of 146.58 yen, a level last
seen in Tokyo on August 22, 1990, when it went as high as 146.95 yen.
</P>
<P>
The bearishness toward the yen prevailed on pessimism about the
weak Japanese economy, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
The yen-holding sentiment was further damaged during the day by the
plummet in stock markets around the region, including those of Hong
Kong, South Korea, Thailand and Tokyo, they added.
</P>
<P>
The key Nikkei average of Tokyo stock prices closed below the
15,000 line for the first time since January, ending at 14,825.17,
down 197.16 points from Friday.
</P>
<P>
Market players remain pessimistic as Japanese authorities appear
lethagic in taking measures to pump up the economy, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
With nothing changing in Japan, the yen will not fall sharply but
will continue to weaken against the dollar, an analyst said.

<HEADLINE> Tree-planting Drive Starts in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- A three-month long countrywide tree
planting drive began Monday in Bangladesh with an aim to enhance
tree-planting awareness among the people.
</P>
<P>
President Shahabuddin Ahmed and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina
issued messages separately on the eve of the drive, calling upon
all to take part in the drive to save the country's environment.
</P>
<P>
"Large scale tree planting can meet the demands for shelter and
fodder of wild animals," Hasina said in her message.
</P>
<P>
She urged people to refrain from indiscriminate felling of
trees to save the country from environment degradation.
</P>
<P>
She also called for making optimum use of land by planting
trees on marginal lands, courtyards, pond borderlines, roadsides,
embankments and canals since Bangladesh is one of the most
densely-populated countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
A fortnight-long cultural program would also be held in the
capital city of Dhaka in observance of the drive.
</P>
<P>
The objective of organizing the grass root-level drive is to
achieve the goal of planting at least two trees -- one
fruit-bearing tree and one fine wood tree -- at every house
throughout the country with a population of 127 million living in
about 20 million households.

today voiced the hope that the Japanese government and other
relative departments will adopt effective measures to stabilize
Japan's economy.
</P>
<P>
He said the financial crisis has produced a big impact on the
economies of Asian countries, and that the recent continued

economies in Asia, Li added.
</P>

former Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Nikaido Susumu here this

that Susumu and other Japanese friends will continue to dedicate
themselves to the growth of Sino-Japanese ties.
</P>

China and Japan would inherit and carry forward the traditional
friendship shared by their elder generations.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that this year marks the 20th anniversary of
the signing of the Sino-Japanese Treaty of Peace and Friendship
and President Jiang Zemin is expected to pay a historically
significant visit to Japan this fall.
</P>
<P>
The relations between China and Japan are now at the critical
moment of inheriting the past and ushering into the future, Li
noted, adding that China values its good-neighborly ties with
Japan.
</P>
<P>
China and Japan should advance their cooperation and foster a
long-term, good-neighborly relationship on the basis of adhering
to the principles set in Sino-Japanese Joint Statement and
Sino-Japanese Treaty of Peace and Friendship, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Susumu said it is his 20th visit to China since 1972 and in

achievements in the country's politics, economy, culture and other
fields.

exercise outside Kosovo without taking into consideration Russia's
opinion," the Interfax news agency quoted a source with the
Russian Defense Ministry as saying on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Lt.-Gen. Viktor Zavarzin, the Russian envoy to NATO, is
expected to return to Moscow on Tuesday, one day after the NATO
exercise begins in Albania and Macedonia on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Russia has repeatedly voiced its opposition to any military
settlement by NATO to the crisis in the Yugoslav region where
ethnic Albanians, who account for 90 percent of the population,
are demanding independence from the Yugoslav Republic of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
More than 250 people have died there in clashes between
government forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army, the armed wing
of the Albanian independence movement.
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, a Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman said it is
"of crucial importance" that the NATO exercise "not provoke either
the Albanian community in Kosovo or Belgrade to escalate (tension)
and give diplomats a possibility to work on settling the Kosovo
conflict," Interfax reports said.
</P>
<P>
"Political means must be used first of all for resolving the
conflict in Kosovo," Vladimir Rakhmanin, the spokesman, said.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic will arrive in Moscow
later on Monday for a visit that is expected to focus on the
Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to meet Russian President Boris Yeltsin on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We are putting great hopes on this meeting" Rakhmanin said.

caused investors to dump shares.
</P>
<P>
Bank shares fell to fresh year lows on renewed pessimism over
the economy and rising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Total market volume fell to 119.49 million units, valued at
248.88 million Singapore dollars (142.22 million U.S. dollars).
There were 29 rises against 313 falls while 248 other counters
remained unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Taxation Administration Vows to Reach Tax Income Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Jin Renqing, director of the State
General Administration of Taxation, today urged the national
taxation system to overcome difficulties and reach this year's
target of increasing tax revenue by 80 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released during today's session of a national
taxation conference show that national industrial and commercial
tax revenue through the end of May stood at 304.57 billion yuan,
(36.7 billion US dollars) up 7.9 percent on last year's same
period. Value-added and consumption tax revenues for the period
grew by one percent to 151.78 billion yuan (18.3 billion US
dollars). However, both figures failed to achieve the planned
growth rate.
</P>
<P>
Jin said that the major factors accounting for slower than
expected growth included the impact of Asian financial crisis, the
declining efficiency of state-owned enterprises and the slow
growth rate for exports.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Jin urged the national taxation system to accelerate
taxation efforts by reducing tax arrears, strengthening tax audits
and introducing strong punishment for tax evasion.

<TEXT>

<P>
PARIS, June 15 (Xinhua) -- FIFA President Joseph Sepp Blatter
held a press conference after Croatia-Jamaica match later on Sunday
night and praised the "storming start" of the World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
Blatter said:"The game is in good shape. I have rarely known such
a storming start to a World Cup, with such attractive football. I've
always said that with thirt-two teams in the final competition, teams
will have to play to win, and not simply to avoid losing."
</P>
<P>
"The players as a whole are disciplined and the referees'
performance has been good up to now. I have no other adjective to
add for the moment." Blatter said.
</P>
<P>
As a response to the statements of French President Jacques
Chirac who said on Sunday that FIFA was entirely respenisble for the
ticketing situation, Blatter said:"It is not for me to comment on
the statements of Jacques Chirac. It is the joint responsibility of
FIFA and the French Organising Committee. We must learn from this
situation and make sure that it never happens again. It is not
solely the problem of football, it is a global problem."

<HEADLINE> Norway, Scotland to Play Crucial Group Match </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BORDEAUX, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Norway and Scotland will play
their second group match on Tuesday with both teams needing to win.
</P>
<P>
The Norway-Scotland match will open the second round of the
group competitions and the World Cup pressure mounts.
</P>
<P>
As Norway will play their last group match against Brazil, so
they needs a victory against Scotland to have any chance of
progressing past the first round for the first time. Only the top
two teams from each group qualify for the knock-out stage.
</P>
<P>
And if Scotland lose the match, they will become the first team
to be out of the World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
Scotland coach Craig Brown knows that his team have the ability to
beat either Norway or Morocco. If they can win the two matches, the
Scottish team will ensure a passage to the second round despite
skipper Gary McAllister being ruled out of World Cup finals due to
injury.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to turn things around, Brown is likely to replace
Darren Jackson with either Craig Burley or Billy McKinlay.
</P>
<P>
"I will certainly think about adjusting tactically for the next
game and we may also look at changing the personnel."
</P>
<P>
Norway coach Egil Olsen said he would not change his
tactics:"Maybe our style evolves around a lot of high balls and
set-pieces, but that won't change against Scotland."
</P>
<P>
Norway have remained unbeaten for 17 months. The Norwegian
public are expecting their team to go beyond the first round for the
first time in three World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
Midfielder Oyvind Leonhardsen, who plays for England club
Liverpool, said he expected a much-improved performance compared to
the Morocco match.
</P>
<P>
"I think we are all a bit relaxed now. We've got our first match
out of the way. We know we can do a lot better than we did against
Morocco." said Leonhardsen.
</P>
<P>
The Norway-Scotland match will be played at Bordeaux on Tuesday.

<P>
TOKYO, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices continued plunging in Tokyo
Monday with the key Nikkei index closing below the 15,000 line for the
first time in five months, as investors remained worried about the
declining yen and Japan's stagnant economy.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost 197.16 points, or 1.31
percent, from last Friday's close to finish at 14,825.17. The index
last closed below 15,000 on January 13, when it ended at 14,755.94.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
issues on the major section, dropped 10.04 points or 0.85 percent to
1,167.21.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the First Section declined to an estimated 300 million
shares, well off from 818 million shares recorded Friday when special
quotation for futures prices was being set.
</P>
<P>
Nippon Steel was Monday's most heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
The nonstop fall of the yen against the dollar is causing
considerable concern on Asian stock markets and Tokyo is no exception.
The dollar hit the 145 yen level in Tokyo on Monday for the first time
since August 27, 1990.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the downward spiral of the Hong Kong market darkened
the already pessimistic mood among Tokyo-based investors.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,336 issues listed on the First Section, losers outpaced
gainers 679 to 430, with 177 issues remaining unchanged.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 15 (Xinhua) -- A high-level seminar on managing
capital flows opened here Monday, with a call on Asian countries
to "promote a better understanding of policy responses required to
deal with large-scale capital flows".
</P>
<P>
In a keynote speech, Thai Deputy Prime Minister Supachai
Pantitchpakdi said, "The restoration of confidence should be our
top priority so that the influx of international capital resume."
</P>
<P>
"In this regard, recovery and growth are best achieved through
macroeconomic stabilization policies, coupled with structural
reforms, particularly through the liberalization of trade and
financial markets," Supachai said.
</P>
<P>
He said the movements of money and capital, as well as private
financial flows, cannot be left entirely to market forces without
incurring tremendous risks.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, we need a framework of surveillance and supervision
designed to prevent a recurrence of the present crisis without
hampering further liberalization of our economies," he said.
</P>
<P>
The two-day seminar was jointly organized by the U.N. Economic
and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), the Asian
Development Bank, the World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
Among the topics for discussion are macroeconomic developments
and policy lessons, financial sector reforms in Asian economies,
sound practices to facilitate development of the financial sector
and corporate governance in East Asia.
</P>
<P>
"Drawing on the experience of the recent economic and financial
crises in the region, participants will identify ways and means to
manage capital flows to be able to reap their benefits while
avoiding their disruptive consequences," an ESCAP official said.
</P>
<P>
ESCAP Secretary-General Andrianus Mooy said the process of
globalization brings risks, especially considering the speed with
which private capital crosses borders.
</P>
<P>
"Unless such risks are managed effectively, the gains and
confidence achieved through years of hard work can be undermined
quickly and dramatically. This is precisely what happened in
several countries in East and Southeast Asia," he said.
</P>
<P>
Officials from nearly 30 countries took part in the seminar,
entitled "Managing Capital Flows: National and International
Dimensions".

<HEADLINE> Donors Urged to Boost Zambia's Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has called on the donor
community to offer financial support for creating a credit
facility to be accessed by the Zambians willing to invest in
tourism.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Zambia Daily Mail at the weekend, Tourism
Deputy Minister Cecil Holmes said that the Zambian government is
making efforts to ensure that the tourism industry do not
collapse, which is published by the newspaper Monday.
</P>
<P>
Holmes urged donors to emulate the World Bank which gave the
Ministry of Commerce about 40 million U.S. Dollars for a credit
scheme for small entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
"We would be very glad to see donors helping us in the same
way the World Bank did to the Ministry of Commerce," he said.
</P>
<P>
The creating of a credit facility will enable the Zambians to
invest in tourism and not to leave the business to foreigners
alone, the deputy minister added.
</P>
<P>
he stressed that it is important that the Zambians venture
into tourism because their profits will be ploughed back into
Zambia's economy rather than leaving it to the foreigners who
reinvest their returns in their countries of origin.
</P>
<P>
Holmes cited the inadequate information flow from Zambia to
the outside world as the major factor behind Zambia's bad
performance in the tourism sector.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need to allocate more funds to the Zambia
National Tourist Board to enable it to adequately market the
country's tourism potential in other countries.
</P>
<P>
Zambia has vast potential of tourist resources such as wildlife
and unspoiled scenery, but its tourism is far from being
developed due to insufficient investment in the industry.

<P>
BEIJING, June 15 (Xinhua) -- (Editor's Notes: Xinhua reporters
recently interviewed representatives from China's political,
economic and military circles in advance of U.S. President Bill
Clinton's coming visit to China later this month. The interviewees
responded with in-depth views concerning wide-ranging questions
related to Sino-U.S. exchanges and cooperation and approaches for
advancing the development of bilateral relations. Today's
exclusive interview with Zeng Peiyan, minister in charge of the
State Development Planning Commission, is the first in a series of
exclusive interview stories scheduled for release over the next
few days.)
</P>
<P>
China, the world's largest developing country, and the United
States, the world's largest developed nation, are confident and
capable of advancing bilateral economic and trade cooperation
which is "mutually beneficial and compatible with the advantages
of each side," according to Zeng Peiyan, the senior Chinese
official in charge of macroeconomic planning.
</P>
<P>
Zeng, minister in charge of the State Development Planning
Commission, underlined that bilateral ties "are not only in the
interests of the two peoples, but also play a due role in global
economic growth."
</P>
<P>
Sino-U.S. economic and trade ties are an integral part of "the
Sino-U.S. constructive strategic partnership," said Zeng, adding
that "related cooperation has ushered in a new era amidst constant
improving state-to-state relations over recent years, particularly
since Chinese President Jiang Zemin's U.S. visit last fall."

"China's civil aviation sector alone has already ordered 387
Boeing and McDonnell Douglas aircraft valued at 18.3 billion
U.S. dollars. Some 60 percent of China's aircraft fleet was
manufactured in the United States," according to Zeng. He added
that the Shanghai Aviation Industrial Corp. and McDonnell Douglas,
which recently merged with Boeing, have jointly assembled 35 MD-82
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Zeng commented that the energy, environment and infrastructure
sectors in the two countries have also enjoyed "fruitful"
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese and U.S. governments signed the Proposal on
Sino-U.S. Energy and Environmental Cooperation and unveiled the
full-range of cooperation in the fields during the fall visit by
President Jiang.
</P>
<P>
A report issued by Zeng's commission shows that a large number
of Chinese power plants have imported power-generating equipment
from the United States. American enterprises have 17 bids from
Chinese power plants since 1992, with the total contract value of
approaching two billion U.S. dollars. Zeng further indicated that
Chinese and U.S. companies are expected to sign contracts for more
projects during coming US President Clinton's visit, including a
contract calling for the joint construction of the second-phase
project at the Wenzhou Power Plant in east China's Zhejiang
Province.

Another column of troops moving northward captured an important
 rebel stronghold west of Mankulam town Sunday evening. M1-24
helicopters of the air force effectively supported the advancing
troops, spokesman Ink Dewage said.
</P>
<P>
During the day troops engaged and killed five rebels northeast
of Mankulam town. At present, strategically important Mankulam
junction is virtually surrounded by the troops, said Dewage,
adding that the Tamil rebels are in disarray due to their
inability to repel the attacks by the advancing troops and
continue to hold onto Mankulam junction.
</P>
<P>
The fighting took place after the troops continued their
advance to recapture the strategic Mankulam town on its way to
clear a 75-km route between the South and the North launched in
May last year.
</P>
<P>
The Tamil rebels are fighting for a separate state homeland for
 minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east in a war which
began in 1983.

<HEADLINE> Newcastle Vaccination Drive Launched in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe Monday has started a
nationwide Newcastle disease vaccination campaign for over one
year for mainly chickens and ostriches, the daily Herald reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Lands and Agriculture Kumbirai Kangai Sunday
received 15 million doses of V4 Newcastle disease vaccine to be
used in the exercise from the United Nations Food and Agriculture
Organization.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a handing-over ceremony here, Kangai was happy
that people in communal areas who depend most on poultry for food
would benefit from the free campaign.
</P>
<P>
Ostrich meat exports to Europe and other developed countries
are threatened by the presence of Newcastle disease, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that it is important that the virus is eradicated if
exports are to be protected especially at a time when the new
ostrich industry is now earning valuable foreign currency for the
country.
</P>
<P>
Newcastle disease is contagious and affects birds. Almost all
poultry exposed to the virus die from the disease.

Moreover, American corporations have actively cooperated and
joined in the development of China's petroleum industry, with a
total of 98 contracts and agreements inked for both onshore and
offshore oil exploration and development. The State Development
Planning Commission and the U.S. departments of commerce and
energy plan to expand cooperation in the field by jointly hosting
the Sino-U.S. Oil and Natural Gas Forum and a conference on energy
fund-raising in the second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
With regard to clean energy sphere, relevant companies from the
two nations are currently exploring coal-bed gas reserves in north
China's Shanxi Province, an area with abundant resources. "Certain
projects will generate investments of over a billion U.S. dollars
in the near future," said Zeng.
</P>
<P>
"China's economic growth and market potential obviously offer
sufficient room for furthering Sino-U.S. economic cooperation,"
said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Zeng said that China will invest 1,100 billion U.S. dollars in
infrastructure and import commodities valued at over 600 billion
dollars in the remaining three years of this century. In addition,
China will increase its installed generating capacity by 200
million kilowatts and increase its telephone switching capacity by
200 million lines over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
The minister pointed to the "unprecedented" development scale
in the petrochemical, electronics and automobile manufacturing
industries, as well as in the development of railways and
high-speed rail systems, urban light-track commuter systems,
highway and airport construction, aircraft manufacturing and
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
China's ongoing reforms are expected to generate a huge demand
for wide-ranging service industries, including the finance,
insurance, consulting, accounting and commodity wholesaling and
retail sectors.
</P>
<P>
The ability of American enterprises to use their technical
edge, competitive prices, highly developed services and the active
involvement of financial institutions to seize opportunities "will
depend on whether or not the United States adjusts its China
policy," said Zeng.

Zeng noted that China has urged the U.S. government to ease
technical export limitations on China and remove barriers such as
the annual review of China's Most Favored Nation status and entry
into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
Limitations on high-tech exports will weaken the competitive
edge of U.S. enterprises, said Zeng. For example, U.S. nuclear
energy enterprises failed to get "major opportunities" to
participate in China's nuclear power development program due to
the delayed congressional approval of the Sino-U.S. Agreement on
the Peaceful Use of Nuclear Power which the two governments signed
early in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he added, "the conservative attitude of American
financial institutions has created unfavorable fund-raising
conditions which have prevented certain American power generation
equipment producers from bidding on highly profitable contract."
</P>
<P>
Zeng went on to say that bilateral cooperation in many fields
will have room for further expansion in the future. "In additon to
promoting cooperation between large enterprises, the two
governments should enage in special efforts to create beneficial
conditions and provide assistance to promote cooperation between
small- to medium-sized enterprises," according to Zeng.

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Turkish Ties Not Directed At </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Ambassador to Turkey Uri
Bar-Ner has denied that the Israeli-Turkish military cooperation
is directed at Syria, a foe of both countries.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Turkish Daily News, which was
published Monday, Bar-Ner said that this cooperation does not
constitute a threat to Syria.
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to fight with Turkey against Syria, and
Turkey is not going to fight with Israel against Syria," Bar-Ner
said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Turco-Israeli military cooperation was aimed
at creating a peaceful environment for themselves and the Middle
East as well.
</P>
<P>
"What it (the Israeli-Turkish cooperation) will do will be to
tell Syria that it has to seek peace and stop supporting
terrorism," said the Israeli ambassador.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he admitted that Israel and Turkey, which have big
defense establishments in the region, are joining together to
"work with the whole interest of creating a deterrent."
</P>
<P>
Israel and Turkey both share bitter relations with Damascus
due to various reasons and they accuse Syria of supporting
terrorist activities.
</P>
<P>
Bar-Ner declined to comment on whether Jordan, an Arab country,
is participating the Turkish-Israeli military cooperation.
</P>
<P>
There were reports that Jordian pilots would receive training
in Turkey as Turkish pilots went to Israel for flight practices.
</P>
<P>
"They feel that Israel, Turkey and Jordan are working
together. I hope it will eventually be more in the economic field
than anything else," Bar-Ner said.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Turkey have signed a series of military and defense
accords under which they share airspace and bases for training
purposes.
</P>
<P>
The rapidly expanding Turkish-Israeli military cooperation has
prompted serious concern among Arab countries who fear it would
change the region's balance of power.
</P>
<P>
Some Arab states also feel restless about Jordan's closer
ties with Turkey and Israel.

<HEADLINE> Cargo Prices on Transatlantic Route Tumble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Cargo prices on the transatlantic
route have reached a 10-year low, reflecting a decline in overall
trade between sub-Saharan Africa and the United States in recent
months.
</P>
<P>
Goods and raw materials can now be transported in both
directions for as low as 4,000 U.S. Dollars for a 40-foot
container and 2,000 U.S. Dollars for a 20-foot box, the East
African weekly newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The rates represent a reduction of up to 50 percent from the
charges five years ago, said the report quoting articles from the
June edition of the Journal of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
The volume of commerce was relatively high as recently as the
third quarter of 1997, but it has since dropped significantly for
a combination of reasons, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
One factor is the strength of the U.S. Dollar, which has made
American exports considerably more expensive for African buyers.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, they have turned to alternative sources in Asia.
The fall in value of many currencies there has enhanced the
competitiveness of Asian suppliers.
</P>
<P>
Soft global demand for both oil and gold has further
contributed to the slackening of U.S.-Africa trade.
</P>
<P>
"We are moving mining equipment at lower volumes right now
because gold prices internationally are so poor that there is no
incentive for the mines to undertake additional explorations,"
said Christian Holm, owner's representative for Torm Lines.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is almost the same for oil," he added.
</P>
<P>
Cocoa, traditionally an important commodity in west Africa's
trade with the U.S., is currently not exported at all, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
Shipments will resume with the start of the cocoa harvest in
November, but prices are expected to remain comparatively low.
Cocoa rates have fallen by as much as 50 percent during the past
few years.
</P>
<P>
Carriers on the Africa-U.S. route can achieve significant
savings by transshipping via Europe, but that option results in
much longer transit times, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Cargo sent directly between Africa and the U.S. arrives in
three to four weeks, while transshipments through European ports
can take twice as long.
</P>
<P>
Air freight offers a speedier but much more expensive option
for American businesses shipping high-priority goods to Africa.
</P>
<P>
However, even by air, door-to-door delivery time may be as
long as a full week, according to Bruce Rea, Vice-President of
the Georgia-based arm of a South African manufacturer of lorries
used in construction.
</P>
<P>
Rea said that he relies on air freight for "urgent traffic"
such as air conditioning units and radiators.
</P>
<P>
It was said that some African governments are making progress
in privatizing port facilities. But major obstacles must still
be overcome before foreign investors agree to share in the risks
associated with these privatization initiatives.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration has made strong efforts to interest
American investors in opportunities at African ports that are
being privatized, the report claimed.

CAIRO, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Tower Semiconductor and Motorola are holding talks
on setting up a joint venture in Israel to produce semiconductors,
the daily newspaper Haaretz reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
It said the two companies based in the United States are
estimated to invest about 1.2 billion U.S. dollars in the project.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel's industrial exports stood at 1.61 billion
dollars in May, 4.6 percent more than the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Most of the growth was gained in the sectors of medical
equipment and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Jordan's export of fruits and vegetables increased by
4 percent in 1997 compared with that in 1996, the Jordan Times
newspaper reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The United Arab Emirates topped the list of importers, which
was followed by Kuwait, Lebanon, Qatar, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia,
Oman and Iraq, Director General of the Jordanian Agricultural
Marketing Organization Salem Lawzi said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Only 1.3 percent of the total exports in 1997 went to non-Arab
countries, Lawzi added.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the increase to his organization's continued
efforts to open more markets for the kingdom's agricultural
products.
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY -- The domestic tourism in Saudi Arabia has been
growing annually by 10 percent, the Saudi English-language daily
Arab News reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
General Manager of the Saudi Public Transport Co. Abdulaziz
Al-Ohali attributed the growth to the accomplishment of major
infrastructural projects and quality service provided by public
tourism and transport services.
</P>
<P>
Abdulaziz said that some major infrastructural projects, such
as hotels and other accommodation facilities, have been completed
in well-known scenic spots.
</P>
<P>
Besides, media's support in highlighting tourism attractions
has also contributed to the tourism development, he added.

<HEADLINE> English Fans Go on Rampage in Marseille </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MARSEILLE, France, June 15 (Xinhua) -- About 200 English fans
rioted Marseille on Sunday night, smashing shops and damaging cars on
the eve of a World Cup game here.
</P>
<P>
Police equipped with the helmets and shields fired tear gas to
contain the violence, which led the arrest of around 30 English
supporters.
</P>
<P>
At least two injured English fans were described as in serious
condition in local hospital while about twenty other fans suffered
minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
This was the scenes that the French authories feared most before
the World Cup kicked off last Wednesday and the riots here eventually
caused the cancellation of a free concert in the city Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
The trouble started on Saturday night but spilled over to Sunday
when rival fans from England and Tunisia clashed with each other,
hurling bottles and exchanged verbal abuses.
</P>
<P>
Their soccer squads are to face each other in Group G in the World
Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
Marseille press lamented the early breakout of hooliganism in the
five-week competition, with major newspaper La Provence crying "The
Hooligans Have been Unleashed Already".
</P>
<P>
In London, British Sports Minister Tony Banks described the
trouble-makers "drunken, brain-dead louts," while Home Secretary Jack
Straw said French police had full support of the British government.
</P>
<P>
Over 10,000 English fans were expected to pour into the city for
the match. On the other side, the French authorities planned to
deploy almost 2,000 police officers and 100 anti-riot CRS policemen.

<P>
MANILA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine currency peso Monday
fell sharply against the U.S. dollar as a result of the continued
weakness of the Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
The peso plunged to a four-month low of 42.55 pesos a dollar to
close the day's trading, down by 5.7 percent from last Thursday's
trading.
</P>
<P>
Analysts and dealers said the weaker yen aroused fears of
another round of financial crisis in Asia and raised the spector
that the regional economy would contract further.
</P>
<P>
At press time, the yen fell to 146.27 yen per dollar, the
lowest in eight years.
</P>
<P>
The sentiment also sent the Philippine stock market into
turmoil, driving the composite index of the Philippine Stock
Exchange to drop 82 points to a record low of 1,746,86 points in
recent months.

<P>
HARARE, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African Development
Community (SADC) countries will have a maize deficit of 1.35
million tons for the 1998/99 marketing year, according to a
latest SADC bulletin.
</P>
<P>
The daily Herald Monday quoted the bulletin of the SADC
Regional Early Warning Unit as saying that the SADC member
countries are expected to harvest 16.73 million tons of maize in
this season against last season's 17 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The unit attributes the decline in total maize harvest to
erratic rainfalls and reduced plantings in some countries and
long spells of overcast weather in others.
</P>
<P>
Current assessments indicated substantial maize deficits in
Zimbabwe with 646,000 tons, Zambia 209,000 tons, Angola 322,000
tons, Namibia 140,000 tons, and Lesotho 196,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
However, on individual basis, Mozambique, South Africa and
Tanzania are projected to have maize surpluses of 134,000 tons,
386,000 tons and 89,000 tons respectively.

<HEADLINE> HK, Australian Ties Important: Tung Chee Hwa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, Australia, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Hong Kong Chief
Executive Tung Chee Hwa stressed here Monday the importance of the
relationship between Hong Kong and Australia, saying the purpose
of his ongoing visit is to make sure the relationship is further
enhanced.
</P>
<P>
"Taking this opportunity of being here in Australia, and here
in Sydney I also have chances to discuss with many (political and
business) leaders how important this Hong Kong and Australian
relationship is," said Tung, chief executive of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China,
who arrived here Sunday morning on a three-day visit to Australia.
</P>
<P>
He said, "The purpose of my trip is to make sure this
relationship is further enhanced because it is not just the trade
and investment relationship, it is also people's relationship:
thousands of (Hong Kong) students are studying here."
</P>
<P>
"We have many (people) who migrated to this great city living
here. Equally, there're 30,000 Australians working in Hong Kong,"
he told reporters at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said late last
month that Hong Kong is Australia's eighth largest export market
and fourth largest source of investment.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, more than 13,770 students from Hong Kong came to
Australia for full-time study, the fourth largest source of
overseas students for Australia, Downer said.
</P>
<P>
Asked how soon Hong Kong economy would recover from recession,
Tung said the economy would continue to be difficult for the
future, but in the longer term... it would rebound strongly.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the rumor that the Chinese government might
back
away from its pledge not to devalue its currency Renminbi, Tung
said, "I cannot see a devaluation of the Renminbi at all".
</P>
<P>
He explained that the leadership in China had made it very
clear
that they would not devalue the currency and "I have every belief
that this policy will not change."
</P>
<P>
"From the economic point of view...looking at the economic
fundamentals... Chinese exports increased in the first quarter of
this year by about 12 percent. And it (China) had a trade surplus
of 8.7 billion (U.S.) dollars," he added. "Foreign direct
investment in the first quarter also increased by close to 10
percent...All these fundamental figures ...tell you that
devaluation is not in the cards."
</P>
<P>
"I think there is no need for China to devalue its currency
both politically and economically," he said.
</P>
<P>
In response to another question, Tung said, "Australia has been
a very successful, tolerant society, which practices
multi-culturalism. This is where Australia's strength is. And I
cannot imagine Australia deviating from this very successful
practice of the past."
</P>
<P>
Tung left Sydney Monday afternoon for Melbourne, where he is
scheduled to meet with Australian Prime Minister John Howard and
Deputy Prime Minister and Trade Minister Tim Fischer and other
senior federal and state officials Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The HK chief executive is scheduled to leave Melbourne
Wednesday for a three-day visit to New Zealand.

<HEADLINE> Sino-British Cooperation on Poverty-Elimination Discussed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 15 (Xinhua) -- China will continue to seek
international cooperation for its poverty-alleviation effort, a
senior Chinese official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Britain has provided China with donation and loans, and the two
countries have conducted good cooperation in China's poverty
alleviation endeavor, said Vice-Minister of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation Sun Zhenyu during his talks with British
Secretary of State for International Development Clare Short.
</P>
<P>
Sun said that the mixture of donation and loans has been used
in China's 40-plus projects for poverty-alleviation.
</P>
<P>
The new British government changed its cooperation policy with
China by mainly providing it with donations rather than mixture of
loans, he noted, and the Chinese government respects this policy
change.
</P>
<P>
Sun expressed his hope that new cooperative projects and
related measures between the two countries will be implemented at
an earlier date.
</P>
<P>
Short said the policy change of her government is aimed at more
effective use of Britain's assistance to China, and that the
amount of the fund will not be reduced.
</P>
<P>
The British government hopes that the fund will be used in the
areas of environmental protection, health care, the reform of
primary education and China's state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Short and her party are currently on a visit to China at the
invitation of Chinese Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation Shi Guangsheng.

<HEADLINE> Hunan Expands Use of Farm Machinery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Hunan Province, a major grain
production base in central China, has extended great effort to
ensure the effective use of farm machinery.
</P>
<P>
The province has introduced some 115,000 pieces of farm
machinery annually since 1993. Hunan's farm machinery has a total
capacity of 16.9 million kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
This summer's demand for small combines, a relatively expensive
piece of farm machinery priced at 12,000 yuan, has far outstripped
supply. Brisk sales have also been recorded for machinery such as
seeders, transport vehicles and irrigation and drainage
equipment.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show the province achieved a 64 percent
mechanization rate for 1997 and projections call for farm
machinery to be used on 2.8 million ha in 1998, up 200,000 ha on
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The number of individuals purchasing farm machinery continues to
grow and agricultural service companies have emerged as a major
consumer force. Related companies operate large fleets of farm
machinery and routinely contract irrigation and drainage projects
for farmers.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Minister On Poverty Alleviation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Fifty percent of Bangladesh's 127
million people are still living below the poverty line, press
reports said Monday.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Minister for Local Government, Rural
Development and Cooperatives Zillur Rahman while addressing a
workshop on strategies for poverty eradication here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Poverty alleviation was the most vital part of the national
development policies, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that poverty alleviation could be achieved through
expansion of productive employment and income generating
activities, human resources development, larger participation of
women and youth in the development process, building of physical
infrastructure in the rural areas and development of rural
institutions.
</P>
<P>
The government was committed to evolving a permanent and
fruitful method of service system to improve the condition of the
rural poor, he stated.
</P>
<P>
The fifth 5-Year Plan (1998-2002) took a comprehensive view of
rural poverty, he said, adding the government had allocated 87
billion taka (about 1.89 billion U.S. dollars) in the current
5-year plan as against only 19.6 billion taka (about 426 million
dollars) allocated in the previous 5-year plan.
</P>
<P>
The gigantic task of rural development required well-defined
strategies and concerted efforts by efficient organizations such
as ministries as well as other government and non-government
agencies, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Food production of the country had almost reached the level of
self-sufficiency, population growth had slowed down, access to
safe drinking water had increased, primary education was expanding
rapidly with significant increase in literacy rate and rural women
were gaining economic and social freedom, he told the workshop.
</P>
<P>
These had been achieved through decades of endeavors by both
government and non-government organizations, he added.
</P>
<P>
As an agriculture-based country, Bangladesh has over 80 percent
of people living in the rural areas where the people living below
the poverty line account for more than 80 percent of the total
number of the poor people.

<HEADLINE> ECOTONE Regional Seminar Opens in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, June 15 (Xinhua) -- A five-day ECOTONE regional seminar
for Southeast and East Asia opened here Monday to discuss
integrated coastal zone management in the region.
</P>
<P>
The seventh seminar of its series, organized by the National
Commission for Environmental Affairs (NCEA) of Myanmar and the
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization
(UNESCO), is being participated by experts from Cambodia, China,
Indonesia, Malaysia, Japan, the Philippines, Vietnam, South Korea,
and host Myanmar as well as the UNESCO.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar Foreign Minister U Ohn Gyaw said in his opening address
that his country has envisaged the establishment of an appropriate
coordinating mechanism for integrated management and sustainable
development of coastal and marine areas and their resources at
both local and national levels.
</P>
<P>
"In comparison with other countries, the status of Myanmar's
coastal area is relatively good, however, the exploitation of
mangroves for the production of charcoal has resulted in the
depletion of mangroves in the Ayeyawaddy delta," said U Ohn Gyaw
who is also chairman of the NCEA.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar government, he said, is now making efforts with
community participation to rehabilitate mangroves in the country's
delta area especially in the Bogalay township where mangroves
depletion and coastal erosion resulted in loss of fisheries.
</P>
<P>
The coastline of Myanmar stretches for more than 1,600
kilometers and its coastal areas have rich natural resources.
</P>
<P>
The ECOTONE Seminar, held since 1992 in Malaysia, provides an
annual forum for scientists, resource managers and administrators
in the region to exchange views, experiences, information and
knowledge on problems and issues related to ecotonal systems in
the region.

BANGKOK, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The State Railway of Thailand
(SRT) will have its new on-line ticketing service launched in
August, the Bangkok Post reporter here Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, the 500-million-baht (11.6 million
U.S. dollar) seat ticketing and reservation system (Star 2)
project would boost ticket sales and modernize the way booking is
handled.

Preeda Pramote, the private company which won the bidding of
the project, will invest in the installation of the computerized
system and in return, it will be allowed to collect income from
the share of ticket sales over a 10-year concession.

SRT officials said the new system would speed up booking and
make the service more convenient for passengers, adding it would
also plug the leakage of state revenue through unmonitored ticket
sales.

The new system will also record important data which enables
the SRT to cater to the customers' demand more efficiently, they
said.

<P>
BANGKOK, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Under the pressure of serious
financial problems, many private hospitals in Thailand have to
begin seeking foreign partners for survival, the Bangkok Post said
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, the first foreign investment in a
Thai private hospital is expected within the next few months.
</P>
<P>
Deputy chief executive administrator of Bangkok General
Hospital (BGH) Dr. Krittavith Lertutsahakul informed that the
hospital was negotiating with foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Investors from Singapore, Australia and Sweden have expressed
an interest in investing in private Thai hospitals, the newspapers
said.
</P>
<P>
Private hospitals, expanded rapidly in past years, are now
finding it difficult to maintain their services because of the
economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
More and more people prefer buying over-the-counter drugs to
going to hospitals for medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
Private hospitals are faced with three alternatives to survive,
namely staff reductions, greater specialization, or finding a
foreign partner.
</P>
<P>
Krittavith said he believed foreign participation would improve
the standard of services at hospitals due to foreigners'
experience and know-how.

JAKARTA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian legislators have asked
the United States to ensure that American aid is not used to
finance activities which would interfere in the country's domestic
affairs, The Jakarta Post reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Six legislators delivered two letters, one addressed to U.S.
President Bill Clinton and the other to U.S. Congress, to U.S.
Ambassador J. Stapleton Roy here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The two letters were signed by 89 members of the 500-member
House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted legislator Abu Hasan Sazili as saying that
they were concerned over American news reports that suggested the
aid will benefit those whose aims were not in the national
interest.
</P>
<P>
"We asked that in the future the aid be continued and increased
but with tighter supervision to ensure that it is for the welfare
of the people," Abu said.
</P>
<P>
The letter expressed concern that despite knowing that this aid
was being "misused", the U.S. government did nothing about it.
</P>
<P>
The letter warned that inappropriate action would only worsen
Indonesia's economy and cause the people further despair.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Myanmar's Forestry Rises 1.3 Percent in 1997-98 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar's forestry rose 1.3 percent
in its production in the 1997-98 fiscal year ended March,
according to the latest official statistics.
</P>
<P>
The rise was due to a slight increase in production of hardwood
and other forest products, said a report on the country's
financial, economic and social conditions issued by the Ministry
of National Planning and Economic Development.
</P>
<P>
The production of hardwood increased to 195,694 cubic meters
from 192,440 cubic meters, fuel wood to 255,690 cubic meters from
251,021 cubic meters and charcoal to 254,700 cubic meters from
212,250 cubic meters, while that of teak decreased to 283,000
cubic meters from 287,000 cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
The export quantity of the country's teak went to 215,448 cubic
meters in the fiscal year, while that of hardwood stood at 142,915
cubic meters, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar undertook some measures in the 1997-98 to enable
long-term commercial extraction of its forest products without
depleting the forest resources, ensuring environmental
conservation, ecological preservation and promotion of
manufacture of value-added finished wood products.
</P>
<P>
In forest conservation, total reserved forest area increased to
106,247 square kilometers in 1997-98 from 2,358 square kilometers
in the previous fiscal year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
During the fiscal year, plantation of 900,000 teak trees and
2.8 million hardwood trees as well as 11.2 million saplings by the
public were carried out, it said.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is rich in forest resources with forest covering about
51 percent of its total land area. The output value of the
forestry sector accounts for 1 percent of the country's gross
domestic product.

BANGKOK, June 15 (Xinhua) -- A prominent Thai economist have
called on the United States and Japan to coordinate their
macro-economic policies to solve the current economic crisis in
Asia, the Nation reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The United States should expand its money supply or cut
interest rates, while Japan should spend more through a greater
budget deficit, Teerana Bhongmakapat, associate professor at
Chulalongkorn University's economics faculty, suggested over the
weekend when commenting on the free-fall of the Japanese yen
during the past week.
</P>
<P>
The sharp slide in the yen and the sharp appreciation of the
U.S. dollar have come about because both countries have been
focusing on their own domestic economic objectives, the Nation
quoted Teerana as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, the Asian financial crisis has already spread to other
parts of the world, and a second Asian crisis is set to be
unleashed because of the weak yen, he said.
</P>
<P>
If the world's two biggest economies do not adopt international
economic objectives, a global financial crisis will come soon in
which Europe and the United States will not escape unhurt, the
economist warned.
</P>
<P>
Teerana suggested the U.S. Federal Reserve buy more domestic
bonds or foreign assets, which will result in injection of money
supply into the market and could bring the interest rates down.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Japanese government should expand government
expenditure by running a greater fiscal deficit to stimulate
domestic demand, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government should sell bonds in the domestic
market to get funds which will push up interest rates and curb
capital outflows, he added.

<HEADLINE> Shanxi Improves Safety in State Coal Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Shanxi Province, China's leading
coal producer, has significantly improved safety in major
state-owned coal mines in the first four months of the year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Provincial Coal Industry Department, the
overall mortality rate for that period plummeted by 91 percent to
an all-time low of 0.05 per person for every one million tons
mined.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin praised the achievement in a letter to
the director of the Provincial Coal Industry Department. "Continue
your effort and do a better job in both production and safety in
operation."
</P>
<P>
Shanxi produces an average 340 million tons of coal annually,
about a quarter of China's total. It suspended production during
February celebrations of the Spring Festival, the traditional
period for celebrating Chinese Lunar New Year, to conduct a
comprehensive inspection of safety measures and eliminate safety
hazards.

FUZHOU, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Meteorologists from eastern
China's Fujian Province and Taiwan has initiated a joint research
project to forecast typhoons and torrential rains which commonly
hit areas near the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists from Fujian and Taiwan have engaged in extensive

<HEADLINE> Bulls Beats Jazz 4-2 to Win NBA Finals for Sixth Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Michael Jordon scored a series
high 45 points to help the Chicago Bulls beat the Utah Jazz 87-86
in the NBA Finals to wrap up the series 4-2 in Salt Lake City on
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
It is the sixth championship the Bulls have won in this decade,
and it is also their second third staight victory in NBA history.
Ironicly, it is also a repeat defeat for the Jazz who lost last
season's series with the same score.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, perhaps the greatest NBA player ever, rose at the
crucial occasion with 5.2 seconds left, burying a jumper to lead
the score 87-86. The sixth time NBA Finals MVP had a tremendous
show in his "last dance" tonight, turning the whole game to a solo
show.
</P>
<P>
Karl Malone hit 31 points to lead Utah's scorers.
</P>
<P>
With Scottie Pippen hobbled by a back injury, the Bulls had to
rely on Jordan completely.
</P>
<P>
With the Jazz led 86-85 and the time was left 15 seconds,
Jordan poked the ball away from Malone and created a golden chance
for the Bulls to turn the tide.
</P>
<P>
Jordan dribbled to the foul line, dropping his defender, and
leaped up to hit his winning jumper. The shot found the bottom of
the net dramatically with only 5.2 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
The Jazz still had one more chance, but John Stockton's
three-pointer effort fell just short before the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
Jordan had a 15-of-35 shooting, including three shots beyond
the arc. His highest score was 55 in 1993 when the Bulls played
against Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
Jordan was rewarded with his sixth finals MVP trophy. Now, the
world is waiting Jordan's decision: will the greatest basketballer
want to retire after this brilliant win?

<HEADLINE> Feature: Expectation from Clinton's Hometown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 14 (Xinhua) -- They are modest and amicable,
warmhearted and hospitable. When talking about President Bill
Clinton's upcoming visit to China, they feel proud of their former
governor and curious to know more about that Asian country.
</P>
<P>
"The world is too small," said local government officials,
educators and businessmen who were happy to meet the Chinese press
in Littlerock, where Clinton governed Arkansas for 12 years and
campaigned hard for his way to the White House. "A lot of people,
if not all, in his hometown will certainly watch TV coverage of
Bill's China trip," confirmed Skip Rutherford, director of the
Presidential Library Project.
</P>
<P>
"China is still a mystery to many people in the United States
and I think we should try to learn more about other countries
which might not share our belief, instead of trying to impose our
ideas," said the president's staunch supporter, who was believed
to contribute a lot to his success in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Skip said that the first thing he wants to do is to finance his
children's travels aboard, including trips to China, to enrich
their knowledge, if he's better off. He believes that President
Clinton's trip to China will help people understand the mystery
better.
</P>
<P>
Eventually it is no longer a mystery for all. Jim Dailey, mayor
of Littlerock, has travelled to China twice since his city
established a sistership with Chang Chun, provincial capital of Ji
Lin in Northeastern China, in 1994. He was astonished to notice at
his first trip that a sign of welcome held high by his Chinese
host at the airport wronged his city as "Little Stone" in
Chinese. But when he flew to Chang Chun for the second time and
visited an elementary school, he was very much touched to hear
pupils greeting him "Dailey, Welcome" in English.
</P>
<P>
Sharon Piest, Secretary of State of Arkansas, hasn't been able
to visit China so far. However, she knows the importance of
engaging that country in every field and supports Clinton's
summit meeting with Chinese President Jiang Zemin. "It is in the
interests of both side to understand each other better and
cooperate with each other better," said Sharon, who ranks third in
the Arkansas government.
</P>
<P>
Marolyn Chambers-Dorman, vice president of Riceland Lecithin
Division, shared the belief. She traveled to Shanghai recently to
assess the China's market potential for Lecithin, a nutriment
extracted from soybean. The conclusion was encouraging and she was
quick to realize that "Shanghai is a real business metropolis like
Tokyo and New York." She is now awaiting delegations from
Shanghai and Heilongjiang to explore the possibility of
establishing joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
Winrock International, a non-profit institute dedicated to
agriculture development worldwide, is working on The Lead21
Program with various Chinese partners. The program builds on
China's existing Ph.D. programs in agricultural economics by
strengthening course work and applied research at participating
institutes. "We lately opened an office in Beijing," said Mary
Laurie, public affairs director.
</P>
<P>
Academic exchanges are also gaining momentum, as described by
William Goolsby, Donaghey Dean of Business Administration of
Arkansas University. His faculty agreed in May to accept 35
students from Tianjin University of Finance and Economics this
year as a first step toward closer cooperative ties.
</P>
<P>
Arkansas University also set up a China-America center for
statistics and economic research, providing opportunities for both
Chinese and U.S. scholars to work together. The center has
launched a research program on cotton infestations and diseases in
Xinjiang and other places in Western China. The university's
Fulbright College of Arts and Sciences is also seeking expanded
China programs. "We are ready to accept Chinese students in
hundreds and to expand exchanges with our Chinese counterparts,"
said Mark Cory, associate dean.
</P>
<P>
Dave Mcmahen of Impuls company based in Russellville sounded
confident to succeed in his joint venture with China's Sundiro.
Motorcycle parts would be shipped from China's Hainan province and
assembled in Arkansas before the Chinese products go to the
American markets. "It is the first Chinese foothold in Arkansas so
far and I'm sure it will be enough competitive," said Dave at a
construction site. The plant will be operational in September.
</P>
<P>
People in Hope, Clinton's birthplace, are more enthusiastic
about the president's trip to China. "Bill is intelligent and
smart enough to tide over the controversy," said Joe Purvis, a
lawyer and President Clinton's childhood friend. He was referring
to the pressure brought on the president not to visit China this
time.
</P>
<P>
"That's really great," said in one tone Clinton's relatives,
friends and mayor Ramsey who gathered at a humble two-storey house
where President Clinton grew until age of four. They are anxious
to know if First Lady Hillary will be going with the president.

<HEADLINE> NATO Planes Ready for Show of Strength in Balkans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 14 (Xinhua) -- About 40 NATO warplanes are waiting
at an airbase in northern Italy for an air exercise to
begin early Monday morning over Albania and Macedonia, which
border the Yugoslav province of Kosovo, NATO officials said.
</P>
<P>
The operation, code-named Determined Falcon involving nine
countries, is intended to step up pressure on Yugoslav President
Slobaodan Milosevic to negotiate an end to his conflict with
ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of Kosovo's population.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by NATO in Brussels on
Saturday said the operation is to demonstrate NATO's "capacity to
rapidly stage a show of strength" in the Balkans region.
</P>
<P>
The exercise will include fighters, reconnaissance planes,
airborne early warning systems, air refueling tankers and
helicopters, operating from the Aviano airbase north of Venice and
from an American amphibious task force in the Adriatic Sea.
</P>
<P>
Countries sending aircraft for the manoeuvre are Belgium,
Britain, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Turkey
and the United States.
</P>
<P>
NATO's action comes as the conflict in Kosovo is turning
increasingly violent.
</P>
<P>
More than 300 people have died and some 65,000 people been made
refugees since the Serb-led government of the Yugoslav federation
began a military crackdown on the ethnic Albanian independence
movement in Kosovo early this year.

<HEADLINE>   Clinton's China Visit to Contribute to Regional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) expressed the hope
that U.S. President Bill Clinton's forthcoming visit to China will
contribute to the regional stability.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua here recently, ASEAN
Secretary General Rodolfo C. Severino pointed out that the visit
by the U.S. president to China is a good thing.
</P>
<P>
In this time of economic globalization and financial crisis, it
is good for the world that the most powerful economy and the
biggest developing country get together and have an understanding
of what is required by both the developed and developing countries
in overcoming this crisis, he said.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the visit could strengthen relations between
China and the U.S.
</P>
<P>
"Good relations between China and the U.S. are good for the
international community and for regional stability. So I think
that this kind of inter-action, this kind of relationship should
be increased," Severino said.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question about the role China and the U.S. have
played and should play in the international arena, Severino was
glad to see that both China and the U.S. participated in the ASEAN
Regional Forum (ARF), established in July 1994 on the initiative
of ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN invites foreign ministers from China, the U.S., the
European Union, Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand,
Canada, Russia, Papua New Guinea, Laos and Cambodia to discuss
political issues and security situation in the Asia Pacific area
under the ARF annually.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN secretary general stressed that ASEAN has taken the
lead in organizing the ARF.
</P>
<P>
"And in that way, all the participants in the ARF have a better
understanding of what's China position and what's U.S. position,"
the General Secretary said, adding that he hoped China and the
U.S. have better understanding of each other's position.
</P>
<P>
AS an important regional organization, ASEAN has played a very
significant role in maintaining peace and stability in the region
as well as economic development and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"In order to continue to play that role, ASEAN must move
forward on its own solidarity, it's activity in the world
affairs," Severino explained.
</P>
<P>
On the China-ASEAN relations, the secretary general said that
ASEAN has very good relations both with the U.S. and China.
</P>
<P>
Recalling the ASEAN-China senior officials' consultations held
in April this year, he said the consultations which he attended
"are very good because the best yield has seen."
</P>
<P>
If ASEAN and China keep it up and refrain from acts that would
harm the security of each other, "ASEAN-China relations will keep
growing in the future for the benefit of both," Severino
concluded.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Tightens Rules for Entry of New Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the Philippines
has approved stricter rules for the entry of new banks to
strengthen the banking industry and protect it from further
internal shocks, Business World reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report said the Monetary Board, the highest policy-making
body of the central bank, wanted to encourage only the better
industry participants by tightening entry and competency
qualification criteria.
</P>
<P>
The Monetary Board approved in its regular meeting last week
three additional requirements in the revised guidelines for
establishing new banks, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the new requirements, each shareholder of the new
bank must submit the statement of income and expenses for the last
three calendar years as proof of sources of income to support net
worth growth.
</P>
<P>
They must also present evidences of asset ownership such as
bank certification, passbook, certificate of time deposit, bond or
stock certificate, tax declaration and others.
</P>
<P>
The shareholders of a foreign bank must also submit
certifications by the home country's supervisory authority that it
has no objection to the investment in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The supervisory authority must also provide adequate
information on the foreign bank and its subsidiaries to the
Philippine central bank to the extent allowed under existing laws.
</P>
<P>
By ensuring that a new bank has good financial backgrounds and
track records, the central bank hopes to prevent situations in
which management or shareholders use the bank as their personal
money bag, central bank governor Gabriel Singson said.

BONN -- German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel stressed on Sunday
that any NATO military intervention in the Serbian province of
Kosovo must first be approved by the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued on Sunday, Kinkel said that the planned
NATO aerial manoeuvres in Albania and the Republic of Macedonia on
Monday could go without U.N. mandate because it takes place in two
countries which have participated in the NATO program of
"Partnership for Peace" and which have given green light to the
exercise.
</P>
<P>
However, in case of a NATO military intervention in Kosovo or
its airspace, an approval by the U.N. Security Council was
required, Kinkel said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> State to Curb Drain of Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The central government is expected
to take measures to curb capital drain from collectively-owned
township enterprises in their structural reform, according to an
official with the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted on the front page of today's China Daily as
saying that the ministry has submitted a draft to the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council,
which are to issue a joint circular on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Collective firms' capital drain, evasion of bank debts, and
their stereotyped reform procedure have been the widespread
problems in the reform drive, said Vice-Minister Qi Jingfa.
</P>
<P>
He noted there are reports saying collective township
enterprises have been sold to individuals at prices much lower
than their real value. "While not wholly true, it has become the
current trend."
</P>
<P>
According to the Vice-Minister, the circular to be issued is
expected to urge local authorities not to register township
enterprises whose ownership is disputed as individual private
business. Any such registration in the past should be corrected.
</P>
<P>
All township authorities are expected to record the collective
capital of enterprises and introduce complete management and
auditing regulation.
</P>
<P>
Qi said that the collective fund, acquired by selling firms or
shares, should not be spent on non-productive issues, or
squandered. And the enterprises should not be interfered by
governments on their decision making.
</P>
<P>
A central government circular issued on Thursday requires
creditor banks to take part in dealing with the debts of firms
undergoing reform in order to prevent them evading their debts.
</P>
<P>
Some 520,000 rural collective enterprises in China, one third
of the total, had been sold, annexed, declared bankrupt or
transformed into shareholding co-operative companies by the end of
last year, according to Jiang Yongtao, director of the ministry's
Township Enterprise Bureau.

<HEADLINE> Edible Oil Abstracted from Tea Seeds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, June 15 (Xinhua) -- After eight years of experiments,
a farmer in east China's Zhejiang Province has developed the
technique of abstracting edible oil from tea seeds, which
otherwise would be thrown away.
</P>
<P>
The technique, pioneered by Fang Shunzhong of Jinhua City, is
purely physical and can abstract 14 kg of fine edible oil of a
transparent yellow color out of 100 kg of tea seeds.
</P>
<P>
Though the idea of abstracting edible oil from tea seeds is not
new, before Fang's innovation, oil abstracted from tea seeds was
turbidly black and bitter in taste, and therefore not suitable for
use in foodstuffs.
</P>
<P>
"Fang's innovation means a lot to tea farmers," said a
spokesman for the Jinhua Lanxiang Green Food Co. Ltd., in which
Fang is a shareholder.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has 1.4 million ha of tea plantations,
yielding more than 800 million kg of tea seeds annually. Only a
few of the seeds are kept for procreation, and the rest are thrown
away.
</P>
<P>
The company is so far the only user of Fang's technique. It
has turned out the first batch of oil, which is expected to be
marketed at 80-90 yuan per kg.
</P>
<P>
Fang, as a tea grower himself, did the research individually,
using 900,000 yuan of his own money.
</P>
<P>
An appraisal report from the China Quality Supervision and
Inspection Center shows that the various indices of Fang's oil
exceed those of the national first-degree edible oil standard.
</P>
<P>
Nutritionists in the Zhejiang food hygiene supervision
department have affirmed that the oil is cholesterol-free and
effective for eliminating non-saturated fatty acid.

<HEADLINE> China Implementing Sustainable Development Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, June 15 (Xinhua) -- China will adopt a wide range of
measures to advance implementation of a sustainable development
strategy, said Pan Wencan, deputy head of the national leading
group for the China 21st Century Agenda, at a symposium held in
this central Chinese city.
</P>
<P>
The measures will include spreading ecological agriculture,
promoting clean production in industrial enterprises, improving
the ecological environment in some selected areas such as major
river valleys, intensifying construction of ecological
shelterbelts and protection of animal and plant resources in
northeast China, and concentrating efforts on developing and
utilizing clean energy, said Pan.
</P>
<P>
China drafted the China 21st Century Agenda in March 1994,
implemented a plan on priority projects to be finished under the
agenda and compiled a national report on China's sustainable
development.
</P>
<P>
So far, 25 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities have
set up their respective leading groups for the China 21st Century
Agenda. Some localities have even worked out their respective
regional 21st century agendas or action plans, as well as priority
projects.
</P>
<P>
China regards its sustainable development strategy as a basic
state policy for the modernization drive, and has urged
different localities and relevant departments to implement the China
21st Century Agenda by writing the guidelines of the agenda into local
economic and social development plans, as well as including the
spirit of the agenda in government decision-making and
management mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
The country has so far designated 50 counties as national-level
bases to experiment with ecological agriculture. In addition, 29
industrial enterprises have realized clean production.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Tightens Rules for Entry of New Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the Philippines
has approved stricter rules for the entry of new banks to
strengthen the banking industry and protect it from further
internal shocks, Business World reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report said the Monetary Board, the highest policy-making
body of the central bank, wanted to encourage only the better
industry participants by tightening entry and competency
qualification criteria.
</P>
<P>
The Monetary Board approved in its regular meeting last week
three additional requirements in the revised guidelines for
establishing new banks, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the new requirements, each shareholder of the new
bank must submit the statement of income and expenses for the last
three calendar years as proof of sources of income to support net
worth growth.
</P>
<P>
They must also present evidences of asset ownership such as
bank certification, passbook, certificate of time deposit, bond or
stock certificate, tax declaration and others.
</P>
<P>
The shareholders of a foreign bank must also submit
certifications by the home country's supervisory authority that it
has no objection to the investment in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The supervisory authority must also provide adequate
information on the foreign bank and its subsidiaries to the
Philippine central bank to the extent allowed under existing laws.
</P>
<P>
By ensuring that a new bank has good financial backgrounds and
track records, the central bank hopes to prevent situations in
which management or shareholders use the bank as their personal
money bag, central bank governor Gabriel Singson said.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Real Estate Investment Remains Stable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Overseas investment in real
estate in the Pudong New Area here, the most vigorous economic
development zone in China, has been affected by the financial
crisis in Southeast Asia, "but only to a limited degree," said Li
Zhanjun, an official at the Pudong Reform and and Development
Institute.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Li said that his
conclusion is based on a detailed analysis of major Pudong
projects financed by Japan, the Republic of Korea, and other
Asian countries and regions affected by the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Li admitted that construction of some real estate projects has
been delayed due to the lack of funds, and foreign investors are
now taking a more prudent attitude toward further investment.
</P>
<P>
"But this does not mean they will withdraw their funds," said
Li, adding that such a delay is somewhat conducive to reducing the
current oversupply in Pudong's real estate market.
</P>
<P>
Li said that projects funded by Japan and Singapore have
suffered the least, with most of them either being completed or
smoothly under way as planned. A residential building, financed by
Japan's Matsushita Electric Works and completed last September, is
30 percent occupied, according to him.
</P>
<P>
Despite severe financial difficulties at home, Republic of Korea
companies are still pressing forward with their projects
here. Some projects may have been delayed, but "that doesn't mean
they will be abandoned," said an official from ROK's Daewoo
Group.
</P>
<P>
Investors from Hong Kong and Taiwan continue to bring in
funds. The Shangri-la Hotel, funded by a Hong Kong company, is
being given the finishing touches preparatory to its expected
opening this October.
</P>
<P>
"Projects with investment from Thailand have suffered the
most," noted Li. Some planned projects now see no prospects of
starting, while some ongoing ones are likely to be
halted. However, investors are still keeping a close eye on
Pudong, Li added.

<HEADLINE> Kinkel Says NATO Intervention in Kosovo Needs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 14 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
stressed on Sunday that any NATO military intervention in the
Serbian province of Kosovo must first be approved by the U.N.
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued on Sunday, Kinkel said that the planned
NATO aerial manoeuvres in Albania and the Republic of Macedonia on
Monday could go without U.N. mandate because it takes place in two
countries which have participated in the NATO program of
"Partnership for Peace" and which have given green light to the
exercise.
</P>
<P>
However, in case of a NATO military intervention in Kosovo or
its airspace, an approval by the U.N. Security Council was
required, Kinkel said.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen said
earlier that a U.N. approval of a NATO intervention in Kosovo was
"desirable, but not necessary".
</P>
<P>
German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe on Sunday also did not
rule out a NATO military action in Kosovo without preceding U.N.
approval.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin is due to meet Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic in Moscow on Tuesday to seek a
peaceful solution to the Kosovo conflict. According to the Russian
news agency Interfax, Yeltsin would reiterate his opposition to a
NATO military intervention.

<HEADLINE> World Economic Growth Dampened by Asian Crisis, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The Asian financial crisis is
expected to slow down the world economic growth this year by as
much as one percent, a survey conducted by the German Ifo economic
research institute said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to a Ifo survey of 420 multinational companies and
economic institutes in 66 countries, the world economy is expected
to grow by 2.5 percent this year. Without the Asian crisis, the
growth rate could be one percentage point higher, Ifo said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the survey also showed that despite the generally
unstable situation at the moment, most of the Asian countries
involved in the financial crisis were expected to see a slight
improvement in their economies in the coming six months.

<HEADLINE> Croatia Too Much for Jamaica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LENS, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Croatia proved that they were too much
for Jamaica to cope with as they scored a convincing win of 3-1 in a
Group H match on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Croatian team, making their first World Cup appearence,
played quite relaxed as most of the team have abundant experences in
top European clubs.
</P>
<P>
They dominated the playing after first 10 minutes and opened the
scoring at the 26th minute through Mario Stanic.
</P>
<P>
The Jamaican team, the other newcomers of the World Cup finals,
fought hard and finally got their first goal at World Cup as Robbie
Earle headed home a long cross at the 45th minute.
</P>
<P>
The second half saw the Croatians enjoy even greater advantage.
Only seven minutes after the game resumed, Robert Prosinecki
beat the Jamaican defenders and goal-keeper with an acute volley.
</P>
<P>
The Croatian team never stopped their attacking thereafter and
Davor Suker consolidated their lead at the 67th minute with a
right-footer which hit the leg of a Jamaican defender and deflected
into the net.
</P>
<P>
Compared with Argentina which beat Japan earlier in another
Group H match, the Croatian team were in better form and have the
ability to challenge Argentina for the top spot of the group.
</P>
<P>
Croatia and Argentina will clash on June 26 in the last round of
the group stage.

<HEADLINE> Zagallo Punctures Brazilian Team's Peak Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
PARIS, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian head coach Mario Zagallo
said his team would peak at the World Cup finals when it matters most.
</P>
<P>
Zagallo said at the Brazilian in Ozoir-La-Ferriere that he saw
clear signs in Sunday's training that his team was improving
steadily.
</P>
<P>
Zagallo said Brazilian poor performances in some of the warm-up
matches were nothing to worry about:"Everything is getting better.
If you reach your peak before the competition starts, then you have
nowhere left to go."
</P>
<P>
"The only way for us to go is up. We are improving each day and
today's training showed this. It's always good to know that you can
produce more." said Zagallo.
</P>
<P>
Zagallo said:"If you get to the top too soon, it's easier to go
down again than to try and maintain the same level."
</P>
<P>
Zagallo rejected the suggestions his remarks about peaking so soon
were aimed at Argentina. The Argentine team played superbly in their
warm-up matches but had a difficult time in the match against Japan.
</P>
<P>
"I really don't want to talk about other teams. Everyone talk
about Brazil but I don't speak about the others." Zagallo said.
