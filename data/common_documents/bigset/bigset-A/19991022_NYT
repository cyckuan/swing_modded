 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
The baseball playoffs have provided enough edge-of-your-seat
moments and spellbinding twists and turns to take us into the next
millennium.
<TEXT>
<P>
   And the World Series hasn't begun.
</P>
<P>
   But does it have a tough act to follow.
</P>
<P>
   How can the Fall Classic possibly top a postseason that already
has produced one amazing comeback, another that fell just short and
a matchup between two of most storied organizations in history?
</P>
<P>
   While fans look ahead in anticipation of a World Series showdown
between the New York Yankees and Atlanta Braves for the title of
``Team of the '90s,'' there has been plenty of reflection on what
many regard as one of the best National League Championship Series
ever.
</P>
<P>
   Refusing to die, the New York Mets mounted a furious comeback
against Atlanta before falling short of becoming the first team to
overcome a 3-0 postseason deficit. The tug-of-war series featured
five games decided by one run and one by two. Two games went extra
innings.
</P>
<P>
   The defining moment of the series came in Game 5, when the Mets
and Braves staged an epic 15-inning battle won by New York on Robin
Ventura's grand-slam-turned-single.
</P>
<P>
   After the Mets rallied from 5-0 and 7-3 deficits to take the
lead, twice, in Game 6, the Braves used a bases-loaded, 11th-inning
walk to set up a rematch of the 1996 Series with the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to take some time during the winter to watch these
games and try to enjoy them like I think millions of people got to
enjoy them,'' Mets manager Bobby Valentine said after the
exhausting yet exhilarating series.
</P>
<P>
   The way the Mets played during the final week of the regular
season and on through the NLCS, Valentine could build a video
library.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing a page from their history book, the Mets were amazin'
in the playoffs, with a late push on the season's final weekend, a
tiebreaker playoff win at Cincinnati to earn the NL wild-card spot,
and a first-round upset of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the thrilling six-game series with Atlanta, which
ranks with the 1986 NLCS between the Astros and Mets and the 1980
Astros-Phillies war as possibly the best ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a broadcaster's standpoint, I think the LCS we just
finished doing was the best one I've ever seen or been involved
with as an analyst,'' said former major-leaguer Joe Morgan, who
teamed with Bob Costas during NBC's coverage and who played for the
1980 Astros.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Mets and Yankees kept alive the idea of the first
Subway Series since 1956.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking, What would a Subway Series be like? I don't
think any of us could imagine what it would have been like. It
would have been a once-in-a-lifetime experience,'' said Yankees
pitcher David Cone, who played six seasons with the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   The postseason excitement has not been limited to the NL.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Red Sox, known more for heartbreak than for success,
completed a stunning turnaround in their AL Division Series against
Cleveland, becoming only the fifth team to rally from an 0-2
deficit to win a best-of-five series.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball got its wish _ an ALCS featuring the Yankees and Red
Sox, arguably the fiercest rivalry in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't have a better scenario to close out the
millennium than the Red Sox against the Yankees for the pennant,''
Yankees pinch hitter Jim Leyritz said.
</P>
<P>
   New York took the first two games, both by one run, before Cy
Young Award favorite Pedro Martinez and the Red Sox handed the
Yankees their most lopsided playoff loss ever, 13-1, in Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees won the final two games for their 36th AL pennant.
</P>
<P>
   In the six playoff series (AL and NL) this year, 13 games were
decided by one or two runs and five have gone extra innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reinforces how many things have to go right to advance,''
Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker said. ``There are some very
good baseball teams sitting home now.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta is making its fifth trip to the World Series in the
1990s but is looking for an elusive second title. The Yankees are
trying for their third title in four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It says something for having been there and knowing what it's
like where you can settle in and do your job,'' Yankees manager Joe
Torre said. ``To repeat after the incredible year we had last year
is quite an accomplishment. Hopefully, we can hold up well in the
World Series.''

education dramatically affects success. Researchers at the
University of North Carolina followed 111 poor, African-American
babies, half of whom had high-quality child care from infancy. As
they turn 21, those in the child-care program are more likely to be
in college or have graduated (35 percent compared to 14 percent)
and hold jobs (65 percent versus 50 percent). They also have higher
IQs (by 14 points) and, on average, had their first baby at age 19

BROOKS: TYSON OLDER, WISER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ It's Tommy Brooks' job to pump up his fighter, to
make the world _ and the fighter _ believe he can accomplish
anything.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he will elicit some chuckles with his response to this
question: Could Mike Tyson ever again resemble the fighter he was a
decade ago?
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually think Mike can be a !ital!better!off! fighter
through maturity,'' said Brooks, whose protege takes on Orlin
Norris in his latest comeback fight here on Saturday. ``Look at the
(Joe) Louises, the (Ray) Robinsons, you learn how to do certain
things after a period of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You become fluent in it. I think that's the point Mike is
coming to in this part of his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks was among those who suspected that the Tyson who swept
through the heavyweight division like a bowling ball through pins
in the '80s is a memory.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't thrown combinations as he once did, he hasn't jabbed,
he hasn't punched to the body, he hasn't bobbed his head and moved
his feet to avoid taking punishment. He has relied solely on his
considerable power to get the job done and that's not always good
enough.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks could attest to this first hand: He was in the corner of
Evander Holyfield as an assistant trainer for both victories over
Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   So, Brooks feared the worst when he took over as Tyson's trainer
before his knockout victory over Francois Botha in January. He
wondered about Tyson both as a person and as a fighter.
</P>
<P>
   He swears he was pleasantly surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, first, I expected him to be a spoiled-rotten kid, a hood
rat who just got lucky and got a lot of money,'' said Brooks, who
is as conservative as Tyson can be wild. ``I was totally wrong.
He's one of the nicest guys I've ever met. I put him in the same
category as Evander.
</P>
<P>
   ``... And he possessed more talent than I thought he had. He can
box, he knows how to fight. He's just been fed the wrong
information.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks said he has yet to have a philosophical chat with Tyson,
so he's not the authority on Mike Tyson the person.
</P>
<P>
   However, he has spent six months with him in training camps. He
knows what the 33-year-old former two-time champion is capable of
doing in the ring, at least the ring in the gym. And he likes what
he sees.
</P>
<P>
   How does he explain Tyson's deterioration? Bad habits that were
re-enforced through repetition and the fact no one around him could
convince him he was doing anything wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks attributed Holyfield's pummeling of Tyson in 1996 _ a
stunning 11th-round knockout _ in part to the fact he had taken
Holyfield lightly and had undertrained. He said he learned recently
that Tyson was in camp only four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   However, he admitted Tyson also was ill-equipped in terms of his
skills: He did nothing right that night.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks also conceded that Tyson's performance against Botha was
a disappointment, at least until he ended a fight he was losing
with one big punch in the fifth round.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson, coming off a 1{-year layoff at that time because of his
suspension for biting Holyfield's ear, fought in the gym the way
Brooks wanted him to fight but reverted to his inferior style once
the fight began.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike was trying to prove something, not only to the public but
to himself,'' Brooks said. ``He wanted people to say, `Mike Tyson
is the baddest man on the planet' again by knocking (Botha) out
with one punch.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what he was doing instead of putting his punches
together like we worked on.''
</P>
<P>
   So where is Tyson now after another layoff, this one nine months
after his second stint in prison?
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Brooks doesn't see him as an old fighter. He's
taken only two beatings in his career _ against Buster Douglas and
Holyfield _ and the long hiatuses have spared his body punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Brooks insists, Tyson has a lot left physically. He
remains quick, both in hand and foot speed, has perfectly good
reflexes and the power will always be there.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson also listens to his trainers, Brooks and Jay Bright, his
former head trainer who goes back to the Cus D'Amato days. Brooks
said Tyson refers to him as ``sir,'' a good sign.
</P>
<P>
   Again, the results are good much of the time in the gym, Brooks
said. Tyson shows glimpses of the terrorizing fighter he once was:
He throws more than one punch at a time and he doesn't telegraph
them, he doesn't stand directly in front of his sparring partners
waiting to be hit and he fights with spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his motivation _ which appears more than ever to be
money, which he needs to pay off debts and support his family _ he
seems to understand what it will take to succeed the fourth time
around.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easier for me to prepare now than when I was younger,''
Tyson said. ``Before, I was more of a loose cannon. I thought I
could conquer the world, but I know it takes a lot of hard work and
sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still young. I feel strong and believe I can compete with
the best of the current crop of heavyweights.''
</P>
<P>
   That's assuming he brings what he learns and does in the gym
into his fights over an extended period of time.
</P>
<P>
   If he does, Brooks is convinced, Tyson could surprise a lot of
people in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a scale of 1 to 10, Mike is about a seven right now,''
Brooks said. ``How long it will take him to get to 10 is up to him.
We're taking it step by step. He has to be able to do what we're
working on in his sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``... And I think he understands. He's got a family to look out
for. He just can't throw caution to the wind anymore. You'll see.
</P>
<P>
   ``... I see Mike retiring as heavyweight champion of the world,
riding off into the sunset with one of his kids on his knee.''

BY WIDE MARGIN, HOUSE RENEWS SCHOOL AID TO THE POOR
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for new updating 13th graf)  (dal) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House, in a rare display of bipartisanship,
voted overwhelmingly on Thursday to renew for five years the
largest federal program to help educate poor children.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers agreed, by a vote of 358-67, to extend Title I, the
federal program that has spent more than $100 billion since its
enactment in 1965 as a cornerstone of President Lyndon Johnson's
Great Society. The program reaches 10 million of the nation's
neediest children.
</P>
<P>
   In a stinging rebuff to conservatives, the House rejected a
voucher plan that could have given families of poor children $3,500
each to attend private schools if their public schools were failing
academically or deemed unsafe. Opponents had expressed fears that
vouchers would drain students _ and, by extension, public money _
away from public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Education has become a battleground issue for candidates in the
2000 presidential and Congressional campaigns, with Republican and
Democratic rivals promising to increase federal spending on
education. The House bill would increase annual spending on the
Title I program to $9.9 billion from $7.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike other hot political issues, like tax cuts or gun
control, in which Democrats and Republicans have seen greater
political advantage in confrontation than compromise, lawmakers
largely buried their party differences on Thursday to show their
support for education.
</P>
<P>
   ``They each want to preserve their role as the education
party,'' said Vicki P. Rafel, vice president for legislation for
the national Parent-Teacher Association.
</P>
<P>
   Passage of the measure marked the third major education bill the
House has approved in a session defined by its lack of significant
accomplishments. In April, Congress approved a bill that gave
states and local schools more flexibility in how they spend more
than $10 billion in federal education money each year. In July, the
House approved a $2 billion bill for teacher training and
recruitment.
</P>
<P>
   Broad bipartisan support for the bill staved off efforts by
conservatives to attach amendments allowing taxpayer-financed
vouchers to private schools for students in academically failing
public schools. Voucher plans would have drawn a sure veto from
President Clinton, dooming the entire bill.
</P>
<P>
   Moderate Republicans, led by Rep. Bill Goodling of Pennsylvania,
chairman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, had
fended off voucher amendments in committee, and joined virtually
all Democrats on Thursday to reject two different voucher
provisions, by votes of 257-166 and 271-153.
</P>
<P>
   One plan offered by the House majority leader, Dick Armey of
Texas, would have set aside $500 million over five years to give
annual vouchers of $3,500 each, redeemable at private schools, to
27,000 students at failing public schools. ``No child should be
trapped in a school that's failing or unsafe,'' Armey said.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents said the voucher plans would siphon taxpayer money
away from public schools that need it the most, and would violate
the constitutional separation of church and state, since many
private schools are church-based.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives suffered another setback when a second
Republican-backed bill to allow states and schools to pool a wide
array of targeted federal education grants into a lump sum that
schools could use for any purpose, was watered down to a pilot
program limited to 10 states.
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday night approved the measure, 213-208, but
the outcome fell short of the votes necessary to override Clinton's
veto threat of the bill, which the administration says helps
children who are neither poor nor low-achieving.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For the past several weeks, Republican moderates have been eager
to show that they could produce a popular education bill free of
the divisive voucher issue. The Title I program provides $300 to
$1,500 a student to schools in almost every congressional district,
enabling principals to hire teachers for remedial classes and buy
textbooks, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which is backed by the Clinton administration, would
require schools to compile new information about the performance of
their students and their schools, and their teachers'
qualifications. Much of this information is rarely disclosed
publicly _ for example, whether teachers are licensed or trained to
teach the class to which they have been assigned.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It would also allow parents in failing schools to transfer their
children to other schools in the same district _ but only those
that are public.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The end result will be that the most disadvantaged youngsters,
the children who need us the most, will benefit from this
program,'' Goodling said. ``They will not continue to be left
behind. We cannot afford to leave them behind.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the House, which is reauthorizing the 1965 Elementary and
Secondary Education Act in pieces, including Title I, the Senate is
wrestling with the entire bill at once. A draft is circulating in
the Senate Health and Education Committee, and could be acted on by
the end of the month.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In two days of floor debate, Representatives this week jousted
over the merits of Title I, and to what extent it had succeeded in
bridging the education gap between the nation's most disadvantaged
and more affluent children.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The results have been mixed,'' Rep. George Miller, D-Calif.,
said on Wednesday. ``We have closed the gap to some extent between
rich and poor, majority and minority students, but the gap remains
wide and it remains open.'' Critics complain that Congress has
poured money into the program for 35 years with scant success. ``It
is really a total failure,'' said Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, who
opposed the bill. ``Yet the money goes up continuously.''

STONEMAN EXPECTED TO BE ANGELS' NEXT GM

 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Bill Stoneman, who grew up in West Covina, is expected
to be named general manager of the Angels today.
</P>
<P>
   Stoneman, 55, met with Disney officials Thursday for his third
interview. He previously met with Angels team president Tony
Tavares and Disney executive Sandy Litvak.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not definitive, they're still finishing up the interview
process,'' Angels spokesman Tim Mead said Thursday. ``But they're
on course. That's probably the direction we need to focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoneman pitched one season with the Angels in 1974, but made
his mark, both as a player and in the front office, with the
Montreal Expos.
</P>
<P>
   Stoneman's latest position with the Expos is vice president of
baseball operations, with financial and administrative
responsibilities for all aspects of the major-league budget. He's
been in the Expos' front office since 1983.
</P>
<P>
   As a player, Stoneman pitched for the Expos from 1969-73,
highlighted by 15 shutouts, including two no-hitters. He no-hit
Philadelphia in 1969 and the Mets in 1972. He also holds several
Expos pitching records.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' other top candidate was former Yankees general
manager Bob Watson. Watson has interviewed twice with the club but
reportedly hasn't spoken with anyone from the Angels in more than a
week.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have been searching for a new general manager since
Oct. 1, when Bill Bavasi resigned after six years as GM.
</P>
<P>
   Updates: Outfielder Garret Anderson and pitcher Troy Percival
underwent surgery Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson had corrective surgery to release a trapped nerve in
his left foot. Percival had right shoulder surgery to shave a bone
spur and clean up a frayed labrum. Both are expected to be ready by
spring training.

MCCAIN DROPS AIR-TOUR PHRASE, KEEPS NOISY FLIGHTS OUT OF CANYON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients)  
 By STEVE YOZWIAK  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
PHOENIX - Working to patch his relations with environmentalists,
Ari zona Sen. John McCain on Oct. 21 removed language in a bill
that could have allowed a noisy air-tour ``free-for-all'' over
Grand Canyon National Park.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Republican presidential candi date dropped a plan that could
have automatically allowed all air-tour aircraft to be considered
``quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a designation would have allowed unlimited numbers of
air-tour flights. McCain's old amend ment, passed last week by the
U.S. Senate, also would have eliminated the curfew on flights over
the eastern end of the Canyon within an hour of sunrise and sunset.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, new language McCain in serted into the bill, which
re-author izes the Federal Aviation Administration, would require
that agency to establish standards for what constitutes ``quiet
aircraft tech nology.''
</P>
<P>
   Helicopters and fixed-wing airplanes that use less noisy
technology would be allowed to fly in newly designated ``quiet
aircraft'' corridors over the Canyon, according to the language
pushed Oct. 21 by McCain through a House-Senate conference
committee.
</P>
<P>
   However, environmentalists and Na tional Park Service officials
argue that no aircraft is ``quiet,'' just less noisy.
</P>
<P>
   Under the language, less noisy air craft would be exempt from
caps on the number of flights over the Canyon set to take effect
Jan. 31, as long as the number of aircraft did not diminish
McCain's 1987 legisla tion calling for ``the substantial
restoration of the natural quiet'' at the park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal from the beginning was to get the action necessary to
address the noise problem at Grand Can yon,'' McCain said. ``I'm
pleased that the agreement will achieve that objective in a manner
that all parties find acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the new language was praised by three prominent envi
ronmental &QL; 
groups, Sierra Club spokesman Rob Smith continued to express
reserva tions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an improvement &QL; 
from the disaster it was going to be,'' Smith said. ``But there are
no quiet aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that if more flights are allowed, there will be more
noise.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Smith called for a complete ban, perhaps in three to
five years, of all aircraft that does not employ so-called quiet
technology.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said his measure, which still must be approved by the
full House and Senate and signed by President Clinton, would create
``appropriate incentives to encourage the transi tion'' to quieter
aircraft ``in a timely manner.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill also calls for the FAA and the Park Service to develop
``air-tour management plans'' to govern where, when, how and even
if tourist aircraft may fly over the nation's parks. Currently, air
tours are con ducted over nearly 100 national parks.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's plan was praised by other environmental groups as a
compro mise with the air-tour industry, which currently makes
117,000 flights annu ally over the Canyon. Environmen talists said
noise from those flights drown ``the natural sounds that are a
unique part of the Canyon's character.''
</P>
<P>
   Geoff Barnard, president of the Flagstaff-based Grand Canyon
Trust, said, ``Senator McCain has retaken the hill, and once again
served notice that he is serious about his defense of the Grand
Canyon.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Kiernan, president of the Na tional Parks and Conservation
Asso ciation, said, ``(McCain's) advocacy of quiet technology will,
over time, make a difference in how park visitors see and hear the
Canyon.'' &QL;

HOME OPENER LEFT ITS MARK ON KINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On the morning after the Kings' home opener, there
was little trace of the club at the Staples Center. The ice was
covered over and the stage put back in place for Thursday night's
Bruce Springsteen concert.
</P>
<P>
   But third-line winger Marko Tuomainen isn't likely to forget his
first game in the new building. He was poked in the left eye during
the second period against Boston and is expected to miss 10 days
beginning with tonight's game against the Phoenix Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is blood in the eye and it will be awhile before he gets
back,'' coach Andy Murray said Thursday at the Iceoplex. ``We'll
have to make a few adjustments.''
</P>
<P>
   Left winger Steve McKenna, who has missed all but one game due
to a torn retina in his left eye, has been cleared to return, but
Murray will decide how soon McKenna plays during today's morning
workout at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Eye injuries are part of hockey, although the numbers are down
because more players, including Kings first-liners Luc Robitaille,
Ziggy Palffy and Jozef Stumpel, are wearing plastic shields on
their helmets. Often that is not enough, though, because stick
blades can get between the face and the shield.
</P>
<P>
   ``And a lot of guys still do not like to wear them,'' Murray
said. ``You grow up playing a certain way and it is hard to
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisheye: There were some complaints from fans in the lower bowl
of the Staples Center that the glass along the boards distorts the
action.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many new arenas that have a clear-glass view of the ice,
the Staples Center uses an older style in which the glass is fitted
into metal slats. One reason is for quick event changes. After
Thursday's concert, the Springsteen stage was struck and the Kings
ice was uncovered. This will happen two more times in the next few
days.
</P>
<P>
   None of the Kings are complaining about the older glass. The
newer version is heavier and very inflexible. There is very little
give, making checks into the boards far more dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix is hot: The Coyotes, who lost to St. Louis in the first
round of the playoffs last spring, are off to their best start in
franchise history. They are 4-1-2 under new coach Bob Francis and
tied with the Kings for third in the Pacific Division despite
playing without top scorer Jeremy Roenick the past four games
during to a suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Roenick, who led the Coyotes with 72 points last season, will
finish the suspension tonight and is scheduled to return Saturday
against the Washington Capitals in Phoenix. He was suspended for
slashing close friend and former Chicago Black Hawks teammate Tony
Amonte on the chin Oct. 8.

STORE OWNER DETAILS GUN BATTLE WITH ROBBERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY HARRISON SHEPPARD  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Three days after a wild shootout with two
robbers, market owner Ralph Gambina recalled the harrowing
experience clearly.
</P>
<P>
   When the two men burst into his store in the Tujunga community
20 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles and demanded cash, he
said, he was ready for trouble: He had a 9 mm Ruger pistol tucked
in the back of his waistband and he wasn't afraid to use it.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a gun in his face, he kept waiting for his moment, for
the time the robbers would slip up and give him a chance to draw.
</P>
<P>
   He would soon get his chance, and when it was all over, a
16-year was lying dead on the floor, and Gambina had a bullet in
his lung.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't breathe'' after being shot, he said Thursday in a
telephone interview from his hospital bed. ``It felt like a knife
in my back. My lung was filling with blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite the pain, he was determined to chase after the
robber who had shot him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was lying on the floor. I wiggled my hands and feet and said
I'm all right. Let's go. So I jumped up and went after him. By the
time I got to the door, he was gone. I went around the corner and
saw his silhouette in the dark.''
</P>
<P>
   Gambina said he always carries a gun on him at the store. His
father was killed in a 1981 robbery and his own store had been
robbed twice in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   The latest robbery began around 11:40 p.m. Monday. Gambina was
alone in the store when two men burst in and demanded cash from the
register.
</P>
<P>
   The larger man, who had a gun, was wearing a ski mask, while the
other had a hood pulled around his face with a drawstring, Gambina
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles County Coroner's Office later identified the
smaller suspect as 16-year-old Louis Manuel Chavez of Altadena, a
city 20 miles northeast of Los Angeles. The other suspect is still
at large.
</P>
<P>
   Gambina acted nervous, telling them ``Don't shoot me, I got four
kids. I'll give you everything I got.'' But in his head, he said,
he thought of the Ruger, and waited for them to make just one
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Since the register was nearly empty, they ordered him to open
the safe. Gambina led the larger man to the back of the store,
while the smaller one rifled through the front counter area and
ripped a telephone out of the wall.
</P>
<P>
   His safe was closed, but unlocked. Gambina turned the dials,
locking it, as he pretended to forget the combination under the
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   He was still waiting for his moment. After the robber gave up on
the safe, they walked back to the front of the store. As he passed
through the doorway, his moment came. Gambina dived behind an
aisle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big guy didn't have a clear shot at me,'' he recalled. ``I
drew my weapon and popped the little guy twice.''
</P>
<P>
   The larger man fired at him, hitting some boxes. Gambina took a
few steps back and tried to fire again, but his gun jammed. He
banged it against the wall, and that was when he got shot once. The
bullet pierced his left side and went through to his lung, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gambina hit the ground. His body hurt, but once he realized he
was going to survive, he stood up. He tried chasing after the other
man, but decided not to follow him into the neighborhood. He
returned to the store and called 911.
</P>
<P>
   As for the young man lying on the floor of his store in a pool
of blood?
</P>
<P>
   ``I kicked him in the head and I said, Was it worth it?''
</P>
<P>
   He had thought the 16-year-old was armed as well, but it turned
out the object in his hand was the store's telephone, Gambina said.
</P>
<P>
   Gambina said he regrets the death of the teen, but felt
justified in defending himself. Police agreed, deciding not to
arrest him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a plain working stiff who wants to do a decent job,'' he
said. He was born in the family's store, he added, and ``I want to
die of old age there.''
</P>
<P>
   Once some gang members tried to steal some beer from his store.
</P>
<P>
   ``I beat them both in the head with a pistol and got my beer
back,'' he said.
</P>

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
On the practice court, the extra pass is made. The defensive switch
comes over. Teammates cover each other's back. Open shots fall.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rockets gush about the collective talent they see. Coaches
see pieces that seem to fit together. And then the Rockets take a
real court, with loud music and a scoreboard that on occasion
successfully keeps score, and everything but the talent disappears.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Rudy Tomjanovich will suffer preseason defeats as part of
the process. The latest, a 110-98 loss Thursday night at Compaq
Center to the even more rebuilt Magic, drove the Rockets' preseason
record to 1-4.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a problem with no easy solution. How does he fix
something that isn't broken when it is time for repairs?
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the negatives outweighed the positives,''
Tomjanovich said. ``The thing that really disappointed me was I
thought we were just too anxious on offense by far. We took a lot
of bad shots. We definitely have skills I think will mesh together.
We never gave it a chance. We didn't deserve to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (the Magic) played as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets called for patience given the changes in their
roster and style. But they played a team that has been almost
completely overhauled, with 24 transactions involving 34 players
since Doc Rivers replaced Chuck Daly as Magic coach. The Magic
(5-0) has two wins over the Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time I thought we were struggling,'' Rivers
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to win and are willing to sacrifice our individual
games,'' said guard Tariq Abdul-Wahad, one of 12 new Magic players.
``It's a brand-new team. Doc and the coaches are doing a great job,
and it's a lot of fun to be in this situation.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Orlando struggled, the Rockets showed few strides in
getting their retooled roster in sync with only three preseason
games left before the start of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I forget about the record,'' Tomjanovich said. ``What concerns
me is I saw individual play. I thought this team on paper,
chemistry-wise, fits. We had too many possessions out there where
we didn't make the right pass. It was very contagious. We were
shooting it with guys in our face. In practice, we pass the heck
out of the ball. But some of the things we work on are not
translating to the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets did finally reduce their turnovers. Averaging 27.5
in their first four games, they had 20. Guards Steve Francis and
Shandon Anderson each had four in 36 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But the perimeter players barely had time to turn the ball over.
They shot quickly and often. Francis, Anderson, Cuttino Mobley and
Bryce Drew combined to make 18 of 48 shots, leaving little time to
get the ball inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played like some garbage,'' said Francis, who had 20 points,
seven assists, four steals and seven rebounds. ``I couldn't buy a
layup. I was missing a lot of layups.''
</P>
<P>
   Center Hakeem Olajuwon made just three of eight shots. Kelvin
Cato had his first poor game offensively, making one of seven
shots.
</P>
<P>
   With Charles Barkley still out with a strained right elbow, many
of the usual low-post options were unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to work toward playing winning basketball and learning
from games like tonight,'' Olajuwon said. ``We need to make a
conscious effort to get good shots every time downcourt. The only
way to win is to play together as a team and feed off each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a conscious effort to make sure we get something every
time, to get good shots. If you get good shots and miss good shots,
nobody can fault you for missing good shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Rockets insisted the time will come. Even with
Barkley and Matt Bullard (sore knee) out, the Rockets used 11
players. Carlos Rogers worked at small forward. Center Thomas
Hamilton played by far the most minutes, 17, that he has in the
preseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main problem is that we don't know each other, and at
times it shows,'' forward Tony Massenburg said. ``A lot of people
have high expectations of us, and we need to work on some things. I
sense that we don't know our roles well so we need to learn what
everybody does best and work together to take advantage of each
person's strengths.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we have everyone trying to do everything. We need
to apply on the game floor what we do well in practice and to
adjust as a team. We need some games under our belt.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Tomjanovich seemed to feel the problem could be greater
than getting acquainted. With practices offering few signs of the
game-time troubles, solutions might have to come in the remaining
preseason games and in the early season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say I'm worried,'' Tomjanovich said. ``I respect
the league. You don't get a bunch of new guys, put them together
and go out and win. I accept that.''
</P>
<P>
   He was not ready to accept what he saw Thursday. But the
solution remains less clear.

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
LAS VEGAS _ It was, Mike Tyson said, a slip of the tongue, not an
exercise to determine whether the chompers were in prime biting,
er, fighting shape.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But in a recent interview with the Los Angeles Times, the
two-time former world heavyweight boxing champion was quoted as
saying were he put in another circumstance similar to his second
fight with Evander Holyfield, he would ``bite again.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the new and improved Mike Tyson? The tamer, gentler soul
supposedly humbled by two prison stays in the last six years and
the 18-month suspension of his boxing license?
</P>
<P>
   In a session with the media Wednesday during the final news
conference before Tyson faces Orlin Norris (50-5, 27 knockouts) at
the MGM Grand Hotel-Casino's Grand Garden Arena on Saturday night,
the ex-champ/ex-con said he should have commented differently to
the LA Times.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if Saturday's non-title fight with Norris starts to
mirror the Holyfield bout would he bite Norris, Tyson on Wednesday
said: ``No, I would never do that again. When I said that, I was
just blowing off hot air. I would never bite anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging from his demeanor at Wednesday's news conference, there
has been a change in Tyson. Oh, there were moments when, seated at
the table with the other fighters on the card and their handlers,
Tyson seemed bored and detached. But he was far less testy, much
more comfortable with the media than has been the case at any point
in his career.
</P>
<P>
   He is, according to his manager of two years, Shelly Finkel,
more at ease on those rare occasions he mingles with the public.
But unfortunately, Tyson, 33, might never shed the image of that
night in July 1997 at the Grand Garden Arena when he bit
Holyfield's ears.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Tyson was taking a beating like none he had received in a
boxing ring, save perhaps for his upset loss to James ``Buster''
Douglas in Tokyo seven years before.
</P>
<P>
   He was asked by the Times, ``When you look back on the second
Holyfield fight, is it hard for you to believe you acted the way
you did and resorted to ear-biting?''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson said, ``I would do it again under those circumstances.
Mills Lane (the referee) wasn't protecting me (from Holyfield
head-butts). He didn't handle the situation appropriately.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of biting Holyfield, Tyson was fined heavily. His
license was put in the deep freeze by the Nevada Athletic
Commission. He got it back in 1998 after protracted commission
hearings during which the contrite Tyson said he never would bite
again, that he was no threat to himself or the sport of boxing.
</P>
<P>
   As his comeback opponent, Tyson chose former International
Boxing Federation heavyweight champ Francois Botha. For four rounds
Jan. 16, 1998, Botha had gotten the best of the once-acclaimed
``baddest man on the planet.'' Then, he became too bold. It opened
the door for Tyson to stave off embarrassment by knocking out Botha
in the fifth round.
</P>
<P>
   Though he lived up to the no-bite promise, the rusty Tyson
couldn't avoid controversy. At one point, when he had little or no
offense and his defense was porous, Tyson locked arms with the
South African and gave them a hard twist.
</P>
<P>
   During the postfight news conference, Tyson admitted he was
``trying to break it.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Tyson was back behind bars. A fender-bender in
Maryland during the summer of '97, after which he punched and
kicked two of the drivers involved, netted him a three-month stay
in jail.
</P>
<P>
   It started badly. Reportedly angered by a guard, Tyson responded
by throwing a television set at him. But for the rest of his
incarceration, Tyson was a model prisoner, earning time off from
the original six-month sentence for good behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Tyson (46-3, 40 knockouts) is back and ready to fight.
Though his weight ballooned to over 280 pounds when he was released
from jail, Tyson is down to 220. Using Phoenix as a training base
most of the last three months, Tyson has honed his skills to a
level close to what he achieved as heavyweight champion, Finkel
said.
</P>
<P>
   And Tyson says all the controversial comments _ about biting
again; about his intent in twisting the arm of Botha _ shouldn't be
taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fight talk, that's all,'' he said. ``Get the people
interested. Make them want to see you do what you do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you ever watched wrestling on TV? When you hear `Stone
Cold' Steve Austin say he's going to give the other guy a
neck-breaker and do this and do that to him, doesn't it make you
want to go out and see the next match or buy the pay-per-view?
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they get me with that; I want to go see it. This is the
same thing. It's just talk, nothing else. You just have to
understand the business. We need to get people out to watch us.
That's how we make our living.''
</P>
<P>
   Finkel, hired as Tyson's adviser around the time the former
champ fired Don King as his promoter and filed a $100 million
lawsuit against him, is amazed at the physical and psychological
changes Tyson has undergone in the past 48 months. The Tyson with
whom he now works, Finkel said, is indeed a kinder, gentler soul,
regardless of the occasional slip of the tongue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully it will continue, because it's wonderful,'' Finkel
said. ``He's doing in and out of the ring what he has to do now.
Look, he's going to say some things because he talks what he
believes or thinks at that moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not always going to be, `Hey, let me think this thing
through before I answer.' So a lot of times he's going to say some
things that later he's sorry he's said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he's told me, `Shel, I don't ever want to be in that
situation (the second Holyfield bout) again, I don't want to be in
prison again. I have some lawsuits I've got to clean up. (But) I
don't want to see court again, I don't ever want to see jail
again.'''

 By JEROME SOLOMON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
LINCOLN, Neb. _ It was like the final bellow from a train
conductor.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``All aboard!''
</P>
<P>
   In two words, the conductor lets everyone know this is the last
chance: Come on if you're coming; stay if you're not.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska's team captains _ cornerback Ralph Brown, rover Mike
Brown, tight end T.J. DeBates and offensive lineman Adam Julch _
called a team meeting and did the same a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   When starting I-back D'Angelo Evans quit the team in September
because he was unhappy with his playing time, the Cornhuskers'
leaders felt they needed to know definitively who wanted to be part
of this year's team.
</P>
<P>
   Evans was not pleased. But the Cornhuskers were 2-0 and had
outscored their opponents 87-7 at the time. When Evans asked to be
reinstated, coach Frank Solich sought input from the team and
eventually told Evans he was not welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Though the decision to deny Evans' return was made by Solich,
the players believed there was no room on the train for anyone who
put his well-being before the team's. That was what was said at the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   All aboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The captains basically just said, `Hey, people that want to be
here, stay. But after all this stuff, we're not going to deal with
it anymore. If you don't want to be here, you can leave now, and no
one is going to say anything,''' junior I-back Dan Alexander said.
``We just advised every player, `If you are going to be here, then
you're going to be a team player. If not, we don't want you.'
</P>
<P>
   ``People have to realize that the program is bigger than any
individual. If any individual is going to bring the program down,
then either that individual has to change or leave. If everybody
understands that, it really helps us get over any petty differences
or petty troubles that happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize this program's going to survive, with or without
us,'' Alexander said. ``We can either add to it or subtract from
it. The goal of everybody that came here was a national
championship, and we all wanted to be a part of a high-caliber
program, so we're all looking to make things better.''
</P>
<P>
   No one accepted the offer to leave. And now, to a man, the
Cornhuskers point to that meeting as the turning point in what they
hope will be a championship season.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander said a ``team-first'' attitude is not an option at
Nebraska; it is a requirement. It is also part of the reason for
the Cornhuskers' success.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska, which is ranked No. 3, takes a 6-0 record to Austin to
face Texas this week. Not many thought the team would handle its
early troubles so well.
</P>
<P>
   They should have known better.
</P>
<P>
   Many times in the past, Nebraska continued to win after dealing
with off-the-field incidents, most notably running back Lawrence
Phillips' six-game sabbatical for assaulting his former girlfriend
during the national championship season of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But this season's distractions _ which included running back
Correll Buckhalter leaving the team for a few days because he also
objected to a lack of playing time, and quarterback Eric Crouch
coming close to doing the same after he was not awarded the
starting job _ were different.
</P>
<P>
   They were different because they came under the watch of Solich,
the second-year coach, whose watch already had gotten off to a
sluggish start. The Cornhuskers lost four games last year, their
first four-loss season since 1968.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (distractions) happen every year, but I think this year
it was magnified a lot because of the positions and players
involved who wanted to leave,'' Ralph Brown said. ``It was kind of
tough. But we pulled together for coach Solich because he was going
through a lot and we pulled together as a team to get back focused
on our goal.''
</P>
<P>
   How Solich handled the situation said a lot about his leadership
ability. He made the difficult choice of denying the talented
Evans, ending an injury-plagued career. On the same day, he moved
quarterback Bobby Newcombe to wingback and inserted Crouch as the
starter.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever else he did, he was able to get his team refocused.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly we went through a point in time there early in the
season where our squad was disrupted, but I thought they worked
through that very well, and right now our chemistry is good,''
Solich said. ``As you go through each year, and as you go through
each week of practice, there are a number of things that jump up at
you and start to slow you down if you're not very careful. I think
this football team has been very good at not letting things get in
their way. I appreciate how they as a team have handled the things
that they have gone through.''
</P>
<P>
   With the distractions behind them, the Cornhuskers seem to have
put it in cruise control.
</P>
<P>
   The week Evans left, Nebraska struggled to beat Southern
Mississippi 20-13. Since then, the Cornhuskers have rolled over
Missouri (40-10), Oklahoma State (38-14) and Iowa State (49-14).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been tough this year, but everyone just understood their
role and did it,'' Brown said. ``I think in the beginning of the
season a couple of players didn't understand their role. Now
everybody does.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that it would pull us together because we have great
character on this team. That's why we're in the position we're in
now _ character. People just want to go out and do it for the team,
not for themselves.''

MORE THAN 100 KILLED IN DEVASTATING GROZNY MISSILE ATTACK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs lede graf to replace the word `bombs' with `explosions') (lh) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ At least 10 explosions devastated a downtown market and
maternity hospital in Grozny, Chechnya, on Thursday evening,
according to reports from the breakaway Russian republic.
</P>
<P>
   The explosions killed scores of people and injured hundreds
more. Chechen officials told The Associated Press that at least 118
people died and upward of 400 were injured, though the reports
could not be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters on the scene told of body parts strewn across market
stalls and corpses stacked in the city's darkened main hospital
after the attacks, which occurred about 6:15 p.m. Thursday, local
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``A huge number of people were killed,'' said Alkha Tosuyev, a
cameraman for the Reuters news agency, describing the scene at the
market. ``Some who were sitting in a cafe, some who were selling
things at booths, some just walking by. Teen-agers. Children. It
was a horror. Counting the wounded was nightmarish.''
</P>
<P>
   Tosuyev said he had counted 60 dead at the market alone.
</P>
<P>
   Chechen officials said the explosions came from ground-to-ground
missiles fired by Russian forces that now are barely more than
eight miles from downtown Grozny. The Associated Press quoted
witnesses as saying Russian warplanes, which were buzzing the city
Thursday night, had bombed the central market.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Russian Defense Ministry flatly denied any
role in the attacks, many of which clustered around the residence
of Chechnya's president, Aslan Maskhadov.
</P>
<P>
   Other senior officials, including Prime Minister Vladimir Putin,
pointedly left open the prospect that troops would invade Grozny.
Putin, in Helsinki, Finland, for a meeting with leaders of the
European Union, said that military moves would ``depend on the
concrete situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Itar-Tass news agency quoted a senior Russian official as
saying troops planned to consolidate their positions around Grozny.
And the deputy defense minister, Gen. Vladimir Toporov, said
Russian soldiers or civil authorities would enter Grozny ``sooner
or later.''
</P>
<P>
   That would set up a confrontation with Chechen armed forces and
rebel guerrillas that the Russian authorities have repeatedly said
they want to avoid. The last time Russian troops tried to crush an
internal revolt in Chechnya, in a two-year war that ended in 1996,
some 80,000 people died, and Grozny was all but leveled by Russian
bombs.
</P>
<P>
   President Boris Yeltsin ended that stalemated war by granting
the Chechens an unspoken form of independence and postponing any
official decision on the state of the republic until 2001.
</P>
<P>
   But after Islamic fundamentalists left Chechnya and invaded
neighboring Dagestan this summer and a series of terrorist bombs in
Moscow and elsewhere killed nearly 300 Russians, Russian troops
struck back hard, marching into Chechnya last month.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Kremlin's assurances that troops were only seeking
to build a security zone around Chechnya, Russian forces have
steadily advanced toward the capital. At last count, nearly 90,000
Russian soldiers were involved in the operation, far more than were
involved in the 21-month Chechen war of three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials have played down the conflict, shunning terms
like ``rebellion'' in favor of labeling their military action as an
antiterrorist operation.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, many Chechens are said to oppose the uprising, and the
Russian government has seized on that possibility. A statement
issued Thursday assured Chechen citizens that its soldiers were
defending them against bandits and that they ``should know that
they will receive protection and help from the Russian
government.''
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday evening's attacks, which went largely unmentioned
on Moscow's main television news programs, seemed to be
distinguished by their grisly nature.
</P>
<P>
   By various reports, five or six rockets or aerial bombs were
said to have struck the central market at rush hour, sending
hundreds of screaming shoppers into the streets and leaving behind
scores of dead and pools of blood.
</P>
<P>
   One witness, Umar Madayev, told The Associated Press: ``It was
dark and then all of a sudden the place was illuminated and
something was sparkling in the air. Then we heard the explosions.''
</P>
<P>
   Agence France-Presse reported that at least 27 people, many of
them mothers and newborn children, died when a rocket or bomb
struck a maternity hospital wing some 80 feet from the presidential
residence on Grozny's central square.
</P>
<P>
   Other rockets or bombs were said to have hit a mosque, killing
perhaps a dozen people, but that report too was unverified.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday evening's attacks seemed destined to raise a din of
protest among members of the European Union, who already had
elevated the situation in Chechnya to a major topic at their
Helsinki meeting.
</P>
<P>
   A number of nations have expressed concern at the unsparing
nature of the Russian military thrust, which has killed countless
civilians, spurred an exodus of two-thirds of Grozny's 150,000
residents and forced 150,000 refugees across the Chechen border
into Ingushettia, according to the Red Cross.

FIGHT HEATS UP OVER UNCLEARED BRUSH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY MICHAEL COIT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Facing the worst fire conditions since the
drought seven years ago, Los Angeles firefighters said they have
been struggling to clear a backlog of brush left by large public
landowners.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding wildfire dangers was the forecast that another La
Nina winter was certain, bringing drier-than-normal weather because
of a pool of cold water off the equator.
</P>
<P>
   Residents complained that they have been forced to clear brush
while utilities and government agencies are allowed to maintain
dangerous conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters said Thursday they are doing the best they can.
</P>
<P>
   ``The properties are spread throughout the city. In order to
identify and get those cleaned in addition to the private property
_ you can imagine the work,'' said Sanford Faz, a lead wild-land
fire inspector for the city of Los Angeles Fire Department.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters said the need for utilities and large public
landowners to clear brush was never clearer than in 1996 when
destructive wild-land fires broke out in the Los Angeles suburbs of
Fillmore and Calabasas.
</P>
<P>
   State forestry officials said the cause was Edison equipment,
but a Ventura County jury decided in Edison's favor after the
Fillmore fire, and the Los Angeles County District Attorney's
Office decided not to file charges against the utility after the
Calabasas fire.
</P>
<P>
   For the past two years, fire department contractors have been
clearing properties owned by the city's Department of Water and
Power and the General Services Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The agencies were responsible for more than 250 properties but
didn't make brush removal a priority, and even now, only problem
sites near homes in mountain areas are being cleared, Faz said.
</P>
<P>
   Not good enough, according to residents in Tujunga, a community
20 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles, including Mike Kruly,
who cleared vegetation around his hillside home at the demand of
the fire department.
</P>
<P>
   He and others are angry that Southern California Edison has not
done the same for several years along an electrical transmission
line near their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get fined if I don't clear my property, and this stuff _
it's just ludicrous. I've gone down with a machete myself to clean
it up,'' Kruly said. ``When you live in an area like this, you have
to be vigilant. Otherwise you're going to lose your house.''
</P>
<P>
   This past August, the value of brush clearance became evident to
Kruly.
</P>
<P>
   He said his home and his neighbors' homes were spared as a fire
roared across 250 acres in Tujunga. Only a break cut by crews
racing ahead of the fire kept flames from reaching grass and brush
in the Edison corridor and spreading to homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the crews didn't do the wonderful job they did, it would
have gone up like a Roman candle,'' he said. ``And if that would
have gone up, it would have probably taken out every house on this
street.''
</P>
<P>
   An Edison spokesman said the utility is governed by state laws
that don't require brush removal under transmission lines such as
those through the Tujunga area.
</P>
<P>
   This year, under pressure from the state Department of Forestry,
Edison went beyond its normal maintenance program, clearing grass
and brush and trimming trees around power poles and high-voltage
transmission lines across its 50,000-square-mile service area.
</P>
<P>
   The company would clear the brush if the fire department asked,
said spokesman Steve Conroy.
</P>
<P>
   City firefighters said they never asked Edison to clear the
brush _ but the company should know better.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning of every year, we try to locate every agency
that has a hazard and send notices to the respective agencies,''
Faz said. ``If something was missed, we will notify the property
owner and get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters gave the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy a list
of properties based on their importance to public safety. But the
agency needed public prodding to get the work done, Faz said.
</P>
<P>
   Conservancy crews cleared brush this summer on the sites, which
numbered fewer than 70. Crews were bolstered because the work was
in addition to the agency's annual brush clearance, conservancy
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It went reasonably well,'' said Belinda Faustinos, the
conservancy's chief deputy director. ``We have to recognize
resource protection, but we always try to make sure public safety
is a No. 1 concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Homeowners have been vigilant at brush clearance.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 171,000 properties the city checked this spring, about
31,000 were sent notices reminding owners of the need for brush
removal. Faz said the department expects to send crews to clean
only about 1,500, with the remainder complying voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 70,000 properties the county checked, only about 5,500
have received notices, and far fewer will require mandatory brush
clearance, Wilkinson said.

LAKERS' FORUM ERA TO END WITH EXHIBITION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ A proud arena whose walls are lined with six
championship banners and the retired jerseys of five Hall of Famers
will witness its last NBA tipoff tonight, in the least-fitting
farewell imaginable. An exhibition game.
</P>
<P>
   The Great Western Forum, bearing the name of a bank that no
longer exists, will soon bear only the memories of its most famous
tenant. The Lakers play a meaningless game tonight at 8 and close
out a 32-year relationship with the formerly Fabulous arena.
</P>
<P>
   The oddity of the moment will not be lost on Lakers coach Phil
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unique for us to be able to play on this floor, and to be
in these type of games, where the Forum is being closed in such a
strange way, an exhibition after so many championships have been
played here,'' Jackson said Thursday, before the Lakers' exhibition
against Golden State.
</P>
<P>
   Championship series hold the fondest memories for Jackson, who
played in three as a New York Knick and coached in one, leading the
Chicago Bulls to the first of six titles in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I feel like this has been a building that I've had a lot of
fun in, had a lot of success in,'' he said. ``Three of those four
championship attempts were successful, the teams I was on. Not with
the Lakers. . . . So there's some real fond memories here and
there's been wonderful basketball here.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of it belonging to the home team, including the four
championships won in the 1980s. A.C. Green, a member of the last
two of those teams, is elated to be back to pay his final respects
to the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obviously been a lot of fun. A lot of great memories,''
he said. ``It's just a blessing, it really is, no matter how you
want to look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Green might miss the familiar digs, but he's looking forward to
playing at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is full of changes,'' he said. ``I'm just happy to be
able to proceed along with the franchise. Change of the century,
there's a lot of ways to look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   To close out the Forum, the Lakers will air a video montage at
the end of tonight's game. The team will give away a CD called
``Fabulous Finale'' to the first 10,000 fans and will also give
away a number of commemorative videos, produced by the History
Channel.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's tipoff has been moved up to 7:45.
</P>
<P>
   Changes: Jackson made one alteration to the starting lineup
Thursday, giving Robert Horry the nod at power forward over A.C.
Green. Horry, who has struggled this exhibition season, played 11
minutes in the first half, netting two points and two rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Remembering Wilt: The Lakers honored the late Wilt Chamberlain
with a moment of silence and a short video tribute before tipoff.
The team also plans to wear a commemorative patch on its uniforms.

MOTHER CHARGED WITH 10 COUNTS OF CRIMINALLY ABUSING FIVE CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE VENDEL  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Eight-year-old
Larry Bass weighed less than 30 pounds when he died Wednesday. His
ribs poked through his sagging skin. His feet, which allegedly had
been dunked in scalding water, were badly infected and blood-red.
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Thursday, Larry's mother, Mary Bass, was charged with 10
counts of criminally abusing Larry, who was a triplet, and four
siblings. Another triplet nearly died Wednesday night _ doctors
revived the boy after his heart stopped beating _ and was in
critical condition Thursday. He was being treated for severe
malnourishment and burns to his feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the worst case of child neglect I've seen,'' homicide
Capt. Darryl Forte said of Larry Bass. ``He was just a skeleton
covered with skin. He looked mummified. It was like famine you
would see in a third-world country.
</P>
<P>
   ``He basically died a slow death. It really hurts your heart to
see something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bass, 31, was charged with two counts of first-degree assault,
two counts of armed criminal action, two counts of endangering the
welfare of a child and four counts of child abuse. She was in jail
Thursday night, and bond had not been set.
</P>
<P>
   The medical examiner did not rule the case a homicide Thursday.
Police said the office would wait for the results of some tests
before officially declaring the cause of death. Charges against
Bass could then be upgraded.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the triplets, Bass had a 12-year-old daughter and
a 10-year-old son living with her in a 2 1/2-story house.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the children were placed in protective custody. The
hospitalized boy might have to have some toes amputated _ and
possibly his feet _ because of infection.
</P>
<P>
   The case marks the third time in two weeks that a Kansas City
area child has died allegedly at the hands of a caregiver.
Two-year-old E'Lexis Crawford died Oct. 11, and her 41-year-old
caregiver was charged with second-degree murder. Eleven-month-old
Luis Graber died Oct. 12; a 22-year-old man was charged with
second-degree murder in that case.
</P>
<P>
   The Bass case, however, is notable not only for the severity of
the alleged abuse, but also for its duration _ and for the
potential failure of the social safety net.
</P>
<P>
   As far back as two years ago, say teachers and school
administrators, state social workers had been alerted of possible
neglect. Because case records are closed to the public, the
Missouri Division of Family Services would not release any details
about the family's case or say whether it had investigated the
family.
</P>
<P>
   It would take several weeks for a child to die from
malnutrition, as long as the child was receiving fluids, said Maria
Little, a certified pediatric nurse practitioner at St. Vincent's
Operation Breakthrough day-care center. If fluids were withheld, a
child probably would die in two or three days.
</P>
<P>
   Malnourished children appear ashen, have dark circles under
their eyes and lack stamina to play, Little said.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicions that the Bass triplets were malnourished arose at
least two years ago when they attended Whittier Elementary School
in the Northeast area. Teachers at Whittier, where the triplets
went to school for kindergarten and first grade, said Thursday that
they had noticed the boys took packs of crackers from a teacher's
desk and food from other classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Larry was the ringleader, they said, and often scrounged enough
food to share with his siblings. The boys often complained of being
hungry, said Tracy Johnson, the parent-community liaison at
Whittier. They cleaned their trays at breakfast and often asked
classmates, ``Are you going to finish that?''
</P>
<P>
   Cafeteria managers noticed the boys' unusually hearty appetites
and routinely gave them second helpings. School officials said they
began to suspect neglect and soon alerted state officials.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said the school had sponsored the family for
Thanksgiving, providing ham, turkey and canned foods.
</P>
<P>
   The boys transferred to Garfield Elementary for second grade and
were enrolled at Swinney Elementary this year. Swinney officials,
however, said that only one of the triplets attended classes
regularly this year.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 Missouri children have died from abuse and neglect
this decade. In Jackson County three dozen children died between
1992 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``When parents become very frustrated or angry and they hit a
child, it happens very quickly because someone has lost control,''
said Jeannie Jones, who oversees child abuse investigations for the
state Division of Family Services in Jackson County. ``It's very
different to essentially withhold food from a child and have that
child be malnourished to the point it contributes to a child's
death. That is truly horrific.''
</P>
<P>
   Sister Berta Sailer, a child advocate and administrator at St.
Vincent's, said: ``I bet there are hundreds of other (abused) kids
the whole world is missing, including us. Kids are taught they
can't tell anything. If they tell, they'll get beaten. The kids
kind of go along and protect mom in so many cases.''
</P>
<P>
   The condition of the Bass children came to the attention of
police for the first time about 7:25 p.m. Wednesday, with a call
from Mary Bass to 911. She talked with police and an ambulance
dispatcher. Donald Pickard, a spokesman for the ambulance company,
said the dispatcher gave the caller directions on how to administer
cardiopulmonary resuscitation, which was ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Bass told them that she had her hands full, working
full time at the Federal Aviation Administration, raising five
children and going back to school, and said she was having a hard
time controlling Larry and another triplet. Because nothing else
seemed to work, police said, she resorted to withholding food as
discipline. Police said severe food restrictions began this summer.
</P>
<P>
   According to police and court records, the boys would be fed
only bread and water for up to two weeks at a time. Once, when one
of the boys was caught stealing food, they were locked in a room,
where the starvation continued, records said. They would be let out
only to use the restroom, the records said, and would stay locked
up all day while Bass was at work.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, court records allege, Bass became enraged at Larry
and one of the other triplets and dipped their feet in a tub of
scalding water. Their skin was burned off in places; police said
the boys' feet looked as though they had on blood-red socks.

AMGEN, HARVARD FIND ALZHEIMER'S `HOLY GRAIL'

<P>
   THOUSAND OAKS, CALIF. -- Researchers at biotech giant Amgen Inc.
have isolated a compound that might be the cause of Alzheimer's
disease and are trying to create a drug to inhibit its production
and slow or reverse the disease's effects.
</P>
<P>
   In an article to be published in Friday's issue of the journal
Science, researchers for Thousand Oaks-based Amgen and the Harvard
Medical School discuss their discovery of the protein, known as
beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme, or BACE.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists praised the discovery Thursday as a monumental
breakthrough in their research and said it could eventually lead to
a cure for Alzheimer's, a degenerative neurological disease which
affects 4 million people annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people in the Alzheimer's community are referring to
this discovery as the Holy Grail of Alzheimer's Disease,'' said
Amgen spokesman David Kaye. ``It's a discovery related to the
fundamental understanding of the disease. This enzyme appears to be
central to the formation of plaque in brains of Alzheimer's
patients.''
</P>
<P>
   For more than a decade, Alzheimer's researchers have been
hunting for two unknown enzymes they presumed existed but could
never pinpoint. The Amgen researchers have finally identified one
of them.
</P>
<P>
   The enzyme is a component in a substance that builds up in the
brains of Alzheimer's patients and causes the formation of plaques
that cause the neurological degeneration of Alzheimer's Disease.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the finding, it could be 8 to 10 years before a drug is
put on the market, Kaye said, assuming one can be found that is
effective and safe to administer to humans. It also must receive
approval from the federal Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``This discovery is a target for a drug; this is not a drug in
and of itself,'' Kaye said. ``We now need to find a drug that can
inhibit the buildup and the threat of the enzyme.''
</P>
<P>
   The search for the cause of Alzheimer's has been so frustrating
in the past that false claims of success had dampened hopes.
</P>
<P>
   But experts say that the new work has passed crucial tests of
authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Sangram Sisodia, chairman of the department of neurobiology,
pharmacology and physiology at the University of Chicago, told the
New York Times that when he first heard of the Amgen result, he
dismissed it, saying, ``It's junk. It has been junk after junk for
12 years.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``When I read the paper, I was overwhelmed. The
set of experiments in this paper was a tour de force.''
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Douglas Christopher of Los Angeles-based Crowell Weedon
&AMP; Co. said the development of a new Alzheimer's drug would be a
financial feather in Amgen's cap.
</P>
<P>
   But such a development is so uncertain and so far in the future
that its value to investors is negligible, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely good to have claim to something that
substantial,'' Christopher said. ``We're just trying to kind of
look at their existing products and markets. I approach it from the
valuation and the financial perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   That perspective fared rather poorly Thursday. Amgen's stock
ended the trading day down $6 per share to $80.125 on 18.2 million
shares traded, roughly six times the normal volume.
</P>
<P>
   The 7 percent price drop was fueled by Amgen's announcement late
Wednesday that it will increase its spending for research and
development in coming quarters, cutting into future earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The company also had announced that quarterly earnings were
better than Wall Street estimated by 1 cent per share and that the
company's stock would split 2-for-1 in November.
</P>
<P>
   Kaye said the price decrease was due to overreaction on the part
of investors.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham, who rates the stock a ``buy,'' said a company such
as Amgen that is increasing its research budget is a better buy for
the long-term investor than for the day trader or the momentum
investor.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing they've demonstrated is quality in science,'' he
said. ``If they bring something to the table, you know you're
seeing everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Amgen is the nation's largest _ and most successful _ biotech
company, largely on the strength of two drugs: Neupogen, which
stimulates white blood cell production; and Epogen, which
stimulates red blood cell production. Both have annual revenues of
$1 billion.

NESBY'S GAME HAS SOLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As he approaches the second furlong of his NBA
career, Tyrone Nesby is positioning his agenda in the following
order:
</P>
<P>
   Win, place and shoe.
</P>
<P>
   The lead priority winning is automatic; nothing is fun about
9-41.
</P>
<P>
   Nesby's notion of place also seems to be established. After
somehow slipping through the 1998 NBA Draft unselected, he took a
spin through the CBA, went post-lockout camping with the Clips and
eventually took the starting small forward job away from slumping
Lamond Murray. When that 9-41 season was over, league stat geeks
had Nesby ranked among the top 10 rookies in nine of 10 statistical
categories.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cool playing with these guys,'' Nesby said of life in the
NBA at large. ``First, you're watchin' 'em on TV; then you're out
there checkin' 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   Then you cash in.
</P>
<P>
   Nesby's metamorphosis was rewarded with a three-year, $8.9
million contract, which is how much the Clippers are coughing up to
match the offer sheet he signed with the NBA champion San Antonio
Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   But Nesby, a 6-foot-6 contradiction to the laws of gravity,
continues to wait for shoe time.
</P>
<P>
   While outplaying Scottie Pippen in one game last season, Nesby
found time to request a test drive of Pippen's signature Nikes.
After Shaquille O'Neal clobbered the fearless newcomer on an
attempted dunk, the Laker center's belated apology was interrupted
by another Nesby pitch for shoes.
</P>
<P>
   During the dog days of summer free agency, Nesby was offered a
shoe deal with a caveat from a company called And 1. And 1 would
bring Nesby into the fold if he played for any team BUT the
Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that was out of Nesby's hands. The Clippers had the
right to match, said they would match, did match.
</P>
<P>
   So no And 1 deal for Nesby. No chance to replace Sean Elliott as
the starting forward for the defending champs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think about that,'' Nesby said of the occasional daydream
that features him playing alongside Tim Duncan and David Robinson.
``I won't lie about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I love it here; I think we're going to be pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   And while Nesby waits for the shoe contract to drop (Converse
possibly, Nike more likely), rookie Lamar Odom has rolled in to
claim the starting small forward spot. Nesby, who spent most of the
off-season chipping away the rough edges on his perimeter game,
doesn't seem to mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can live with it,'' he said of what has become his sixth-man
role. ``It's just about knowing you're going to get out there.
Finishing the game is more important than starting it.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Chris Ford can live with that attitude, as long was Nesby
picks up the defensive pace and rebounds with more conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sixth man is an ideal role for him,'' Ford said. ``Nez is
always going to be an offensive weapon for us. But with his
athletic ability, he has to be more of a presence on defense and on
the boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he knows that; I get on him all the time about it. He asks
why I always single him out, and I tell him he's the guy I always
see out of position on defense when I look at the films.''
</P>
<P>
   If Nesby realizes the shoe fits, he figures to make the
adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   Fast breaks
</P>
<P>
   Brian Skinner (upset tummy) and Maurice Taylor
</P>
<P>
   (sore shoulder) didn't participate in Wednesday night's public
scrimmage, but practiced without restrictions Thursday and will
play against the Grizzlies tonight (7 p.m., KXTA AM/1150) in
Vancouver. ... Point guard Eric Murdock
</P>
<P>
   whose injured left ankle passed Wednesday's test will make his
Clipper debut tonight. ... Taylor has provided the official
nickname for 34-year-old point guard Scott Brooks
</P>
<P>
   ``Old Faithful.'' ... In response to a recent newspaper report
that indicated they will get nothing, a team official said the
Clippers will receive ``seven figures'' this season as their share
of the Staples Center luxury-suite revenue.

GALAXY'S VANNEY IS MENTALLY TOUGH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA -- By the end of last season, Greg Vanney had finished
his path to bench and felt like his spirit was shaken.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy's left-back was a regular starter since establishing
himself as a rookie in 1996, and he had trouble understanding why
he was losing his starting job to Joey Franchino a few weeks before
the 1998 MLS playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was never explained to me,'' said Vanney.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of storming into then-coach Octavio Zambrano's
office to voice his frustrations, Vanney chose to hold his emotions
in check.
</P>
<P>
   When he did get a rare nod over Franchino, Vanney didn't seem to
have the same spirit that he had become known for during the team's
inaugural season.
</P>
<P>
   During the playoffs, Vanney sat helplessly on the bench while
the Chicago Fire eliminated the Galaxy from the Western Conference
finals.
</P>
<P>
   Vanney's playoff contribution? Only two minutes -- this from a
guy who piled up 694 playoff minutes during the league's first two
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But that was a year and a coaching change ago.
</P>
<P>
   You won't find a mentally tougher Galaxy player than Vanney
today as the Galaxy prepares for Sunday's playoff match at
Colorado. The Galaxy leads the first-round, best-of-three series
1-0 following Sunday's 3-0 victory over the Rapids at the Rose
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has Vanney returned to his starting role for new coach
Sigi Schmid, he also earned an invitation to join the U.S. National
team for a recent friendly in Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should never lose confidence in yourself, which is
something that started to happen to me last year,'' said Vanney.
``Your mind has to be focused and completely in the game. There
were times when I was wondering why I was not playing. I was
frustrated and started looking over my shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just can't play that way.''
</P>
<P>
   The change is the result of a lot of hard work.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had seen Vanney in the off-season, then you would know
why Vanney is where he's at right now,'' said defensive midfielder
Danny Pena. ``He came into camp at the beginning of the season and
was by far the fittest player on this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Vanney and some other Galaxy players joined fitness coach Jim
Liston for winter workouts. While others trained Monday through
Thursday, Vanney added Friday and Saturday workouts on his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greg made a decision to go beyond what was asked of him,''
said Liston. ``There was no way he was going to come into this
season and give anyone an opportunity to take his position. Now
he's reaping the rewards.''
</P>
<P>
   Vanney said the motivation was simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate when somebody tells me I can't do something or that I'm
not good enough to start on this team,'' said Vanney. ``You can do
one of two things when that happens: You can quit or prove someone
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to myself, `I'm going to prove Octavio was wrong.' That
was my approach every day at the gym. It was grueling and tough but
when you have focus and you set goals, it really gets you through
the hard work.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmid coached Vanney at UCLA. He said he noticed Vanney's
physical improvement in March, when Schmid took over for Zambrano.

   ``I noticed right away,'' said Schmid. ``He's improved himself
and adapted better because of his physical strength. ``He's been
able to handle a marking role and get matched up with physical
players like (Jorge Dely) Valdes and (Eduardo) Hurtado. A year ago
he wasn't ready for those matchups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everything Greg has done has allowed him to play with
a lot more confidence and resolve. And he has more bite in his
tackles. Greg is not usually a demonstrative player, but you can
see that quiet fire that burns inside him.''
</P>
<P>
   His effort has sure caught the attention of his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Vanney) had one mission in mind, to gain his position back
and to gain the respect back from players whom maybe Greg feels
lost confidence in him,'' said Pena. ``That's how you're supposed
to respond. Any time you hit a bump in the road you have to bounce
back and Vanney showed that type of character.
</P>
<P>
   ``And one thing he has that a lot of players don't is that
professional attitude. Anything we do, Vanney is right there at the
front of the pack.''
</P>
<P>
   Fellow defender Paul Caligiuri says this is only the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``To see a young player mature like he did was great,'' said
Caligiuri. ``Greg is one of the best defenders in this league and
we still haven't seen the best of him yet. He will not only get
more caps on the National team, but he's going to become a regular
starter someday and he won't lose that role until he's ready to
give it up.''
</P>
<P>
   The new and improved Vanney doesn't plan on letting up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've already talked with Robin (Fraser) about setting a
workout schedule again,'' said Vanney. ``I've learned a lot from my
experience and I'm not going to get caught questioning myself
again.''

WOMAN CONVICTED OF KILLING MAN ON VIAGRA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE LAMBE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Area lawyers said a
Jackson County murder case this week may have been the first use of
what they called the Viagra defense.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mary T. Frost, 33, said she stabbed her 77-year-old Kansas City
housemate to death after the man, who used Viagra, asked her for
sex, begged her for sex and then tried to rape her.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors deliberated six hours Thursday before convicting Frost of
second-degree murder. She can be sentenced from 10 years to life.
</P>
<P>
   They convicted Frost, one juror later said, because they thought
she could have defended herself without stabbing Oscar Fingers in
the heart on June 18, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   She was also guilty because she waited more than an hour to call
police and to summon medical help for Fingers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt she just left him to die,'' the juror said.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, the case was unlike any that area lawyers
had seen. The case hinged on Finger's use of Viagra and Frost's
videotaped police statement last year. She did not testify, and the
tape told her story at trial:
</P>
<P>
   She had moved in with Fingers months before and had her own
bedroom. The two were just friends, but he had started taking
Viagra and slept with other women.
</P>
<P>
   As she watched television that night, he asked her for sex. Then
he got down on his knees and begged for sex. Then he started toward
her and became more forceful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oscar is really a nice person,'' but that night ``he was
acting like a maniac.'' She threw a ceramic rooster at him, ran
into the kitchen and got a steak knife. She returned and waved the
knife to keep him away.
</P>
<P>
   ``He started to reach for me, and I jumped up. I stuck him,''
Frost said.
</P>
<P>
   He grabbed the knife, and she shoved him to the floor into a
corner. He went into the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   She yelled she was calling police.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I go to jail, you're going to jail, too, because you had no
business trying to rape me,'' she said she told him.
</P>
<P>
   He told her not to call police. She told him she was sorry she
stuck him and called her mother. Her mother told her to put a towel
over the wound. (But the blade had pierced Fingers' heart, and he
was bleeding internally).
</P>
<P>
   Fingers cleaned the knife and handed it to her, and she put it
back in the kitchen drawer. Frost called her mother again, and her
mother and brother drove over. Her mother told her to call police,
and Frost did _ more than an hour after the stabbing.
</P>
<P>
   In closing arguments Thursday, assistant prosecutor Kate Mahoney
said the two could have argued over something else. She reminded
jurors that Fingers took Frost in as a favor to her mother months
before and wanted Frost to leave. Frost refused.
</P>
<P>
   Fingers also was afraid of Frost, Mahoney said. He had locked
the kitchen butcher knives in the trunk of his car but left out the
steak knives.
</P>
<P>
   His Viagra use also helped the prosecution's case, Mahoney said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that he took Viagra and had women shows he was no
potential rapist _ he didn't even like her,'' Mahoney said.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyer Jarrett Johnson said his client acted in
self-defense in a horrifying situation of a man consumed by lust.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was getting angrier and angrier, and he made his intentions
very clear,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Fingers didn't know how bad he was hurt, and he ordered her not
to call police because he wanted to work things out, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Mahoney countered: ``He was left to bleed to death on the
bathroom floor.''
</P>
<P>
   And even if Frost told the truth, she did not have to stab the
77-year-old man to escape harm, Mahoney said.
</P>
<P>
   After the verdict, Mahoney said other women who want to try a
Viagra defense to murder might think again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't work here,'' she said.

LOS ANGELES: from becoming ill.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I am surprised that even those who voted to go forward had so
many questions about their vote,'' Lansing said. ``There is
definitely not a big, thundering herd of support to go forward on
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynoso did not passionately champion the project during his
testimony to the board. Instead, he presented a reluctant
recommendation that it be completed if the board stipulates to some
terms and conditions.
</P>
<P>
   He said the board would need to seek legal advice from the state
attorney general, require the highest-quality gas-control system
for the school, set aside funds immediately to maintain and monitor
the system for as long as the site was used for students, designate
regulators within the district to oversee monitoring and
maintenance of the system, and pursue legislation to ensure that
officials outside of LAUSD would oversee the internal regulators'
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``These recommendations need to be done,'' Reynoso told the Los
Angeles Daily News. ``If they are not, there are serious questions
about going forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not backing down from my decision, but if the school board
decides not to go forward, I won't regret anything. I think that
would be understandable. It is a perfectly legitimate stance to
take under these conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission voted 4-3 on Wednesday to recommend completion of
Belmont, located downtown atop an oil field pervaded by explosive
and toxic gases.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's two environmental experts and a public works
professional voted against continuing construction, concluding the
site could not be made safe.
</P>
<P>
   Former District Attorney Ira Reiner, who advised the commission
but did not have a vote on it, urged the board never to send
students to the Belmont site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not your disaster unless you accept the majority view
and vote to go forward with Belmont,'' Reiner told the school
board. ``At that moment you have adopted Belmont as your disaster.
That would be the most grievous mistake that this board could make.
Belmont would be the iceberg that you crashed into.''
</P>
<P>
   Reiner said legal problems and designing and installing a system
to try to control Belmont's environmental dangers would prevent the
partially completed school from opening for at least four years.
</P>
<P>
   Reiner also argued that the district has poisoned its
relationship with the state Legislature by pouring money into
Belmont. He said state officials have vowed not to give the
district even $1 for Belmont but have agreed to provide money for
schools on clean sites.
</P>
<P>
   The school board, which created the advisory commission in July
after a series of Daily News investigative articles on Belmont, is
scheduled to vote Nov. 2 on the complex's fate. Nearly all
construction has been halted since August.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Belmont is completed, school board members vowed
Thursday to expedite construction of two other high schools in the
inner city to relieve massive overcrowding in urban classrooms. The
district has promised the low-income Latino community around
Belmont a new high school for more than two decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to find alternative sites and get them ready to go.
... These parents want schools for their youngsters, and they have
been overlooked,'' Hayes said. ``This community needs three schools
not one.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with Reynoso, those voting for the project's completion
were Humphries, president of the Service Employees International
Union; Ira Monosson, a former officer for the state Division of
Occupational Safety and Health; and Charles Calderon, a former
state senator and assemblyman.
</P>
<P>
   Those who voted against going forward were Craig Perkins,
director of Environmental and Public Works Management in Santa
Monica; David Beckman, senior attorney for the Natural Resources
Defense Fund; and Maribel Marin, a city public works commissioner.

BELMONT COULD HINGE ON ONE VOTE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- A citizen commission's narrow endorsement of the
Belmont Learning Center has failed to convince three school board
members that the $282 million public works fiasco should be
completed.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate opposition from three board members Thursday
signifies there is no clear-cut mandate to build Belmont but leaves
open the possibility that completion of the nation's costliest high
school could still be approved by a 4-3 board vote.
</P>
<P>
   Only one board member, Victoria Castro, a loyal Belmont
supporter, told the Daily News on Thursday that she would vote to
complete the high school if she had to decide immediately.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing testimony from several commissioners, board
members Julie Korenstein, David Tokofsky and Caprice Young said
they oppose going forward.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining board members withheld their opinions until they
could read the commission's written report. The board president,
Genethia Hayes, said she was undecided but unmoved by arguments
from Cruz Reynoso, a former state Supreme Court justice and
chairman of the commission, that the school should be finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the impression that Justice Reynoso was making the point
for the minority side, the side he didn't vote for. That's
troubling,'' Hayes said.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes also said she thought it was odd that only two of the
commissioners who voted to go forward with Belmont, Reynoso and
Janett Humphries, attended the board meeting Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why were they absent?'' she asked about the others. ``When you
are absolutely, positively passionate about something, when you
want to see something get done, you rearrange your life to get here
to speak. That obviously didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   While expressing concerns about the costs of the project and
desire to read the commission report, Castro praised the panel's
recommendation, saying it gave her direction and guidance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's taken (Belmont) for me out of the political arena,''
Castro said. ``I'm trying to take this out of politics and be a
good policy maker.''
</P>
<P>
   But Korenstein, Tokofsky and Young cited the long-term risks
posed by placing children and teachers in a school built atop an
oil field that seeps methane and hydrogen-sulfide gases as clear
reasons to scrap the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your heart goes out to the community on a daily basis. But
whenever people put their mind to it, instead of their hearts, they
come up with the fear about the risks and jeopardies of putting
children at Belmont,'' Tokofsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Young said there is no way she would send her children to
Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   ``So my vote has to be no, don't build this school,'' she
explained. ``That said, we need to build the community a new, safe
school as soon as possible. The majority of the board feels the
same way.''
</P>
<P>
   Korenstein, who has led opposition against Belmont for two
years, delivered the most direct answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter if I had to vote today. Whenever we vote, I
will never, ever vote for Belmont,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Hayes, board members Valerie Fields and Mike Lansing
refused to reveal their position now or predict how they will
eventually vote.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Hayes and Lansing said they were troubled and
surprised that the commission voiced reservations about the LAUSD's
long-term ability to operate a system that would extract and
monitor gases, which would be necessary to keep Belmont from
exploding and children from becoming ill.

LIGHT RAIL IS HOT TREND, BUT STUDIES CAST DOUBT ON ITS WORTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFFREY SPIVAK  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Light rail transit is
the latest game of municipal follow-the-leader.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like the recent rages to expand convention centers and build new
state-of-the-art sports stadiums, city after city across the
country either has built a streetcar-like light rail line on urban
streets or wants to build one.
</P>
<P>
   The rush to rail, contends John Kain, a Harvard University
economics professor, is attributable to ``boosterism, appeals to
civic pride...and a fondness of politicians for building
monuments.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because when light rail is analyzed in terms of costs and
benefits, its performance fails, according to transportation
economists who have studied the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Study after study in the last few years has concluded that light
rail does not improve transit usage noticeably, does not reduce
traffic congestion and, in effect, requires a taxpayers' subsidy
equal to buying every rider a new Ford Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   ``While light rail may bolster civic psyche, its popularity has
nothing to do with genuine transportation objectives,'' wrote
Wendell Cox, a transportation consultant, in a national report last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Or as a California grand jury, investigating Orange County's
decision-making process on light rail, determined earlier this
year: ``The national experience with urban light rail systems'
ability to solve traffic congestion, air pollution and related
urban problems has been poor.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, transit advocates see the issue differently. They
contend light rail does increase transit ridership. But even they
have trouble citing one evaluation of rail systems nationally that
demonstrated those systems had met their cost and transportation
goals.
</P>
<P>
   So transit advocates play up the game of municipal
follow-the-leader.
</P>
<P>
   William Millar, president of the American Public Transit
Association, described light rail this way: ``That is what the
successful communities are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City is engaged in the same debate.
</P>
<P>
   Question 5 on the Nov. 2 ballot proposes to extend two half-cent
sales taxes. One half-cent would fix roads and bridges and the
other would build a light rail line that its sponsor, Clay
Chastain, envisions running between south Kansas City and Kansas
City International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   A campaign flier for Question 5 asks in big letters, ``Who is
Missing from these light rail cities?'' It then lists 21 major
cities _ but not Kansas City. The flier goes on to catalog light
rail's benefits: ``reduce traffic congestion'' and ``boost
community pride,'' among other things.
</P>
<P>
   The flier does not mention how much the roughly 25- to 40-mile
system would cost or how many people would ride it instead of
driving. Chastain, however, has estimated costs at $900 million to
$1.5 billion, depending on how long the line is.
</P>
<P>
   Chastain argues that light rail will be successful in combating
traffic congestion and urban sprawl. If it isn't working elsewhere,
he asked, ``why are 190 cities vying for light rail funding? There
are more vying for it than there are available funds.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there is no doubt light rail is popular. In the last two
decades, it has been built in cities from Baltimore to San Diego,
Buffalo to Dallas. Also, the federal government's transportation
plan, called TEA-21, has a long waiting list of places wanting rail
funding.
</P>
<P>
   But when cities have asked their residents for tax money for
those projects or expansions, they're often turned down. This
decade, only five of 25 rail referendums passed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, cities typically crow about the systems they have. St.
Louis leaders boast how ridership has exceeded projections. Dallas'
supporters point to private development popping up near rail stops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are the cities happy with it?'' asked Ron Fisher, who oversees
rail planning for the Federal Transit Administration. ``Frequently,
they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, studies on light rail's performance find it
falling short. Researchers' judgments go beyond the usual beefs
that rail construction costs more and carries fewer riders than
forecast.
</P>
<P>
   Other arguments can be boiled down to basically two issues:
traffic congestion and cost effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   With traffic congestion, rail proponents frequently point out
that a single rail line can carry the same number of people as six
lanes of highway. Yet transportation consultant Cox studied traffic
in 10 cities with new rail systems and found congestion had
worsened more in those cities than in those without new rail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtually everywhere these things are proposed, proponents
talk about traffic congestion, even though there's not a single
study anywhere in the country that shows a perceivable reduction in
traffic congestion as a result of light rail,'' Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   As for cost effectiveness, light rail costs hundreds of millions
of dollars to build and only accounted for 0.3 percent of new
passenger travel during the first half of this decade, according to
John Semmens, who criticized transit in a 1997 report for the
nonpartisan Goldwater Institute in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   The overall cost of new light rail lines translates to roughly
$8,000 per new commuter _ which is more than the annual payment on
a five-year loan for a Ford Explorer or the lease of a Lincoln Town
Car, according to calculations by transportation economists.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the actual impact it has on the region,''
Semmens said, ``it's pitifully small. You're kidding yourself if
you think that's the solution.''
</P>
<P>
   When the FTA's Fisher was asked how light rail was performing,
even he didn't sound too upbeat: ``It's hard to say one way or
another on that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, whether or not light rail performs as planned, it
still is one of the hottest big-ticket items that cities are
chasing today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's happening in too many places to be a fluke,'' said the
transit association's Millar.

LAKERS' FORUM ERA TO END WITH EXHIBITION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ A proud arena whose walls are lined with six
championship banners and the retired jerseys of five Hall of Famers
will witness its last NBA tipoff tonight, in the least fitting
farewell imaginable. An exhibition game.
</P>
<P>
   The Great Western Forum, bearing the name of a bank that no
longer exists, will soon bear only the memories of its most famous
tenant. The Lakers play a meaningless game tonight at 8 and close
out a 32-year relationship with the formerly Fabulous arena.
</P>
<P>
   The oddity of the moment will not be lost on Lakers coach Phil
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unique for us to be able to play on this floor and to be
in these type of games, where the Forum is being closed in such a
strange way, an exhibition after so many championships have been
played here,'' Jackson said Thursday, before the Lakers' 93-89
overtime victory over Golden State.
</P>
<P>
   Championship series hold the fondest memories for Jackson, who
played in three as a New York Knick and coached in one, leading the
Chicago Bulls to the first of six titles in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I feel like this has been a building that I've had a lot of
fun in, had a lot of success in,'' he said. ``Three of those four
championship attempts were successful, the teams I was on. Not with
the Lakers. . . . So there's some real fond memories here and
there's been wonderful basketball here.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of it belonging to the home team, including the four
championships won in the 1980s. A.C. Green, a member of the last
two of those teams, is elated to be back to pay his final respects
to the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obviously been a lot of fun. A lot of great memories,''
he said. ``It's just a blessing, it really is, no matter how you
want to look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Green might miss the familiar digs, but he's looking forward to
playing at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is full of changes,'' he said. ``I'm just happy to be
able to proceed along with the franchise. Change of the century,
there's a lot of ways to look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   To close out the Forum, the Lakers will air a video montage at
the end of tonight's game. The team will give away a CD called
``Fabulous Finale'' to the first 10,000 fans and will also give
away a number of commemorative videos, produced by the History
Channel.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's tipoff against the Phoenix Suns has been moved to
7:45.
</P>
<P>
   Dribbles: Shaquille O'Neal missed his first 10 free-throw
attempts Thursday but, in dramatic fashion, swished his 11th try to
forge an 85-85 tie with the Warriors with 1.6 seconds remaining and
send the game into overtime. O'Neal finished with a game-high 21
points, including four points in overtime, and made the game-saving
defensive rebound to lock up the win.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal is now 2 for 19 from the line in the last two games and 9
for 33 (.273) in the exhibition season.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson made one alteration to the starting lineup Thursday,
giving Robert Horry the nod at power forward over A.C. Green.
Horry, who has struggled this exhibition season, played 17 minutes,
netting six points and six rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Devean George continued to impress, with 13 points, four
rebounds and two assists. He played 21 minutes, including the
entire overtime.

FORMER WESTERN WEAR OWNER FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARITA, CALIF. -- Monte B. McKeon, one of five McKeon
brothers who owned the now-defunct Howard &AMP; Phil's Western Wear
chain, has filed for personal bankruptcy, citing over $100,000 in
credit card bills and an array of other debt.
</P>
<P>
   McKeon's Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing reveals many of the
continuing challenges that he and his brothers _ including Rep.
Howard P. ``Buck'' McKeon, R-Santa Clarita _ face after the
collapse of the company their parents founded in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   The list of creditors in the Oct. 1 bankruptcy petition includes
the state Board of Equalization, which is owed $395,776.80 for
unpaid sales and use taxes relating to Howard &AMP; Phil's.
</P>
<P>
   The petition also lists a $52,700 Superior Court lawsuit filed
against all five brothers. The suit charges the brothers with
defaulting on debt payments related to a promissory note.
</P>
<P>
   But the largest liability in McKeon's petition _ $2.8 million _
stems from a civil action by Coast Business Credit, the main
creditor of the McKeon brothers' defunct retail clothing company.
</P>
<P>
   Coast filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court in June
which alleges the four brothers who ran the chain _ Monte, Joseph
B., John D. and Timothy _ ``participated and conspired in the
submission of false reports'' in order to ``deceive'' Coast into
giving Howard &AMP; Phil's large cash advances. Coast claims it is owed
about $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   McKeon's bankruptcy filing halts the suit as it relates to him,
but the case against the other three brothers will continue unless
they also file for bankruptcy, according to Coast lawyer Robert
Freitas. Monte McKeon did not return calls for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Rep. McKeon is a strong advocate for tightening
bankruptcy laws to make it harder for people to erase unsecured
debt such as credit card obligations.
</P>
<P>
   Coast's suit does not target the congressman, though, and McKeon
has distanced himself from the company's problems. After his 1992
election to Congress, McKeon stepped down from management; his only
continued involvement was as a 20 percent owner, according to his
spokesman, David Foy.
</P>
<P>
   But former employees who were left with unpaid wages when Howard
&AMP; Phil's closed say they disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's just as responsible as the four other brothers,''
said Amy Elliott, former store manager of the company's Thousand
Oaks and Northridge stores. ``If he didn't want responsibility for
it, he shouldn't have kept his 20 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   But at least one McKeon is not out of the western wear business
yet.
</P>
<P>
   According to his bankruptcy filing, Monte McKeon is now a
$5,000-a-month employee of Alta Montana Corporation Inc., the
company that purchased most of Howard &AMP; Phil's assets and
subsequently reopened several of the chain's stores.
</P>
<P>
   McKeon's brother-in-law, Don Williams, manages Alta Montana's
Valencia store. He formerly was general merchandise manager for
Howard &AMP; Phil's.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott said Monte McKeon's continued involvement is disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people feel like Monte McKeon and all the McKeon
brothers have gotten away with it,'' Elliott said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just no justice,'' she said. ``It's a case of the rich
getting richer and the poor getting poorer.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott says she is still owed about $250. Other former Howard &AMP;
Phil's employees filed claims upward of $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Those claims are not listed in the bankruptcy petition, though,
and the state dropped an effort to collect unpaid wages after
Howard &AMP; Phil's assets were sold in June.
</P>
<P>
   Other claims on the estate of Monte McKeon and his wife, Kathy,
include:
</P>
<P>
   -- An $85,000 promissory note to Santa Clarita-based Valencia
Bank &AMP; Trust.
</P>
<P>
   Congressman McKeon served on the bank's board of directors
before his 1992 election to Congress. Joseph McKeon was elected to
the board after his brother stepped down and served until the
mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   -- Credit card debt of $116,563.72, spread over nine different
cards.

ARIZONA LAWMAKER URGES ARMING TEACHERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS MOESER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Rep. Barbara Blewster has a novel solution to school
violence: Let every teacher carry a gun.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican legislator said Thursday that if teachers and
school administrators could carry concealed weapons to work, it
would keep violence out of Arizona schools.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers and school officials immediately derided the idea. The
president of one of the the largest school boards in Blewster's
district called her a ``fruitcake.''
</P>
<P>
   But gun rights advocates say the idea should be considered.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Froman, second vice president of the National Rifle
Association, pointed out that in countries where teachers are
armed, such as Israel, school shootings are rare.
</P>
<P>
   Froman said the NRA has not taken a position on allowing
teachers to carry guns at schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very difficult issue, and it involves a lot of
uncomfortable questions. Would it save lives or put more lives in
danger?'' Froman said. ``If you're a deranged person and you want
to do some damage, are you going to a police station, where
everybody is armed, or to a school?''
</P>
<P>
   Blewster said the situation can't get any more dangerous than it
is now, when a shooter can walk into a school and open fire. That
would be less likely if those inside were armed, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, she said, ``An armed society is a polite society. I
think you would have a lot better manners from the students toward
the teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dewey Republican made a name for herself in her first year
at the Capitol by comparing homosexuality to ``bestiality, human
sacrifice and cannibalism.'' She told another colleague that she
didn't look Jewish because she didn't have a ``hooked nose.''
</P>
<P>
   She later suggested to an African-American colleague, Rep. Leah
Landrum, that slavery wasn't that bad and that Native Americans
weren't very smart.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Maddux, president of the Prescott Unified School Board,
said he wasn't surprised by Blewster's latest proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds just like her. What a fruitcake. She's a clown.
Arizona politics is interesting enough without her,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said her suggestion is in direct opposition to the current
no-tolerance policy toward weapons in schools.
</P>
<P>
   State schools Superintendent Lisa Graham Keegan said arming
teachers is a bad idea, and state Sen. Chris Cummiskey called it
``outlandish.''
</P>
<P>
   The two attended a meeting of the Safety Answers for Education
Committee in Prescott on Wednesday. Blewster also attended.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the craziest thing I've ever heard,'' said Cummiskey,
D-central Phoenix. ``The things we keep hearing is not to create a
Fort Apache situation on these campuses but to try and get the guns
out of the schools.'' &QL;

FEDERAL PROSECUTORS VOW TO SEEK DEATH PENALTY IN CHILD'S MURDER 
</HEADLINE>
 KILLING-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK MORRIS and ANNE LAMOY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Federal prosecutors
vowed Thursday to seek the death penalty against Keith D. Nelson
for the kidnapping, sexual abuse and killing of 10-year-old Pamela
Butler last week.
<TEXT>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Stephen L. Hill Jr. said he already has asked U.S.
Attorney General Janet Reno for permission to seek the death
penalty. Reno has granted such permission in four previous cases in
western Missouri during Hill's tenure, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll make the best case possible for the death penalty,''
Hill told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Hill's announcement Thursday capped a concentrated flurry of
legal action on Nelson's case.
</P>
<P>
   Just after noon, a federal grand jury returned an indictment
against Nelson, restating a kidnapping count and charging him with
taking Pamela across a state line to commit sexual abuse that
resulted in her death. Both counts could carry the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Other than the allegation of sexual abuse, the two-page
indictment contained little new information about the case.
</P>
<P>
   Should Nelson not be sentenced to death in federal court, Hill
said he would work with Jackson County Prosecutor Bob Beaird for a
murder prosecution in state court.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson's attorney, Daniel Franco, was not surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize there is a specific purpose for the way he's
charged,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela's mother, Cherri West, was pleased with the prosecutors'
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want this man to be dead,'' she said. ``I will seek the
death penalty all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors allege Nelson kidnapped Pamela on Oct. 12 while she
was skating near her family's Kansas City, Kan., home, drove her
into Jackson County and killed her there.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 14, authorities arrested Nelson near the Kansas River
and took him to a hospital for medical treatment for an injured
leg. The following day, searchers recovered Pamela's body near a
Grain Valley, Mo., church.
</P>
<P>
   Standing on her front porch Thursday, Pamela's mother carefully
read the indictments during a temporary lull in the stream of
visitors who have left hundreds of cards and flowers at the little
house in Kansas City, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   West looked for clues to her daughter's murder. But nothing in
the indictment indicated motivation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still want to know why he did this to her,'' West said.
``Why did he pick her?''
</P>
<P>
   After the indictment was returned, several members of the grand
jury waited an hour at the courthouse to attend Nelson's first
court appearance in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   A deputy U.S. marshal pushed Nelson in a wheelchair into the
packed courtroom. Nelson, 24, was dressed in orange prison scrubs.
Nelson closely watched U.S. Magistrate Judge Sarah Hays as she read
the indictment to him, glancing down occasionally to check a copy
on the table in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson did not enter a plea and was not asked for one.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Nelson's family watched from the second row of
benches and said nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Hays announced she would appoint a lawyer from the federal
public defender's office to join Franco in Nelson's defense. Hays
also denied bond for Nelson, leaving him in federal custody.
</P>
<P>
   Franco said, ``From my point of view, things went as expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Nelson's family declined to comment. Members of
Pamela's family did not attend.
</P>
<P>
   At Hill's press conference, prosecutors and investigators said
that with the new indictment, they would have much less to say
publicly about evidence in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case has generated an intense amount of public attention,
but from this point on, the kind of information we can provide to
you will be very, very limited,'' Hill said. ``Our primary concern
is to bring justice in this case. The proper forum for our evidence
is in a courtroom upstairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, officials hinted at some lingering questions.
</P>
<P>
   While they did not rule out the possibility of charges against
others who may have been involved in Pamela's kidnapping, they
expressed no urgency about warning the public of any accomplices
still at large.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not say there is a public safety issue,'' said FBI
Special Agent Larry McCormick, who also asked the public to
continue feeding the bureau tips on the case.
</P>
<P>
   Other authorities have said that since his capture, Nelson has
not made a statement or cooperated with investigators.
</P>
<P>
   McCormick said the FBI is still awaiting the results of some
laboratory tests. In an affidavit submitted last week, an FBI agent
said that tests for blood in a white Ford pickup Nelson allegedly
drove were inconclusive and needed more refined testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence has been submitted to Washington,'' McCormick
said. ``We have no results as of this date.''

KC SCHOOL DISTRICT STRIPPED OF CERTIFICATION 
</HEADLINE>
 SCHOOLS-ACCREDITATION-2TAKES-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PHILLIP O'CONNOR, KEVIN HOFFMAN and LYNN FRANEY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. _ The Missouri Board
of Education voted unanimously Thursday to strip the Kansas City
School District of accreditation despite pleas to delay the action
for the sake of students.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The board agreed to postpone the decision's effective date until
May 1, a move state officials said was aimed at eliminating
concerns that students would flee the district in the middle of the
school year.
</P>
<P>
   But state board members said they could no longer accept the
district's dismal performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very difficult vote for all of us,'' said state
board member Rice Burns Jr. of Sikeston. ``To a person, all of us
are thinking about your kids, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The district has until June 30, 2002, to raise test scores or
meet other requirements, such as improving attendance and
graduation rates, to regain accreditation. If that doesn't happen,
then state officials take over the district, split it into smaller
districts or divide up its students and send them to other
districts.
</P>
<P>
   After the vote, Superintendent Benjamin Demps Jr. said he
wouldn't be diverted from his goal of raising the academic
achievement of all district students.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a lot of work to do,'' Demps said. ``I've got a tough
job ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Demps said the district would pursue its legal options. The
district tried unsuccessfully in both state and federal court to
bar the state from taking action Thursday. U.S. District Judge Dean
Whipple set a hearing for Tuesday on a district request to keep the
action from taking effect.
</P>
<P>
   Should that effort fail, some Kansas City school board members
say the district could be doomed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It still makes it a complete disaster for the district,'' said
board member Lance Loewenstein. ``(They) may think the children
won't leave the district, but they will.''
</P>
<P>
   Joy West-Spearman said her stomach turned when she got a phone
call Thursday from her daughter, a junior at Lincoln College Prep,
informing her of the decision. West-Spearman thinks that it will
hurt her daughter's chance to attend a private college.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that (graduation) certificate is going to
be worthless,'' she said, citing a concern raised by many parents.
</P>
<P>
   However, several college officials have said that the state's
decision would not prevent Kansas City students from getting into
college.
</P>
<P>
   West-Spearman said her daughter was already looking at other
schools in case she decides to leave the district.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at many of the city's 15 charter schools said they had
received numerous calls from parents in the last week asking about
openings, particularly for high school students.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're so upset,'' said Erik Harvey, on-site manager at
Southwest Charter School. ``The rumors of losing accreditation
started it all. It was the straw that broke the camel's back. It
was all over the papers and it made them think.''
</P>
<P>
   Even school board President John Rios said he would weigh
whether to remove his children from the district.
</P>
<P>
   But Bill Clark, president of the Urban League of Greater Kansas
City, cautioned the community against panicking and urged support
for the district.
</P>
<P>
   The state board vote came after several officials voiced concern
about how the loss of accreditation would affect the district,
especially in view of recent progress under Demps.
</P>
<P>
   ``To withdraw accreditation for the acknowledged failures of
earlier administrations imposes hardships on the children while
undermining efforts of this administration, newly appointed and
focused on the very educational reforms we all recognize as
essential to improve student achievement,'' said Arthur A. Benson
II, attorney for the plaintiff schoolchildren in the Kansas City
desegregation lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Mary Groves Bland, a Kansas City Democrat, told the
state board that community, political and religious leaders were
committed to seeing the district improve. Already, she said,
notices are being posted in schools, churches and other public
places encouraging parents to keep faith in the district. She urged
the board to delay its decision.
</P>
<P>
   Demps told the board he was hired in August solely to implement
a federal court order to improve academic achievement. He said the
uncertainties of being unaccredited could make it difficult to meet
court-ordered goals to enact a new core curriculum, improve teacher
training, introduce new tests designed to better gauge student
performance and develop a plan to hold students, teachers and
administrators accountable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Student performance is why I'm here,'' Demps said. ``That is
my passion. If we were to become unaccredited, things would happen
that would deter us from that cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Demps said being unaccredited would make the difficult task of
luring and keeping high quality employees even harder.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City teachers union President Judy Morgan said she had
already heard from teachers. She said the loss of accreditation
could cause some veteran teachers to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't support subdividing or dissolving the district,''
Morgan said.
</P>
<P>
   State Board of Education President Betty Preston of Chillicothe
called the lack of improvement in the five years since Kansas City
last underwent a state review inexcusable.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't set the benchmark...we are imposing a hardship on
children who grow up and don't have the skills they need,'' Preston
said.
</P>
<P>
   Board member Russell Thompson of Columbia said troubled
districts always asked the board to consider the children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet we don't see any change or difference,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Education Commissioner Robert Bartman agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over time we've learned that good intentions don't move a
district forward,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bartman had recommended that both the Kansas City and St. Louis
districts lose their accreditation after their students posted
dismal scores on the latest state standardized tests.
</P>
<P>
   The state board on Thursday tabled the decision on St. Louis in
accordance with a provision in the settlement of that city's
desegregation lawsuit. The provision defers any sanctions
associated with the loss of accreditation until June 2002. The St.
Louis district would retain accreditation in the interim, but also
must show progress or become unaccredited.
</P>
<P>
   Bartman told state board members that there was no state or
federal money set aside to help either district with its problems.
</P>
<P>
   But Bartman said Gov. Mel Carnahan told him recently that he
remained committed to helping the state's two largest public school
systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how that will play out,'' Bartman said. MORE

CSUN CONFERENCE TARGETS SHOW BIZ ECONOMY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTHRIDGE, CALIF. -- Facing the challenge of establishing
itself as a Hollywood player 20 miles away from Tinseltown,
California State University, Northridge, will attempt to
``demystify'' the economics of show business Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The campus' 2-year-old Entertainment Industry Institute has
organized a daylong conference dubbed Adam Smith Goes to Hollywood,
with panels covering profit predictions, labor markets, the
regional economy and the arts. Participants include studio
executives, consultants and university professors.
</P>
<P>
   Lani Daniels, a former Hollywood executive who heads the
institute, said the event is part of CSUN's ongoing efforts to
improve its recognition among industry professionals. ``The
conference is targeting a high-profile audience rather than those
interested in breaking into the business,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our original marching orders were pretty clear _ create more
interdisciplinary courses and build bridges with the industry,''
Daniels said. ``I'm not aware of many events like this that bring
together people from the industry and academia, so we're going to
get a richer discussion as a result.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to helping create classes in cinematography and
editing, the institute has sponsored the California SUN
International Animation Festival, a teleconference on the issue of
news vs. entertainment and an entertainment career conference. The
animation festival drew about 1,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Cody Cluff, president of the Entertainment Industry Development
Corp., will be today's keynote speaker and plans to stress the need
to acknowledge the unprecedented amount of change that the industry
faces due to the emergence of digital cameras and powerful desktop
computers for editing and animation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, there are changes everywhere, from the basic
economic model all the way to the technology of production,'' Cluff
said Thursday in an interview. ``The fact that we're telling
stories will not change, but the tools we're using are changing and
the way we deliver them will change.''
</P>
<P>
   Cluff predicted major shifts will come soon in areas such as
high-definition TV production, satellite delivery of movies to
theaters and using computers for set and costume design. ``To
survive, people will need to match creative abilities with a solid
understanding of the business, so they need to be very cognizant of
both the latest and least expensive technology,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Cluff said the blockbuster success of ``The Blair Witch
Project,'' which topped $140 million in domestic box office gross
after being shot for $35,000, underscored the profound shifts in
the business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Digital video cameras have forever changed Hollywood,'' he
asserted. ``We're seeing filmmaking heading to an environment
that's very much like the recording industry, where people have the
equipment to make a completed product in their living rooms. We're
fast approaching the same level of sophistication in animated TV
and theatrical productions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Blair Witch Project'' should also be a signal that the
world's film schools are turning out thousands of graduates who
know how to use low-cost filmmaking technology, according to Cluff.

WOMAN CONVICTED OF KILLING MAN ON VIAGRA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE LAMBE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Area lawyers said a
Jackson County murder case this week may have been the first use of
what they called the Viagra defense.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mary T. Frost, 33, said she stabbed her 77-year-old Kansas City
housemate to death after the man, who used Viagra, asked her for
sex, begged her for sex and then tried to rape her.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors deliberated six hours Thursday before convicting Frost of
second-degree murder. She can be sentenced from 10 years to life.
</P>
<P>
   They convicted Frost, one juror later said, because they thought
she could have defended herself without stabbing Oscar Fingers in
the heart on June 18, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   She was also guilty because she waited more than an hour to call
police and to summon medical help for Fingers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt she just left him to die,'' the juror said.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, the case was unlike any that area lawyers
had seen. The case hinged on Finger's use of Viagra and Frost's
videotaped police statement last year. She did not testify, and the
tape told her story at trial:
</P>
<P>
   She had moved in with Fingers months before and had her own
bedroom. The two were just friends, but he had started taking
Viagra and slept with other women.
</P>
<P>
   As she watched television that night, he asked her for sex. Then
he got down on his knees and begged for sex. Then he started toward
her and became more forceful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oscar is really a nice person,'' but that night ``he was
acting like a maniac.'' She threw a ceramic rooster at him, ran
into the kitchen and got a steak knife. She returned and waved the
knife to keep him away.
</P>
<P>
   ``He started to reach for me, and I jumped up. I stuck him,''
Frost said.
</P>
<P>
   He grabbed the knife, and she shoved him to the floor into a
corner. He went into the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   She yelled she was calling police.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I go to jail, you're going to jail, too, because you had no
business trying to rape me,'' she said she told him.
</P>
<P>
   He told her not to call police. She told him she was sorry she
stuck him and called her mother. Her mother told her to put a towel
over the wound. (But the blade had pierced Fingers' heart, and he
was bleeding internally).
</P>
<P>
   Fingers cleaned the knife and handed it to her, and she put it
back in the kitchen drawer. Frost called her mother again, and her
mother and brother drove over. Her mother told her to call police,
and Frost did _ more than an hour after the stabbing.
</P>
<P>
   In closing arguments Thursday, assistant prosecutor Kate Mahoney
said the two could have argued over something else. She reminded
jurors that Fingers took Frost in as a favor to her mother months
before and wanted Frost to leave. Frost refused.
</P>
<P>
   Fingers also was afraid of Frost, Mahoney said. He had locked
the kitchen butcher knives in the trunk of his car but left out the
steak knives.
</P>
<P>
   His Viagra use also helped the prosecution's case, Mahoney said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that he took Viagra and had women shows he was no
potential rapist _ he didn't even like her,'' Mahoney said.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyer Jarrett Johnson said his client acted in
self-defense in a horrifying situation of a man consumed by lust.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was getting angrier and angrier, and he made his intentions
very clear,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Fingers didn't know how bad he was hurt, and he ordered her not
to call police because he wanted to work things out, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Mahoney countered: ``He was left to bleed to death on the
bathroom floor.''
</P>
<P>
   And even if Frost told the truth, she did not have to stab the
77-year-old man to escape harm, Mahoney said.
</P>
<P>
   After the verdict, Mahoney said other women who want to try a
Viagra defense to murder might think again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't work here,'' she said.

GLENDALE GETS DISNEY BALL ROLLING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLENDALE, CALIF. _ The city of Glendale took the first official
step Thursday toward creating a major new entertainment industry
campus for Walt Disney Co.
</P>
<P>
   The city's redevelopment agency issued a ``notice of
preparation'' to state officials that it had launched the
environmental review process for Disney's proposed Grand Central
Creative Campus. Redevelopment director Jeanne Armstrong said the
draft environmental impact report, prepared by Los Angeles-based
environmental consultants PCR, should be ready in March following
extensive information gathering and public meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The project would transform the dozens of tilt-up concrete
buildings in Grand Central industrial park into a high-tech hub
with four- to six-story buildings surrounded by green belts,
courtyards, walkways, tree-lined streets and planted medians. The
first new buildings would be ready for occupancy in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong said local reaction to the project, unveiled by Disney
in early September, has been positive. ``I think Disney has been in
Glendale for so long that they are perceived as a very good
employer and a company that gives back to the community,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Disney Imagineering, the research and development operation
that designs theme-park rides, has been headquartered in the
industrial park since 1961. Disney bought the property, which lies
within the city's 7-year-old San Fernando Road Redevelopment
Corridor, in 1997 and has about 3,000 employees there.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's plans include restoring the now-vacant Grand Central
Air Terminal, the first major airport in the Los Angeles area, and
converting it into office space. When completed, the entire project
will be anchored by Disney's Imagineering and new media divisions.

KC SCHOOL DISTRICT STRIPPED OF CERTIFICATION 
</HEADLINE>
 SCHOOLS-ACCREDITATION-2TAKES-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PHILLIP O'CONNOR, KEVIN HOFFMAN and LYNN FRANEY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. _ The Missouri Board
of Education voted unanimously Thursday to strip the Kansas City
School District of accreditation despite pleas to delay the action
for the sake of students.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The board agreed to postpone the decision's effective date until
May 1, a move state officials said was aimed at eliminating
concerns that students would flee the district in the middle of the
school year.
</P>
<P>
   But state board members said they could no longer accept the
district's dismal performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very difficult vote for all of us,'' said state
board member Rice Burns Jr. of Sikeston. ``To a person, all of us
are thinking about your kids, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The district has until June 30, 2002, to raise test scores or
meet other requirements, such as improving attendance and
graduation rates, to regain accreditation. If that doesn't happen,
then state officials take over the district, split it into smaller
districts or divide up its students and send them to other
districts.
</P>
<P>
   After the vote, Superintendent Benjamin Demps Jr. said he
wouldn't be diverted from his goal of raising the academic
achievement of all district students.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a lot of work to do,'' Demps said. ``I've got a tough
job ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Demps said the district would pursue its legal options. The
district tried unsuccessfully in both state and federal court to
bar the state from taking action Thursday. U.S. District Judge Dean
Whipple set a hearing for Tuesday on a district request to keep the
action from taking effect.
</P>
<P>
   Should that effort fail, some Kansas City school board members
say the district could be doomed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It still makes it a complete disaster for the district,'' said
board member Lance Loewenstein. ``(They) may think the children
won't leave the district, but they will.''
</P>
<P>
   Joy West-Spearman said her stomach turned when she got a phone
call Thursday from her daughter, a junior at Lincoln College Prep,
informing her of the decision. West-Spearman thinks that it will
hurt her daughter's chance to attend a private college.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that (graduation) certificate is going to
be worthless,'' she said, citing a concern raised by many parents.
</P>
<P>
   However, several college officials have said that the state's
decision would not prevent Kansas City students from getting into
college.
</P>
<P>
   West-Spearman said her daughter was already looking at other
schools in case she decides to leave the district.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at many of the city's 15 charter schools said they had
received numerous calls from parents in the last week asking about
openings, particularly for high school students.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're so upset,'' said Erik Harvey, on-site manager at
Southwest Charter School. ``The rumors of losing accreditation
started it all. It was the straw that broke the camel's back. It
was all over the papers and it made them think.''
</P>
<P>
   Even school board President John Rios said he would weigh
whether to remove his children from the district.
</P>
<P>
   But Bill Clark, president of the Urban League of Greater Kansas
City, cautioned the community against panicking and urged support
for the district.
</P>
<P>
   The state board vote came after several officials voiced concern
about how the loss of accreditation would affect the district,
especially in view of recent progress under Demps.
</P>
<P>
   ``To withdraw accreditation for the acknowledged failures of
earlier administrations imposes hardships on the children while
undermining efforts of this administration, newly appointed and
focused on the very educational reforms we all recognize as
essential to improve student achievement,'' said Arthur A. Benson
II, attorney for the plaintiff schoolchildren in the Kansas City
desegregation lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Mary Groves Bland, a Kansas City Democrat, told the
state board that community, political and religious leaders were
committed to seeing the district improve. Already, she said,
notices are being posted in schools, churches and other public
places encouraging parents to keep faith in the district. She urged
the board to delay its decision.
</P>
<P>
   Demps told the board he was hired in August solely to implement
a federal court order to improve academic achievement. He said the
uncertainties of being unaccredited could make it difficult to meet
court-ordered goals to enact a new core curriculum, improve teacher
training, introduce new tests designed to better gauge student
performance and develop a plan to hold students, teachers and
administrators accountable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Student performance is why I'm here,'' Demps said. ``That is
my passion. If we were to become unaccredited, things would happen
that would deter us from that cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Demps said being unaccredited would make the difficult task of
luring and keeping high quality employees even harder.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City teachers union President Judy Morgan said she had
already heard from teachers. She said the loss of accreditation
could cause some veteran teachers to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't support subdividing or dissolving the district,''
Morgan said.
</P>
<P>
   State Board of Education President Betty Preston of Chillicothe
called the lack of improvement in the five years since Kansas City
last underwent a state review inexcusable.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't set the benchmark...we are imposing a hardship on
children who grow up and don't have the skills they need,'' Preston
said.
</P>
<P>
   Board member Russell Thompson of Columbia said troubled
districts always asked the board to consider the children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet we don't see any change or difference,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Education Commissioner Robert Bartman agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over time we've learned that good intentions don't move a
district forward,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bartman had recommended that both the Kansas City and St. Louis
districts lose their accreditation after their students posted
dismal scores on the latest state standardized tests.
</P>
<P>
   The state board on Thursday tabled the decision on St. Louis in
accordance with a provision in the settlement of that city's
desegregation lawsuit. The provision defers any sanctions
associated with the loss of accreditation until June 2002. The St.
Louis district would retain accreditation in the interim, but also
must show progress or become unaccredited.
</P>
<P>
   Bartman told state board members that there was no state or
federal money set aside to help either district with its problems.
</P>
<P>
   But Bartman said Gov. Mel Carnahan told him recently that he
remained committed to helping the state's two largest public school
systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how that will play out,'' Bartman said. MORE

<TEXT>
<P>
   In addition, Bartman said top administrators from the state
Department of Elementary and Secondary Education would be in Kansas
City and St. Louis Monday to begin assisting both districts in
meeting the state-ordered improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City officials were concerned that once the district
became unaccredited, its students could begin enrolling in
neighboring districts willing to accept them.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the surrounding districts prohibit out-of-district
students from enrolling. But Kansas City board members think
districts could change their policies in light of Thursday's
decision. The Kansas City district would have to pay tuition and
transportation costs for students who choose to go to different
districts.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City school board members say those costs, when combined
with the loss of per-pupil state aid to charter schools and a
decrease in annual state funding, could doom the district to
financial failure.
</P>
<P>
   Bartman said loss of accreditation was the best tool the state
had to spur academic improvement in Kansas City and St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's extremely important that the two major districts
in our state be successful,'' Bartman said. ``This is the wake-up

education.''

ACTIVIST GIVES DETAILS OF HIS LIGHT RAIL PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
 RAIL-PLAN-2TAKES-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNN HORSLEY and MATT CAMPBELL  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Transportation
activist Clay Chastain this week outlined his vision for light rail
in Kansas City, although he emphasized that the details should be
left to the professional planners.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I am not the emperor of light rail,'' Chastain said as he
discussed his initiative on the Nov. 2 ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Chastain's Question 5 asks voters to extend a 1-cent sales tax
for 15 years, with half the money going for basic infrastructure
improvements. The other half would build a light rail line from
south Kansas City to Kansas City International Airport that is
estimated to cost from $900 million to $1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The city is backing a rival proposal, Question 1, which asks
voters to support an eight-year tax extension of the 1-cent tax.
All the money, estimated at more than $500 million, will go for
basic infrastructure such as bridges, roads, sewers and sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   Chastain said that if his proposal passes, he envisions a
downtown corridor being dedicated to light rail trains traveling in
both directions down the middle, with one lane for emergency and
delivery vehicles on either side. That would reduce traffic
congestion and make the area more friendly to bicyclists and
pedestrians, Chastain said.
</P>
<P>
   At the cross streets, Chastain said, light rail would get
priority for green lights. He said the city could also have
mechanical crossing guards to ensure safety at major intersections.
</P>
<P>
   Where there is existing right of way, such as in the Brookside
area or along Waukomis Drive in the Northland, the light rail line
could be built there.
</P>
<P>
   To cross the Missouri River, Chastain proposed light rail use
the ASB bridge upper rail bed, between the Hannibal and Heart of
America bridges.
</P>
<P>
   Chastain said he envisioned trains going by about every 15
minutes, stopping every few blocks in congested areas, but
traveling 70 to 80 mph as they approach the airport.
</P>
<P>
   The ballot initiative also calls for a new terminal connecting
the light rail line with the planned Johnson County Commuter Rail
line in Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Pritchett, director of rail planning for the Kansas City
Area Transportation Authority, said the ATA's plans have always
assumed that large portions of a light rail line would operate on
city streets. But identifying those streets and gaining public
consensus on the details has been a problem.
</P>
<P>
   When the ATA several years ago proposed a line along Grand
Boulevard, business leaders feared construction disruptions. Parks
board representatives also balked at the use of a boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's ideal, to have a street dedicated to light rail. But
the question is whether people would accept that,'' Pritchett said.
</P>
<P>
   Pritchett said another complication would be going over the
Missouri River. He pointed out that the ASB bridge's upper rail
does not extend all the way from one side of the river to the
other. It is also only one lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would have to do a tremendous amount of retrofitting,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pritchett said the ATA also is concerned about whether Kansas
City realistically could expect to receive the $500 million to $1
billion in federal funding that would be needed to build the
35-mile line. Other officials think Kansas City should anticipate
only $300 million in federal funding.
</P>
<P>
   Critics also have questioned why Kansas Citians should pay for a
terminal that will benefit the Johnson County rail project.
Chastain, however, said that Kansas Citians must provide the
leadership and funding to get light rail going.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be too cumbersome to try to get it funded with a bistate
tax,'' Chastain said. ``History will have passed us by by that
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Cities have unique situations that require tailored approaches
to light rail. /{The Kansas City Star/} looked at a handful that
have embarked upon that path, or are just beginning. The cities
were chosen for geographical diversity as well as comparable size.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly half the population of the state of Washington is
squeezed into an hourglass shape constricted by Puget Sound and
Lake Washington. Seattle's a beautiful place to live, but ``rush
hour'' can stretch to four or five hours.
</P>
<P>
   Seeds of light rail were sown in 1992, when the state created a
regional bus and rail district known as Sound Transit. But voters
in 1995 rejected a nearly $7 billion rail plan as too expensive. A
scaled-back $3.9 billion plan, based on a 0.4 percent sales tax and
a 0.3 percent motor vehicle license tax, passed the next year.
</P>
<P>
   The system also relies on a 20 percent federal contribution.
</P>
<P>
   A two-mile light rail line in Tacoma, Wash., is on a fast track
toward completion in 2001. Environmental impact studies are being
completed for a separate spine to link downtown Seattle and the
SeaTac airport. It is scheduled to be in service by 2006.
</P>
<P>
   Light rail is to be augmented by 82 miles of commuter rail on
existing Burlington Northern railroad tracks linking Seattle and
Tacoma by this time next year.
</P>
<P>
   The system will combine surface lines with tunnels and elevated
sections. Light-rail ridership is projected at 125,000 initially,
with about 40 percent of operating costs recovered in fares.
</P>
<P>
   Rail opponents who prefer buses have argued fixed lines cannot
buck the 20th-century trend toward more mobility and flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   The situation became complicated in 1997, when Seattle voters
approved an initiative petition placed on the ballot by a former
cabdriver. It called for expanding the city's one-mile monorail
left over from the 1962 World's Fair into a 40-mile system cutting
an X-shape through the city. MORE

<P>
   But the monorail has no funding and its likely routes would
overlap those of Sound Transit.
</P>
<P>
   City planners view Portland, Ore., as a progressive city in
containing urban sprawl, and the light-rail system plays a key part
in that policy.
</P>
<P>
   The Tri-Met transit authority built its first 15-mile line from
downtown to suburbs on the east. Last year, it opened an 18-mile
westward line to connect workers with high-tech jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Ridership has been higher than expected, and large employers
such as Intel and Nike provide yearly rail passes to employees. On
the west side, home builders have planned communities around rail
stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen $2.4 billion in new development within walking
distance from the stations since the 1979 decision to build the
line,'' said G.B. Arrington, director of strategic planning.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the rail system take the Libertarian view that it and
other restrictive-growth policies impose too much government
control.
</P>
<P>
   The existing lines depended largely on federal money but part of
the airport spur under construction is being paid for by a large
private employer.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the rail line is at street level within dedicated
roadway lanes. The newest trains are very quiet. Five persons have
been killed after being struck by the trains, but Tri-Met says in
most cases the victim was partially at fault.
</P>
<P>
   Fares range from $1.10 to $1.45, depending on distance, and
revenue from fares covers nearly half the light-rail operating
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Voters a year ago rejected a property tax increase to build a
22-mile north-south line. But Tri-Met and Portland are seeking to
pool local funds with a federal grant to proceed with a $350
million northern spur.
</P>
<P>
   Metropolitan Denver hugs a mountainous wall, but the population
density is centered on land almost as flat as Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Voters approved a Regional Transportation District nearly 30
years ago. The integrated bus and rail system now encompasses 41
municipalities.
</P>
<P>
   Local funding from a 0.6 percent sales tax allowed Denver to
build its first light-rail line without federal help, but spurs to
the southwest and southeast will require nearly $1 billion from
Washington, leveraged by a local bond issue planned for Nov. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Central Denver suffers a parking shortage, which officials think
has contributed to high ridership on light rail. About 15,000
riders a day were projected at this point, but the number is closer
to 17,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking 4,000to 5,000 cars from the central business
district every day,'' said district spokesman Scott Reed. ``Plus
we're eliminating nearly 500 bus trips that formerly came into
downtown.''
</P>
<P>
   About 37 percent of total bus and rail system operating costs
are covered by fares.
</P>
<P>
   The southwest extension to Littleton is to open in July and is
projected to carry 8,400 daily riders initially, but is expected to
grow to 22,000 by 2015, according to the district. The southeast
extension is projected to carry 30,000 riders a day.
</P>
<P>
   Many property owners, however, oppose rail routes down the
middle of interstate highways because they force the roadways to
encroach outward.
</P>
<P>
   The central light-rail line is at surface level, requiring
traffic to yield to trains. The extensions are planned with no
at-grade crossings.
</P>
<P>
   In the 3 years since two interconnecting light-rail lines went
into service in Dallas, initial ridership projections of 33,000
have been exceeded by about 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   That, along with an estimated $600 million in private-sector
investment near the station points, causes the Dallas Area Rapid
Transit system to think it is on the right track.
</P>
<P>
   Studies by the University of North Texas project that the
economic impact of the planned extensions will bring a 2-to-1
return on the public investment. Property values near the
light-rail stations have increased by as much as 25 percent,
according to one of the university studies.
</P>
<P>
   Bus and rail systems are integrated in Dallas, but officials
said that light rail has proven an effective tool in influencing
the direction of growth, as well as bolstering redevelopment
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   High-rent lofts are being snatched up in the city center. To the
northeast, the suburb of Richardson, already home to many high-tech
companies, is anticipating an expansion station by planning for new
residential, office, hotel and performing arts developments.
</P>
<P>
   But some suburban merchants oppose street-level rail, saying it
will disrupt traffic and business.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas rail system incorporates at-grade crossings, tunnels
and elevated sections.
</P>
<P>
   The network was built with a 1-cent transportation sales tax in
each member city. The two rail extensions will cost about $1
billion. But earlier this month, Dallas Area Rapid Transit became
the first transit authority to sign an agreement for a full
light-rail grant of $333 million under the new federal
transportation act.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly the impact and the reception can be found not only in
ridership, but also in the investment people have been willing to
make in developing around the system,'' said system spokesman
Morgan Lyons.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a light-rail spine in traffic-congested St. Louis
had been bandied about since 1984 but the fear was always that
people could not be pried from their cars.
</P>
<P>
   But early projections of 12,000 riders a day have ballooned to
about 40,000 people on the 17-mile MetroLink line between
Lambert-St. Louis International Airport and East St. Louis in
Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Now the problem for the Bi-State Development Agency, which also
provides bus service, is how to keep up with growing demand for
light rail.
</P>
<P>
   The original MetroLink line was built with $348 million in
federal funds and a local in-kind property match worth $116
million. A quarter-cent sales tax will pay for future rail lines.
Extensions to Belleville and Scott Air Force Base in Illinois are
under way, but voters in 1997 rejected a new one-quarter cent sales
tax to speed up future work.
</P>
<P>
   A planning group called the East-West Gateway Coordinating
Council is studying alignments to take MetroLink out into St. Louis
County. Suburban cities, including upscale Clayton, are concerned
about the aesthetic effect of elevated rail and the disruptions
from at-grade crossings.
</P>
<P>
   The MetroLink combines elevated sections, at-grade crossings and
tunnels. The basic one-way fare is $1.25; fares make up about 25
percent of the transit district's total operating costs.

LCS RATINGS REQUIRE CLOSER INSPECTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (ital) The TV sports world according to me: (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   NUMEROLOGY: Numbers being as pliable as silly string, you're
going to hear some baseball experts raving about the League
Championship Series (LCS) ratings as another sign that the good old
days are back.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not so fast. The completed Mets-Braves and Yankees-Red Sox
LCS posted the highest Nielsens since 1993, which was the year
before the 1994 strike which cancelled a World Series. But the
numbers didn't soar to the top of the week's Nielsen chart or even
beat the NFL in head-to-head occasions.
</P>
<P>
   The average rating for the LCS games shared by NBC and Fox was a
10.3, a 21 percent increase over last year's 8.5 and the best since
an 11.8 in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's five-game average for the ALCS was a 9.2, its
highest-rated LCS ever, a 21 percent increase over its 7.6 for the
NLCS in '98 and a six percent increase over its 8.7 for the ALCS in
'97. Fox earned these numbers, too, despite some stiff obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   Game 3's dream matchup of Pedro Martinez and Roger Clemens was a
daytime telecast that fizzled as the Sox KO'd Rocket en route to a
13-1 win. The Nielsen was 7.5, which was a tenth better than the
7.4 for Game 4 Sunday night, which had competition for two hours
from the extra-inning Braves-Mets game as well as ESPN's Sunday
night NFL cablecast.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's 9.6 for Game 5 came opposite ABC's Monday Night NFL
game between Dallas and the New York Giants, a snoozer that still
beat baseball head-to-head with a 12.1 rating.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's six-game NLCS average was 11.3, an increase of 20 percent
from NBC's ALCS last season and 49 percent from Fox's NLCS in 1998.
The almost six-hour, 15-inning Game 5 between the Braves and Mets
earned a 12.0, while the Game 6 clinching win for the Braves earned
a 15.4, the highest national mark for a NLCS game since 1993 when a
Braves-Phillies game earned a 17.4. One network ratings point
represents 994,000 households.
</P>
<P>
   The divisional series ratings indicate that baseball fans are
sharp enough to know a qualifier when they see one. NBC averaged a
7.0 for three telecasts, down 10 percent, and Fox a 6.9 for five
games, down three percent. Game 5 of the Boston-Cleveland series on
Fox did a 9.0 and cut into ABC's Monday night game, which did a
10.4, down 34 percent.
</P>
<P>
   (subhd) Happy New Year
</P>
<P>
   A year ago at this stage of the baseball season, NBC's Bob
Costas and Joe Morgan were coming off their postseason baseball
work amid more criticism than either had ever heard during their
broadcast careers.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus said Costas was rusty from not having any regular
season baseball work and that the two lacked any spark or chemistry
in the booth.
</P>
<P>
   The opposite is now true. Costas and Morgan worked together on a
few ESPN regular season games, and they meshed well on the NLCS and
go into the World Series on a high.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lucky for us, one of the two games we did this year was a
Mets-Braves game, so some feeling carried over,'' Costas said. ``It
was a matter of getting the mechanics and a rhythm down, and we
were lucky that the NLCS had so many good games. Once things got
going, we found a flow.''
</P>
<P>
   It had to be strange for both men to read unflattering reviews.
Costas has been a standard bearer in the industry for years, and
Morgan, at least until a recent article that said players thought
he was too blunt, was always considered one of the best analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone who watches isn't going to like you or love you,''
Morgan said. ``I can only do a game through my eyes. I don't
broadcast the games for the players, I broadcast for the fans. I
think in many cases, players are getting things thirdhand, because
I know they're not watching the telecast. But in truth, I don't
think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``By my own assessment, I felt I was rusty (last season),''
Costas said. ``The broadcasts were good, but not as good as in the
past and what we should be able to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's true that if you're around for a long time, and
have been treated well, there may be some people who jump at the
first sign that things are falling. I understand that. I just try
to keep my perspective that overall I've been very well treated.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox Sports NFL pregame anchor Terry Bradshaw, on his KXTA (1150
AM) radio show this week, savaged Costas for his on-air work and a
condescending attitude, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one person,'' Costas said. ``I've never had a problem
with Terry. I've never said anything public or private about him.
We do have different approaches.''
</P>
<P>
   (subhead) And now the news
</P>
<P>
   More ball notes. Costas and Morgan declined to pick a winner.
But Costas expects the series to have a moment along the lines of a
Bill Buckner
</P>
<P>
   roller or Kirk Gibson
</P>
<P>
   home run. Costas says the Yankees' Darryl Strawberry
</P>
<P>
   is the X factor, and Morgan says the Braves will need a dynamic
series by Andruw Jones
</P>
<P>
   to win. ... Costas has joined the growing number of
sportscasters who believe instant replay should be used on select
occasions, like the tag play in Game 4 of the ALCS. ... Costas will
host two specials Saturday before Game 1, ``The Sporting News 25
Greatest Moments in Baseball History'' and the ``MLB All-Century
Team.'' The members of the All-Century Team will be introduced
before the start of Game 2 in Atlanta, and Vin Scully
</P>
<P>
   will handle those on-air introductions. ... XTRA (690 AM) and
KXTA will carry the World Series broadcasts via ESPN Radio, with
the teams to include Jon Miller
</P>
<P>
   , Rick Sutcliffe
</P>
<P>
   , Charley Steiner
</P>
<P>
   and Dave Campbell
</P>
<P>
   .
</P>
<P>
   ...
</P>
<P>
   Fox's NFL pregame show Sunday features a Howie Long
</P>
<P>
   piece with Jimmy Johnson that covers the Dolphins' coach and his
relationship with quarterback Dan Marino

ANOTHER WET LA NINA WINTER PREDICTED
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By DAVID PERLMAN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  A NASA satellite is warning weather-watchers to prepare for
another ``wet and wild'' winter, with cold storms blasting the
Pacific coast from Alaska to San Francisco.
<P>
   ``We're in for another La Nina,'' said oceanographer William
Patzert, who monitors the satellite's findings every 10 days from
his station at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The satellite, dubbed TOPEX/Poseidon, orbits Earth from pole to
pole and measures how high the sea surface across the entire
Pacific rises above its normal level. It is so precise that it can
detect the rises and falls of just a few inches that indicate
significant changes in weather patterns in the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
   When the ocean's temperature rises, so does the height of the
sea, but in areas where it cools down, the level of the surface
drops, Patzert explained.
</P>
<P>
   Maps created from the satellite's latest data show that the
Pacific's surface height dipped about six inches below normal
during a 10-day cycle that ended last Friday, Patzert said. At the
same time, the surface of the western part of the Pacific is higher
than normal, which indicates that temperatures will be higher than
usual in that part of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Patzert is now forecasting a wet and stormy winter in the
northeastern Pacific and a dry and warmer-than-usual winter in
Southern California and much of the Southwest, he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's the mark of a La Nina winter _ the reverse of weather
conditions known as El Nino, when the Pacific's waters are
unusually warm along the Northern California coast and colder than
usual down south.
</P>
<P>
   These extremely unbalanced conditions, Patzert said, exert a
powerful influence on the weather system that sends the jet stream
out of the North Pacific across North America.  &LR;   &LR;  To Patzert, the
unstable atmosphere above the ponderous Pacific is like ``a
ballerina dancing on top of an elephant,'' and as a result, he
said, ``we're definitely going through a decade of wild climatic
behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   The La Nina phenomenon usually follows an El Nino year and
creates the opposite weather conditions. So during the 1997-98 El
Nino winter, for example, the waters off the Northern California
coast reached record high temperatures, and offshore fishermen
found themselves catching all kinds of tropical creatures, some
edible and some not.
</P>
<P>
   Then last winter's cold La Nina followed, when precipitation
throughout Northern California was 45 percent above normal and the
Pacific Northwest was lashed with one heavy winter storm after
another.
</P>
<P>
   Similar abnormally cold and wet La Nina weather has also
followed El Ninos three times in the past 15 years: after the
1982-83 El Nino event, and after those of 1986-87 and 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
   It is somewhat unusual for two La Nina events to occur in
successive years, Patzert said, adding, ``And as some distinguished
person remarked, this coming winter is `deja vu all over again.' ''
Scientists at the government's Climate Prediction Center in Camp
Springs, Md., use a wide array of surface buoys to watch changing
sea temperatures across the entire Pacific, and they, too, are
predicting a second episode of La Nina weather for the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Above-normal precipitation and below-normal temperatures'' is
the forecast for the coming winter in Northern California and the
Northwest, said Ants Leetma of the federal agency.
</P>
<P>
   Leetma and his colleagues keep long-term climate records for the
entire country, and ``it's pretty clear'' that there was a gradual
warming of sea surface temperatures all along the Pacific Coast
during the 1970s, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now that pattern seems to be reversing, and it looks as though
the coast is in for a gradual return to a warmer, long-term El Nino
weather pattern, despite the coming winter wet and cold, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is whether this pattern will persist, and if it
does, it could have profound effects'' on California climate
trends, he said. But the evidence for long-term changes is still
unclear, so the return of La Nina is still the most likely outcome
for the coming winter months, Leetma said. &QL;

FALWELL AND GAYS TO MEET ON ISSUES THAT SPLIT THEM
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By DON LATTIN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   They've made careers out of condemning each other.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, the Rev. Jerry Falwell, 200 members of the
televangelist's Baptist church and 200 gay and lesbian religious
leaders will sit down in a Lynchburg, Va., church together, trying
to get beyond two decades of demonizing and demagoguery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to sit down together and see that none of us have
horns,'' Falwell said Thursday. ``We've agreed to look carefully at
our wording, to lower the rhetoric, without changing what we
believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Inspiring the gathering is a series of highly publicized hate
crimes against gays and Christians and the rekindling of a
friendship between Falwell and the Rev. Mel White.
</P>
<P>
   White is a former ghostwriter for Falwell, whose close
association with the Religious Right leader abruptly ended when
White came out of the closet. For the past six years, White has
been campaigning for gay rights as a minister with the
predominantly gay Universal Fellowship of Metropolitan Community
Churches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't go into the new millennium hating each other,'' White
said Thursday after a meeting with Falwell at Thomas Road Baptist
Church in Lynchburg.
</P>
<P>
   ``We demonize Falwell all the time _ saying that he wants to
create a theocracy and making him look like the devil. We've got to
stop raising money off each other's sickness. People are being
killed on all sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Gay rights activists cite last year's murder of Matthew Shepard,
a gay student at the University of Wyoming, and the July 1 double
slaying of Gary Matson and Winfield Scott Mowder, a gay couple
living in Happy Valley, a rural community outside Redding.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative evangelicals point to the September rampage at a
Fort Worth Baptist church, when a gunman shouting anti-Baptist
rhetoric killed three adults and four teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   Falwell said the spate of violence convinced him that gay
leaders and Christian fundamentalists could not continue business
as usual.
</P>
<P>
   Not all factions are willing to stop screaming at one another.
Police in Virginia have issued permits for eight groups that want
to protest the gathering.
</P>
<P>
   The invited guests will be meeting in the church in groups of
10, five from each side. Reporters and television cameras will be
kept outside the church during the actual meetings. ``We don't want
people to put on an act,'' Falwell said.
</P>
<P>
   White's delegation, called ``Soulforce'' and coming from 30
states, plans to contribute $20,000 to Habitat for Humanity in
Lynchburg, give 1,000 cans and packages of food to local food banks
and pick up trash along Lynchburg streets. The delegation will also
worship with Falwell's flock Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 200 people selected by White is a seven-member Bay
Area delegation, including gay and lesbian Christians from Baptist,
Methodist, Presbyterian and Roman Catholic congregations.
</P>
<P>
   Christian de la Huerta, the San Francisco author of the book
``Coming Out Spirituality,'' is one of ``the Lynchburg Seven.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping we can move beyond labels like `sinners' and
`abomination' and `Christian fanatics' and discover that underneath
the apparent differences we all share a common humanity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another participant, Kara Speltz, is a lesbian, a certified
pastoral minister with the Roman Catholic Diocese of Oakland and an
active member of the Newman Hall/Holy Spirit Parish in Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We make nasty remarks about Jerry Falwell just like he makes
nasty remarks about us. One of the principles of nonviolence is to
recognize the truth in your opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Ending the `Hate Speech'
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the Lynchburg seven are gay or lesbian. The Rev. Doug
Donley, pastor of Dolores Street Baptist Church in San Francisco,
is heterosexual. His 35-member church has been kicked out of the
Southern Baptist Convention for its nonjudgmental policy toward
homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Donley is traveling to Lynchburg with a gay member of his flock,
Dave Chandler, a sales consultant with Oracle Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to speak to our Baptist brother (Falwell) and
call for an end to the hate speech,'' said Donley. ``It's much
easier to demonize an issue than a person. We need to spread the
message that God loves all people _ even Baptist people.''
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday's interview with The Chronicle, Falwell conceded
that he has gotten carried away with his rhetoric about gay people.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Falwell stressed that he still thinks
homosexuality is a sin, as is adultery, and that gays and lesbians
can overcome their sexual problems through Christian counseling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't compromise that fact,'' he said, ``but we can do it
without being condescending.''
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Friday, a gay rights activist and San Francisco police
commissioner, commended Falwell for his recent remarks against
anti-gay violence and for holding this weekend's forum at his
church. In a letter to Falwell, he also urged the Baptist leader to
take another look at his theology.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Love the sinner, hate the sin,' is a statement which
validates and encourages violence,'' Friday said. ``These are words
of hate, not love.''

HIGH-TECH LEADERS BEG RELUCTANT SENATORS FOR MORE WORK VISAS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  WASHINGTON _ Silicon Valley lobbyists warned a Senate
subcommittee Thursday of a dire shortage of high-tech workers, but
despite broad sympathy in Congress, there is little chance that the
ceiling on temporary work visas will be lifted this year.
<P>
   Senator Dianne Feinstein said she supports another increase in
the number of so-called H-1B visas, which grant temporary entry to
highly skilled workers. But the California Democrat pointedly added
that she thinks more should be done to train U.S. workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been besieged by CEOs from high-tech companies year
after year,'' Feinstein said, citing statistics to demonstrate that
she understands the vital role high-tech plays in the California
economy. ``I've heard, firsthand, CEOs saying we can't find
educated Californians who can do these jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   But unless American native  &LR; workers are better educated, she
added, ``what we're going to have in California is an increasing
division between those who have and those who have not.''
</P>
<P>
   Michigan Republican Spencer Abraham called the Senate
immigration subcommittee hearing to rally support for lifting the
current 115,000 per year ceiling on H-1B visas. Even though the cap
was nearly doubled just last year, it was reached in June.
</P>
<P>
   The industry has complained vociferously that an explosive
demand for skilled workers, a shortage of U.S. science and computer
graduates, and visa backlogs from previous years are creating a
critical labor shortage that threatens to strangle high-tech's
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Several bills to raise the limit have been introduced. Yet
despite a full-court press in both parties to please the high-tech
industry, the visa issue is divisive, splitting off pro-labor
factions among Democrats and anti-immigration factions among
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Republican Lamar Smith, who chairs the House immigration
subcommittee, strongly opposes further H-1B increases, and is not
about to move such a bill in the few weeks left before Congress
adjourns. Instead, Smith has highlighted visa fraud and the recent
admission by the Immigration and Naturalization service that it
mistakenly granted anywhere from 10,000 to 20,000 extra H-1B visas
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., also signaled his
potential opposition, rattling off a survey showing high-tech
industry salaries in the $40,000 range.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not one graduate of Harvard Law School who starts off
making less than $100,000,'' Kennedy said, calling the
comparatively low salaries in high-tech ``surprising,'' given the
industry's complaints of shortages.
</P>
<P>
   Susan DeFife, president of womenConnect.com, an Internet company
in Virginia, answered that companies rely more on stock options to
attract workers.
</P>
<P>
   Roberta Katz, president of TechNet, a Silicon Valley lobbying
group, assured Feinstein that the industry's top worry is the poor
performance of U.S. schools and that companies are pouring hundreds
of millions of dollars into training and education.
</P>
<P>
   Katz and others said Intel Corp. spends more than $100 million a
year and Hewlett-Packard $50 million to improve lower education,
while Cisco Systems has 17,000 students enrolled in its Networking
Academies.
</P>
<P>
   But Katz insisted that until U.S. schools produce enough trained
workers, skilled foreigners should not be rebuffed, especially
since many received their advanced degrees from U.S. universities.
``To turn these highly skilled scientists and engineers away after
we have trained them in the United States _ encouraging them to
seek employment by foreign companies who may be our competitors _
simply does not make sense,'' Katz said.

 DINOSAUR FOSSILS COULD BE THE OLDEST YET  &HT;     By DAVID PERLMAN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A villager in a remote and roadless valley of Madagascar led a
team of scientists to a clutter of old bones in a nearby hill four
years ago, opening the door to one of the most remarkable fossil
discoveries of recent times.
</P>
<P>
   Digging into that hill, the scientists found the fossil jawbones
of what may be the two oldest dinosaurs ever known _ calf-size
creatures that were probably the ancestors of the huge beasts that
later dominated Earth for millions of years, according to a report
being published Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In the same hill, the scientists also found the fossilized
skulls and bones of at least eight primitive mammal-like reptiles
whose remains point to a critical period in the early evolution of
both mammals and reptiles.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the scientists say, their discoveries could provide
new clues to the process of evolution during the long years of a
geologic period known as the middle to late Triassic, around 230
million years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of the expedition, John J. Flynn of the Field Museum
in Chicago and Andrew Wyss of the University of California at Santa
Barbara _ together with their American and Madagascar colleagues _
are reporting their discoveries in Friday's issue of the journal
Science.
</P>
<P>
   Wyss called the discovery of the varied animal fossils ``a
spectacular fauna of this age'' and said their condition is
``superb, rivaling that of anything in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   And there is more to come, he said, because ``a wealth of bones
is pouring out of our quarries _ a host of other novel animals.''
</P>
<P>
   Flynn said the teeth in the two jawbones indicate the creatures
were long-necked prosauropods, the earliest of all dinosaurs. They
were probably four to eight feet long and no larger than calves.
And they were both bipedal and quadrupedal, Flynn said, meaning
that they could use their forefeet like hands to forage on the lush
vegetation of the ancient region but could run swiftly on all four
feet to avoid predators.
</P>
<P>
   Their bone structure indicates that they were probably the
ancestors of a long line of plant-eating dinosaurs, including the
huge Apatosaurus that weighed 36 tons and was the largest animal
ever known, the scientists said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Wyss, the bones of the reptile-like creatures in
the same dig indicate they must have lived at a time when evolution
was dividing their lineage in two directions _ some descendants
toward true mammals and the others to the abundant reptilian world.
</P>
<P>
   Madagascar, lying isolated in the Indian Ocean off the east
coast of southern Africa, was once joined to that continent, but it
separated when the ancient world's massive supercontinent known as
Pangaea began splitting apart about 250 million years ago, at the
very beginning of the Triassic period.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Madagascar's Morondava Basin is known to contain a vast
variety of fossils from the middle to late Triassic period, which
spanned the time from 230 million to 200 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
   That was the epoch when true dinosaurs began emerging _ some as
small as foxes and others far bigger than elephants and whales.
They flourished, multiplied and dominated the landscape, only to
become extinct in a spasm of destruction 65 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The prosauropod skulls discovered in Madagascar resemble the
fossils of early dinosaur forms from Argentina, which have been
firmly dated with radioisotope techniques at 227 million years old.
</P>
<P>
   But the Madagascar finds may well be a good 5 million years
older, according to Wyss, and the final date must await the use of
laboratory techniques that are unavailable at the excavation site.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we can say at this point is that all indications point to
its being older than 227,'' Wyss said.
</P>
<P>
   The team of scientists has already opened three new sites in the
same region of Madagascar, where there are rich fossil deposits
from the late Triassic and early Jurassic periods _ a time when
dinosaurs began flourishing as the dominant beasts on every
continent.
</P>
<P>
   As for the young man who led the team of paleontologists to
their first discovery site, his name is Mena, which in the Malagasy
language means red _ red for the color of the island's soil. Now,
the scientists plan to name at least one of their fossil species
after him _ a true honor in the world of fossil-hunters, who must
still classify and name the unnamed creatures they have found in
their Madagascar treasure trove.

 BIG GUN CARRIED IN VIOLIN CASE  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A violin with an entourage?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, here it comes: ``Il Cannone'' (The Cannon), a 250-year-old
violin that belonged to Nicolo Paganini, who was the Jimi Hendrix
of 19th century fiddling.
</P>
<P>
   Il Cannone will be played by Eugene Fodor on Tuesday night in a
benefit at the Herbst.
</P>
<P>
   The violin is traveling from its home in Genoa and will be
accompanied on the trip by its custodian, along with the Genoa
chief of police and five other people.
</P>
<P>
   I hear Il Cannone is demanding its own hotel suite, a Lemon
Pledge rubdown and a gram of fresh Peruvian rosin.
</P>
<P>
   MAYOR WILLIE BROWN stops by the Boom Boom Room one night on his
appointed rounds o' da town.
</P>
<P>
   Bartender Michael Krouse buttonholes the mayor, tells him about
a project. Krouse wants to paint a mural on the outside wall of the
Boom Boom, facing Geary, a tribute to the Fillmore District's rich
musical heritage. Would the city help finance the work?
</P>
<P>
   Mayor says he'll see what he can do. Right.
</P>
<P>
   Couple months later, Michael gets a grant for $13,500 from the
office of Neighborhood Beautification.
</P>
<P>
   Whattaya know, city government works for the little guy,
sometimes. And Krouse didn't even have to pay consultant Jack Davis
$330,000 to lobby the mayor for the grant.
</P>
<P>
   GHOST OF A CHANCE: Somebody in the Haight apparently is
disenchanted with the choices in the upcoming mayoral election. The
home is displaying a very large vintage sign: ``Moscone for
mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   FORGET CAT-SCANS. Here's how we'll know if 49er QB Steve Young
has head damage:
</P>
<P>
   A scientific study found a correlation between brain damage and
impaired morals, so a reader named Doc says to look for warning
signs: Mormon Steve swilling Coke on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``ROSES ARE RED, and lovely forivver/On the list of top grads I
guess I'm just chopped liver.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lowell High alums published a directory that includes ``A
Sampling of Grads,'' high achievers in every walk of life.
</P>
<P>
   Missing: A poet. And at least one Lowell alum, Robert Peterson,
is a widely acclaimed poet.
</P>
<P>
   James Russell Lowell would consider the oversight poetic
injustice.
</P>
<P>
   THEY'LL BE SHIFTING into a higher gear Monday night at the
Transmission Theater, at a benefit blowout for Rudy Castro, famed
big-band leader.
</P>
<P>
   On the Bay Area musical family tree, Rudy's a huge branch. His
rehearsal big band has been cranking for half this century,
grooming a huge roster of great musicians and singers. Rudy is 80,
chair-bound after a stroke last year.
</P>
<P>
   If half of Rudy's pupils and friends show, and they will, Monday
night will go down in swing/big-band legend.
</P>
<P>
   MORE VIOLIN NEWS: Hey, wasn't that Sting front-rowing at the
symphony last night? Yes, he came to hear his new buddy, violinst
Kennedy, who is guest-virtuosoing with the symph orchestra this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, the artist formerly known as Nigel Kennedy, is a
strange character who grooves with the symphony, then hits the
city's backstreet clubs and jams all night with the fellas.
</P>
<P>
   Sting was playing in Berkeley, and the two happened to meet, hit
it off and made plans to rip up the city last night.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody please hand Kennedy ``Il Cannone,'' and jump back.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Now accepting applications &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Fight Club &LR;
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of Fight Club, when  &UR; is  &LR; the next bare-knuckles
mayoral debate?
</P>
<P>
   A TOMATO DETECTOR will be used at the door for next Wednesday
night's Commonwealth Club event.
</P>
<P>
   Guest speaker: Michael Burns, Muni general manager. His topic:
``Muni in the Millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   Some questions Burns might be called upon to field:
</P>
<P>
   -- Which millennium will Muni be entering?
</P>
<P>
   -- How many more millennia will I have to wait for my freakin'
bus?
</P>
<P>
   -- Millennium? Did Willie say he'd fix Muni in 100  &UR; years? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   -- Can I get a transfer to another speech?

   Packing Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence off to a Mississippi
prison where they trade quips while doing hard labor may not sound
like an idea headed much of anywhere. But over 60 years Ray (
Murphy) and Claude ( Lawrence) develop a curmudgeonly feel for each
other, flashing back to the days when the two went on a bootlegging
mission and encountered racism.
</P>

   Evolving affectingly from a fast-talking hotshot into an old man

can offer'' (Maslin). &QL;

YOUNG VIEWERS FUEL SUCCESS OF THE WB 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Accent mark needed over e in Pokemon) 
(Eds.: Optional trim included) 
 
By MIKE McDANIEL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The WB's ``Angel,'' a ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer''
spinoff, has higher ratings than ``Buffy.''
</P>
<P>
   The WB moves ``Felicity'' to highly competitive Sundays and
gains viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Fox passes on ``Roswell,'' and the WB launches another instant
teen hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pokemon'' rules. ``7th Heaven'' captivates. ``Charmed''
charms.
</P>
<P>
   Now if only the WB could make some money.
</P>
<P>
   But wait. The WB will break even the fourth quarter of this
year, its CEO said this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to be an avalanche of money but it will be a
profit,'' said Jamie Kellner. ``With my business hat on, I judge
myself on making a profit.''
</P>
<P>
   Kellner likes to point out in public addresses, as he did at a
luncheon of the Houston Advertising Federation, that 48 percent of
the U.S. population is 18-49, and 50 percent of the WB viewers are
18-49.
</P>
<P>
   ``I use that because our competitors, and sometimes the press,
try to make us into a teeny-bopper network,'' he said. ``We're not
under-delivering the 18-49 audience. We're over-delivering the
18-34 audience and over-delivering the teen audience, which are the
harder-to-reach viewers. I just twist that criticism into a
positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people who are studying our industry are paying more and
more attention every year to young demographics. All the big
package goods companies are targeting teens and younger adults,
because they can't let their competitors establish the competitor's
brand with younger people.''
</P>
<P>
   Kellner has followed this principal most of his 30-year
television career. He left as president and chief operating officer
of Fox in 1993 because his vision collided with owner Rupert
Murdoch's.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a single show on CBS I ever watch,'' he said. ``I
don't like any programs that are older-skewing.''
</P>
<P>
   As WB CEO, he expects to continue to go after the 18-34 crowd _
and younger.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to be No. 1 with teens, you want to be No. 1 with
kids because you don't want anybody to outflank you,'' he said.
``If I were selling Ford automobiles, I'd have a very low-priced,
entry-level car that every kid would want to have when they got
their first car. And I would want them to have a great experience
with that car.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'd even make bicycles for teen-agers. I'd want them to
think my company, Ford, was the best way to get your transportation
as early as possible. I'd want them to think we're the coolest and
best mode of transportation in their whole lives. That's my network
strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   That strategy works with teens, it's been proved. And now it's
working with youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to believe cable had a lock on the kid business until
we went past Nickelodeon on Saturday mornings,'' Kellner said. ``It
shows the power of programming,'' with ``Pokemon'' and ``Batman
Beyond'' among the WB shows leading the way. ``We've got the
boys,'' Kellner said. ``They've (Nickelodeon) got the girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Kellner believes the WB can also schedule a successful comedy
and does not oppose WB stations carrying local sports programs. He
also addressed such issues as diversity, sex and violence.
</P>
<P>
   _ On stretching the WB's programming to a seventh night,
Saturday:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's scheduled for next year. Quite frankly, I look at
Saturday as like driving a car in the fog. If there's a night
(young people) are going to be out, it's going to be Saturday
nights. So it's a challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   _ On developing a sitcom in what has proved a poor comedy
season:
</P>
<P>
   The blight in comedy ``makes it easier right now'' for the WB to
develop a comedy, he said. ``We've worked on a couple of shows that
have shown promise, like ''Zoe,`` ''Duncan,`` ``Jack and Jane``
(which is on the midseason roster). The problem is (the characters)
were aged too young so we couldn't deal with significant issues.''
That is being fixed.
</P>
<P>
   _ Teen hormones rage. Should they rage on TV?
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of teen-agers have sex at a fairly early age,''
he said. ``I don't think they should feel they've done something
wrong, but I do feel they should understand they have a choice
before they make that decision. If really cool people, like the
stars (of ''Dawson's Creek``), say they don't have to have sex,
then (real-life teens) can say they don't have to have sex, either.
And other kids that have done it aren't bad; they've made a choice.
In most cases, they regret it. You have to show consequences and
deal with the issue of STDs.''
</P>
<P>
   _ On violence:
</P>
<P>
   ``When I watch Buffy do the chop-socky on vampires and take a
wooden stake and turn them into dust, I believe that's acceptable
viewing for people above the age of 10 or 11.'' Incidents like the
one at Columbine High are not TV's fault ``any more than scary
stories told around campfires hundreds of years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   _ On diversity:
</P>
<P>
   The WB doesn't necessarily look for minorities to fill
positions, Kellner said. ``We're looking for someone with a track
record, who can execute, has a unique take on something and fits
into the interest areas of our younger demos.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a network of younger people, we're far less color-blind.
(The WB and UPN were not targeted for boycotts recently by the
NAACP and Hispanic groups). I was raised in a world where there was
far more black and white. My son lives in a world where he doesn't
really care what anybody's skin color is. Between those posts is
where America lies.''

HEARTLAND TEEN STAYS TRUE TO HIMSELF IN EMOTIONAL `BOYS DON'T CRY' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: two dots needed over e in Chloe) 
 
By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Boys Don't Cry'' is an emotionally wrenching film about trying
to find your identity in a world that already has you labeled and
neatly filed away.
</P>
<P>
   If this was just the true story of Teena Brandon, a young woman
of the American heartland who tried to pass as a boy named Brandon
Teena and paid dearly for her fantasy, this might be a
limited-interest pseudo-documentary, trying to make us feel sorry
for her.
</P>
<P>
   But in the skillful hands of director and co-writer Kimberly
Pierce, and with an excellent cast, this film, shot in Texas, has
much broader appeal and a deeper resonance. It has already been
compared to a host of classic films about lost and disaffected
youth. Perhaps none fits it so well in tone and title as ``Rebel
Without a Cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Brandon _ we see the character almost exclusively in her
boy mode _ may represent a lot of things to some people, to her she
is representing only herself. Like Jim in ``Rebel Without a
Cause,'' she is not a crusader. She is not fighting for gay rights
or cross-dressing or freedom. (She does not seem to regard herself
as a lesbian.)
</P>
<P>
   She is just a confused and bursting-with-life 21-year-old
wanting to live as the person she feels inside _ a boy.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce's unsentimental, nonjudgmental approach makes the story
more powerful than if it had gone for our hearts or tried to be a
lesson on equality.
</P>
<P>
   Her only visual tricks, mostly speeded-up camera work in
transitional scenery shots, work to emphasize the out-of-control
nature of Brandon's life.
</P>
<P>
   Brandon is not a hero.
</P>
<P>
   She's self-centered, a petty thief, a belligerent drunk and a
person without even a simple monitor on her self-control.
</P>
<P>
   But she makes a good boyfriend, at least as far as her
girlfriends (who think she is a boy) are concerned. Since Brandon
is something of a low-class barfly, she tends toward the same in
women, and they are thrilled to find a considerate man.
</P>
<P>
   The film opens with Teena trying out her Brandon persona in a
country-western bar. She gets into a fight with an older, bigger
man over the right to sit next to a woman.
</P>
<P>
   Brandon gets her brains beat out, but she's got a lot more guts
than brains, and keeps coming back for more.
</P>
<P>
   The drunken Brandon winds up in the small town of Falls City,
Neb., where she spots Lana. We first see Lana as a boring, poorly
educated frump slumped over a drink.
</P>
<P>
   As their relationship progresses, we see Lana more as Brandon
comes to see her, as an attractive young woman with potential,
given some encouragement, and feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Brandon begins to hang out with Lana and her low-life family and
friends, including a couple of rough-edged boys, John and Tom, the
former a paroled convict. We do not sense that either is really
bad, certainly not capable of what we suspect might happen. But
that is another pleasure of this movie. It treats all its
characters with the same disinterested eye and emphasizes how
events in some lives just develop, with little planning or
anticipation.
</P>
<P>
   Be aware that the film, while excessively graphic, is extremely
powerful in portraying the two final tragic events in Brandon's
life.
</P>
<P>
   Hilary Swank, who has appeared in numerous films (The Next
Karate Kid) and television (Beverly Hills, 90210), is amazing as
Brandon. If the real Brandon was as skilled at playing a boy, it's
no wonder she was able to pass so well.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the cast is also excellent: Chloe Sevigny (Kids and
The Last Days of Disco) plays Lana, Peter Sarsgaard (Dead Man
Walking) is John and Brendan Sexton III (Welcome to the Doll's
House) is Tom.
</P>
<P>
   The screenplay, by Pierce and Andy Bienen, is a wonder of
efficiency and subtlety. They simply tell the story and let us
figure out what is obvious.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce's direction is, for the most part, straightforward,
powerful and unpretentious. But there is one terrific shot of the
underside of an electricity tower, shot at night with special
lenses, that is a disorienting treat. &QL; 
 &QL; 
XXXXXXX &QL; 
 &QL; 
Boys Don't Cry &QL; 
Starring: Hilary Swank, Peter Sarsgaard, Chloe Sevigny &QL; 
Rated: R for violence, including an intense, brutal rape scene,
sexuality, language and drug use.

WITTY `TANGO' CAN BE TOO COY FOR COMFORT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In some ways, ``Three to Tango'' is a refreshing change of pace
for its TV-star cast.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Perry gets to play a lovelorn leading man, Dylan
McDermott gets to play the bad guy and Neve Campbell gets to smile,
unlike her chronically pained character on ``Party of Five.''
</P>
<P>
   But in other ways, this romantic comedy is stale _ or, more
precisely, dated.
</P>
<P>
   Its eventful story presents a complex tangle of relationships,
and the key to the equation is whether Perry's character is gay.
</P>
<P>
   But the subject is addressed as if the setting was a sleepy town
in 1989, not Chicago in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's _ well, you know ... '' say these allegedly sophisticated
city folk, who often can't even bring themselves to say the word.
</P>
<P>
   By contrivance, Perry is perceived to be as gay as his architect
partner (Oliver Platt) when they court a billionaire (McDermott)
for a big deal.
</P>
<P>
   That makes him seem a safe companion for the mistress (Campbell)
of the married and jealous tycoon, who dangles the carrot of a big
contract in exchange for Perry's spying.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Perry falls madly _ and secretly _ in love with her,
jeopardizing the job. But he can't ``come out,'' especially when
the media trumpet him as ``gay professional of the year'' for
bravely admitting his homosexuality (another dated and patronizing
ploy).
</P>
<P>
   In short, this plays like a cross between ``In and Out'' (is he
gay or not?) and ``The Object of My Affection'' (can a straight
woman love a gay man?), only without the contemporary urban
sensibilities it needs.
</P>
<P>
   The director, Damon Santostefano, and writer, Rodney Vaccaro,
are first-timers, so we'll cut them some slack. Besides, once you
adjust to the embarrassment and snickering, ``Three to Tango''
generates a genial charm.
</P>
<P>
   Sticking to his ``Friends'' shtick, Perry tries too hard, but
that's part of his hapless charm, and at least he doesn't play gay
with silly mannerisms.
</P>
<P>
   During funny fits of discomfiture, he tempers his manic nature
with a sensitive side, and he clicks well with Campbell, though
mostly as a guy she treats as a girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Her romance with the billionaire is ludicrously unlikely. Eking
out a living as a glass blower, she's impulsive, earthy, immature
and no model of discretion.
</P>
<P>
   But McDermott is just as unlikely as the billionaire. He's too
young and not driven enough _ especially since we're accustomed to
his zeal in ``The Practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many movies, this also hinges on instant familiarity, if
not bonding, between strangers. The love-hate threesome seem as
tight as old school chums.
</P>
<P>
   Realism aside, ``Three to Tango'' offers snappy repartee, clever
one-liners and amusing turns by Platt, two rival architects (Bob
Balaban and John C. McGinley), and three guys who play Perry's
beer-drinking pals.
</P>
<P>
   Overall it's _ well, you know _ an entertaining lark that's
often spry and even radiant, with an end-credit wrap-up that's a
hoot. It just should have been made a decade ago. &QL; 
 &QL; 
XXXXXXX &QL; 
 &QL; 
Three to Tango &QL; 
Starring: Matthew Perry, Neve Campbell and Dylan McDermott &QL; 
Rating: PG-13 for sex-related situations and language &QL;

TWISTING BLACK COMEDY IS `CRAZY' BUT EFFECTIVE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MELISSA WARD AGUILAR 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's something familiar about Melanie Griffith's character in
``Crazy in Alabama.'' Something reckless. Something wild.
</P>
<P>
   She's a little bit Marilyn Monroe, a little bit Scarlett O'Hara,
a little bit of the character she played in ``Something Wild.'' The
comedy-drama is a return to the kind of role Griffith does best.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith wears a black wig, heavy eyeliner and just-applied
lipstick for the role. She pours herself into a variety of
Monroe-esque outfits. Her Lucille is a sexy, bold, yet somewhat
pitiful character _ a loving mother of seven small children who has
just poisoned their mean, old father and decapitated him with her
electric knife. She carries his head around in Tupperware. (``It's
amazing how fresh he stays in plastic.'')
</P>
<P>
   Did we mention this is black comedy?
</P>
<P>
   Now free from her husband's mistreatment, Lucille drops the kids
with MeeMaw (well, this is Alabama) and heads out to California to
find stardom.
</P>
<P>
   We learn all about crazy Lucille from her adoring nephew,
Peejoe, who narrates the film, which Mark Childress adapated from
his novel. If you were casting a movie called ``Crazy in Alabama,''
you would also want to hire as narrator 16-year-old Lucas Black,
who proved in ``Sling Blade'' that he does the best Deep South
accent in Hollywood. Maybe in the Deep South.
</P>
<P>
   Peejoe doesn't just tell us about crazy Aunt Lucille and her
trip to Hollywood. The orphaned boy who, with his brother, has been
sent to live with his funeral-director uncle (David Morse) has his
own story to tell. That's where the movie gets tricky.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Banderas has chosen, for his directorial debut, a film
with two divergent storylines that are sometimes hard to weave
together.
</P>
<P>
   This is the South in 1965. PeeJoe is watching the stirrings of
the civil rights movement. He wonders why black people can't vote.
Or swim in the pool. He's told that's just the way things are. He
doesn't think it's fair.
</P>
<P>
   Then he sees an African-American boy his age, Taylor Jackson,
take a stand. Peejoe takes his side.
</P>
<P>
   When Taylor (Louis Miller) leads a group of boys to integrate
the swimming pool, Sheriff John Doggett (played menacingly by Meat
Loaf Aday) won't have it.
</P>
<P>
   As Taylor tries to run away and scale the fence, the sheriff
pulls him to his death _ with Peejoe as the only witness. It won't
be the last time the sheriff and PeeJoe are at odds.
</P>
<P>
   As the racial strife escalates, Banderas blurs the scenes of
white men beating peaceful protesters. Then the film flashes to
black and white. The camera work is effective in conveying the
anonymous nature of the violence, but sometimes it's unsettling to
make the switch back to the film's lush colors and comic lines.
</P>
<P>
   But back to Lucille's story: After pulling a gun, stealing a car
and conning a cop, she ends up in Vegas _ and wins big. She heads
to Hollywood in style, and fulfills her dream in no time, landing a
role on ``Bewitched.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucille may sound like a bad girl, but she's really warm and
endearing. It's hard to imagine her killing her husband. Or taking
his abuse. She talks fondly to his head, which she now has encased
in a stylish hatbox.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there will be hell to pay back home. And you know
she'll have to go back.
</P>
<P>
   A courtroom scene brings everyone together and attempts to tie
up the loose ends of the two stories _ both are about freedom. The
scene's longer than it needs to be; the judge finally dispenses
with formalities and lets Lucille tell her side and recount her
husband's abuses.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a strong denouncement, but Rod Steiger, as the Southern
judge, has some funny lines. And Griffith, draped in green, evokes
the spirit of Scarlett O'Hara.
</P>
<P>
   Like Griffith, the film is lovely to look at, with its saturated
colors and moss-laden locales.
</P>
<P>
   The film should appeal to teens as well as adults; they can
identify with the point-of-view character and appreciate the civil
rights story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crazy in Alabama'' leaves a strong impression; in the end, the
drama adds depth to the comic tone. Despite some rough
intertwining, ``Crazy'' is an impressive directing debut from
Banderas; he gets good performances from the actors. And Black's
eyebrows are as expressive as his drawl.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
XXXXXXXXX &QL; 
 &QL; 
Crazy in Alabama &QL; 
Starring: Melanie Griffith, Lucas Black and David Morse. &QL; 
Rated: PG-13 for some violence, thematic material, language and a
scene of sensuality. &QL;

 &HT;    Cross burnings concern Texas community
 &HT;    By Emily Morris
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN AUGUSTINE, Texas _ On the back roads of rural San Augustine
County, two recent cross burnings have caused concern among people
in both the black community and white communities here.
</P>
<P>
   The two separate incidents, reported within two weeks of each
other, are being investigated by the San Augustine County sheriff's
deputies and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The first cross burning was reported to sheriff's deputies
around midnight Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   The victim seemed an unlikely victim of a racially motivated
hate crime _ she is a single white woman with two children lit home.
</P>
<P>
   She is neither Jewish nor Catholic, and she said she has not
recently had black visitors in her home. Sheriff's officials first
believed the cross burning at the white woman's house to be an
isolated incident_ probably meant to be taken as a prank.
</P>
<P>
   But then, less than two weeks later, a cross was set ablaze on
the church grounds of a small country church _ a black church.
</P>
<P>
   The second incident occurred in the same area of the county as
the first incident. Pisgah Baptist Church is a small wooden
building nestled amid trees on national forest lands off
farm-to-market Road 705.
</P>
<P>
   The congregation is made up of nearly 20 members _ all of them
black. Only eight or 10 of the members are able to attend
regularly.
</P>
<P>
   As the membership of Pisgah has aged, the frequency of services
there has decreased.
</P>
<P>
   At the present time, there is no full-time pastor.
</P>
<P>
   A longtime member of Pisgah, C.J. Jones, said members of the
church and usually a few visitors meet every third Wednesday night
for prayer meeting and every third Sunday morning for worship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a pastor, now,'' he said. ``But we have someone
come preach once a month.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones has been a member of Pisgah since 1962. His wife, Vada
Jones, 63, has been a member since she was born.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Jones or his wife knows how old the church is.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's old,'' Jones said. ``That's all I know.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jones live less than a mile from the church grounds, and
they have taken it upon themselves to look after the building,
whenever they take a trip to town.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he drove past the church last week and saw the sun
glaring off the windshield of a truck parked in the drive.
</P>
<P>
   He pulled in and recognized the pickup as a green National
Forest Service vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   He said he saw the driver of the truck standing nearby, but it
was what he saw next that made his heart skip a beat.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a burned cross standing upright, stuck in some
cinder blocks,'' he said. ``I don't know exactly how long it had
been there, but it wasn't there two days earlier, when I went to
town.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones asked the forest service employee if the cross was there
that morning when he arrived to do his work in the woods.
</P>
<P>
   The man told him it was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went home and called the sheriff,'' Jones said. ``Then I
called some of the other church members who live around here, and
they came over to my house.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said Sheriff John Cartwright met him at the church later
that afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sheriff took pictures of the cross, and then he took the
cross with him,'' Jones said. ``We were having church that night,
and I knew some people were afraid to come. We asked him if the
deputies could patrol the area during our prayer meeting, and they
did. They patrol this area pretty regularly, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said members of the church congregated the following
Sunday for worship services, but their attitude was somber.
</P>
<P>
   During their noon meal at church that day, doors leading into
the front of the building were locked. Jones said this is one of
the few times in the history of the church that problems of any
kind have occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 25 years ago, some heaters were stolen,'' he said. ``But
we've never had anything like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he was surprised and shaken by the cross burning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get along real good here,'' he said of the relationship
between blacks and whites. ``We have good relations, and we have
white company over at our house all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones and his wife are both lifelong residents of San Augustine
County.
</P>
<P>
   When their first home in the city limits burned more than 15
years ago, they moved into their current house in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Together, they raise collard greens and other vegetables, and a
long row of marigolds line the drive up to their house.
</P>
<P>
   It's not unusual for white people or black people to pull up in
the driveway for a chat, and more often than not _ visitors take
something with them when they leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``We raise sugar cane, and people are always asking us when it
will be ready,'' Ms. Jones said. ``People come out here to see us
all the time. And they don't leave empty-handed.''
</P>
<P>
   To think that someone has animosity toward them or the people
living in their community is almost unimaginable, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I never would have thought something like this would have
happened, either,'' he said. ``I've never been afraid to knock on
anyone's door as long as I've lived here, and I've never been
afraid of letting anyone in my house. I don't know what to think
about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff John Cartwright said the case has been referred to the
FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something like this is classified as a hate crime these
days,'' he said. ``We've been advised to turn cases like this over
to the FBI, and they have already come for copies of our reports.''
</P>
<P>
   Cartwright said both burned crosses appeared to have been soaked
in either gasoline or some type of lighter fluid.
</P>
<P>
   The cross in the first victim's yard was laid upon the grass.
</P>
<P>
   The first victim, who asked that her name be withheld, said she
was at home when the incident happened.
</P>
<P>
   She said she saw a pickup pull into the drive around 11:30 p.m.
Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   The driver turned off the headlights and got out of the truck,
and the woman said it appeared he set her grass on fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter came into the room where I was, and then went in
and woke my son,'' she said. ``The people in the yard drove away in
a loud truck, but I don't know what kind it was. It was dark, and I
couldn't see. Also, I didn't really know what was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   When the woman and her two children ran outside, the fire was
beginning to go out. They realized it wasn't the grass burning, but
a wooden cross that would have been about as tall as a person, had
it been standing upright.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just laid it on the ground and set it on fire,'' the
woman said. ``It was very dewy that night, or the fire might have
spread.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman said she has no idea why she might have been the
target of a hate crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was scary,'' she said. ``Very, very scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he is also still very frightened by what happened at
the church.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said an FBI agent asked him whether he thought the cross
burning might have any link to the trial
</P>
<P>
   of the third suspect in the dragging death of James Byrd Jr.,
which proceeds Monday in Jasper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine anyone doing anything like that in San
Augustine County,'' Jones said. ``Jasper is 40 miles from here. I
know they call this a hate crime, but there has never been any hate
in our community before.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he believes the incident in San Augustine County
could possibly have been the work of pranksters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a funny prank to play, if that's the case,'' he
said. ``This is the kind of thing that would shake anyone up. It
just wasn't the thing to do.''

the burnt-out ruminations of one Frank Pierce, a wee-hours

   FILM-REVIEW-LIMEY (Undated) _ Steven Soderbergh's newest film,
``The Limey,'' is both a return to experimental territory and an

staccato script that packs potent asymmetry into a few small

noir. By AMY BIANCOLLI.

 &HT;    Nun is soul of school
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Damienne Grismer didn't dream of growing up to be
a nun. As a member of the Julienne High School class of '47,
``there were two things in life _ basketball, and earning the gold
medal in piano,'' she recalls.
</P>
<P>
   In those years, however, the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur were
``everywhere'' at Julienne, inescapable, omnipresent. They
constituted at least 90 percent of the faculty, and the young woman
couldn't help noticing something about them: ``The sisters seemed
to have some intangible spirit _ a peace, a happiness, a deep
secret of some kind.''
</P>
<P>
   On July 26, 1947, she entered the convent. Today Sister Damienne
is the only nun still teaching at Chaminade-Julienne High School,
and the only SND among the five Catholic sisters and brothers who
still work at the school.
</P>
<P>
   Lonely? Hardly. Sister Damienne has the window office just off
the main entrance, where she keeps track of tardies, detentions,
and demerits. She can hardly get through a five-minute conversation
without someone poking a head in.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Ann Martin, a school counselor, is the first to pop in.
``Sister Damienne is C-J,'' Martin declares.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been around forever,'' concedes Sister Damienne, who has
taught psychology at C-J for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that,'' Martin demurs. ``It's her personality,
caring, her charisma.''
</P>
<P>
   Sister Damienne's family spans four generations at C-J,
beginning with her mother, Eugenie Stomps, a 1916 graduate of the
Academy of Notre Dame, Julienne's forerunner. Only 18 when she
entered the convent, she was allowed monthly visits with her
family. ``One minute, we were normal kids, and the next minute, we
were potential nuns,'' she recalls.
</P>
<P>
   She was never lonely or homesick. She never thought about
leaving: ``I liked the camaraderie. It was a whole new family; it
was a community _ and the word `community' was the kicker.''
</P>
<P>
   The Julienne girls of the mid-'40s were their own tight
community _ a community shattered when Sister Damienne nearly lost
her life in an accident on school grounds. A motorcycle jumped the
curb and struck her on Oct. 16, 1946.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all very dramatic,'' she says, with her typical
self-effacing, don't-make-a-fuss-over-me shrug of her shoulders.
``It was a major rally of prayer and offering of novenas so I
wouldn't die.''
</P>
<P>
   She not only survived, but returned to school, turban-clad, head
shaven from surgery, to earn the gold-medal level in piano playing.
</P>
<P>
   That cohesiveness lives on at C-J, she said, as the school
celebrates the 150th anniversary of the arrival in Dayton of the
Sisters of Notre Dame and the Society of Mary, the Marianist
fathers who founded Chaminade High School and the University of
Dayton. ``I see a very strong resemblance to the old Julienne in
the C-J of today.''
</P>
<P>
   What students won't see is groups of sisters in full habit _ a
powerful visual image of that intangible spirit, that deep secret,
Sister Damienne first sensed as a young woman.
</P>
<P>
   Young women have gained, Sister Damienne notes, many more
opportunities to serve without joining a convent. ``What they have
lost _ though I'm not sure they'll recognize it as a loss _ is the
picture of a large group of people committed to service.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That image is from the past.''
</P>
<P>
   But that spirit is very much present in Sister Damienne Grismer.

 &HT;    Carrier's story well-told
 &HT;    By Jim Cinter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ Jeff Nesmith is the only Pulitzer
prize-winning journalist I know who will overnight a coop of laying
hens to bail out a friend.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago (more than either of us care to count), Jeff and
I worked the night shift on The Atlanta Constitution. One midnight
I got a distress call from my wife. Our Irish setter had gotten
into Forrest Ballard's chicken house and killed six hens.
</P>
<P>
   Forrest is a good fellow. In one place or another, we've been
next-door neighbors for most of our lives. I knew he would be
forgiving and wouldn't make a fuss, but I was embarrassed, and
wanted to make amends. I mentioned my predicament to Jeff, a farm
boy from Florida who was in a semirural mode on some acreage out
near Alpharetta.
</P>
<P>
   The next night, Jeff showed up for work with six white Leghorns
in the trunk of his car. I delivered the hens to Forrest with
apologies on behalf of my Irish setter.
</P>
<P>
   After a good run reporting and editing for The Constitution,
Jeff moved on to Philadelphia and then back to Cox Newspapers as an
investigative reporter in the Washington bureau. His wife, also a
former Constitution reporter, worked in the White House writing
speeches for Jimmy Carter.
</P>
<P>
   When I hear people complain about biased and sloppy reporting,
often with justification, I'd like to introduce them to Jeff
Nesmith. He bends over backward to be fair. He checks and rechecks,
listens to all sides, never turns in a story until he has touched
all the bases. If more reporters and editors were as skilled and
conscientious as Jeff, critics wouldn't have much to complain
about.
</P>
<P>
   A few days ago I got a book in the mail, along with a note from
Chuck Perry, the founding editor-chief executive of Longstreet
Press in Atlanta. ``I think you will enjoy this book,'' Chuck
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The title was ``No Higher Honor,'' the story of the USS Yorktown
in World War II's battles of Coral Sea and Midway, the two great
carrier battles that began to turn the tide when it looked as if
the Japanese would never be stopped.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know much about literary stuff, and certainly I've never
been asked to do a book review for the New York Times or anything
like that, but there is one area where I'm not exactly ignorant.
I've read a lot of World War II books. Thanks to our Fayetteville
neighbor Weyman Grubbs, who keeps lending me his books even when I
forget to return them, I've read most of what's been written about
naval warfare in the Pacific. All I can say is, I've never read a
better book about World War II naval warfare than Jeff's.
</P>
<P>
   ``No Higher Honor,'' the title taken from the Yorktown captain's
after-action report following the Battle of Coral Sea, is easy to
describe. It is Stephen Ambrose's ``Citizen Soldiers,'' Tom
Brokaw's ``The Greatest Generation'' and the movie ``Saving Private
Ryan,'' wrapped up in 268 pages of tremendous reporting and
skillful writing. It is also a page-turner.
</P>
<P>
   I wondered how Jeff had managed to track down so many surviving
members of the Yorktown's crew and unlock memories over half a
century old. I found the answer in the last chapter. His uncle Joe
Weatherington, his mother's youngest brother, was a Yorktown
sailor.
</P>
<P>
   When the Yorktown, torpedoed and sunk after the great victory at
Midway, was discovered in its Pacific grave in 1998, Jeff was
assigned to write the story for Cox Newspapers. Thinking it would
be good to have reaction from surviving crew, he called his Uncle
Joe for names.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I said my uncle had been a member of the ship's crew, I
could almost feel the telephone warming in my hand, as if I were a
member of the family,'' he wrote. ``Almost invariably I then got
this question from the other end of the line: `Did he get off?' So
many didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   When he found old sailors in their 70s and 80s anxious to tell
their stories, to talk about their buddies and the great carrier's
brave and often bloody odyssey, Nesmith began to think of a book.
Chuck Perry bought the idea and now ``No Higher Honor'' is
Longstreet's book of the year.
</P>
<P>
   A practiced investigative reporter, Nesmith made extensive use
of naval archives, both Japanese and American. Although told mostly
through words of participants, the book is a creditable history of
the naval war in the Pacific. Typically, every person interviewed
got a chance to read what Jeff wrote and to make corrections.
</P>
<P>
   I can't imagine a better read for those who were there, or for
those who waited and wondered at home, or for those to young to
know and who ought to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``No Higher Honor'' should be a national best-seller. It might
not be, because Jeff is a modest fellow, not one to push for the
``Today Show'' and high-powered publicity that many authors covet.
</P>
<P>
   When I told him I thought the book was terrific, he said he
appreciated the compliment. ``My mother called and said it was a
classic,'' he said, ``but she had only read the first page.''

 &HT;    Texas prison officials deny abuse allegations
 &HT;    By Mike Ward
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas prison officials angrily denounced as
``untruthful propaganda'' allegations made by a nationally
broadcast television show Thursday night that female convicts at a
Gatesville prison were abused in so-called ``tiger cage'' detention
cells.
</P>
<P>
   Prison agency spokesman Larry Todd said a federal court that has
supervised Texas prisons for nearly three decades has approved the
use of the portable detention cells that are designed to hold
unruly inmates working in prison-owned agricultural fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``No inmates (have been) abused in this case with these
detention cells,'' Todd said. ``The inmate making these allegations
apparently is involved in litigation against the state and has made
untrue allegations against the system.''
</P>
<P>
   In a show called ``Pros &AMP; Cons,'' the cable network Court TV on
Thursday evening aired allegations by ex-convict Viktoria Robertson
that guards locked women in the portable detention cells for hours
at a time in summer heat with no water and without allowing them to
use the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're in a cage, out in the wilderness like an animal,''
Robertson was quoted as saying in a press release publicizing the
show.
</P>
<P>
   It labeled the use of the cells ``brutal and scandalous.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd said the ``detention trailers,'' as the cells are
officially known, have been used since the late 1980s at prisons
across Texas to detain convicts who misbehave or refuse to work on
so-called ``hoe squads'' _ convict crews that work in prison
agricultural fields.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 4 feet by 4 feet by 10 feet in size, the cells look like
large boxes of steel mesh mounted on a small trailer that usually
is towed into the fields behind a tractor and parked near where the
crew is working.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the ``detention trailers'' are designed to hold two or
three convicts, Todd said.
</P>
<P>
   While the mobile cells have been the subject of occasional
convict complaints, he said their use is strictly regulated. Water
and bathroom breaks must be given to the convicts held there, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the detention trailer is an effective, efficient
and humane method for handling of unruly inmates who become
disruptive and fail to follow direction and thereby cause a
disciplinary problem,'' he said. ``Judge (William Wayne) Justice
has studied their use and believes their use is OK, and so do we.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice is the federal judge who has supervised Texas' prison
system for years.
</P>
<P>
   The press release about the Court TV show portrays another
scenario:
</P>
<P>
   ``When women are unable to keep up with the fast pace of the
regimen, or simply drop from the heat, they are thrown into the
cages, often remaining handcuffed in the heat for hours, with
little or no water ... In fear of more time in the cages, many
women submit sexually to their oppressors and are raped, molested
and forced to perform sodomy on their captors.''
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials said that under longstanding policy,
able-bodied convicts are required to work while in prison _ many of
them on the ``hoe squads'' on prison-run farms. But the work rules
prohibit any abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``An offender is cooler in the trailer than out chopping
weeds,'' Todd said. ``In addition, the inmate is sitting down. The
trailers are generally parked in the shade when available. Again,
sitting in the trailer is easier than working.''
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials said they believe Robertson is one of several
former prisoners who are plaintiffs in an ongoing Austin federal
lawsuit alleging that a former parole officer at a Gatesville
prison, David Taylor, threatened them and forced them to have sex
with him. An Austin judge several weeks ago ordered the former
officer to pay the women $4.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials said they fired Taylor several years ago after
an internal investigation validated their claims. Taylor faced
criminal charges in the case but was acquitted in a jury trial.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to Court TV, the New York firm that issued the press
release and Robertson were not immediately returned Thursday.

 &HT;    Getting rid of squirrels just requires talking them to death
 &HT;    By Phil Latham
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSHALL, Texas _ More than a year ago, I used this space to
solicit ideas from readers on how to get squirrels out of an attic.
I received numerous nice replies, most of them ending with a phrase
which, roughly translated, meant, ``lots of luck, buddy.''
</P>
<P>
   The most consistent advice given was to use mothballs. First I
used one box of mothballs and, when that failed to do the job, I
used 15 boxes. The squirrels stayed though it all, but since then,
a moth hasn't been spotted within miles of my house.
</P>
<P>
   Still and all, the squirrels did leave for a long time, probably
for more posh digs down the street.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe, just maybe, they moved out for a quieter place to
live. With four children, my house will never be mistaken for a
chapel. Neighbors Ben and Margaret just across the street could
bring civilization to the hectic world of a squirrel.
</P>
<P>
   The noise factor is what I am counting on now that the Squirrel
family has decided to re-enter my life. I've decided I'm going to
use noise terrorism to drive out the little buggers.
</P>
<P>
   That is, I'm gonna put a radio in the attic.
</P>
<P>
   Now, before you laugh, remember that the exact same tactic
worked on Manuel Noriega when the Marines were trying to flush him
out in Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, I'm guessing that the first farmer who put up a
scarecrow in his field was the target of jeering from his farmer
friends. When you're on the cutting edge of animal control, people
are always taking shots at you.
</P>
<P>
   The only question is: What kind of music?
</P>
<P>
   Obviously all the great classical masters are out. Squirrels
might well benefit from the ``Mozart effect,'' figure out how to
release the attic stairs and take over the entire house.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, we won't be tuning in to Alvin and the Chipmunks,
either. That would likely bring the entire neighborhood of furry
rodents out to see their ``brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   Country music would be the easiest choice, of course, as it
dominates the airwaves in Texas. Still, I can see problems with
that, too.
</P>
<P>
   Ken down the street drives a pickup truck and, given enough
country music, those squirrels would be giving it the eye, I'm
sure. Then there is always the chance the music would only depress
them, making them misty-eyed about lost squirrel girlfriends,
hunting dogs they have known and those nuts that were stolen by
their best squirrel friends.
</P>
<P>
   No, country music is out.
</P>
<P>
   Rock and rap might work. After all it was rock that drove
Noriega out from his hiding place. Selections from the Animals, the
Yardbirds and the Monkees might just do the trick. It would be a
regular zoo in the attic.
</P>
<P>
   I'm always tempted by the Temptations, but, before you know it,
those squirrels would be dancing in unison and my house would be
nothing but a ball, ball, ball, ball of confusion.
</P>
<P>
   (And that's what my home is today. Hey, hey.)
</P>
<P>
   I'm thinking that the answer may be radio that has no music at
all: That's right, talk radio.
</P>
<P>
   I know that some animal lovers may think I've gone too far,
here, but desperation is creeping in. Desperation, of course, is
what talk radio is all about.
</P>
<P>
   Before you know it the squirrels would be thinking that everyone
and everything was out to get them, that the world was going to
hell in a handbasket.
</P>
<P>
   I'm thinking for effect I could get a few toy helicopters, paint
them black and stick them in the attic. You talk about paranoid
squirrels. Maybe I'd even add some toy soldiers with the U.N. logo
on their helmets. The squirrels wouldn't be sleeping at night.
</P>
<P>
   A few months of talk radio and those squirrels would be
disgusted, ready to pack up and move to Australia or Austria,
taking their upside-down American flag with them.
</P>
<P>
   Fine with me. My motto has always been: Love it or leave it.

   CoxNet SCIHEALTH 1019 -- More children are bringing pre-packaged

with a look at the past 100 years of architecture. Call this ``To
the suburbs and back,'' or ``From Levittown to lofts.'' We examine
the growth of the suburbs and their affect on cities; modernism's

   COALMINING-NOVELIST _ It takes nerve to take on the coal
companies in the small towns of West Virginia. A rather unlikely
looking David has emerged: Denise Giardina, an author, college
professor and Episcopal preacher, is running as independent
candidate for governor. She doesn't really expect to win, but she
hopes to draw attention to the razing of this Southern town's
landscape, which in some places is beginning to look like a lunar
landscape thanks to Big Coal's latest technique, called
``mountaintop removal,'' which is as bad as it sounds. ``Storming
Heaven,'' her first coal-mining novel, is required reading for
incoming freshmen at a couple of Georgia universities and TNT has
just signed on to make a John Frankenheimer film of it. (Weaver,

 &HT;    Just wild about Harry
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Let the owls go forth!
</P>
<P>
   And let them spread the news _ as they do so well in the tales
of ``Harry Potter,'' the all-around regular nice kid who happens to
be a wizard _ that Harry's fabulously hot Scottish creator, J.K.
Rowling, is now among us.
</P>
<P>
   Or will be shortly: Her flight was delayed. There's more ominous
news this cool, clear fall evening that her book-signing wrist is
sore and numb. But no matter! Hundreds of kids are covering what
used to be the front lawn of Hobbit Hall Children's Bookstore in
Roswell _ many with Harry's trademark lightning bolt painted on
their foreheads _ crowding between TV satellite-dish vans and
hoping for a glimpse of the shy, slender author as she slips in to
her book signing.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's not here yet!'' a preteen girl shouts hoarsely to her
friends across the yard.
</P>
<P>
   The real action is in the back yard. Here are the 400 kids, with
parents, who started lining up early enough (six hours ago) to get
passes to the signing by the woman they simply call ``She'' or
``Her'' (few seem to know even that the J in J.K. stands for
Joanne). The scene is somewhere between a carnival and a Hollywood
premiere that skews young (8 to 12, on average). Security guards
mutter wearily into walkie-talkies. A guy in a kilt plays the
bagpipes. Still, Elvis, so to speak, has not yet entered the
building.
</P>
<P>
   ``She will not come in unless the deck is cleared!'' cries a
harried store employee.
</P>
<P>
   Weird, in this day and age, to see such mass excitement for wit,
narrative, character and wholesome moral values (along with a few
troll boogers, just for flavor). All conveyed in that form of
communication that is supposedly so over: the printed page.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Harry because he's funny and has guts and he's my
age,'' says Jonathan Davis of Woodstock, 11. ``Nobody notices him
in the real world, then he goes to wizard school and _ look out!''
</P>
<P>
   Look out, indeed: Suddenly there She is, standing on the
elevated deck as if she magically apparated there. Rowling (rhymes
with bowling) waves and a cheer goes up from the crowd. The hottest
author on the planet (her ``Potter'' books command the top three
slots on The New York Times Bestseller List) then ducks inside to
begin signing fresh copies of her newest book as fast as her
Ace-bandaged wrist will allow. The kids look a bit dazed, hustled
through the stuffy little room crammed with TV cameramen. Then, a
local boy walks in dressed in a scarlet wizard robe and Rowling
cries with relief, ``Harry! I've been waiting for you! You can help
me sign these.''
</P>
<P>
   ANYTHING BUT MUNDANE
</P>
<P>
   The next day, following a professional wrist massage, looking
around the hotel suite where her publisher, Scholastic Press, has
booked her interviews, the 34-year-old Rowling sounds like a
sightseer visiting someone else's amazing life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cool!'' she says, surveying the posh surroundings and royal
view. ``Wish I had time to actually look around this place.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking a seat, she describes her own household: Rowling has a
daughter, Jessica, 6, ``and a rabbit named Jemimah and a guinea pig
named Jasmine, and anybody who'd like to take them off my hands,
you're welcome.'' Not Jessica, of course. ``My house is quite
mundane,'' she goes on, and though she was photographed with a
stone gargoyle in Time magazine, ``That belonged to the
photographer, and he's the weird one, not me.'' As to significant
others, the divorced author says, ``I love reading about other
people's love lives, not mine. So, no comment.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowling has a face you can't stop watching, with the offbeat
beauty of a brainy romantic lead in an art film. Someone whose
flashes of delighted mischief filter through an air of gentle
melancholy. Someone who might start writing her first novel on the
backs of envelopes in a cafe in a cloudy, classy old burg like
Edinburgh _ which happens to be exactly the case.
</P>
<P>
   If Harry travels a long way _ from a miserable orphaned
childhood in the Muggle World (where you and I live) to his true
calling as celebrity wizard in a parallel universe _ Rowling had an
equally remarkable journey. Just a few years ago, she was
unpublished and between teaching jobs, raising her infant daughter
on a welfare check (she was only briefly on the dole but the
British press seized upon that phase to build a Rowling legend).
</P>
<P>
   After three British publishers passed on the book, one finally
accepted it but advised Rowling to use her initials on the theory
that boys wouldn't read her if they knew she was a woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I went on the telly, boys kept reading like mad, and that
theory was pretty well blown out of the water,'' Rowling says with
a husky laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was six months into creating Harry (in 1990) before I asked
myself why I wasn't making him a heroine, since I obviously am
female,'' she continues. ``But by then I was so fond of Harry, and
believed in him so strongly, that I wasn't about to send him out in
a dress. It's funny, when I was teaching (French), I was placed in
charge of all-boy classes because it was considered my forte. Just
recently someone asked me why I don't have stronger female
characters and I was offended, because I consider Hermione (Harry's
goody-goody, but fearless, sidekick) quite strong. Hermione's a
kind of caricature of me at 11, but then, there's a lot of me in
Harry, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The third member of Harry's intrepid crew, fighting hidden evils
at the Hogwarts school of wizardry, is Ron Weasley. ``He's modeled
on my old friend, Sean, a schoolmate, still a kind of surrogate
brother today,'' Rowling says softly. ``For some reason I've spent
most of my life in very close groups of three. I think there's
great fear in a child's life _ even the happiest child's life _ and
the books show how children can overcome those fears. But I myself,
as a young outsider, was lucky to have two wonderful male chums. I
have the happiest, happiest memories of us together.''
</P>
<P>
   FANTASTICALLY LITERATE
</P>
<P>
   If Harry is becoming a household word today, translated into 28
languages, with 8.2 million copies of the books in print in the
United States alone, he's headed for even bigger fame onscreen.
Rowling has an author's dream clause _ final script approval! _ for
the Warner Bros. film in the making of ``Harry Potter and the
Sorcerer's Stone.'' With its flying cars, terrifying beasts,
heart-stopping games of Quidditch (a mad variation of polo on
broomsticks) and magical transformations, this first 1997 Potter
book has all the makings of a Spielbergian blockbuster.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the most miraculous feature of the books is that they
are so unmistakably books _ good, literate books, no goosebumpish
pandering. The imaginative range is vast. The wit is dry (wizard
gardens must be forcibly ``de-gnomed''), the satire sharp. There's
sheer Jabberwockian joy in language as character is proclaimed
through such names as Snape, Filch, Voldemort and Peeves (the
annoying poltergeist). Like ``The Wind in the Willows'' _ one of
the few familiar children's classics that Rowling loves _ Potter
makes wonderful reading for adults for the same reason it's catnip
to kids: It gives them credit for having minds.
</P>
<P>
   And running under all the colorful action is a clear spiritual
message, exemplified in the fearless sacrifice Harry's mother made
for her son before the first book begins.
</P>
<P>
   So it's not surprising that a wince of pain flickers across the
author's face when she's asked about the school boards _ in four
states, including South Carolina _ that have not accepted the
Potter series on account of its alleged sympathy with witchcraft
and the occult.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't get it,'' Rowling, a member of the Church of
Scotland (Presbyterian), says wearily. ``They have a perfect right
to control what their own children read but not what other people's
children read _ that's a basic censorship issue. Look: I don't
believe in witchcraft. Many of the terms for spells and charms and
so on, I invented. Witchcraft is just a metaphor for this other
world of possibilities, beyond convention, that the mind can
reach.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowling, who has planned four more Potter books and will release
another next summer, is being described in news accounts as one of
the wealthiest women in the world. The first flush of success
rattled her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The publicity hit as I was finishing the second book _
suddenly, for the first time in my entire life, I was in a panic,
unable to write. Mentally constipated. Typical of me, really:
Something wonderful happens and I'm the last to really believe it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's odd,'' Rowling continues, ``how, as more people love the
books, they feel entitled to interfere. One adult told me, `You
mustn't kill off this character.' Finally I told myself, `It's no
good thinking what anyone else wants, just follow your unconscious
and write what you want.' And the writing flowed again.''
</P>
<P>
   And will there be a sea change in lifestyle?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're moving to a new apartment, 10 minutes up the street in
Edinburgh,'' Rowling says with her _ some might say mysterious _
smile. ``Jessica only has a tiny garden to play in and she needs a
bigger one.''

ROSALIE HEARST, PHILANTHROPIST AND COMMUNITY LEADER, DEAD AT 84. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM SPRINGS, Calif. _ Rosalie Hearst, prominent Palm Springs
community leader, philanthropist and ``den mother'' of the Hearst
Foundation's U.S. Senate Youth Program, died Friday at her home
here.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hearst, 84 years old, died of circulatory ailments,
according to Gladys Hundley, her long-time assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hearst, who was a resident of the Las Palmas area of Palm
Springs since 1962, was the widow of George R. Hearst, the oldest
of the five sons of William Randolph Hearst. Her step-son, George
Randolph Hearst Jr., of Paso Robles, Calif., is chairman of the
board of The Hearst Corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hearst devoted much of her time to the U.S. Senate Youth
Program, founded in 1962 by the William Randolph Hearst Foundation
and created by an act of Congress. Each year, the program brings
104 high school student leaders _ two from each state and the
District of Columbia and U.S. military schools in Asia and Europe _
to Washington, D.C., for an intense week of immersion in government
and focus on public issues.
</P>
<P>
   Alumni of the program include Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, Mack
McLarty, President Clinton's first White House chief of staff, and
Franklin Raines, former director of the Office of Management and
Budget and now CEO of the Federal National Mortgage Corp. (Fannie
Mae.)
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hearst was affectionately known as ``Mom'' because of her
role as ``den mother'' for the students during their week in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   When the delegates arrived each year in Washington to attend the
program, they were greeted individually at their hotel by Mrs.
Hearst. With the student standing by, she would make a long
distance telephone call to the delegate's parents to let them know
that their son or daughter had arrived safely. She would then turn
the phone over to the delegate for a chat with the homefront.
</P>
<P>
   When former delegates began sending her Christmas letters and
telling about their lives as college students or working adults,
Mrs. Hearst began compiling a newsletter, known as ``Mom's
Christmas Newsletter,'' based on those alumni letters.
</P>
<P>
   Randolph A. Hearst, Mrs. Hearst's brother-in-law, former
chairman of The Hearst Corporation and president of the William
Randolph Hearst Foundation, said, ``Rosalie was known as a very
special and gracious person, a genuine lady who inspired affection
from all who knew and worked with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her strong interest in these high school delegates made her
beloved among the program's 3,900 alumni. She will be deeply missed
by all of us in the family of my late brother and by her adopted
`family' at the Senate Youth Program.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank A. Bennack, Jr., president and chief executive officer of
The Hearst Corporation and a director of the Hearst Foundation,
also cited her work for the Senate Youth Program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her vivacity and charm will be long remembered,'' Bennack
said, ``along with the legacy she has left from her valuable
contributions to this important program for the nation's future
achievers. It was an obvious source of joy and inspiration to her
and, therefore, to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosalie May Wynn was born in Oklahoma City, the daughter of
Audell Clary and Ora Wynn, and attended the University of
California at Los Angeles where she studied psychology. During
World War II, she coordinated volunteer services at Dibble General
Hospital, Palo Alto, Calif. After the war she worked in the same
capacity at Sawtelle Veteran's Hospital in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Her late husband held various executive assignments in the
Hearst organization _ including the post of publisher of the San
Francisco Examiner at the age of 25. Mr. Hearst was a diabetic and,
after they were married in 1960, the couple committed themselves to
learning everything they could about the disease and became
informal counselors to help other diabetics cope.
</P>
<P>
   When Mr. Hearst died in 1972 at age 68, Rosalie Hearst founded
the George Randolph Hearst Memorial Foundation for Diabetes
Education and became its first president. She was a former director
of the Joslin Diabetes Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hearst was a well-known leader in the Palm Springs
community because of her involvement in a wide range of charitable
and civic affairs.
</P>
<P>
   She served as a director of the Warner Guidance Center for
Emotionally Disturbed Children, the Palm Springs Youth Center,
Friends of the College of the Desert Cultural Center and the
Pathfinders Boys and Girls Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   She was a founding member of the Assistance League of the Desert
Area, an organization dedicated to community service.
</P>
<P>
   During her long career in philanthropy, Mrs. Hearst was honored
by the Palm Springs Senior Center; the Palm Springs Stroke Activity
Center, the Palm Springs Youth Center; Palm Springs Desert
Charities; the City of Hope; the American Health Assistance
Foundation; Northwood University of Midland, Mich., the Paralyzed
Veterans of America and the World Opportunities International Fund.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her step-son, Mrs. Hearst is survived by a
step-daughter, Phoebe Hearst Cooke, of Woodside, Calif. Mrs. Hearst
was preceded in death by her parents, her husband, a brother and a
sister.

IN ELECTRONIC AGE, STUDENTS STILL CHERISH CARE PACKAGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL LOPEZ  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ The atmosphere at Skidmore College's
Case Center one recent afternoon borders on frenetic as students
hurriedly check their mailboxes or browse at a vendor's jewelry
display, but for Emily Warner, a single brown package dispels the
drone and clatter.
</P>
<P>
   Warner _ through a care package she's just received _ is
communing with her parents, Dr. Neal and Diane Warner.
</P>
<P>
   If they could just see her face.
</P>
<P>
   From the campus post office at Skidmore, Warner, like a squirrel
with a fall acorn, whisks the brown box to a nearby ledge and
slowly unwraps its contents.
</P>
<P>
   It is show and tell. First, an orange plastic pumpkin light.
``You stick it on the window and you put the batteries in and it
lights up.''
</P>
<P>
   Next, those marshmallow puffs, normally bright yellow Easter
chicks, refashioned as bright orange pumpkins. Disgustingly sweet,
but irresistible. ``My best friend and I share them all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   And, Cheez-Its. ``My favorite.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner begins, and ends, this unveiling with the same few
sentences. ``I love my mom. My mom is the best. I love my mom.''
</P>
<P>
   In an age of electronic mail and cellular phones, technology
cannot displace the powerful message of the college care package.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're wonderful,'' said Skidmore senior Sarah Kottmeier,
who, on the same afternoon that Warner got her package, received a
birthday card from her best friend's mom. ``Nothing is better than
care packages. I think it takes more effort than e-mail. It makes
me realize that people are thinking of me.''
</P>
<P>
   A certain amount of homesickness is built into college life, but
its effects are not general. A few, rare students become so
homesick that they become physically ill, but most in fact ride out
the bouts, alleviated once students make a few friends and become
involved in campus life, said Anita Steigerwald, the dean for
first-year students at Skidmore College, an independent liberal
arts school of 2,200 students in upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general variety of homesickness is really kind of waiting
it out and getting involved in campus life to whatever extent they
can, because sitting around in the residence hall room and pining
away for friends who aren't with you or family members who aren't
with you really doesn't help,'' Steigerwald said.
</P>
<P>
   Conversations between parents, students and the dean, counselors
and peer resident assistants can help those pained by being away
from home.
</P>
<P>
   Like most colleges, Skidmore holds a family weekend in October:
Besides taking advantage of the foliage season, the weekend is
well-timed with the students' transition from home to school.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, ``Those care packages help a lot,'' Steigerwald said.
</P>
<P>
   Warner, a junior studying education and Spanish, had not been
home to Newtown, Conn., since leaving for Skidmore in September.
Caught up in a whirl of fall semester activity, Warner said she was
homesick only in those first September days.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother had hinted that a package might or might not arrive,
adding just enough uncertainty to heighten the surprise, Emily
Warner said. She recognized the earmarks: the Halloween package
most likely was her mother's in concept, but she saw her father _
including the clear Christmas lights, with small orange
jack-o'-lanterns.
</P>
<P>
   The family communicates by e-mail, phone and letters, and
squeezes in a visit about every six weeks. But the college treasure
amounts to the brown parcel, bubble wrap and the box of Cheez-Its.
</P>
<P>
   ``A package in the mail is something more tangible from home.
This is a good break from words on a computer screen, or a voice on
the phone, or words on a page.''
</P>
<P>
   Kottmeier, the senior who read her birthday card as if she'd won
a sweepstakes, described the reason why care packages in 1999 are
just that. ``It takes more effort to drop it in the mailbox, or to
pack a package.''

`BRINGING OUT THE DEAD' IS ALIVE, ENTERTAINING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Bringing Out the Dead'' is what you might get if you took a
cast-iron pot, tossed in ``Taxi Driver,'' buzzy rock songs and an
especially jokey episode of ``ER,'' then stirred it with a
jackhammer.
</P>
<P>
   The result would be quite a stew. It also would bear the
inimitable hand of Martin Scorsese, whose febrile camerawork gives
the film a restless, just-sprung energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bringing Out the Dead'' isn't always coherent and is nowhere
near the director's best film, but at least it's entertaining and
it's a dervish-whirl away from his most recent movie, the beautiful
but static ``Kundun.'' That one sat there, looking gorgeous. This
one moves.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Joe Connelly's novel, ``Bringing Out the Dead'' offers
us the burnt-out ruminations of one Frank Pierce, a wee-hours
paramedic who twirls around New York in an ambulance, looking for
meaning. In exhausted narration, Frank tells us he hasn't saved a
life in months. He's wiped out. He drinks. He's chronically late
for work and keeps begging his boss to fire him (``Next time I see
you, I'll fire you I promise'').
</P>
<P>
   And to top it all off, he's started seeing ghosts. He's haunted
by one in particular: Rose, a homeless, 18-year-old asthmatic who
died on the street and now seems to lurk on every corner. ``She had
come to bear witness for all of them _ all that had been lost,'' he
says, and as the camera dwells on his milky, bloodless face, it's
clear that no one's more lost than Frank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bringing Out the Dead'' follows Frank over the course of a
weekend, during which he meets a cavalcade of ghastly urbanites.
(Credit Scorsese for setting the action in the early '90s, when
crime had reached its mythic worst; had he bumped it up to 1999, he
might have made a film about jaywalkers.) Most of them are
banged-up but benevolent souls junkies, smelly drunks, squatters
who weave in and out of Frank's world with the concise idiosyncrasy
of sitcom characters.
</P>
<P>
   The film is chockablock with extraordinary supporting
performances: Cliff Curtis as a honey-tongued drug dealer, salsa
crooner Marc Anthony as a dreadlocked, pop-eyed street creature,
Tom Sizemore as a chillingly off-kilter medic. John Goodman has a
brief, hale role as one of Frank's partners, but it's the
ever-more-wonderful Ving Rhames as an evangelizing, womanizing
paramedic who steals the show. Few scenes are as marvelously
out-there as the bit in which Rhames ``resurrects'' an OD'd club
crawler.
</P>
<P>
   The weak point in the cast is Patricia Arquette (Cage's wife),
who plays Frank's hesitant love interest the daughter of a
heart-attack victim in an unwavering monotone. If Arquette is
capable of expressing something other than terminal boredom, she
ought to start now. As for Cage, he makes a welcome and mostly
successful escape from the idiotic action vehicles he's been
slumming around in lately, bringing sweetness, crazy energy and
pale-cheeked earnestness to the plight of a man in crisis.
</P>
<P>
   When Frank and his partners cruise a corner of hookers, you
can't help but recall Robert De Niro nosing his cab past Jodie
Foster in ``Taxi Driver.'' To be sure, Scorsese has covered this
ground before the isolation, the urban nocturne, even the insomnia.
And he's culled comedy from New York before, in ``After Hours.''
</P>
<P>
   But in ``Bringing Out the Dead'' he aims a little higher, trying
to find life in death and metaphysics in the manic spin of an
ambulance's nightly tour. He doesn't always find it. But it's fun
watching him try.

SODERBERGH TOYS WITH FILM NOIR IN `THE LIMEY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Steven Soderbergh is an adamantly odd duck. Like David Lynch, he
seems bored with the usual way of telling a story _ once upon a
time, blah, blah, blah _ and challenges the most basic narrative
assumptions of filmmaking.
</P>
<P>
   In his world, movies begin at their endings. Time is stilted,
jerky, likely to lurch forward or fall back at any moment. Dialogue
springs from closed mouths and motionless faces. Characters flash
forward to imagined conversations, flash back to fractured
memories, then speak at the shifting juncture of both.
</P>
<P>
   Soderbergh is best known for his first movie (``sex, lies, and
videotape'') and his last one (``Out of Sight''), but neither is as
dark, or as bristlingly experimental, as some of the films he made
in between. Not many folks saw the surreal ``Schizopolis,'' in
which the director played a blanched suburbanite who swaps
identities with a dentist, but believe you us _ it's a triumph of
weirdness.
</P>
<P>
   Viewed in this context, Soderbergh's newest film _ ``The
Limey,'' is both a return to experimental territory and an exercise
in creative moderation. As non-linear as it is, this small, crafty
crime tale never seems indulgent; with an 88-minute running time
and a staccato script that packs potent asymmetry into a few small
scenes, the movie has the blackness and economy of classic film
noir.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Limey'' features the latest in a long string of comebacks
for Terence Stamp, who began his career as the ethereally beautiful
star of 1962's ``Billy Budd'' and made a string of films before
fading into relative obscurity (and an Indian ashram) in the 1970s.
Of late he's popped up in an eclectic assortment of movies _ as a
transsexual in ``The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the
Desert,'' as Chancellor Valorum in ``Star Wars _ Episode I: The
Phantom Menace'' and as a slippery New Age guru in ``Bowfinger.''
But none of these roles has plumbed the latent danger at the core
of the man, the thrilling sense that he's stuffed with plastique
and might explode at any moment. When he does, duck.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Limey,'' Stamp plays the titular Wilson, a career
criminal whose daughter, Jenny, was killed in a car crash along a
serpentine California road. He believes she was murdered. So after
nine years in an English prison, Wilson brings his ire and his
Cockney rhyming slang to the West Coast, where he looks up a pair
of Jenny's old friends (Lesley Ann Warren and Luis Guzman, in two
affable character bits) and sniffs out her record-producing
boyfriend, a superficial snake of a man named Terry Valentine
(Peter Fonda, putting a Lemon Joy gloss on evil).
</P>
<P>
   Valentine has bad friends with bad acquaintances who do bad
things involving heroin and corrupt narcs and large muscular men in
warehouses. Included among such lowlifes are Joe Dallesandro, nee
Andy Warhol's nude hunk, as a dim hit man, Nicky Katt as a cocky
hit man and Barry Newman (``Bowfinger'') as the hit men's venal
contact in Valentine's house. The details of their wicked doings
are never quite made clear, but Wilson makes short work of the
business and winds up terrorizing all involved.
</P>
<P>
   It's a testament to Stamp's controlled fury _ and the crazy
paternal love he's able to project _ that when Wilson turns
murderous, he doesn't lose an ounce of sympathy. Or credibility:
There's no question that this small, wisp-haired man in white socks
and highwaters is capable of kicking major arse.
</P>
<P>
   ``You tell him. Tell him I'm coming. Tell him I'm (bleeping)
coming,'' he says, after putting away a few thick goons stupid
enough to call him ``pop.'' That's the gist of the film right there
_ in Wilson's bloody, righteous pragmatism, which harks back to
early Eastwood at his most taciturn. He's a man on a tragic
mission.
</P>
<P>
   That ``The Limey'' ultimately backs away from tragedy detracts,
a touch, from its effectiveness. Wilson is never made to reap what
he's sown. But the film is less a morality tale than a character
study, and Stamp's furiously grieving papa is one of the more
interesting incendiaries to spark the screen this year.
</P>
<P>
   He's helped by Soderbergh's direction, which works a cool visual
witchery on Lem Dobbs' pungent script. Incorporating flashbacks,
flashforwards, repetition, clips from an old Stamp film (``Poor
Cow,'' 1967), handheld camerawork and disjunctive editing
techniques that weave exterior and interior dialogue, the film
manages to convey the dreamlike quest of a man from another world.
The result is more disorienting and effective than all the
pumped-up, faux-nihilistic theatrics of the hugely overrated
``Fight Club''; it's amazing what a little thematic cohesion will
do for a movie. (That, and a good score: Cliff Martinez's spooky
minimalism is worth a thousand drum machines.)
</P>
<P>
   If, in the end, ``The Limey'' doesn't quite satisfy, at least
this dusky portrait of revenge lingers like a London fog. Any
nightmare would.

`BEST MAN' IS HANDSOME BUT INNOCUOUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Best Man,'' by first-time writer/director Malcolm D. Lee,
is as innocuous as the love songs on its soundtrack, and as comely
as the members of its nimble ensemble, but the movie poster reads:
``The flower arrangements have all been ordered. The sleeping
arrangements are still being worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Things never get as ribald or as complicated as that, though.
</P>
<P>
   Lee is comfortable with the convention of the wedding surprise,
contributing his own auspicious hook in the form of a juicy
semi-autobiographical novel by the best man, but never maximizing
the screwball potential.
</P>
<P>
   Oprah herself, as Oprah, has picked the book by best man Harper
Stewart (played by fetching Taye Diggs) before it officially goes
to press. The book is an E. Lynn Harris-y affair-a-thon, and the
manuscript makes its way from Washington, D.C., to New York just in
time for Harper's arrival for the wedding of Lance and Mia (Morris
Chestnut and Monica Calhoun). Jordan (Nia Long) gave the paperback
to Murch (Harold Perrineau Jr.), who shared it with Quentin
(Terrence Howard), and before long the only member of the wedding
who hasn't read it is the groom. And he stands to be the most
offended because Harper wrote ``Unfinished Business'' using his
college buddies and their sex lives as mannequins for his
characters.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, there's something in the book that promises to give
the God-fearing Lance, now in the National Football League, a case
of the Warren Moons. (Chestnut is commandingly reincarnated after
the ``Boyz N the Hood'' drive-by that took the life of his aspiring
football player.)
</P>
<P>
   Lee exhibits a knack for disclosing what men want. In the film's
best scene, the four male friends play cards and exhale about the
differences between men and women. It's a keenly written,
improvisatory scene among four engagingly dissimilar actors _ with
the seductively insinuating, Dexter Gordon-looking Howard doing the
most surprising damage _ that feels too weighty and raw to be in a
movie this frothy. (When's the last time you saw a group of
brothers sitting around a movie just talking about sex?)
</P>
<P>
   That scene, along with a few others in which the too-subdued
Diggs and Long have new adventures in chemistry, seems to set up a
demystification of The Booty Myth, lifting it to more refined air.
</P>
<P>
   But, ultimately, Lee suspects he's damned either way. So, he
self-consciously plays the film down the crowd-pleasing middle,
sneaking in some fine Buppie jokes, including Shelby (Melissa De
Sousa), Murch's ``bougie-monster'' (bourgeois African-American)
girlfriend who address Harper as ``Richard Wrong-Langston Snooze.''
</P>
<P>
   But the men never really communicate with their women, none of
whom is written as very deep, just very successful and deeply
needy, meaning the exuberant Long is shortchanged again. But
there's just enough incongruous calm behind Calhoun's passive
demeanor _ her character's engaged to a man who's in love with her
because he thinks he's the only guy she's been with _ that you can
catch that otherwise absent glint of Terry McMillan crazy.

BANKS CHIP IN TO THWART INITIATIVE ON ATM FEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RYAN KIM  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Banks have raised nearly $400,000 in an effort
to persuade San Francisco voters to defeat a city ballot measure
that would ban surcharges on automated teller machines, or ATMs.
</P>
<P>
   The Coalition for ATM Choice, made up largely of banks, reported
$379,078 in contributions for the campaign against Proposition F,
with about two-thirds donated in the last month, according to
campaign finance reports filed Thursday with the San Francisco
Ethics Commission. The municipal election is Nov. 2.
</P>
<P>
   The total included $100,000 contributions each from the Bank of
America, which is based in Charlotte, N.C., and the San
Francisco-based Wells Fargo.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Committee to End Extra ATM Fees has raised
$14,292. The largest recent donation _ $4,750 _ came from the
California Public Interest Research Group, which is leading the
fight against the surcharge fees that have become common at banks
throughout the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition F would eliminate surcharges that are levied by
banks when non-customers use their ATMs. The fees, about $1.50 per
transaction, are in addition to the $1 to $2 access fees that are
paid to a customer's home bank for every transaction at another
bank's ATM.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents say the fund-raising by the banks indicate they are
taking the campaign seriously for fear it may embolden other cities
to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that if this is approved, it will spread like
wildfire and that is what strikes fear in the hearts of Bank of
America and Wells Fargo,'' said Jon Golinger, a spokesman for the
California Public Interest Research Group, a consumer organization.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Barnes, campaign manager for the No on F Campaign, said
opponents of the measure have to raise more money because they have
a more difficult task of educating voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a simple populist measure and we have to explain why
that won't work,'' Barnes said. ``We needed to spend money to make
sure people are aware of the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that even if the proposition were approved, it would not
affect most of the banks in San Francisco that are federally
chartered because they would be exempt from local laws. But to
press that issue, the banks would have to file a lawsuit against
the city, said Barnes, which eventually would require taxpayer
money to defend.
</P>
<P>
   Golinger, however, said he was confident Proposition F would
survive a legal challenge. And he took issue with Barnes'
educational campaign, saying it is aimed more at confusing voters
than anything else.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the ballot initiative have spent $243,384 to date,
mostly on targeted mailers and advertising in neighborhood and
ethnic newspapers. The Committee to End Extra ATM Fees plans to
produce an information sheet which supporters expect to deliver by
hand to voters before the election.

RX FOR Y2K: GO INTO HIDING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: What if you haven't been keeping up to date
with Windows 95 Y2K updates? I went to Microsoft's site to see what
was available, and there was quite a long list. Do I need to
install all of them?
</P>
<P>
   _ Millennium Bugged
</P>
<P>
   DEAR BUGGED: Don't you have enough to worry about without all
this Y2K mess? You don't make enough money, you're getting older,
you're not living up to your potential, and you have the fashion
sense of Andy Kaufman. At least that's what Momma Bombay keeps
telling me. So how much worse could things get if you do absolutely
nothing to prepare for 2000?
</P>
<P>
   It's not like you're an air-traffic controller. You might have a
little trouble balancing your checkbook _ as if that's anything new
_ but you won't be steering any 767s. Relax. All versions of
Windows 95 and 98 are 2000-compliant, meaning they won't think 2000
is really 1900 and refuse to let you play Quake III because you
haven't been born yet.
</P>
<P>
   True, since the first release of Windows 95, there have been
about a jillion service packs (Microsoft-ese for ``bug fixes'').
That's understandable. There are tens of millions of lines of
computer code in Windows, and bugs happen. Who knows? Maybe the
cafeteria was out of Jolt cola the day they wrote line 4,837,382.
At least Microsoft is good about making patches easily available.
Trouble is, you have to keep up with them, or you get way behind
way fast.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to avoid the hassle of catching up piecemeal, go
plunk down 75 bucks for Windows 98 Second Edition. After
installation, the Windows Update feature can take you directly to
an upgrade download center, where a very curious program will delve
deep into your computer's darkest recesses to see what else you
might need.
</P>
<P>
   Bet you thought you were done. Not by a long shot. Windows is
the least of your worries. The real problems are likely to come
from your older applications _ word processors, checkbook programs,
Reader Rabbit, whatever _ and the startup chip on your computer's
motherboard.
</P>
<P>
   Go to 
download.microsoft.com/download/win2000pro/Install/2.0/WIN98/EN-US/y
2k.exe to start downloading Microsoft's Y2K Product Analyzer, or
just poke around their download center until you find it. Running
it tells you if Windows and your Microsoft stuff are compliant. The
report has hyperlinks to technical help.
</P>
<P>
   If everything checks out, you still need to examine your other
apps and that chip, called the BIOS (don't ask _ geeks just like
acronyms). Get the 2000 Toolbox from www.mcafee.com. It's a
try-before-you-buy download, which seems pretty silly, since after
the first time you try it you won't need to buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of these programs will fix all potential problems, but
at least they'll point them out for you. If you've got BIOS
trouble, go to your manufacturer's site and see if it has an update
to fix the chip. If not, you'll need to find a software utility
that will interpret what your BIOS thinks at boot time into
something that will work after Dec. 31. Try cruising shareware
sites like www.shareware.com or maybe www.hotfiles.com and do a
search for ``Y2K.''
</P>
<P>
   Or do what I intend to do: Hide in a cave without electricity or
running water until all the Y2K consultants find new jobs.
</P>

`STRAIGHT STORY' IS BATHED IN TOUCHING REALISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ``Lost Highway'' of David Lynch's last film was a nebulous
strip of Twilight Zone that contorted time into a nightmarish ball
of confusion. One man became another without so much as a narrative
explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Now Lynch takes to a lost highway of his own, telling a G-rated
story about a man who drives his 1966 John Deere riding mower from
Iowa to Wisconsin to bring his ailing, estranged brother his love.
Anyone looking for a sign that Doomsday is nigh won't find it in
the David Lynch-directed, Walt Disney-produced ``The Straight
Story,'' a momentously, shockingly moving fit of shape-shifting by
a filmmaker grown tired of the macabre.
</P>
<P>
   Another director in Lynch's position, a fiercely idiosyncratic
storyteller struggling to surmount his thorough lack of commercial
instinct, would have wrung the true tale of Alvin Straight for
melodrama. In Lynch's hands, it's a beguiling case of a man buying
into something larger than his demons. The film is so simple,
straightforwardly American and unwavering in its trajectory that it
seems watched over as opposed to directed, but Lynch's traceless
touch demonstrates a newfound faith in emotional truth.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``The Straight Story'' is a David Lynch film in all the
ways that count. The apocalyptic conflagrations, Grand Guignol
bloodbaths and lurid, lewd, erotic freak shows from ``Blue
Velvet,'' ``Wild at Heart'' and ``Fire Walk with Me'' may be gone,
but the moment a corpulent, sunbathing neighbor misses the crashing
thud next door because she ran inside to grab a couple of Hostess
Snowballs, it's obvious Lynch's Midwest eccentricities are still
intact. The crash she missed was Alvin Straight's (Richard
Farnsworth) hip giving out, landing him on the kitchen floor.
</P>
<P>
   Proud, stubborn and 73, Alvin's a study in deteriorating health:
bad hips force him to walk with two canes; his vision is waning,
and his smoking has left him with his doctor thinking he has
emphysema. And his mentally ill daughter Rose (marvelous Sissy
Spacek), with whom he shares his house, has to demand that he see
the doctor. When he gets a call that his brother (Harry Dean
Stanton, here briefly and poignantly) has had a stroke, she
practically insists he not go.
</P>
<P>
   Most things move slowly in ``The Straight Story.'' The rain that
falls down the side of the Straight house, the spaces between
Rose's sputtered manner of speaking, Alvin's walk, Freddie Francis'
handsome photography and co-writer/editor Mary Sweeney's fade-outs
so gorgeously protracted that shots have to be peeled off each
other. Slowest of all though is that mower and the caboose he
hitches to the back of it. Not well enough to drive a car, he
chooses this as his chariot, and when he puts his original mower
out of its misery, the John Deere replacement doesn't go much
faster. But time here isn't so important as who Alvin shares it
with.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, ``The Straight Story'' is a yellow-brick-road
movie, a journey film kissed by tiny magic. He meets handfuls of
people in his travels with comic results. The fragile beauty of
Farnsworth's performance is that he makes Alvin appear to be
listening to, learning from and entertained by every one he meets.
</P>
<P>
   Farnsworth has eyes as big and chlorine-blue as swimming pools
and sometimes the wind makes them leak a little. Other times, he's
moved by the kindness of strangers and the quiet, religious
magnitude of his own pilgrimage.
</P>
<P>
   Farnsworth's mouth is collapsed, pushed in as though he's
missing a row of his teeth behind the snowy scraggliness that
passes for a beard. The role, as written by Lynch and Sweeney,
gives Alvin dignity. What the veteran actor brings is a bemusement
_ wonder at how fast the world moves around him, at how the years
have ravaged him. He may be the only actor I've ever seen whose
pensive silences and long drags of contemplative staring have made
me want to know what he's thinking about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll bet a warm bed and roof over your head sure beats eating
hot dogs off a stick with a geezer driving around on a lawnmower,''
Alvin tells a young runaway (Anastasia Webb) one starry night.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he's right, but camped out under the cosmos like this with
Farnsworth and a newly sentimental _ dear God, ethereal _ Lynch for
two hours is just as warm.

A WASH AND WAX FOR YOUR CAR, AND A LATTE TO GO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARSHA GINSBURG  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Once associated with wet rags, loud machinery
and air fresheners, car washes are finding their niche in the
upscale shopping market.
</P>
<P>
   The Autopia and suds shops like it in the San Francisco area are
dolling up their stores with exclusive gifts, hoping to cash in on
impulse buying as well as the ultimate goal of working people in
the '90s: convenience.
</P>
<P>
   Besides expensive gifts, car washes are increasingly offering
coffee bars and greeting cards.
</P>
<P>
   A sampling at some ``gourmet'' car washes includes aroma-therapy
bath salts, massage oil, designer eyeglass cases, hand-painted
Winnie-the-Pooh boxes, hand-made birdhouses, fabric gift wrap,
eucalyptus-scented sinus pillows, soaps with names like ``Facets of
the Sea,'' and, for the man who has everything, an inflatable moose
head. Shoppers waiting for their cars can eat organic scones,
veggie burgers and focaccia, and sip lattes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to do something if you're going to be here 45
minutes,'' said Frances Wright, a nurse from Pacifica who picked up
four greeting cards at Ducky's Brushless Car Wash in Burlingame.
</P>
<P>
   Although the concept of a sloshy car wash and boutique-style
presents seems contradictory, pop culture observer Rodney Buxton of
the University of Colorado said it makes perfect sense. In a
society that seems to value productivity and finds wasting time
anathema, this was just a matter of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real corporate mentality. ... You feel guilty if you're
not doing something,'' Buxton said.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Frahm, site manager at Divisadero Touchless Car Wash in San
Francisco, which pumps out 1,500 clean cars on a busy Saturday,
said people buy on impulse.
</P>
<P>
   Jeannie McCullough, 40, would know something about that. She
takes her car for a bath every three weeks at the Touchless and
admitted she rarely makes it out without buying something for
herself or a friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason I come here is because it's a great car wash,''
McCullough said. ``But this is the icing on the cake.''
</P>
<P>
   She said it was usually the bath products that snare her. But
she also has bought pricey lip gloss for a cousin.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm going to someone's house for dinner and there's
something I should bring, I'll get something for someone that they
wouldn't normally buy for themselves,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But wouldn't it be awkward, McCullough was asked, if the friend
asked where the gift had been purchased, and she was forced to
answer, ``my car wash''?
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's asked where I got it,'' McCullough said. ``But I
wouldn't relish saying it. I'd rather say I got it at some cute
boutique over on Union Street. But they carry the same things
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Patti Shimmick, the owner of the Touchless as well as similar
trendy car washes in Berkeley and San Rafael, said she and her
husband decided to open a store at the car wash more than 10 years
ago. He was thinking ``chilly-willies, hot dogs and six-packs,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Shimmick, an admitted shopper, nixed the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started putting out stuff we wanted to buy ourselves,'' she
said, adding that if people need to pick up cards or gifts anyway
``they might as well do it here. People are in a crunch for time.''
</P>
<P>
   That philosophy has struck a chord among customers, who
invariably seem so busy that saving one more shopping trip to the
mall or the card store is worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's convenience,'' said Linda Rossi of Crockett, who pulled
her Chevy into the Autopia in Walnut Creek and ate at the outdoor
cafe.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the big word in today's world,'' she said. ``What's the
easiest thing?''

<TEXT>
<P>
   PESPIRE, Honduras _ Determined to press on, 83-year-old Pedro
Castro has spent the past year clawing out of the ruin that a storm
called Mitch made of his world.
</P>
<P>
   With his grandchildren's help, Castro shoveled away the
rafters-high mud and debris that the storm left inside the house
that has always been his home.
</P>
<P>
   He put up solid brick to replace the old adobe, which had melted
like meringue in the floodwaters, then plastered the new walls
smooth and painted them a soothing white.
</P>
<P>
   He raised the hard-packed dirt floor a few feet higher and laid
terra cotta tile. He bought new glass display cases for the small
general store at the front of the house, then filled them with the
candy, school supplies and whatnots that his neighbors want.
</P>
<P>
   In putting his life back together, Castro says, he, in many
ways, made it better than it was before.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was total destruction here,'' Castro says of Pespire, a
town of 15,000 in the mountains of southern Honduras that was half
destroyed by Mitch's flooding. ``But we're coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Honduras, hundreds of thousands of people like Castro
toil to recover from Mitch, a powerful hurricane that formed in the
Caribbean late last October.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeping across Central America as a weakening tropical storm,
Mitch killed as many as 10,000 people in Honduras, Nicaragua, El
Salvador, Guatemala and Costa Rica, and left hundreds of thousands
homeless. In Honduras, the country hit hardest by the storm,
officials claim that nearly 6,000 people lost their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Now, despite stubborn obstacles, Honduras seems on the mend. A
fresh coat of green vegetation covers the raw scars of Mitch's
mudslides in the central mountains. Thousands of new houses, most
of them built with the help of foreign church groups and aid
organizations, dot neighborhoods across the country. Bananas and
other crops have been replanted.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
25,000 REMAIN IN SHELTERS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But 25,000 Hondurans made homeless by Mitch remain in shelters.
Many people have left the country to seek work in the United
States, Costa Rica and elsewhere. Despite extensive work, the
country's principal highways remain in precarious shape. Many
smaller roads and bridges have not been repaired.
</P>
<P>
   A new round of flooding and mudslides that began in late summer
has set back the rebuilding and erased some repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, amid the often sluggish and sometimes helter-skelter
reconstruction effort, many Hondurans and their foreign benefactors
hope to remake _ rather than merely restore _ the nation that Mitch
unhinged.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could see Mitch as a disaster but also as an opportunity,''
says Victor Meza, director of a think tank in the Honduran capital
of Tegucigalpa that is devoted to social and political issues. ``We
could see it as a chance to make a better country: less poor, less
corrupt, more democratic, more tolerant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have to only rebuild the country physically,'' Meza
says, ``but also culturally.''
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics say such change will be decades in the making, if it
comes at all. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Nevertheless, the effort has received support from
international donors, such as the United States, Canada, the
European Community and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   At a May meeting in Stockholm, Sweden, lenders and
representatives of the Central American countries hit by Mitch
declared their intentions to re-engineer societies and governments
that have long been considered corrupt and rigid.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for their massive economic help _ some $2.7 billion
to Honduras in the coming years and about $9 billion to the region
as a whole _ donors are pressing demands for crackdowns on
corruption, respect for human rights, rehabilitation of the
environment and the reform of political systems.
</P>
<P>
   The Stockholm agreement reflects an international desire that
``this significant flow of outside resources would facilitate the
process of strengthening the voice of local government and civil
society, to strengthen democracy at the grass roots,'' says Frank
Almaguer, the recently arrived U.S. ambassador to Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   Private aid agencies are working with local governments and
civic groups to provide houses, schools and services to places
pummeled by Mitch. In doing so, proponents say, the aid is
strengthening the ability of communities to determine their own
futures. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Honduras was spared the bloody civil wars suffered in recent
decades by Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala. But political
power long has been concentrated in a national government that too
often was repressive or unresponsive to the needs of its citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Despite years of U.S. economic aid and increased
industrialization, the country remains the third poorest in the
Americas.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
ENVIRONMENTAL PRESSURES &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An exploding population, which is doubling every 20 years, has
put intense pressure on the environment. Deforestation and other
environmental problems that worsened the flooding and mudslides
caused by Mitch have only begun to be addressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one wants to make decisions,'' says Mario Rietti, a
Honduran businessman who helped found the local chapter of
Transparency International, an anti-corruption group. ``The great
fear is that there is not a vision of sustainable development.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, only a fraction of the money pledged at Stockholm has
arrived. Much of the aid involves financial transactions _ the
trading of old debt for new, for example _ and never will translate
into cash for villages or neighborhoods where Mitch caused the most
damage.
</P>
<P>
   Some rebuilding projects have been held up in government
planning committees or put on hold because of funding snags or
concerns about fraud.
</P>
<P>
   According to Transparency International, Honduras ranks among
the most corrupt countries in the world. Many donors are releasing
funds only when they feel certain that the money won't disappear
into officials' personal bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   But President Carlos Flores has insisted on accountability,
Honduran government officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been known as a banana republic,'' says Moises Starkman,
the Cabinet minister in charge of coordinating international
assistance. ``We have not had a very positive image. Now we are
trying to clean it up with the handling of Mitch aid.''
</P>
<P>
   More than image is at stake. The world has been racked by
disaster in the year since Mitch. Earthquakes have shaken Colombia,
Turkey, Greece and Taiwan; hurricanes have slammed the United
States; war has roiled the Balkans and Africa. There are many
competing needs for a shrinking pot of aid money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honduras isn't the only country that needs help. People know
that we have eyes upon us,'' says Glenda Gallardo, a U.S.-educated
economist who directs the agency overseeing the national
government's recovery plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand that the donors want to see that the money is
being used properly,'' she says. ``We know that if they don't think
the money is being used right, or is being stolen, the funds might
stop coming.''
</P>
<P>
   The foreign pressure seems to be keeping corruption in check so
far. Though there have been many allegations of bill padding and
other minor frauds, no major scandals involving relief money have
erupted so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still a lot of corruption, but it is harder now to be
corrupt than 10 years ago,'' says Meza, whose think tank has
produced detailed studies of official fraud. ``People are becoming
more vigilant.''
</P>
<P>
   But safeguarding against corruption has helped slow the
reconstruction, many Honduran and foreign officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Contracts for roads and bridges are taking longer to be
approved, as donors' accountants review them. Some midlevel
bureaucrats hesitate to make decisions that could haunt them later,
aid officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our concern about corruption in a certain sense is slowing
down the process, because we are all watching,'' says Zoraida Mesa,
the top U.N. official in Honduras. ``Since the amount of money
pledged was so huge, we're going to be included in decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Construction delays have contributed to the severity with which
this season's tropical rains have affected the country, officials
acknowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Rivers and canals that were never dredged of Mitch's silt and
debris have flooded more easily. Temporary bridges and river levees
thrown up just before the rains began have collapsed in the rising
waters. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
DEADLY FLOODS CONTINUE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of people have died in the floods in recent weeks, and
thousands more have been made homeless. Tens of millions of dollars
worth of crops have been lost.
</P>
<P>
   Because the rebuilding has been slower than promised, many
Hondurans who suffered most from Mitch believe that the promised
foreign cash will simply disappear or be misused, as it often has
been in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps things are happening in Tegucigalpa or San Pedro
Sula,'' says Marvin Umana, 35, the mayor of the town of Pimienta
near Honduras' Caribbean coast that was flooded earlier this month
by rain-swollen rivers. ``But help has never arrived in the smaller
towns.''
</P>
<P>
   Pimienta's farmers had replanted hundreds of acres of bananas
and other crops destroyed by Mitch after the central government
promised that improved dikes would be built. The new crops have
been ruined by the recent flooding, Umana says.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came, they measured, they studied, but nothing
happened,'' the mayor says of national officials who promised to
build new dikes. ``They said they didn't have the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Government officials say that they are moving as quickly as
possible, that the still-scarce financial resources and the
enormity of the rebuilding effort make it inevitable that people
will be disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, we want the bridges built, the rivers dredged, the
highways fixed. But it's going to take some time,'' says Gallardo,
the Honduran government planner.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have shelter. They have food to eat,'' she says. ``In
spite of the rainy season, we haven't had any epidemics. People
have a lot better houses than they had before.''
</P>
<P>
   Some private aid officials say that the larger remaking of
Honduran society matters more than a quick rebuilding.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what we have to watch for,'' says Maribel Suazo, an
official for a coalition of private aid groups in Honduras. ``Not
whether a certain bridge or road is being built, but whether real
change is taking place.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides requiring more stringent accounting of the money spent,
many foreign donors are seeking assurances that the projects
they're funding are worthwhile and necessary.
</P>
<P>
   That has been the case in Pespire, a village of tile-roofed
houses wedged on a mountainside between a swift river and the main
highway from Tegucigalpa to the Pacific coast.
</P>
<P>
   About half of Pespire's houses were either destroyed or badly
damaged when the Mitch-fed Nacaome River surged dozens of feet
above its banks. About 60 townspeople were killed in the flooding,
according to the local Roman Catholic priest, and thousands were
left homeless.
</P>
<P>
   The flooding also contaminated Pespire's wells and ruined its
water pumps, further debilitating a system that hadn't worked well
for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a Swiss aid group has offered to upgrade the town's water
network. But first, the donors want the town to do its part by
forming a board that will force residents to conserve water and to
pay for what they use.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
PRECIOUS WATER IS WASTED &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With water flowing in the pipes only a few hours each day at
best, few people in Pespire bother to pay for the service. Untold
gallons are wasted, because many leave taps untended and open to
replenish barrels and tanks when the water does come on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The foreign money is only going to pay for things when there
is need,'' Antonio Guillen, a Honduran civil engineer who works as
a consultant for the Swiss aid agency, tells Mayor Antonio
Matamoros and his city council. ``They want to help, but they want
to know what they are getting into.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a national problem. We only know how to say help me,''
Guillen tells the officials. ``But that doesn't work anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The officials and engineers meet in the mayor's office, a
Spartan room outfitted with a large crucifix, a half dozen metal
folding chairs, a battered desk and a filing cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our town, our development,'' declares a bumper sticker slapped
on the cabinet. ``Everyone to work.''
</P>
<P>
   But the mayor belongs to the opposition Nationalist Party. For
that reason, he says, Pespire is getting less help from the central
government than other towns. Matamoros says he has had to court
foreign aid groups himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see the news about the aid, you hear about it, but nothing
has arrived here,'' the 34-year-old mayor says with a
what-can-you-do smile.
</P>
<P>
   Across Pespire's sullen, tree-shaded plaza, the town's priest,
French Canadian Ivan Bouffard, doles out cash to local men and
women who are building houses for the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   With 250 people on his payroll, Bouffard has become the biggest
employer in the area. He says he took on the building job because
government officials _ both at city hall and in Tegucigalpa _
failed to deliver enough help to Pespire.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big task, an enormous effort,'' Bouffard says of the
government's rebuilding effort. ``But things are not arriving to
people on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
BUILDING NEW HOUSES &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bouffard is financing the construction of 325 small houses with
money sent by Canadian, U.S. and European aid groups and with
private donations, including those from a network of Catholic and
Lutheran congregations in Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   He has hired masons and carpenters. The men and women who will
live in the dwellings work as laborers, earning wages three days a
week, working free another two as a down payment on their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Bouffard has added house building to the list of his parish's
other community projects. The church runs primary and secondary
schools; sponsors workshops on health care; and provides storage
bins for grain, so farmers can wait for the best market prices to
sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future we see is a country which doesn't depend upon the
government for anything,'' Bouffard says as he finishes the
payroll.
</P>
<P>
   Many Pespire residents say they increasingly rely upon foreign
charity and their own initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Like people elsewhere in Honduras, residents of Pespire who lost
everything in last year's floods now dress in hand-me-down clothes
sent from abroad. Men and women wear ill-fitting pants, shirts and
dresses. Children sport T-shirts boasting of vacations to Disney
World or Hilton Head that they never took, of summer camps they
never attended.
</P>
<P>
   Though volunteers from aid organizations and evangelical
churches in the United States and other countries are constructing
some houses, many Pespire residents are rebuilding their own homes
with the help of neighbors and family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're recovering with our own efforts,'' says Praxedes
Contreras, a 35-year-old mother of three whose rented home near
Pespire's river bank was all but destroyed by Mitch. ``We've
learned to rely upon each other in a way I never thought we could.
We have more faith in ourselves, more confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Down the steep hill from the priest's office on the plaza, Pedro
Castro and his neighbors keep a wary watch on the rising river.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy rains in the mountains to the north have been fattening
the stream for days. Tree trunks caught beneath the low bridge that
connects Pespire to farms across the river have blocked the flow.
Water several feet deep has been rushing over the center of the
bridge, cutting off people who live across the river from the town.
</P>
<P>
   As great gray thunderheads build over the low mountains, a crowd
gathers at the Pespire side of the bridge to watch young men swim
to the far bank with food supplies for their hungry families. Talk
turns to what people would do if the floods inundate the town
again.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty yards away, Pedro Castro sits on his porch and eyes the
action.
</P>
<P>
   He's not going anywhere, Castro says with a whimsical grin,
whatever the river decides to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born in this house, and I'm going to die here,'' Castro
says. ``We've never seen anything like Mitch before, and we're not
going to see it again.''

DEVELOPERS OF DIGNITY: VIDA NUEVA PLAN GOES FAR BEYOND BUILDING
HOUSES 

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   VIDA NUEVA, Honduras _ A year into the recovery from its worst
natural disaster in decades, Honduras swirls with talk of a new
society that will rise from the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   No idea reaches further toward that envisioned new dawn,
perhaps, than Vida Nueva, a sprawling development of bleak rows of
houses under construction outside San Pedro Sula, a no-nonsense
city near the Caribbean coast that is Honduras' economic dynamo.
</P>
<P>
   Some 4,000 homes planned for Vida Nueva will house about 500
families displaced by Hurricane Mitch's flooding last October as
well as residents of neighborhoods at risk in future disasters and
poor people who simply want to trade up from their shacks.
</P>
<P>
   Planners hope Vida Nueva, which means ``new life'' in Spanish,
does more than simply provide homes to those who need them. Vida
Nueva, they say, aims to create renewed human beings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea isn't just to build houses, but to formulate within
people the idea that they have a dignified place to live,'' says
Luis Fernando Rivera, a building contractor who serves as the Vida
Nueva Foundation's executive director. ``It's a sort of social
engineering.''
</P>
<P>
   Vida Nueva is the brainchild of San Pedro Sula Mayor Roberto
Larios, who has enlisted local businessmen and evangelical
Christian activists from the United States and Mexico for the
effort.
</P>
<P>
   Larios' idea, Vida Nueva officials say, is to replace a culture
of poverty framed by joblessness, street gangs, alcoholism and
illegitimate births with a stable, God-fearing community.
</P>
<P>
   Some international donors already have expressed concerns about
using public funds on a project with such an apparent religious
purpose. And even some planners have expressed doubts about the
intended exclusion of prostitutes, alcoholics and gang members from
the community. Some who will get houses in Vida Nueva complain that
the development is too far from jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But Larry Buckman, the Honduras director of Samaritan's Purse, a
U.S.-based Christian charity that is building a quarter of Vida
Nueva's houses, says Mayor Larios ``wants to build a society that
is way above'' what residents of the community have ever known.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larios is trying to make these people working citizens,''
Buckman says.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the mayor has contracted the services of the
Institute in Basic Life Principles, an Illinois-based organization
that applies Bible teachings to social problems. Vida Nueva's
planners say a training center operated by the institute will teach
moral values and job skills to community residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we want to do is transform the culture,'' says Alfredo de
Hoyos, a 40-year-old lawyer from the Mexican city of Monterrey who
is designing the institute's strategy for Vida Nueva.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a sick group,'' de Hoyos says of the poor Hondurans
who will live in Vida Nueva. ``This is not a healthy society. We
have to break them of their old ways of doing things.''
</P>
<P>
   As it did elsewhere in Central America, Mitch's devastation fell
hardest on San Pedro Sula's poorest. Most of the houses that were
severely damaged sat in working-class neighborhoods along the
Chamelecon River to which many residents had immigrated from
Honduras' rural highlands.
</P>
<P>
   Like many cities in the region, San Pedro Sula contends with a
wave of gang violence. Two large street gangs with the same names
as counterparts in Los Angeles _ 18th Street and Mara Salvatrucha _
battle each other in poor neighborhoods and commit crimes citywide.
</P>
<P>
   The Honduran government's human rights office claims that recent
killings of street gang members appeared to be carried out in an
organized fashion, raising the specter of death squads taking
justice into their own hands. Such killings have been common in
neighboring El Salvador, where gang members deported from the
United States have fueled a crime wave through much of this decade.
</P>
<P>
   Vida Nueva's promoters intend to offer a gang- and crime-free
environment that promotes family values. Planners have designed the
community with few intersections, on the theory that gangs tend to
square off by blocks, as well as a lot of green space.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also have banned the sale of alcohol and cigarettes in
the small stores that serve people living in the community's
temporary shelters.
</P>
<P>
   In a more controversial move, Vida Nueva officials have
attempted to weed out gang members, prostitutes and drug users from
the people who will be permitted to get houses in the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a sensitive question, because the foundation
can't discriminate. It's against its principles,'' Rivera says.
``But we also can't permit the project to fail.''
</P>
<P>
   Boosters say that Vida Nueva is the first planned community for
poor families of its kind in Honduras .
</P>
<P>
   The $16 million project will boast electricity and a water and
sewer system that includes a treatment plant. Parks, day-care
centers, schools and community halls are planned.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to those supplied by Samaritan's Purse _ a charity
run by the Rev. Billy Graham's son, Franklin _ thousands of houses
are slated to be built by Habitat for Humanity and Spanish aid
groups.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government has pledged $1.8 million for the
development's water system and shelters, where 2,000 people live
while their homes are under construction. Private foundations as
well as a 40-year loan from the Inter-American Development Bank are
supplying additional funding, Vida Nueva officials say.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The houses built by charities and aid agencies will be given to
the foundation operating Vida Nueva, which will then sell them to
families at cost. People will make down payments through community
service, Rivera says, and pay off their mortgages at a rate of
about $20 a month over 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bad message to give something away,'' Rivera says.
``What we need to do is recover the investment we have made.''
</P>
<P>
   In terms of community planning, Vida Nueva contrasts starkly
with impoverished neighborhoods throughout Latin America, which
develop haphazardly as families squat on land or buy small lots,
then build homes as their wallets and time allow. Such
neighborhoods either wait years for electricity, water and sewer
services or never get them at all.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no other place in Honduras could either afford or
organize a project like Vida Nueva. Although San Pedro Sula and
nearby towns account for only about 20 percent of Honduras'
population of nearly 6 million people, the region produces
two-thirds of the country's economic output.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Vida Nueva is a work in progress. About a quarter of the
houses planned for the development are under construction. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The much-delayed first stage of the drinking-water system was
finally installed in September. The sewage treatment plant won't be
built for months.
</P>
<P>
   Several thousand people already living on the grounds of the
project have been crowded into shelters for half a year, rather
than the several months originally envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   Samaritan's Purse is working to complete its promised 1,000
houses, Buckman says, with the first 600 to be ready by the end of
the month. But other charities and agencies have not yet started to
build in their sections of the development.
</P>
<P>
   Vida Nueva's houses, though an improvement on what many people
who will live here are accustomed to, are tiny and threadbare.
Measuring only 18 feet by 12 feet, each house consists of a
closet-sized kitchen and bathroom and a single room that will serve
as bedroom and living room.
</P>
<P>
   Plans allow for an additional two rooms to be added to the back
of the houses later, as families can afford them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those aren't houses. They're rabbit hutches,'' says Antonio
Gonzalez, 51, a resident of a flood-ravaged neighborhood in San
Pedro Sula who says he can't imagine living in Vida Nueva with his
nine family members.
</P>
<P>
   The houses line up in monotonous gray rows, their walls
unpainted and their tin roofs exposed to the tropical sun. Each
family will receive a few trees to plant. Each lot has room for a
garden.
</P>
<P>
   Vida Nueva lies 18 miles outside San Pedro Sula, far from the
foreign-owned clothing assembly plants that provide jobs for many
of the people expected to live in the development. Bus rides to and
from the factories cost about a dollar each day, or about a fifth
of a daily wage.
</P>
<P>
   Promoters say they plan to develop an industrial park near the
new development to provide jobs. But only one factory exists there
now, and the once-rapid growth of San Pedro Sula's assembly-plant
sector has stagnated.
</P>
<P>
   People living in the temporary shelters complain that food sold
inside the Vida Nueva compound is more expensive than in the city.
And, they say, life has been boring and far too regimented.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of us moved from the country to the city in order to live
better,'' Horacio Romero, a 48-year-old father of eight, says with
a toothless grin. ``Now they are moving us back to the country
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``They call this new life,'' he says. ``But this doesn't seem
like living to me.''
</P>
<P>
   De Hoyos, the Mexican lawyer charged with instilling new values
in Vida Nueva's residents, says complaints are to be expected. But,
he says, the doubts will evaporate as Vida Nueva takes shape in the
coming months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how this is going to fail,'' de Hoyos says. ``We
have the resources and experience to make it work.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new society we are building.''

   CENTAM-MITCH _ MARCOVIA, Honduras _ Maritza Espinar spent four
terrifying days clinging to the high branches of a tree last year
after Hurricane Mitch flattened her home in a village near here.
When new floods in September sent a tributary of the Choluteca
River once again rising toward the place she lived, she didn't
waste any time evacuating. Such stories are not uncommon around
this poor, mountainous nation of 5 million people. Mitch was the
worst disaster in more than a century, killing some 9,000 people
and leveling or damaging more than 50,000 homes. Most people had
hoped that by now, a year after Mitch blew ashore on Oct. 25, the
storm would be nothing more than a frightful memory. But the recent
floods are evidence that Mitch is still having an impact.

   MITCH-REBUILD _ MARCOVIA, Honduras _ The walls are unadorned
cement blocks, the floor is poured concrete, the roof made from
plain sheets of metal. The kitchen is a lean-to out back with a
small, smoky cooking fire. But Rita Galvez proudly sits inside the
tiny structure, holding her breath. To her, this diminutive house _
the size of a typical two-car American garage _ may as well be a
millionaire's mansion. One year after Hurricane Mitch devastated
Central America, life is getting better for thousands of the killer
storm's victims. Although new flooding has brought more misery to
many of those left homeless by Mitch, a massive rebuilding program
spearheaded by charities worldwide has made significant progress.

   MEXICO-SKEPTICISM _ MEXICO CITY _ Mexicans live in a perpetual

FATHER OF THIRD SUSPECT IN JASPER SLAYING SAYS SON INNOCENT

<P>
   GENEVA, Ohio _ Louis Hezebicks was dreaming of being reunited
with his son, Shawn Berry, whom he last saw as a toddler 20 years
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   He was hoping that Shawn and his older brother would drive
Shawn's battered, gray Ford pickup the 1,270 miles from Texas to
northeastern Ohio for a grand reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Then a network television news report about a terrible racial
crime caught his eye. Three white men had dragged a black man to
death near Jasper, Texas, where his sons lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked up and saw this picture of this gray pickup truck ...
and I knew right then,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, the confirmation of his worst fears came
when his son, Shawn, was identified as one of the three white men
arrested in one of the most vicious racial crimes in modern
history.
</P>
<P>
   The truck he had hoped would bring his sons to him had instead
been used to drag James Byrd Jr. almost three miles down
back-country roads. His decapitated body had been found in front of
a black cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Berry, now 24, goes on trial for capital murder Monday in Jasper
for his role in the June 7, 1998, slaying. Juries have already
convicted his two companions at the time, Bill King, also 24, and
Russell Brewer Jr., 32. Both were sentenced to die. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Berry claims he had no part in the murder and tried to stop the
other two when they began beating Byrd in a forest clearing before
they chained him to the truck. Berry admits, though, that he was
driving in the early morning hours of June 7, 1998, when he stopped
to pick up Byrd, 49, as the older man staggered home drunk from a
party.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime after Berry's arrest, Hezebicks called the Jasper
County Jail and was allowed to talk briefly with his son. ``He
called me Dad,'' Hezebicks said. ``He told me he didn't do it. And
I have to believe him because he's my son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe that anybody who has any part of me in them
could do anything like that,'' he said. ``I feel so bad about the
Byrd family. What a terrible thing for them to go through.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Hezebicks, 43, heads the shipping department of an electronics
company in this blue-collar town about an hour's drive from
Cleveland. He suffers from emphysema and said financial problems
may keep him from making the trip to Jasper to be with his son
during the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to go down there and just walk around and talk to
people, if they'd talk to me,'' he said. ``I'd like to see the Byrd
family and tell them how sorry I am for all of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's parents and sisters have embraced relatives of the other
two defendants during the earlier trials. They have asked for
justice, not retribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to talk to that sheriff down there or somebody and
see if there's any way I could just see my son and hug him,'' he
said. ``I may never get to do that again.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would also like to visit with Shawn's girlfriend,
Christie Marcontell, and the couple's toddler son, Michael Montana.
</P>
<P>
   If Berry is convicted of capital murder, he faces either life in
prison or the death penalty. In either case, his visitors in prison
wouldn't be allowed to touch him. If he gets a life sentence, he
wouldn't be eligible for parole for 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd never see him come out,'' Hezebicks said. ``I won't live
that long.''
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Berry was the second son born to Hezebicks and Kathleen
Berry, high school lovers whose relationship began when he saw her
across the cafeteria in Geneva Junior High School.
</P>
<P>
   She was a couple of years older, hungry for adventure. He would
ride his bicycle, cutting through a trailer park to the street
where she lived with her parents across from her grandparents' mink
farm.
</P>
<P>
   He was barely 17 and still in high school when their first son,
Louis Berry, was born. Hezebicks said he wanted to get married, but
their parents and even a minister suggested they live together
instead, he recalled. He said he worked 48 hours a week at a gas
station while trying to finish high school and take care of his
little family.
</P>
<P>
   By then her &UR;  &LR; parents had moved to Jasper County and Kathie, as
she was known, restlessly moved back and forth between Ohio and
Texas. Eighteen months after Louis, Shawn was born. He had his
mother's green eyes, but in adulthood, his dark hair and slender
build is much like Hezebicks'.
</P>
<P>
   Kathie was a ``free spirit,'' Hezebicks remembered, who was more
interested in having good times than trying to build a family. She
took off to Texas with their sons. On Dec. 12, 1976, she married
Don Hopson in Jasper.
</P>
<P>
   Hezebicks said he even wondered sometimes if he really was
Shawn's father. Then last month he watched an interview of his son
on the CBS-TV program ``60 Minutes II.'' ``There's no doubt now,''
he said. ``We just look too much alike.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathie and Don Hopson were together just two years, long enough
to have a daughter. Hezebicks said he got a phone call from Kathie,
saying she had got a divorce and wanted to come to Ohio but
couldn't make the trip alone with three small children. He flew to
Beaumont, Texas, and drove her and the kids to Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long, however, before he learned that the divorce
wasn't final and that money was still owed on the car she was
driving. Hopson and his family arrived to pick up the baby daughter
and ended up taking the two boys back to Texas as well. Kathie's
parents in Kirbyville got custody of the boys.
</P>
<P>
   That was the last Hezebicks ever saw of Shawn. His mother kept
up with the boys over the years, exchanging letters and pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Don Hopson remained a father figure for Shawn and Louis. They
lived with him and his parents at different times over the years,
even though he and their mom had both married other people by then.
At one time, they lived with Hopson in a house on Huff Creek Road,
near where Byrd was slain. In the ``60 Minutes'' interview, Berry
said he and his dad, meaning Hopson, had lived on that road.
</P>
<P>
   Hopson committed suicide in 1990. By then Shawn was 15 and Louis
17 and they were largely on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials in Jasper say they have no idea where
Berry's mother is.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1991, Kathleen Wright, as she was then known, was
sentenced to seven years in prison after pleading guilty to a
charge of delivery of a small amount of cocaine. Records indicate
that &UR;  &LR; she never went to prison, but was paroled after serving about
three months in county jail.
</P>
<P>
   She was indicted in a similar case in 1993, but records indicate
she was never arrested on that charge.
</P>
<P>
   Hezebicks eventually married, had three daughters, divorced and
remarried. He and his family live in a Civil War-era house near the
center of his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Although he says he at last has the family he always wanted,
Hezebicks says he has always wondered about his sons. ``There was
always this piece of me that was missing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then a couple of years ago his wife, Gina, began an intense
search for the boys on the Internet. She gave Hezebicks phone
numbers to try.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even remember what I found or how I found it,'' she
said. ``I just tried everything I could think of and we started
coming up with some numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Then one night about three years ago, Louis, who had learned of
his father's search, called him.
</P>
<P>
   That phone reunion led to a few visits by Louis Berry. He once
spent several months living with the Hezebicks and even found a job
there.
</P>
<P>
   Louis went back to Texas, but said he planned to return. Perhaps
he would come back with Shawn, and maybe with their girlfriends.
They would make the trip, he said, in Shawn's gray pickup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sure wish they had come up here before all this happened,''
Hezebicks said.
</P>
<P>
   He is convinced his son was in the wrong place at the wrong
time.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors, however, contend that Shawn Berry was a thrill
seeker who eagerly joined in the brutal slaying with his buddies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wish there was some sort of way I could go back and
make this all just not happen,'' Hezebicks said. ``If I could go
down there and chain myself to the back of a pickup truck, I'd
gladly let myself be drug down that road if it could make Mr. Byrd
come back. Nobody deserves what happened to that poor man.''
</P>
<P>
   If his son is acquitted or somehow eventually released from
prison, Hezebicks said he would urge him to move to Ohio, change
his name and start a new life.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had my way, their names would have always been
Hezebicks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to just walk around down there in Jasper and talk to
people and ask them if they know my son and what they think about
him,'' he said. ``I'd like to know if they think he's somebody who
can do something like that.''

VIKINGS MAY CURE WHAT AILS THE 49ERS OFFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JEFFRI CHADIHA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ Jeff Garcia sat at his locker earlier this
week, picking at a light lunch and awaiting the start of another
practice. He never saw San Francisco 49ers general manager Bill
Walsh coming until Walsh was nearly on top of him.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh took a seat on the bench and spoke to the 49ers
quarterback in a soothing tone, looking every bit like a learned
father offering advice to a son who had hit hard times.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wanted to be a starting NFL quarterback,'' Walsh said.
``Well, now you are one.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowering his voice, Walsh spoke to Garcia for the next few
minutes. Only those two will ever know the rest of that
conversation, but this much is true: Walsh couldn't have picked a
better time to give Garcia a lift.
</P>
<P>
   Since a masterful debut in a win over the Tennessee Titans on
Oct. 3, Garcia's world has shifted along with the rest of the
49ers. In the wake of a 42-20 dismantling at St. Louis and a 31-29
disappointment against Carolina, the 49ers are searching for
answers to all kinds of questions, including how to jump-start
their offense. After all, the defense has scored more touchdowns
than the offense in the last two weeks (three to two).
</P>
<P>
   ``We've struggled all year to put the ball in the end zone,''
Garcia said. ``We certainly haven't done it as much as we would've
liked. But a lot of this falls on my shoulders, with my being the
quarterback. Whether it's making a throw or the right read, I have
to get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a lot of weight for a backup quarterback to take on,
especially one who has been asked to fill in for a Hall-of-Fame
player like Steve Young. But this is Garcia's way. No doubt, that
willingness to take on a burden is one that made Walsh want to sign
the guy in the first place. But Garcia isn't solely responsible for
what's been troubling the 49ers offense of late.
</P>
<P>
   This team's problems include poor pass protection, an
inconsistent running game, dropped passes, turnovers and a horrid
third-down conversion rate (30.4 percent). These same issues are
largely to blame for Young's current status as a quarterback on the
verge of retirement. The past two weeks have been no different.
</P>
<P>
   Both the St. Louis Rams and the Carolina Panthers blitzed Garcia
heavily while taking advantage of double-digit leads. Against
Carolina, Garcia rarely had enough time to even look downfield
before finding himself in the midst of heavy pressure. He completed
only 22 of 45 passes in that game, leading the team to only one
offensive touchdown. Such has been the life of 49ers quarterbacks
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of teams have been saying, `Let's blitz the 49ers,'''
wide receiver Jerry Rice said. ``Until we prove we can get the job
done against the blitz, teams will continue to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   There might be a glimmer of hope for the 49ers this week. With
the Minnesota Vikings next on the schedule, the offense will meet
what they face in practice every week _ one of the league's most
vulnerable defenses. The Vikings rank 29th in the league in total
yards allowed (362.8 per game) and 30th in pass defense (260 yards
per game). In fact, those numbers are even worse than those
surrendered by the 49ers' defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings major weakness _ and the 49ers should empathize _ is
at cornerback. Neither Kenny Wright nor Ramos McDonald has proved
to be adequate replacements for the departed Corey Fuller at left
cornerback, while right cornerback Jimmy Hitchcock is an average
player. Still, the 49ers aren't so willing to consider the Vikings
defense as porous as those numbers suggest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the yardage they have allowed has come between the
20-yard lines,'' 49ers offensive coordinator Marty Mornhinweg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The statistics don't look great but on the field it doesn't
look that bad. They're doing a good job of stopping teams in the
red zone.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings are allowing 20 points per game but Mornhinweg is
being respectful. If there is a team the 49ers will face in the
near future that could cure their offensive woes, it is Minnesota.
And the 49ers, though loathe to admit this, realize they can
capitalize on the Vikings' problems. In fact, Garcia understands
that this team must do that if it wants to steer this season in a
more positive direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone believes in this system and knows that we can
put up some points,'' Garcia said. ``We've had little mistakes that
have turned into big problems for us. We need to be better focused
and stop killing ourselves. If we can eliminate some of those
things, we'll have more success.''

 THIS ELECTION LOOKS LIKE `NONE OF THE ABOVE'
 (For use by New York Times News Service cients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ ``It looks like it's going to be a `None of the
above' election,'' said a friend, who advocates such a choice on
every ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Think of how the country would look if we had such a choice.
</P>
<P>
   No one in the White House, no one in the governor's office, no
one as mayor, no one as district attorney and no one on the Board
of Supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   That's pretty much the way it is now, but we'd make it official,
and not have to waste all that money in salaries and contracts for
the nobody friends of all the nobodies in office.
</P>
<P>
   I got to thinking. This is San Francisco. We've got all kinds of
pranksters who run around in nuns' habits. Why doesn't one of them
run as Nun of the Above?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe someone should just run around in a mayor's costume.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is a great town, despite the idiots who run it. Every once
in a while there's a glimmer of passion and flesh that lets you
know this is still San Francisco and not Yuptown USA.

<P>
   Anti-sweatshop demonstrators stripped naked and invaded the
grand opening of the new Old Navy store on Market Street. And the
only bargain hunters who looked up were those shocked to see people
without the words ``Old Navy'' on them.
</P>
<P>
   Does Old Navy sell anything that doesn't have the words ``Old
Navy'' on it?
</P>
<P>
   What do old Navy guys think of all those sweat shirts? Should I
get one for my father-in-law, the retired Navy captain?
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the only photograph we got from Old Navy was of
the backs of some demonstrators' heads.
</P>
<P>
   We weren't buttless because we were gutless, but because the
demonstrators were much faster than those naked guys we always
shoot from behind in the Bay to Breakers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrations keep right on coming. At noon on Nov. 1, the
day before the election, there will be a ``Let them eat cake''
demonstration in front of City Hall, complete with a guillotining
of the effigies of the three major candidates for mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, according to someone who calls himself Pierre, Le
Marquis du Gateau, cake will be served to the homeless by
``aristocrats'' in elaborate 18th century French dress.
</P>
<P>
   Nudity is optional, except for the Emperor.

   A popular local band called Buddhakowski (whose name is a nice
tribute to one of our favorite religious figures and one of our
favorite Beat curmudgeons) has donated the use of a Dylanesque song
called ``Great Town'' to Tom Ammiano's write-in campaign for mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great town, except for the idiots who run it,'' go the
lyrics written by Matt Langlois. ``It's a great town if you can
afford the price.''
</P>
<P>
   The song rips into lofts, the demise of nightclubs South of
Market and our mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're definitely doing whatever we can do to get behind
Ammiano's campaign,'' says lead singer Philip Golden, who goes by
Philip Mars. ``Musicians are leaving in droves because they can't
afford to live here.''
</P>
<P>
   His favorite lyric from ``Great Town'' is: ``If you think that
something's wrong, there are the words of some old song about the
colors that have gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps worst of all, people are going away without leaving
their hearts here.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Muni took delivery of some new buses painted shocking white, and
then started painting old buses white. What's the story? Are these
meant to be canvases for graffiti artists or for advertisers? Or is
Muni looking for a new, pristine image?
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, it takes some guts to send such white buses
into such dirty streets. And now when three buses are running in a
row, it looks like a school of Moby Dicks to us Ahabs who have been
waiting so long for them.
</P>
<P>
   Buses as white as white Rolls-Royces. I think I know who's
behind this.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparent Lesbianism in Beetle Actually May Be Ruse to Lure
Males, Scientists Say.''
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like a plot from a sitcom made by Pixar, but
scientists really are saying that some female beetles of the
species Diaprepes abbreviatus fake mating to attract a male.
</P>
<P>
   Typical male cockroaches, these guys. It seems their sight is
often bad, so the only way they can tell males from females is that
females are slightly larger. Therefore two females get on top of
each other to look bigger, and the dumb males hop right on.
</P>
<P>
   I could make a lot of dumb comments right now, but I can think
of a couple of females who'll bug me if I say anything.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Boot-up 'n' sniff? ``Look who's teaching your computer to
smell,'' says the cover of the November Wired magazine. The article
is about a Bay Area company with the name of DigiScents (no
kidding) that plans to take Smell-O-Vision to new heights via
computer.
</P>
<P>
   So far DigiScents can generate the smell of wood smoke, orange
peels and bananas. Hey, I can do that when I smoke ribs in the back
yard out near the garbage can.
</P>
<P>
   Our olfactory sense does seem to be in decline, but the fact is,
Americans don't really like to smell things. Besides, the computer
I'm working on right now already stinks.

   SCHENECTADY, N.Y. _ He was wearing the black suit, the
double-breasted one. Mayor Al always wears the black,
double-breasted suit when he gets serious about something.
</P>
<P>
   Al Jurczynski is the Republican mayor of Schenectady. He's a
burly, bespectacled guy in his early 40s who used to operate a
furniture store. Mayor Al is roughly the size of a Lincoln Town
Car. The black suit makes him look a bit more like a statesman and
a bit less like a nose guard for the Jets _ a job in which he would
sustain fewer bruises, actually, than the rotten job he has now.
</P>
<P>
   This was the other night, at the Ramada on Nott Street. About
400 people were crowded into a hotel ballroom for Mayor Al's debate
with his opponent. That's Gary McCarthy, Schenectady's city council
president.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Al is the incumbent, which is to his advantage. Gary
McCarthy is a Democrat, which is to his advantage. The Democrats
hold a slight enrollment edge in Schenectady. All seven city
council members are Democrats.

   Mayor Al and Gary McCarthy do not enjoy a warm relationship.
Mayor Al is earnest, affable and well-intentioned. Gary McCarthy is
smart, well-intentioned and has a tongue you could use to trim a

complained that Mayor Al suffers from an unfortunate penchant for

</P>
<P>
   Each nasty remark produced a round of spirited applause. That's
because each candidate had the good sense to stack the crowd with
supporters. Besides, everybody loves it when politicians complain
about one another's personal failings. Just look at how popular
professional wrestling is these days.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the exterior of what might seem like just another local
political campaign, though, lurked the harsh reality that this is
not just another exercise in the fun and games of the democratic
process.
</P>
<P>
   Schenectady, population 65,000, is a city in dire trouble. The
issue of which of these candidates is elected mayor on Nov. 2 is
far less crucial than the issue of what this state _ and this
country, for this matter _ plans to to do about these old,
industrial cities whose tax base is eroding, whose neighborhoods
are crumbling and whose residents are aging at a far faster rate
than the population of the nation as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   In Schenectady, jobs have evaporated like mist on a windshield
in the morning sun. General Electric, the city's economic mainstay
for nearly a century, has sent jobs south and west, until a plant
that once employed nearly 40,000 now employs one-tenth that number
and shows every sign of abandoning its birthplace at the first
convenient opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so you're the mayor. What do you do about it? What do you do
about a tax base that's fading, about a city where the sale price
of the average house has slipped from $70,000 four years ago to
closer to $60,000 today? What do you do about continuing to provide
people who live in this town with adequate fire protection,
adequate police protection, adequate schools?
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Al had his ideas. So did Gary McCarthy. The depressing
truth, though, is that this same sad drama is being acted out year
after year in old, industrial cities across the Northeast and the
Midwest _ in Utica, in Buffalo, in Sandusky, Ohio, in Flint, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   The world has changed. Political boundaries once created to
conform with economic boundaries bear no relationship to today's
economic realities. Local politicians do what they can. The sad
truth, though, is that it matters little which local politician
ends up at the ship's helm.
</P>
<P>
   Without outside help, the ship continues to sink.
</P>

CLINTON'S LEAD ON FOREIGN DEBT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Crushed by debt, extremely poor countries won support Monday
from President Clinton, who wisely vetoed a foreign operations
budget that contained no money for international debt relief. ``We
can't not fulfill our responsibilities to the rest of the world,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The need is glaring. Zambia, for example, spends $17 per person
on health each year but $30 per person to service its $6.6 billion
debt. In other countries, debt drains money from education,
development, and social services.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS increases the financial devastation. In Africa the disease
has not only killed millions but swamped health systems and created
millions of orphans. Callisto Madavo, a vice president of the World
Bank, has said that ``HIV is now the single greatest threat to
future economic development in Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton proposed to ease that burden, following up on a promise
of faster, broader debt relief made at a June meeting of the Group
of Seven leading industrial nations in Cologne. Congress sent
Clinton a foreign aid budget earlier this month that omitted the $1
billion debt forgiveness program he had announced. What the
president needs now is congressional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the poor nations, the debt crisis has made
unexpected allies. Representatives Spencer Bachus, an Alabama
Republican, and Maxine Waters, a California Democrat, agree on debt
relief as chairman and ranking member, respectively, of the House
subcommittee on domestic and international monetary policy. They
join Iowa Republican Jim Leach and Democrat Barney Frank of
Massachusetts as sponsors of a separate bill that calls on the
president to ``cancel all amounts owed to the United States . . .
by heavily indebted poor countries.''
</P>
<P>
   The essential caveat is that relief should be given only to
countries willing to invest in human needs such as education,
poverty relief, and social services. Debt relief is also an
opportunity to steer countries toward more sustainable development
and better economic management.

ON LANGUAGE: STAKE IN THE GROUND 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release on Sunday, Oct. 24.) 
(EDS: Items in boldface should be set in italics.) 
(th) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stiffen those linguistic sinews.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it is important to  &UR; put &LR;   &UR; a &LR;   &UR; stake &LR;   &UR; in &LR;   &UR; the &LR; 
 &UR; ground &LR; ,'' said Gov. George W. Bush, ``and to say, `Enough is
enough,' when it comes to trying to dig up people's backgrounds in
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight years before, a Democratic candidate, Paul Tsongas, used
the same metaphor of determination in a Des Moines speech: ``The
Iowa caucuses are an integral part of any sense of American
politics, and I intend to  &UR; put &LR;   &UR; my &LR;   &UR; stake in &LR;   &UR; the &LR;   &UR; ground &LR; 
here.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a metaphor of determination, with a Western flavor. It
is rooted in, or has a stake firmly planted in, the laying of a
claim to a piece of territory, owned by nobody, for mining or farm
use. The rush for land after the Civil War popularized the phrase
(along with  &UR; doing &LR;   &UR; a &LR;   &UR; land-office &LR;   &UR; business &LR; ). The stakes
driven in the ground were the markers used to post the boundaries
of a homestead; this led to another phrase,  &UR; to &LR;   &UR; pull &LR;   &UR; up &LR; 
 &UR; stakes &LR; , which means ``to move on'' to greener pastures.
</P>
<P>
   George Dubyuh's use of  &UR; stake &LR;   &UR; in &LR;   &UR; the &LR;   &UR; ground &LR;  immediately
called to mind a similar trope called up by his father, President
Bush, after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990: ``A  &UR; line &LR;   &UR; has &LR; 
 &UR; been &LR;   &UR; drawn &LR;   &UR; in &LR;   &UR; the &LR;   &UR; sand &LR; .'' This expression may have
stemmed from the circle drawn in the sand around the Syrian King
Antiochus Epiphanes in 168 B.C. by the Roman envoy Popilius Laenas,
who ordered the king to agree to withdraw his forces from
Alexandria before he could step out of the circle.
</P>
<P>
   It is very unlikely that President Bush had this episode in
mind. Despite the elder Bush's passive construction, the phrase
evoked the Alamo legend, in which William Barret Travis, besieged
by a Mexican army, used his sword to draw a line in the ground (or
sand), saying, ``Those prepared to die for freedom's cause, come
across to me.'' One hundred eighty-nine did, and died. The
president's son, George W., in a fund-raising letter opposing Ann
Richards' election as governor of Texas in 1990, wrote, ``When Col.
Travis drew the  &UR; line &LR;   &UR; in &LR;   &UR; the &LR;   &UR; sand &LR;  at the Alamo, he
discovered immediately who had the courage to stand and fight for
the Texas Republic.'' Three weeks later, President Bush used that
metaphor challenging Iraq's Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   As a new political campaign approaches, metaphors of intestinal
fortitude, or gutsiness _ cool, courageous determination _ will be
at a premium. Not all are suitable in making the antiflinching
point; for example,  &UR; stick &LR;   &UR; to &LR;   &UR; your guns &LR; , first used in 1881 as
a variant of  &UR; stand &LR;   &UR; to &LR;   &UR; your &LR;   &UR; guns &LR; , might backfire on a
proponent of gun control.  &UR; Stand &LR;   &UR; your &LR;   &UR; ground &LR; , however, has a
stalwart image, especially because it was extended beyond military
use in ``On Liberty'' by John Stuart Mill in 1859: ``It is not easy
to see how it (individuality) can  &UR; stand &LR;   &UR; its &LR;   &UR; ground &LR; .'' (A
similar construction, the 17th-century  &UR; stand &LR;   &UR; to &LR;   &UR; one's
pan-pudding &LR; , never caught on in America and is unlikely to be
recommended by political debate consultants.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Hold &LR;   &UR; the &LR;   &UR; line &LR; , however, has a nice connotation of military
firmness with an overlay of college-football bravado. It is the
same symbolic line as that  &UR; drawn &LR;   &UR; in &LR;   &UR; the &LR;   &UR; sand &LR; , as if between
 &UR; two &LR;   &UR; stakes &LR;   &UR; in &LR;   &UR; the &LR;   &UR; ground &LR; . The related  &UR; hold &LR;   &UR; the &LR;   &UR; fort &LR; 
suggests that someone else act with fortitude until aid arrives; it
is derived from a message that Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman of the
Union Army sent to the garrison at Allatoona, Ga., in 1864:
`` &UR; Hold &LR;   &UR; the &LR;   &UR; fort &LR; , for I am coming.'' They then  &UR; drew &LR;   &UR; a &LR; 
 &UR; line &LR;   &UR; in &LR;   &UR; the sand &LR; ,  &UR; put &LR;   &UR; their &LR;   &UR; stakes &LR;   &UR; in &LR;   &UR; the &LR;   &UR; ground &LR; 
and  &UR; stood &LR;   &UR; to &LR;   &UR; their &LR;   &UR; pan-pudding &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   The opposite of all the above is  &UR; to &LR;   &UR; shift &LR;   &UR; one's &LR;   &UR; ground &LR; ,
sometimes a necessary maneuver but inviting the derogation
 &UR; shifty &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   NUTRACEUTICALS
</P>
<P>
   A spelling controversy is about to explode about the word that
means ``a food or part of a food that has a medical or health
benefit, including the prevention and treatment of disease.'' Plain
bread supplemented with calcium, vitamin D, folate, dietary fiber
and a shot of St. Johnswort or whatever becomes a  &UR; nutraceutical &LR; ,
unless you prefer to spell it  &UR; nutriceutical &LR; , with an  &UR; i &LR; , as in
 &UR; nutrition &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   I checked it out with the coiner, Dr. Stephen L. DeFelice, now
the head of the Foundation for Innovation in Medicine. His
spokesman explained that the 1989 coinage is spelled  &UR; nutra &LR; , with
an  &UR; a &LR; , on the analogy of  &UR; pharmaceutical &LR; , with its Greek root
 &UR; pharmak &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Reached directly, however, DeFelice said, ``To tell you the
truth, I was drinking grappa in Rome one day and  &UR; nutra &LR;  sounded
better than  &UR; nutri &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   That asserts ``coiner's privilege,'' and the enhanced, enriched,
jazzed-up food _ as both noun and adjective _ is spelled
 &UR; nutraceutical &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   PHLOGGING IT
</P>
<P>
   ``The real writer is one/who really writes,'' writes the poet
Marge Piercy. ``Talent/is an invention like phlogiston/after the
fact of fire.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Fooling With Words: A Celebration of Poets and Their
Craft,'' the TV documentarian Bill Moyers, quoting this poem, asked
the author about the meaning of the unfamiliar word  &UR; phlogiston &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   `` &UR; Phlogiston &LR;  was a pre-19th-century explanation for why things
burned,'' Piercy replied. ``People said things burned because they
contained  &UR; phlogiston &LR; . It always struck me as the perfect example
of a false explanation.''
</P>
<P>
   For two decades I have awaited someone else's use of the word
that was rendered obsolete by the discovery of the properties of
oxygen. The unforgettable S.J. Perelman, in sending me his hefty
collection of hilarious works that he scorned to title ``The Best
of'' _ he chose ``The Most of S.J. Perelman'' _ inscribed it with
his good wishes ``together with a small jar of  &UR; Antiphlogiston &LR;  to
rub on his deltoids should he read this compendium in bed.''

SCHEDULE WORKS AGAINST VIRGINIA TECH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The surge by Virginia Tech in the polls has been a boost for the
Big East, which has been battered by critics for years. But can the
Hokies remain undefeated and make the quantum leap into the Bowl
Championship Series title game in the Sugar Bowl Jan. 4?
</P>
<P>
   The answers: yes and maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Tech's schedule is favorable the rest of the way. The Hokies
have a week off before playing back-to-back road games at
Pittsburgh and West Virginia. Both are winnable. Then comes a
gut-check game at home against Miami, a team the Hokies have
dominated recently, winning the last four meetings.
</P>
<P>
   After that they play at Temple and are home against Boston
College.
</P>
<P>
   An 11-0 record looks not only possible, but probable.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the tough part. Suppose Florida defeats archrival
Florida State (the game is in Gainesville) and Alabama in the
Southeastern Conference championship game. The Gators would be
11-1, with wins over Tennessee and Florida State, both top 5 teams.
</P>
<P>
   Tech does not have anything close to those wins on its schedule
and two of its victories are over Division 1-AA James Madison and
lightly-regarded Alabama-Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   The Gators, or any other once-beaten team with a tougher
schedule, could jump over Tech into the championship game.
</P>
<P>
   What we have here is Kansas State revisited: A good team that
people are not willing to call a great team because of a soft
nonconference schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Big East commissioner Mike Tranghese recognizes the problem.
``Everyone knew what the rules were going into it,'' said
Tranghese, referring to the BCS guidelines that factor in strength
of schedule. ``I told (BCS chairman) Roy Kramer that he wasn't
going to hear a squawk from me about the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Tranghese has told the schools in his conference that they must
play good teams.
</P>
<P>
   Tech has done that to some extent. Clemson and Virginia are
legitimate nonconference opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Any Division 1-AA team is not legitimate and Alabama-Birmingham
has only a fledgling Division 1-A program.
</P>
<P>
   Things could work out for Tech. Any of the teams above them
could lose and the Hokies could be the lone unbeaten team in the
country, which would almost guarantee a Sugar Bowl berth.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Hokies should end up outside the gates, there should
be no grumbling about the system from people in Blacksburg.
</P>
<P>
   They knew the rules and chose the easier path.
</P>
<P>
   The feeling here is that things will sort themselves out and if
Virginia Tech is unbeaten, it will go to New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   But that is hardly a lock, which is too bad because they can
match up with anybody.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BC bowl picture
</P>
<P>
   Here's the deal with Boston College and its bowl hopes. The
first order of business is to get one more win, which will make the
Eagles eligible for a bowl. A home game against West Virginia Nov.
13 looks like their best shot.
</P>
<P>
   If they beat the Mountaineers they likely will have two options.
Grab a spot in the Motor City Bowl in Pontiac, Mich., against
probable Mid-American Conference champion Marshall, or take a spot
in one of the bowl games in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   But the Eagles need some help and luck. Two of the bowl slots in
Hawaii are committed to Pacific-10 teams. The resurgent University
of Hawaii squad could take another slot. If the Rainbows are
bowl-eligible, they will get a bid because of the ticket-sale
factor. And the Atlantic Coast Conference could become a factor
since a team like Clemson, which has a traditionally strong
following on the road, might be more attractive than BC.
</P>
<P>
   The other variable is Notre Dame. The Big East has commitments
from four bowls: a BCS bowl, the Gator, the Insight.com, and the
Music City.
</P>
<P>
   It looks like Virginia Tech is the BCS team; Miami and Syracuse
will battle for the Gator, with the loser in the Insight.com; and
West Virginia likely to go to the Music City Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   But Notre Dame has an arrangement with the Big East that it can
grab any of those bowl slots if eligible. The Gator or Insight.com
would grab the Irish in a heartbeat, which would squeeze a team
like West Virginia or BC out of a slot.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Southern exposure
</P>
<P>
   One of the sleeper teams this season has been Southern
Mississippi, which shouldn't surprise those who know how good a job
coach Jeff Bower has done. Southern Miss, , which is one of three
ranked teams from the state of Mississippi, enters Saturday's game
against Cincinnati with a 4-2 mark (3-0 in Conference USA). The
Golden Eagles are a perennial power in Conference USA (winning
titles in 1996 and '97, and finishing second in '98) and have been
national spoilers as well, particularly against Southeastern
Conference teams such as Alabama, which the Golden Eagles play next
week. Over the last four seasons, the Golden Eagles have compiled
the second-best conference record (18-2) of any team in Division
1-A, trailing only Florida State's (28-1) record in the ACC . . .
Usually one of the signs of a good team is a plus figure in
turnover ratio. Not so Virginia Tech. The Hokies have committed 13
turnovers and forced 13 . . . Those of you looking for a Miami
blowout of BC Saturday at Alumni Stadium should consider these last
four scores against the Eagles at Alumni Stadium: 19-14 in 1991,
23-7 in '93, 17-14 in '95, and 45-44 (2 OT) in '97.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Family affair
</P>
<P>
   Saturday is family reunion day at Clemson. No. 1 Florida State
is in Death Valley but that's only a minor attraction of the
weekend. It will be Florida State's Bobby Bowden coaching against
his son Tommy for the first time, and a Florida State win would
mark the 300th of the senior Bowden's career . . . Saturday's games
should clear up the Heisman picture quite a bit. Purdue quarterback
Drew Brees, who has moved up several notches after his
five-touchdown performance against Michigan State last week, will
face Penn State's athletic defense. A big game against the Nittany
Lions could move Brees to the top. Alabama running back Shaun
Alexander will be tested against Tennessee's defense Saturday. A
Tide win and a strong effort by Alexander will move him among the
leaders. The other leading contender is Georgia Tech QB Joe
Hamilton, who has been spectacularly steady all season . . . Latest
coach on the hot seat is LSU's Gerry DiNardo, whose 2-4 Tigers are
again struggling. ``Gerry DiNardo is our coach and will continue to
be our coach,'' said LSU chancellor Mark Emmert. ``I expect him to
be our coach until the end of the season. We're going to play out
the rest of our schedule. It's obvious that we need improvement.''
Sounds like a solid vote of confidence to me . . . Speaking of
votes of confidence, Rutgers announced Thursday it will stick with
Terry Shea for one more year. The question is, why? The Scarlet
Knights are winless and could finish 0-11. There has been no sign
of progress in the program in Shea's four years. Here's the Rutgers
statistic of the week: The Scarlet Knights are the only team (of
114) in Division 1-A not to have an interception this season.

THE TEAM PEOPLE LOVE TO HATE DESERVES SOME RESPECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY RATTO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The New York Yankees and Atlanta Braves have been told
that this World Series will bestow upon the winner the profoundly
mythical title of Team Of The '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, their confusion. They thought they were just playing for
the here and now.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, players have always distrusted mythical titles, let
alone mythical titles given by sportswriters. Myth has nothing to
do with the nasty 91-mph slider on the black with men on second and
third and two outs in the bottom of the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   That, they understand. History, they are determined to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   Especially the Braves. History has not been nearly as kind to
the Braves as it should have been, based on _ if nothing else _ the
widely held belief that America is bored e Braves.
</P>
<P>
   They win too often, but they don't win enough. They have the
same manager and the same pitchers and the same tedious
chant-and-chop, and they're just, well, the same old Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, they're not, but why let the details get in the way
of the greater truth? Yes, Ted Turner is still about sneaking
late-inning naps, and general manager John Schuerholz is walking
around seeming slightly above it all.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Bobby Cox still has the eternally pained look and crab
walk of a man who has played and managed a very long time, and
pitching coach Leo Mazzone still rocks back and forth whether his
pitcher is throwing a three-hitter or has just loaded the bases.
</P>
<P>
   And of course there is that pitching staff. Greg Maddux, Tom
Glavine, John Smoltz, and in the role of Steve Avery and Denny
Neagle, Kevin Millwood. They are as omnipresent as 20/20, and in
every significant way explain the pitchers' art in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and they win all the time. Except for those four pesky World
Series failures, their place in history would be platinum on gold.
As it is, they are as we stand here now, the Brooklyn Dodgers of
the '50s back from the land of shadows.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, there are a few structural differences, of course.
</P>
<P>
   There is no equivalent for Jackie Robinson for a number of
salient reasons, Pee Wee Reese was better than the Atlanta
shortstops of the era, and Chipper Jones is a serious improvement
on Billy Cox, but by and large around the diamond, those Dodgers
are these Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Why, if America could have embraced these Braves as it has those
Dodgers, you'd have a near dead-on four-point match.
</P>
<P>
   Such is not the case, of course. America in the '40s and '50s
didn't get tired of the Dodgers, but more charmed. Losing the
Series in 1947, then 1949, then 1952, then 1953, every time to the
Yankees, made them the obvious antidote to Yankee dominance of the
day. Breaking the color line had won the Dodgers a place in
baseball history, to be sure, but once done, the Dodgers took on
the persona of the game loser, the eternal silver medalist, the
conscience and identity of a borough as big as most American
cities. The Dodgers were inflated out of all proportion to their
baseball, and when they won the '55 Series, the heavens all but
opened for them all.
</P>
<P>
   Which is fine. That's what history is for, after all. What
doesn't translate, though, is how, by doing essentially the same
things the same way and getting the same results, the Braves
haven't won a greater share of the nation's heart.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, though, the Braves have done no such thing. They didn't
have an oppressive Yankee myth off which to play, but had been
beaten by the Minnesota Twins, Toronto Blue Jays and a '96 Yankee
team that had been so long without a Series appearance that the
Braves seemed the oppressors. Ever their '95 title came over the
Cleveland Long Suffering Indians.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody sees the Braves as long-suffering. They see them as
an almost tedious perennial of the decade, to the point of having
rooted for the Mets to catch and beat them in the NLCS.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have been deemed by the great amorphous mass to be,
well, unhuggable, and as is often the case, the loss is the
nation's.
</P>
<P>
   There is, though, one way out of this grinding dilemma for the
Braves, and it is not an easy road. They must beat the Yankees in
the Series. Not come close, not force a seventh game, not even
outdo their thrilling performances against the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   They have to win.
</P>
<P>
   They have to win because it is their only way of avoiding the
cavalier dismissal of the nation as the Team That Didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Cruel? Yeah, maybe. Unfair? You betcha. But those are the facts.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves couldn't be long-suffering because America wasn't
interested in it, and they couldn't be the Brooklyn Dodgers because
myths only work once.
</P>
<P>
   They can, however, be the last team standing this century, and
that counts for something in the long run, doesn't it?

SOCIOLOGY'S PATHFINDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You never know what you ultimately think until you write it
down. And his remarkable talents for thinking and then writing down
are what drew a full house of academics and intellectuals _ they
are not always the same people, after all _ to an elegant
amphitheater in Cambridge, Mass., Wednesday in honor of a grand old
man of American intellectual life, David Riesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lonely Crowd'' is but one of the texts which he
co-authored in a long lifetime of hammering together the tenets and
tendencies of the social science that came to be known as
sociology. Now 90 and in a wheelchair, the kindly old gent was
feted by a galaxy of colleagues, old students, and friends.
</P>
<P>
   Not even a cold rain at dusk prevented the assembly of a
standing-room only crowd at the American Academy of Arts and
Sciences for three assessments of his career. Riesman sat patiently
through a two-hour program in which he heard his work linked to
that of Alexis de Tocqueville, the pioneering Frenchman whose
writings in the 1830s alerted the Old World to the brawny,
boisterous New World spawned on the American continent.
</P>
<P>
   Telling Americans who we are and why we are that way was the
work of a long lifetime for Riesman, who became Harvard's Henry
Ford II professor in 1958 and retired 19 years ago. His seminal
work was ``The Lonely Crowd,'' which he coauthored with professor
Nathan Glazer and the late Reuel Denney.
</P>
<P>
   Nate Glazer gave the principal speech Wednesday and generously
credited Riesman with being the guiding force of that book,
described in the program as ``a study of changing American society
and character . . . the most widely noted and most influential
sociological work on American society of the past century.'' With
that work, Riesman became the Babe Ruth of sociology.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you never read it, you were taught or informed or
influenced in some manner or fashion by someone who had. It was the
book that as much as any other explained Americans to themselves.
That book ``was not afraid to tackle the largest questions,'' said
Glazer, of who we were, and how we became that way. ``It
established itself by readers saying: `How true!' '' It also
established the sidelines and goal posts of sociology, a social
science whose place in the ladder of academic prestige was the
subject of many wry asides and sardonic comparisons in the lectures
by Glazer and professors Daniel Bell and Christopher Jencks.
</P>
<P>
   Bell asserted that the field has become ``more stilted and
stunted'' since Riesman's heyday, that ``pop psychology'' gave way
to ``plop psychology.'' Jencks suggested that faculties
reinvigorate their social science faculties ``by hiring fewer
people with degrees in sociology.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Riesman's gentle humanity and ``generosity of mind and
time'' that Glazer cited, with a lot of gray heads from Harvard,
MIT, and further campuses nodding assent. Riesman melded the
charts, statistics, and dry bones of academic studies with lively
insights from hands-on studies of real people and telling
observations from popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   Riesman was a sort of Christopher Columbus of the field, sending
hundreds of students and teaching assistants forth with the
confidence and skills gained under his tutelage, under the general
admonition to study your fellow humans, analyze your data, draw
inferences and conclusions, and contribute to the literature of
scholarship. Or journalism.
</P>
<P>
   Jencks, noting how he, Glazer, and Bell all started careers in
opinion journalism, offered a cheeky aside that sociology, in the
end, ``is just slow journalism,'' which drew an uncomfortable
chortle from some. Glazer drew parallels from the fact that Riesman
and de Tocqueville were both initially trained as lawyers, not
historians or social scientists. By being flexible, receptive, and
ultimately artistic in his weaving together of themes and
conclusions, all three agreed, Riesman became a pathfinder.
</P>
<P>
   His rule of thumb, said Bell, was: ``Go out and observe. Be
mindful of history.'' And Bell told a joke about a student
badgering his rabbi for guidance on distilling judgments from
experience: ``Rabbi, how do you have good judgment?'' Rabbi: ``By
having bad experiences.''
</P>
<P>
   You could not become a college president or think seriously
about American education without encountering Riesman's thoughtful,
rigorous, and empathetic canvases of the forces shaping the
immigrant land that turned into the American colossus. His genial
and collaborative style drew hundreds of acolytes into his orbit.
His division of Americans between ``inner-directed'' and
``other-directed'' was brilliant. The former marched to their own
drummers despite the conformist, consumerist pressure of the '50s.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the other-directed people should discover how much needless
work they do, discover that their own thoughts and their own lives
are quite as interesting as other people's, that indeed, they no
more assuage their loneliness in a crowd of peers than one can
assuage one's thirst by drinking sea water, then we might expect
them to become more attentive to their own feelings and
aspirations.'' De Tocqueville's great idea was to explain the
American experiment in equality to the world, Riesman's to explain
to Americans what we did with all of that.

TOBACCO'S WEB OF DECEIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Step right up, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls! Click on to
www.philipmorris.com and see death-defying feats of corporate
communications! See the Marlboro Man eat fire! See Virginia Slims
dangle from the Trapeze of Truth! See Benson stop Hedging!
</P>
<P>
   Witness what no man, woman, or child has ever seen under the Big
Top of Big Tobacco! See our Web page, where we tell you how you are
killing yourselves with our cigarettes!
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris is playing us all for Bozos. Last week the
cigarette maker unveiled a new Web page that, after decades of
denials and lies, admitted that the company's product might cause a
few problems for consumers, like, um, cancer. Given the denials and
lies, David Kessler, the former head of the Food and Drug
Administration who bludgeoned the tobacco industry at every chance,
called Philip Morris's move a ``profound change.''
</P>
<P>
   Kessler is right to the degree that these ``confessions'' may
make cigarettes easier to regulate. But how profound a change this
is for the rest of us depends on how one views the motives of the
ring . . . er, smoke-ring master.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from curious reporters and antismoking advocates who will
get chuckles from this Web site, it is difficult to imagine who
else would actually use it. It is hard to see a chain smoker buying
a discount pack at the gas station and rushing to the Internet to
read: ``There is an overwhelming medical and scientific consensus
that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease,
emphysema, and other serious diseases in smokers.''
</P>
<P>
   It is just as unlikely that underage smokers are going to bum a
Marlboro off a buddy at the corner store, then go home to stare at
a computer screen that says, ``Click here for information about
Philip Morris USA's Youth Smoking Program department.''
</P>
<P>
   The site might have minor worth for sly parents who tell teenage
smokers, ``Why don't you look at Philip Morris's Web page and see
what they're saying about their own cigarettes?'' But most
health-conscious people do not need Philip Morris to hot link them
to the surgeon general's report, the World Health Organization, or
the American Cancer Society.
</P>
<P>
   As for quitting, it is nearly impossible to picture addicts
throwing themselves on the mercy of Philip Morris to read such
patronizing hypocrisy as: ``For those smokers who want to quit but
are having difficulty, there are many programs and products
marketed as being helpful, including group classes, hypnosis,
nicotine replacement therapies, and smoking deterrents. . . . We
encourage you to investigate the wide selection of options that are
available and see if there are any that seem right for you.''
</P>
<P>
   That is like walking up to your local heroin dealer and
expecting him to ``encourage'' you to head straight for the local
methadone clinic. Or entering a gun shop and asking for the phone
number to Handgun Control. There is only one reason Philip Morris
has the Web site. It is not to inform smokers but to insulate the
company from further attack from dying smokers.
</P>
<P>
   Big Tobacco negotiated a $246 billion settlement with the states
who sued to recover the cost of treating ill or dying smokers. But
it still faces suits from the federal government, individuals, and
health insurers who say that cigarette makers knew for decades how
deadly their products are.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris evidently hopes that if it comes just clean enough
_ it does not come out and say smoking causes cancer, it only
acknowledges the ``overwhelming evidence'' that it does _ it will
convince juries that smokers were fully informed of the dangers of
cigarettes and thus gave themselves cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris is gambling that it can seduce juries to forget
that today's plaintiffs began smoking in yesterday's era of denial
and lies.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing just that, attorneys for 500,000 Florida smokers have
already asked a judge to shut down the Web page. In July a Miami
jury found Big Tobacco liable for smoking-related illness. The
big-money, damage phase of the trial, begins Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Shutting down Web sites is highly impractical on the basis of
free speech. But the episode makes it clear why Philip Morris has
the Web site. Philip Morris knows that few people will use it as a
hot link to the American Cancer Society. What they are doing is
finding a new way to avoid having any responsibility for cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The old way was denials and lies, which treated smokers like
bozos. The new way is coming clean and making smokers look like
clowns in the courts. Either way, it is a death-defying feat of
corporate communications.
</P>
<P>
   The Philip Morris Web site may seem like the Trapeze of Truth.
But look closer and you will see that the safety net is only for
Philip Morris itself. Smokers are still headed for a fatal fall.

 Undated: ... spoken at home.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   That mirrors a concern across the Franco-American community. For
many, losing the language was painful, and sometimes an unpleasant
memory.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Hebert lives in Amherst, Mass., and is the fiddler with
the group Chanterelle, which specializes in Franch-Canadian and
Franco-American traditional music. Her mother grew up in Manchester
and spoke French _ until she came home from school one day and said
the teacher told she was not to come back until she could ``speak
white,'' meaning English.
</P>
<P>
   Her father, angered at that slur but accepting the reality,
roared out _ in French _ ``There are no French here anymore. We
speak English.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Within a short period of time, I came into contact with three
people in their mid-40s like me who were writing about holding onto
Franco-American culture and passing it on.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Paul Marion, Lowell. Poet, editor of ``French Class.''
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, Marion published ``French Class,'' a collection of
journals, poems, and essays by himself and three other
Franco-American writers, ``personal family stories,'' he said, but
``with common threads.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so good to hear some of those stories being told,
because you can't find them elsewhere,'' he said. They are stories
about how French-Canadians arrived here, what it was like in the
1920s, how the churches were built.
</P>
<P>
   While ``French Class'' is a slender, paper-bound book published
locally, its authors represent a vibrant ethnic thread not often
examined in contemporary American writing.
</P>
<P>
   Best-known among contemporary Franco-American writers is
Cormier, for whom the thinly disguised Leominster of his youth is
reprised in ``The Chocolate War,'' one of the most popular books
for junior high school students. ``It's my background, and I like
to write about it,'' said Cormier, 74, a former newspaper reporter
in Worcester and Fitchburg who eventually turned to young-adult
fiction.
</P>
<P>
   John Dufresne, who grew up in Worcester, is another writer who
draws on his Franco-American roots, particularly in his 1997 novel,
``Love Warps the Mind a Little.''
</P>
<P>
   While most readers will associate Jack Kerouac with the ``Beat
Generation'' of the '50s, to people like Marion _ who has edited
``Atop and Underwood,'' a forthcoming collection of his early
writings _ he is the quintessential Franco-American writer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a content-provider,'' said Marion. ``His Lowell novels
are the best account we have of what it was like for everyday
Franco-Americans making their way in Lowell. He gives us the
religious atmosphere, the cultural rituals.''
</P>
<P>
   Marion said that Kerouac, born in Lowell in 1922, was of his
parents' generation. Marion's mother was even in first grade with
him. ``They could both see literature being made out of their
lives.'' And, he added, ``Kerouac always identified himself as
`Franco-American.' ''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The music is the most notable part of the culture, along with
religion. The music, the dancing, the songs _ even if you don't
understand it all, it means something to you.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Donna Hebert, Amherst, Mass. Fiddler.
</P>
<P>
   In an article written for the forthcoming ``Encyclopedia of New
England Culture,'' folklorist Julien Olivier calls music ``the
element of Franco-American folklife which has best survived the
migrations of the French to and about North America.'' It is
readily transmitted, and preserved on recordings.
</P>
<P>
   Hebert and singer Josee Vachon formed Chanterelle to play and
record traditional songs from Quebec and New England. They appear,
along with other groups, on the recently released ``Mademoiselle,
Voulez-vous Danser?'' ``It's a great document of what's out there''
in New England, said Hebert.
</P>
<P>
   Vachon added, ``We're adding fresh new sounds to the tradition,
so we're trying to appeal to younger audience rather than
presenting something `grandpere' knows.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Our phone number was 207-581-FROG, for Franco-American
Resource Opportunity Group. It was a play on the negative image of
Franco-Americans. But it empowered us as Franco-Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Josee Vachon, Amherst, Mass. Singer.
</P>
<P>
   Franco-Americans ``were slow to awaken to the idea of pride,''
says Claire Quintal, former director of Assumption College's
Institut Francais. ``We were `privately proud.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``You were proud of what the French had done in North America in
the early days,'' Quintal explained, ``but your family came into
New England as mill workers.'' By contrast, Quintal said, even with
similar blue-collar backgrounds, ``their Irish and Italian
neighbors could connect with a mother country in Europe and its
culture.''
</P>
<P>
   That lack of connection with a mother-country culture _
French-Canadians' ties with Europe were sharply cut after their
defeat by the British in 1763 and then by the French Revolution in
1789 _ meant that even if they continued speaking French, there
might be embarrassed that it was not ``good French.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, there was the matter of ethnic slurs, of ``Canucks'' who
lived in ``Frog Hollow,'' the derogatory term for Franco-American
neighborhoods in many New England cities.
</P>
<P>
   Vachon, 39, was born in Quebec, but grew up in New England and
remembers how ``Franco-American kids were put down so much.'' But
as an undergraduate at the University of Maine at Orono, it was the
word ``frog,'' turned on its head, that put her on the way to being
what she sees as an ``ambassador of Franco-American music.''
</P>
<P>
   At Orono, Vachon became active in the Franco-American Resource
Opportunity Group, working on the staff of Le Forum, a monthly
bilingual newspaper that covers political, cultural, and social
activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started singing because of that experience,'' Vachon said.
``They pushed us into our culture and, all of a sudden, there I was
performing at Franco-American festivals.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Where New England's Franco-American culture goes from here, as
language generally slips into the backgroun, is an open debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's problematic,'' said Quintal, citing the passage of
generations and the closing of French parishes and parochial
schools, with their Quebec-born nuns.
</P>
<P>
   Still, suggests Julien Olivier, a folklorist in Barrington,
N.H., ``every succeeding generation said: It's all over. But
something new kept happening, and the culture went on and on and
on.''

LYNCH AIMS `STRAIGHT' FOR THE HEART 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the hands of many directors, simplicity seems pretentious.
But in a 180-degree turn from the surrealistic weirdness of his
previous films, David Lynch makes simplicity seem pure, eloquent,
and deeply moving in ``The Straight Story.'' Unlike his views of
small-town America in ``Blue Velvet,'' ``Wild at Heart,'' and
``Lost Highway,'' there's no irony at all in his sunlit take of the
farm town in Iowa where the story begins, in what we think will be
``Blue Velvet'' fashion as an overhead camera drops down into a
yard to show us a banal shot of a woman sunbathing between two
modest frame houses. But there's nothing even remotely campy on
Lynch's menu. In no time, we've made the acquaintance of the
woman's next-door neighbor, a geezer in declining health played by
that ex-rodeo rider, stuntman, and twinkling old gent who has Old
West written all over him, Richard Farnsworth.
</P>
<P>
   It's Farnsworth's Alvin Straight who gives the film its
deep-breathing quality, its unhurried authority, and its courtly
nobility. He grumps about the fact that in addition to emphysema,
he's got to use two canes to get around, because of a fall in his
kitchen and some newly discovered circulatory problems. At that,
he's better off than his stroke victim brother Lyle, who lives in
Wisconsin. They haven't spoken in 10 years, he tells us, for no
better reasons than drinking and pride. All the background we need
is sketched in minimal but, we are convinced, emotion-loaded
exchanges with his speech-impaired daughter Rose, played with
uncommon rightness by Sissy Spacek. She's carrying her own load of
pain, having been declared an unfit mother by a state agency after
a fire, and having her four kids taken away from her.

   But ``The Straight Story'' is Farnsworth's film all the way,
once Alvin decides he ought to reconcile with Lyle before they die.
He is not about to be stopped by the fact that not only doesn't he
have a driver's license, he doesn't have a car. He simply hitches a
wagonful of supplies to his lawnmower and takes off. When it blows
a gasket not far up the road, he patiently has it towed back,
trades it in on an old John Deere, and takes off again, at a none
too speedy but infinitely resolute 10 miles per hour, unfazed by
rumbling 18-wheelers that blow by him like speeding cliffs. That
there is nothing lovably eccentric or silly about his mission or
his way of accomplishing it comes from the sense we must get _ and
do _ that Farnsworth's 73-year-old self-sufficient World War II vet
is what sociologists used to call inner-directed.
</P>
<P>
   His gentlemanliness, sincerity, and dignity make a difference
during a roadside stopover when he meets a young woman running away
because she's afraid to tell her family she's pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, it makes no difference at all when he meets
another woman who is hysterical because she hit a deer, not for the
first time, on her commute.
</P>
<P>
   The film _ based on an actual journey made in 1994 _ doesn't use
flashbacks, but we get enough of Alvin's history to deepen him,
including his stifled pain at mistakes he made and his candor in
facing up to years he wasted drinking hard. But that was then, the
film seems to say, and this is now, and Alvin, who hasn't much
future, lives for as much now as he can still get.
</P>
<P>
   His understated but unmistakable tenacity generates sympathy,
but maybe Lynch, who grew up in rural Montana, is simply saying
that most people along the way will respond to decent behavior in
kind. Alvin makes minimal demands on his benefactors, and is
grateful for the help he gets from some kind locals when his brakes
and tires fail near the hilly state border. One of the film's
scenes of sly country humor comes when Alvin gently makes clear to
some twins that he isn't going to overpay for a pair of tires and
bargains them back down to earth. ``The Straight Story'' is a
beguiling piece of Americana populated by Deere hearts and gentle
people. Farnsworth's embodiment of old American values, with their
combination of delicacy, reserve, and stand-alone independence, is
a one-of-a-kind treasure.

SCORSESE'S `DEAD' IS FLIP SIDE TO `TAXI DRIVER' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Bringing Out the Dead,'' Martin Scorsese's film about EMS
drivers, isn't a thrill ride. It's a soul ride. For all of the
blood and suffering splashed through every draining shift worked by
Nicolas Cage's paramedic, for all the shrieking sirens and
high-speed careening up and down Manhattan's harsh streets in the
early '90s, the real crisis is the one buffeting the spirit of
Cage's Frank Pierce. Frank's problem is that there are none of the
usual defenses between him and his job. Most of his colleagues
detach, take refuge in mock-callous survivor's humor, or focus on
other things _ food in the case of John Goodman's Larry, religion
in the case of Ving Rhames's Marcus. But for Frank _ surrogate for
EMS driver Joe Connelly, whose autobiographical novel is the film's
source _ there is no relief. What his tormented customers feel, he
feels.
</P>
<P>
   Although it may loom as an extension of ``Taxi Driver,''
``Bringing Out the Dead'' would more accurately be called that
nihilistic film's flip side. While there's a lot of death on the
streets of Hell's Kitchen and in the apartments lining them,
there's also hope. Unlike the alcoholic he played in ``Leaving Las
Vegas,'' Cage's character isn't seeking death. What he wants is
redemption, peace, or, failing that, a little sleep. He's the
opposite of Travis Bickle's boiling taxi driver. His conscience
won't let him quit, although he'd like to. The most amusing piece
of black humor comes from his harried boss, played by Scorsese.
When he threatens to fire Frank for coming in late, he knows it
would be a relief to Frank, who then would be let off the moral
hook. But, of course, Scorsese's dispatcher is perpetually
short-handed. So Frank's punishment is to be kept in his job.
</P>
<P>
   You will by now sense the large presence of Catholic guilt here.
It is an element that figures in many of Scorsese's films, from
``Mean Streets'' on. Like that film's hero, Frank has something of
a savior complex. He feels guilty about the people he can't save. A
recurring hallucinatory image of a young woman personifies all the
snuffed-out life Frank regards as his responsibility. At one point,
a voice tells him that nobody asked him to suffer, that suffering
was his idea. Although the film never makes anything of it, he may
be guilty of the sin of pride, of taking on more of the
responsibility of running the universe than is rightly his. It
speaks well for his heart, but unless you identify with his guilt,
a lot of Frank's anguish seems like pointless self-laceration and,
from the dramatic point of view, relegates to secondary status a
lot of the more immediate suffering. While Scorsese was right to
avoid an overemphasis on rescue heroics, it seems a miscalculation
to make Frank's agonizing the film's center.
</P>
<P>
   A scene in a drug pad seems artful rather than visceral in its
impact. A recurring street figure who survives brutal treatment
seems more symbolic than actual. The film does reach some of the
contrasting tender emotion it's after in a few exchanges between
Cage and Patricia Arquette, as a troubled but compassionate
neighbor named, yes, Mary. They meet when he responds to her
father's heart attack. But when solace works its way around to a
pieta, it seems more emblematic than immediate. There's a little
too much docu in this docudrama and not enough drama. This seems a
curious thing to say about so pain-drenched a film, in which a lot
of emergency room footage adds to the verisimilitude of the images.
There would seem no surer bet this season than America's foremost
film artist going back to Manhattan's mean streets to bookend
``Taxi Driver.'' But while heartfelt and beautifully crafted,
``Bringing Out the Dead'' is too freighted with its protagonist's
failed savior complex and is surprisingly lacking in primal impact.

<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a common word that Franco-Americans use to discuss their
half-hidden presence, knit into New England's cultural fabric over
three centuries. They call it ``la survivance.''
</P>
<P>
   Literally, it means ``survival.'' It's there in Lowell, Mass.,
at the monthly dinner meeting of the Club Richelieu, in Webster,
Mass., at St. Anne's School when Muriel Pontbriand plays a language
game with her French class, and in Woonsocket, R.I., when Josee
Vachon sings ``updated traditional songs'' at the Jubile festival.
</P>
<P>
   As Franco-Americans examine the state of their culture, the word
also carries connotations of both ``preservation'' and
``persistence.''
</P>
<P>
   Descendants of the French who settled in Quebec and Acadia in
the 17th and 18th centuries, they make up the second-largest ethnic
group in Massachusetts, behind Irish-Americans. They often manned
the region's textile mills, and like the Irish, brought their
Catholicism with them. In the last national census, there were just
under a million state residents of French Canadian and French
ancestry. But despite their numbers, they remain a quiet presence,
largely absent from high-profile public positions, their ethnicity
rarely invoked. Theirs is often an inward culture, but one that
remains rich, lively, and varied.
</P>
<P>
   To sample it is to visit a side of New England rarely examined
yet remarkably vital:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I found le Club (Richelieu) on the Internet last year. I have
an Acadian background, and my parents insisted I speak French. So I
was looking for something French to do.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Jeannine Richard, Lowell, Mass. President, Club Richelieu.
</P>
<P>
   Richard is greeting _ and is being greeted by _ club members in
the traditional way, kisses on both cheeks and a warm ``bon soir,''
as they arrived for last month's meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Richard, who is in her 50s and recently settled in Lowell after
a peripatetic marketing career, grew up in a French-speaking
family. She is the club's first woman president, but like the other
more than 30 members found in it a place to reconnect with her
roots. The club is an international social and service organization
with close to 300 chapters and some 7,000 members, named not for
the 17th-century French cardinal, but for his niece who founded a
home for orphans in Quebec in 1665.
</P>
<P>
   At this meeting, member Roger Lacerte's talk dealt with a
subject that is becoming the new roots-connection for the region's
Franco-Americans _ genealogy. The discussion points the way to
another regional touchstone.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Marie Perrault, editor of the journal of the
American-Canadian Genealogical Society, suggested, ``It's hard to
learn a language when you're older, so doing family history is an
easy, painless way to get back into the culture.'' The society is
housed in an old parochial school building in Manchester, N.H., and
is stocked with the birth, marriage, and death records of many
families.
</P>
<P>
   ``The French-Canadians were excellent record-keepers,'' Perrault
said, with record-keeping centralized in the Roman Catholic
parishes in Quebec and in the Maritime provinces that
Franco-Americans refer to as Acadia.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think my son's wife is making meat pies. But 20 years
from now, maybe Peter will get interested in traditional things and
she'll say, `Where's that recipe?' ''
</P>
<P>
   _ Robert Cormier, Leominster. Author, ``The Chocolate War,''
``Frenchtown.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the three things that most identify Franco-American culture _
language, religion, and food _ says poet Paul Marion, ``People lose
contact with them in that order.''
</P>
<P>
   So, says Marion, ``You find people mentioning the totemic food,
like pork pies. That's the last identifier to go. Even when
everything else goes, that stays.''
</P>
<P>
   It certainly stays at Cote's Market in Lowell's old
Franco-American district. It's a ``mom and pop'' store like any
across the country, but with a refrigerated case filled with meat
pies, pates, and baked beans.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturdays, says owner Roger Levasseur, ``I'll have 80 pots of
beans going. There's 50 servings in a pot. That's 4,000 servings,
and I'll sell every one.'' These are a variant of the better-known
Boston baked beans, but are cooked without molasses or sugar which
makes them lighter in color and taste more of tomato.
</P>
<P>
   And there are traditions within traditions in the
``tourtieres,'' the meat pies of which Cormier spoke. His own
mother's version, the author said in an interview, ``was very plain
because that was the way my father liked it, just the pork and beef
and onion sprinkled with salt and pepper.'' But his wife's mother's
version was fancier, with potato mixed with the meat and seasoned
with cloves and other spices.
</P>
<P>
   ``On holidays,'' said Cormier, ``We'd go to Connie's mother's
and then to my mother's. They were still tourtieres, but very
different.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``What I try to give is a bit of love for the language and
enough vocabulary so they can order breakfast when we go to Quebec
every spring.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Muriel Pontbriant, Webster. Teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``We study French,'' pipes up one of Pontbriant's sixth-graders,
``because it's the French school.''
</P>
<P>
   Officially, it's St. Anne's School. But ``Ecole Ste. Anne'' over
its front door proclaims its heritage, as do the words over the
schoolhouse doors ``Garcons'' and ``Filles.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent morning, Pontbriant kept up a lively round of games,
songs, and demonstrations. At one point, she walked the aisles,
posing as a waitress with pad in hand to take orders of ``jambon''
and crepes to prepare for next year's class trip to Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   Pontbriant, who attended St. Anne's herself, grew up in a
French-speaking family and learned the language before she spoke
English. Of her 29 sixth-graders, half have French backgrounds,
though only one said French is spoken at home.

A POWERFUL TALE OF A 13-YEAR-OLD DREAMER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Rosie,'' from a new Belgian director, Patrice Toye, is a
devastatingly understated powerhouse of a film. With its
13-year-old nonprofessional in the title role, it could have been
rigged with over-the-top adolescent angst. Instead, it achieves
enormous impact through the restraint with which it unfolds. Rosie,
played by Aranka Coppens, is an alienated girl clapped into a
juvenile facility as the film opens. In flashback, we see what got
her there. She acts out, but she's far from wild by nature. She's
dreamy. Toye came to this feature film debut from documentaries,
one of which focused on 13-year-old girls. Certainly this one
succeeds as few films do in convincing us that Rosie lives a lot of
her life in her head, in fantasies.
</P>
<P>
   She spends a lot of her time in her personal refuge, an
abandoned refinery in the bleak, weed-covered outskirts of Antwerp,
where she lives with her mother in cramped public housing. She
doesn't know her father, and while her mother loves her, she passes
Rosie off as her sister, not wanting to admit that she gave birth
to Rosie when she was young and unmarried. Although the bond is
strong and deep between Rosie and her mother, living this lie
troubles Rosie. Pressure builds when her Uncle Michelk moves in
with them, making his own demands and gambling money away at a time
when Rosie's mother is trying to make a go of it with a nice-guy
lover.
</P>
<P>
   Rosie takes refuge from the exacerbated tensions in the
claustrophobic flat by escaping into fantasies with a boyfriend
transformed in her mind into a romantic deliverer. They play house,
go joy riding, then go too far by kidnapping a baby. Part of the
film's impact derives from the fact that the boyfriend (Joost
Wijnant) is no real desperado, just slightly delinquent. Toye cast
members of Antwerp's leading acting cooperative, Sara de Roo and
Frank Vercruyssen, as Rosie's mother and uncle. They, too, are
remarkable at suggesting the gravitational pull of the lifelong
brother-sister baggage borne by their characters.
</P>
<P>
   Still, most of the film takes place in Rosie's eyes. As it
proceeds, and you tie into all the characters, you keep hoping
they'll find a way out. But while Toye projects their world with
surprising poetry, she's clear-eyed enough to avoid easy, much less
sentimental, solutions. She also keeps the yearning, emotionally
malnourished Rosie at the center of the film's troubled but always
beating heart. ``Rosie'' is a dynamic and unflinching film, but
it's also a tenderly observed one that delicately but
invigoratingly pulses with the energies of film renewing itself.

BANDERAS'S `CRAZY IN ALABAMA' IS SERIOUS FUN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Juggling Southern gothic eccentricity and civil rights advocacy,
``Crazy in Alabama'' represents a challenging directing debut for
Antonio Banderas. To his credit, he and the film land on their
feet. Although it's ungainly and disjointed in places, ``Crazy in
Alabama'' is carried by the larger-than-life character played by
Melanie Griffith. Never has a woman been more lovingly directed by
her real-life husband in a Hollywood film. But the effort is well
invested. Griffith makes her character's sexual flamboyance work.
She makes it seem simultaneously easy and over the top as an
oppressed woman determined to break out of her Alabama backwater
and become a Hollywood star.
</P>
<P>
   The hard part is getting out from under the thumb of her abusive
brute of a husband. Once she murders him and flees with his severed
head in a hatbox, such details as car theft and batting her eyes at
a succession of men ranging from smalltown sheriffs to Hollywood
agents are, to Griffith's Lucille, child's play. Griffith and
Banderas poke sly fun at the roles to which a woman like Lucille is
limited in the 1960s, when the film takes place, making her a
cheerful survivor who just plunges in and makes the best of things.
Not only does she have to make Lucille's extreme behavior
entertaining and funny, which she does, she must keep Lucille
sympathetic. This she does too. Irresponsible as it may seem that
she should have placed her brood of children in the care of others,
Lucille convinces us that she loves them in her outsize way.
</P>
<P>
   The story is narrated by Lucille's oldest teenage son, Peejoe,
played with dewy sentience and stubborn decency by Lucas Black in
an appealing performance. He and his younger brother are stashed
with their uncle, Lucille's older brother, Dove, who works in a
funeral home. David Morse is always affecting in his understated
way, and he makes this role work too, although he and the boys have
their hands full sustaining the film's other major plot strand, the
serious one focused on the civil strife of the '60s. Meat Loaf Aday
brings presence to a caricatured mean bigot sheriff. And the film
deftly handles the part of the story that involves the boys nudging
their uncle into the struggle.
</P>
<P>
   The pieces don't always fit together smoothly, but there's a lot
of flavorful work to savor, including Rod Steiger's judge, who
brings off the tough job of tying together the film's comic and
serious strands in a spirited climactic trial scene. There's not
quite enough craziness in the slightly overlong ``Crazy in
Alabama,'' but neither is it negligible. The civil rights story is
played with conviction and achieves impact. Griffith tempers
Lucille's lunatic kewpie doll quality with scatty warmth, to say
nothing of strategically deployed slashes of scarlet lipstick.
Lucille becomes sympathetic because she convinces us she's a woman
who will not be defeated by an unpromising set of day-in-day-out
circumstances, even if she has to stage her own civil rights
protest. So it is with ``Crazy in Alabama.'' Its joinery can be
faulted, but it's always simpatico.

`BEST MAN': A CAUSE FOR CELEBRATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Malcolm D. Lee's ``The Best Man'' is a romantic comedy that gets
the important things right. It fills the screen with appealing
characters and, unlike most such films, deepens our involvement
with them as the film proceeds, thanks to a warm ensemble
performance and sophisticated finesse from Lee, both at the word
processor and behind the camera.
</P>
<P>
   Only at the end do we feel a too-apparent hand of the writer,
wrapping things up with a neatness more convenient than believable.
Still, ``The Best Man'' is an enormously engaging and quite
impressive debut for Lee. Not since ``How Stella Got Her Groove
Back'' has a mainstream film about successful African-Americans
arrived with so much going for it.
</P>
<P>
   It perhaps is no coincidence that the star of that Angela
Bassett romance, Taye Diggs, is the male lead here, too. In this
case, though, he's a full-fledged American buppie, a writer named
Harper with a steamy semiautobiographical novel about to be
published as he heads for a weekend reunion with his pals. It's
built around the wedding of one of them, Morris Chestnut's star pro
football running back. Harper's counting on the fact that the book
won't hit the stores until after the wedding. But one of his old
crowd gets a preview copy, and before long they're all reading it
to see which character might be a thinly veiled version of
themselves, complete with what could be compromising secrets about
sexual liaisons.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it isn't long before the skies are thick with the
chickens coming home to roost. Relationships are shaken up and the
wedding itself seems in jeopardy, even though the footballer and
the sweet woman in his life, played by Monica Calhoun, obviously
love one another.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the trouble that develops arises because Harper several
years ago backed away from a romantic involvement with Nia Long's
equally career-focused TV producer, Jordan. Sanaa Lathan's Robin,
the current woman in Harper's life, isn't due to arrive until
Sunday, which gives Harper and Jordan some time to get into
trouble. Of course they all get into trouble of one kind or
another, partly because, the film makes clear, they all have
unresolved issues or parts of themselves they haven't acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   Although the wedding isn't a shotgun wedding, the intense
emotions detonated by the reunions generate some shotgun maturing.
Still, there's nothing to really throw the film off track. We get
hooked by these bright, attractive characters and we stay hooked.
One of the things you've got to like about Lee's writing is that
when the characters start talking trash, it's more earthy and frank
than mean-spirited.
</P>
<P>
   Lee likes his characters, and we keep liking them, too, even
when Diggs's writer wavers, even when Chestnut's athlete is forced
to confront the pain caused by his double standard. As the jock who
convinces us he has a religious side, his character is the most
heartfelt and the most moving. But there are no throwaway roles
here. Even Lathan, given the least screen time as the woman the
writer might possibly throw over to conclude the unfinished
business with Long's producer, weighs in strongly and warmly. ``The
Best Man'' breathes fresh life into old formulas.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

A SLICK BUT TOUGH LOOK AT SEX, RAPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most so-called date movies are eye candy. But ``Body Shots''
goes to some uncomfortable places to show some ugly situations
beneath its pretty pictures. Even if it doesn't achieve its
ambitions, it at least has some and is a generally absorbing
ensemble piece that will be regarded as something of an anti-date
movie. Still, it'll give couples something to talk about if they
make it to the end. Beneath its glitz, poses, and pub crawlers and
club prowlers, it's an old-fashioned morality tale whose central
event is a date rape at the end of an evening spent by four LA
couples who pair off.
</P>
<P>
   Director Michael Cristofer and an attractive cast find ways to
give dimension to the script's sexual stereotyping, in which the
guys just want one thing, at least to hear them make their barroom
chat sound like locker room bravado, and the women don't want much
more. Actually, a couple of the guys seem poised to grow beyond
behavior patterns that don't travel well to adulthood: Sean Patrick
Flanery's lawyer, Rick, who at least feels he ought to grow up, and
Brad Rowe's Shawn, who says that sex without love is violence,
although when a sexual opportunity presents itself in an alley with
a too-desperate woman, he doesn't say no.
</P>
<P>
   As the film opens, Flanery's lawyer wakes up in the early
morning in the bed of a woman named Jane (Amanda Peet), who also is
a lawyer. They're quickly yanked out of man-woman stuff into their
professional modes when Tara Reid's Sara shows up, bruised and
beaten, charging that the guys' ex-pro-football-playing pal, Jerry
O'Connell's Mike, raped her. Of course, there are conflicting
stories about what happened. The respective accounts are played out
in flashback. So are the other events of the evening as the
characters stagger into the morning in states ranging from shaken
to wasted.
</P>
<P>
   The film's style is pretty assaultive, paralleling the evening.
And it's as fractured as the characters' thought processes.
Obviously the film means to switch our view of them from hip to
lost, although it's too cool to attempt anything like a definitive
resolution. It also adheres to the Hollywood credo that just
because you have the intellectual firepower of kelp, it doesn't
mean you can't be good-looking. Looks fuel the evening's nod to
humor. Ron Livingston's eccentric Trent gets the leper treatment
for wearing golf knickers and an argyle sweater to the club and
Emily Procter's bargirl amusingly extends the Southern Cal blond
babe look into dominatrix territory.
</P>
<P>
   Trent never sees the handcuffs coming. He and the others
believably receive just enough of a jolt to make us forgive the
film its own relentless style-hound approach and airhead banalities
that pass for profundity in the LA club scene. ``Body Shots''
behaves like a slick TV movie, with platitudes that seem suspended
above the characters in comic-strip balloons. It looks good and
generates a few fleeting moments of sympathy in its washes of
overstatement. But for a movie that seems to think it's Neil LaBute
with palm trees and a beach scene, it's only ``The Breakfast Club''
pulling an all-nighter.

THE CHEMISTRY IS STILL THERE FOR STONE TEMPLE PILOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anxiety reigned when the Stone Temple Pilots, who hadn't played
together in two years, regrouped earlier this year to see if they
had any chemistry left. It was late January in Los Angeles. Singer
Scott Weiland, whose well-publicized heroin problems have often
derailed the group, greeted his three bandmates _ brothers Dean and
Robert DeLeo and Eric Kretz _ and the music began.
</P>
<P>
   Robert brought in the riff to a new song, ``Down,'' and the band
got right to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in a small room cranking out that song,'' Dean DeLeo
recalled this week. ``And, at 119 decibels, the anxiety left rather
quickly, as the paint peeled from the walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just this thing we have together,'' he added of the
group's still-vibrant chemistry. ``There's never a lot of
discussion in STP. Everybody knows what the others want in their
music.''
</P>
<P>
   The chemistry that has made STP a hard-rock powerhouse _
resulting in 14 million combined sales of their first three albums,
``Core,'' ``Plush,'' and ``Tiny Music _ Songs From the Vatican Gift
Shop'' _ bursts forth again on the new CD, ``No. 4,'' which comes
out Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   It packs a worthy wallop and is laced with pent-up guitar rock
and Weiland's brilliant-when-not-smacked-out lyrics, but STP now
has another dilemma to overcome. Weiland finished the record, but
violated parole (he failed to show up for a drug test) and in
August was jailed for a year. With good behavior, he could be out
in March _ in time for a summer tour _ but that's a wait-and-see
matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very aware that there's no guarantee he'll be out in
March,'' said DeLeo. ``To feel differently is setting us up for a
downfall.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiland entered a rehab division of the LA County Jail on Friday
the 13th, after having been sentenced on the 13th floor of an LA
courthouse. ``He never moaned about what he was going to face,''
said DeLeo. ``He was truly noble about facing the burden of his
actions. He had also been sober for 2 1/2 months _ the longest
stint of his sobriety in a decade.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, Weiland ran into a judge who had already seen
him twice before and couldn't hack it anymore. Weiland missed his
drug test and then overdosed in the halfway house where he was
living while making the album.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scott was taken to the emergency room in the middle of the
night, and when that happens, the courts are notified within 24
hours,'' said DeLeo. ``The sequence of events after that was
surreal. We finished the record and were getting ready to do a show
in Las Vegas in mid-August. The court said, `OK, if you want to
leave the state, we want you to turn yourself in on Aug. 13.' And
that was that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vegas show, taped at the House of Blues, will air on MTV
later this fall. The album will start its march up the charts
shortly and, at the very least, is a high-decibel present to fans
who needed a reunion disc after the disappointment of the
participants' non-STP efforts. Weiland made a spotty solo CD, ``12
Bar Blues,'' while the other three members, renaming themselves
Talk Show, made an album by that name that had some great
arrangements, but lacked strong vocals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if Scott was in the same frame of mind as the rest of
us, then Talk Show and `12 Bar Blues' would have never existed,''
said DeLeo. ``He was leading his life in a certain way that took
precedence over everything else. . . . It's tough seeing your
brother spiraling out of control downward. You're beside yourself
and there's no way you can help in a situation like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Tensions were tough at that time, but anger soon gave way to
regret and a genuine missing of each other. ``Talk Show wasn't even
out of the rehearsal room for our tour when I said, `I miss Scott,'
'' DeLeo recalled. ``And when he hit the road with a whole
different band, he called up and said, `Dude, I miss you guys,
too.' Then one thing led to another and when our tours brought us
back to LA, we all expressed feelings about making some more music
together.''
</P>
<P>
   While Weiland tries to get his act together, the remaining
members have at least had some fun learning the songs to the
musical ``Hedwig and the Angry Inch'' (``I was absolutely blown
away by that,'' said DeLeo) and playing them at an opening-night
cast party in Los Angeles. And DeLeo is getting married on Nov. 14
and plans to hide out for a while on his farm in Ventura County.
</P>
<P>
   ``When STP is up and running, it's like jumping on a carousel,''
said DeLeo. ``But when I get home, I punch the off button and just
enjoy country living.''
</P>

KID ROCK MIXES HIP-HOP, COUNTRY, AND MORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Welcome to the brave new world of hick-hop, where hip-hop,
classic rock, and country meet in ways that neither Grandmaster
Flash nor Hank Williams could have imagined. It's the creation of a
27-year-old bundle of contradictions known as Kid Rock _ a
free-spirited showman whose career has been a meteor ride this
year, fueled by Woodstock '99 and MTV, and now coming to a town
near you.
</P>
<P>
   Kid Rock _ born Bob Ritchie, son of a middle-class car dealer
outside of Detroit _ has bear-hugged the charts with the clever,
wise-guy hits ``Cowboy'' (``I'm a cowboy, baby . . . I once was
lost, but now I'm just blind'') and ``Bawitdaba,'' where he advises
crackheads, critics, cynics, crooked cops, and IRS agents to ``get
in the pit and try to love someone!''
</P>
<P>
   The album carrying these hits, ``Devil Without a Cause,'' has
sold 4 million copies and spurred a Kid Rock tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big production show,'' says Kid Rock, who toiled in
obscurity for 10 years before he became an MTV fave. ``I've got
elevators and lights galore and girls dancing. And tons and tons of
surprises. And a lot of pyro. We keep people there right through
the last encore.''
</P>
<P>
   Kid Rock also juggles his career with the demands of fathering a
6-year-old boy (of whom he has sole custody), showing a discipline
that counters the sex-drugs-and-hick-hop hedonism of his songs.
``I'm a contradiction, I'm a twist of fate,'' he rap-sings in the
tune ``Roving Gangster (Rollin').''
</P>
<P>
   Musically, he's a hotshot and he knows it. He beat all comers
during DJ competitions as a youth and boasts that he can do ``all
the tricks'' on turntables. ``I can cut with my chin and do 360s on
the turntables,'' he says. ``But some DJs are like guitar players _
all flash and no substance. That's not me. I can write songs.''
</P>
<P>
   He's written them on albums dating back to his debut on rap
label Jive Records, ``Grit Sandwiches for Breakfast,'' in 1990. His
music pays a debt to everyone from the Beastie Boys (``I loved
them, but they kind of lost me when they got all political'') to
Lynyrd Skynyrd and Hank Williams Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Kid Rock languished for years as an unappreciated
novelty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just kept banging away and then, lo and behold, people were
finally ready for it,'' he says during a recent break in rehearsals
in Kalamazoo, Mich., with his band, Twisted Brown Trucker. ``Radio
started to change format a little bit and MTV definitely embraced
the record before it sold 10 copies, which is pretty amazing to me.
I didn't expect them to do that, but they listened to it and loved
it, and, of course, that helped tremendously. And then it was just
a matter of going out and proving it. I just got the right
opportunity, I guess, and I snatched it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than a year ago, Kid Rock was the middle act on a bill at
the former Mama Kin club in Boston. Today, he's a teenager's
household name, muttered in the same breath as fellow irreverent
acts Limp Bizkit and Korn. But Kid Rock is more fun. He does
personalized covers of classic rock tunes such as Grand Funk's
``We're an American Band'' and John Fogerty's ``Fortunate Son.''
He's covered Hank Williams Jr.'s ``Country Boy Can Survive.'' And,
well, you never know what else he might do. He even employs a
little-person sidekick , Joe C., to exhort the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything just leads to the next thing,'' Kid Rock explains.
``People say, `OK, we saw you at Woodstock, we saw you at the MTV
Video awards, we've heard a lot of good things.' And when it comes
to the live show, they ask, `Is it really that good?' I mean, what
else do you want me to do _ ride out on a bicycle juggling? And
play my guitar and yodel?''
</P>
<P>
   Yodel?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I've got an old classic called `Yodeling in the Valley'
that I might have to pull out,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   His parents gave him his first turntable at age 12 and he went
from there. ``I taught myself everything _ turntables, guitar,
bass, keyboards, drums. I was never much of a learner, or at least
when other people would teach me. I'd teach myself.''
</P>
<P>
   He always had a work ethic. He grew up in the tiny town of
Romeo, Mich., on a 5-acre spread on which he mowed the lawn, moved
rock piles and woodpiles, and cut down trees. Although the song
``Cowboy'' has the phrase ``I'm not straight out of Compton, I'm
straight out the trailer,'' he's definitely not out of the trailer.
``I was just saying it for fun. I was just showing my whiteness,''
he notes. ``But 95 percent of my songs are autobiographical.''
</P>
<P>
   As a youth, he bucked authority. ``But I never hurt somebody to
get my point across,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   He made no apology then and he makes none now. He has a party
image _ he even dated a porn queen named Midori for a while _ and
he's besieged by fans who try to party with him. But he's learned
to draw the line. ``I like to get wild . . . But you can't party
with everybody who shows up with a joint,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   His refuge is his son, Bobby, whom he gets up for school every
day at 8 a.m., when he's not on the road. Otherwise, his older
sister, who lives with him in suburban Detroit, is his nanny.
</P>
<P>
   And though commercially the nation's pop audience has finally
caught up to his offbeat music mix, Kid Rock remains as eclectic as
ever. It's a pattern he developed early.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always hung out with a wide variety of people, and listened
to a wide variety of music,'' he says. ``If something is good, I
like it. I don't let anything else get in the way of it.''

TAKING ON CHALLENGE OF REBUILDING TRUST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Craig Bradley wasn't at Thursday's hearing at the Massachusetts
Division of Insurance. It was too bad. Probably only Bradley could
explain how his once-successful insurance company could have fallen
so far.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the hearing was called to review a plan by
businessman David ``Duddie'' Massad to take control of Bradley's
company, Trust Insurance of Taunton, Mass. In reality, the deal is
a bankruptcy workout that is being handled outside bankruptcy
court.
</P>
<P>
   If the deal goes through, Bradley's role and ownership of Trust
will be sharply reduced. If the deal fails, say industry sources,
the company could wind up in receivership.
</P>
<P>
   The beginning of the Bradley era was a lot more hopeful. He
founded Trust in 1989 after leaving Commerce Insurance in Webster
following a dispute with Commerce boss Arthur Remillard. Bradley
got his revenge by building Trust into a decent-sized insurer and a
pesky rival to Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley could not be reached for comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Craig is a brilliant individual,'' says an insurance executive
who knows him. Others say Bradley was a master salesmen whose skill
at wooing insurance agents helped him build the eighth-largest auto
insurance company in the state. About 175,000 consumers in
Massachusetts buy their insurance through Trust. In his spare time
Bradley became a major Democratic fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, Bradley's interest in his company waned,
say former colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took his eye off the ball,'' says one. Bradley began
spending less time at the company, leaving day-to-day operations in
the hands of his lieutenants and a variety of relatives he put on
the payroll.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a good time to be away. The past few years have been
difficult ones for the auto insurance industry in Massachusetts.
Rates have fallen and profits have dropped along with them.
</P>
<P>
   At Trust profits disappeared altogether. In May Trust said it
lost $21 million in 1998. In June the loss was boosted to $26
million, enough to wipe out half of the company's reserves. Trust
blamed the loss on computer glitches and problems with its
reinsurers. The explanation was skimpy and, according to industry
sources, not entirely plausible. Neither Trust nor the Division of
Insurance has elaborated on the reasons for the losses.
</P>
<P>
   But Trust had an ace in the hole: Massad, an investor who has
turned around car dealerships and a Worcester bank. Massad said he
would put $20 million into Trust in exchange for controlling
interest.
</P>
<P>
   That's how matters stood until Sept. 28, when in the space of
one day, Massad withdrew his offer and then changed his mind and
said he was back in. What happened in those few hours? Based on
documents filed with the Division of Insurance, it is clear Massad
demanded and won important changes in the terms of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet Bank, which had lent Trust $20 million, agreed to cut the
debt to $10 million. Why? Fleet isn't saying, but it's a good bet
the bank realized that if it didn't make the concession, it might
have wound up with nothing. ``If Fleet didn't make the adjustment,
we could not have pursued this matter,'' Massad said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also took a major haircut. He agreed to quit as chief
executive, to turn over part of his stock to Massad for nothing, to
accept a major reduction in his $1.6 million termination package,
to repay $841,000 he borrowed from Trust, and to remove his wife
and daughter from the payroll. Presumably Bradley, like Fleet,
agreed because the alternative would have been worse.
</P>
<P>
   Massad promised to make Trust ``efficient and profitable.''
Rival insurers say he will have his work cut out for him. The
state's auto insurance business is a rough-and-tumble one, and it
is all but certain other insurers will try to lure away Trust's
best agents. In this state, customers are loyal to their agents,
not to companies.
</P>
<P>
   Industry executives also wondered whether all the bad news at
Trust has been disclosed. A lawyer representing some of Trust's
minority shareholders complained that no up-to-date information
about the company's financial situation has been made public. A
spokesman for the Division of Insurance said only that Trust ``is
under examination'' and that the division is monitoring the
situation.
</P>
<P>
   The division has 30 days to approve or deny Massad's offer. Stay
tuned.

GAY SUBSCRIBERS MAY BOYCOTT AMERICA ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY DELGADO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Gay and lesbian subscribers to America Online
and gay online organizations are considering boycotting the
Internet giant for what they see as discrimination against gay
content online.
</P>
<P>
   NationalGayLobby.org began polling its members earlier this week
about boycotting AOL if the company refuses to come up with a new
set of standards to erase what the lobby believes may be a practice
of censoring gay content much more frequently than content that
includes profanities, sexual content or even hate speech by non-gay
members.
</P>
<P>
   Absent that, the organization wants a clear explanation from AOL
why it won't stop the practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure nobody wants to boycott AOL, but they have been
totally unresponsive to traditional forms of communication,'' said
Mike Romanello, the executive director of NationalGayLobby.org.
``They can end this whole thing with a phone call.''
</P>
<P>
   E-mails began flying back and forth this week among gay online
groups criticizing the online giant for its decision to delete the
online member profile of a gay AOL subscriber who described himself
as a ``submissive bottom.'' The subscriber alerted his local
American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) chapter in Fort Worth, Texas,
which, in turn, took the issue to the media and online gay
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Romanello said Thursday that more than 400 organization members
so far had responded to the poll. Of that group, 36 percent
identified themselves as AOL users and said they would support the
boycott. Another 43 percent who were not AOL users said they would
also support the effort.
</P>
<P>
   AOL has been caught in controversy with the gay community
before. Last year, the Sterling, Va.-based company was criticized
when one of its employees turned over a gay member's name to a Navy
investigator who then initiated discharge proceedings against the
serviceman.
</P>
<P>
   AOL spokesman Rich D'Amato on Thursday denied that the company
discriminates against gays. He said it tries to be ``even-handed
and fair across the board'' when dealing with questions of
objectionable profile content.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which has 18 million members, relies on its users
to alert it to objectionable content, D'Amato said. Then a team
within the company reviews the complaint based on the company
policy. The policy does not allow strong sexual content or hate
speech, D'Amato said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to be as narrow and as broad as possible,'' D'Amato
said. ``We do not want to interfere with a community's prerogatives
to express themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   If a profile _ a guide that allows AOL members to post details
about themselves _ has been deemed inappropriate, it is deleted and
the member is given a written explanation. Members are encouraged
to review the terms and submit altered profiles, D'Amato said.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Provasek, president of the ACLU's Fort Worth chapter, said
his group has general concerns with AOL over free speech issues,
but was pushed into action over the deletion of the profile using
what he called the ``innocuous'' term ``submissive bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   Provasek said he took up the cause out of concern that gay
content was being censored more frequently than straight content.
</P>

   He ran the word ``censored'' through AOL's search engines and
pulled up 100 profiles. Of those, the majority had used the word
``censored'' to indicate that AOL had deleted their profiles
because of gay content. All of those cases involved gay men, he
said, which raised the question whether gay content is censored
more than straight content.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're either not censoring non-gays, or gay men are more
naughty from anyone else and AOL thinks they need to be censored,''
Provasek said. ``We just have a real problem with the fact that
(AOL censors) are treating these adults like children.''

COUPLE ADVISED TO SAVE MORE

<P>
   Q. My husband and I are 38 and 31 years old, respectively, and
we hope to have two children over the course of the next three
years. My husband is a self-employed management consultant. I
recently left my job and plan to work part-time, but may not return
to work once we have our first child. We typically earn about
$100,000 a year and save about 20 percent of our gross income, with
the majority going into my husbands SEP-IRA. Here is our retirement
savings: In taxable accounts, we have $18,900 in Vanguard Index
500, $13,340 in Acorn fund, $13,848 in Janus Worldwide, and $6,942
in Fidelity Latin America funds, plus $11,013 in a brokerage
account invested in blue chip stocks. SEP-IRA accounts consist of
$15,593 in Fidelity Spartan Market Index and $6,825 in a Fidelity
brokerage account. Traditional IRAs include $4,666 in Fidelity
Diversified International and $4,033 in Fidelity Low-Priced Stock
funds. And we have Roth IRAs of $4,155 in Fidelity Dividend Growth
and $8,364 in Fidelity Export and Multinational funds. My husband
also has a $69,333 rollover IRA in brokerage accounts, and returns
there have been below average for the past few years. I also have
$16,115 in a tax-deferred account with TIAA. We also have $36,041
in a blue chip stock account from which we give approximately 10
percent a year to charity. Finally, we have a large emergency fund
in Fidelity Spartan Massachusetts Municipal Income, which is the
only savings not earmarked for retirement. Are we saving enough? Do
we have the correct asset allocation for retirement in 20 years?
</P>
<P>
   E.M., Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, at the rate you are now saving, you will build your
nestegg to nearly $2.5 million, presuming average 10 percent
portfolio growth.
</P>
<P>
   This calculation includes neither the stock fund you use to fund
charity contributions, nor your emergency fund, which if untouched
would add a further $121,483, presuming average 5 percent returns
there.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds great, no? But if inflation runs at a 3.5 percent
average, you can figure that youll need about double the number of
dollars to maintain your current standard of living, which is to
say about $160,000 a year. If your $2.5 million were invested in a
fixed-income portfolio which averaged 6.5 percent returns, it would
indeed produce that income stream -- but with very little left over
to protect you from inflation in the later years of your
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   But there are a couple of mitigating circumstances. For one
thing, if you continue to save 20 percent of your gross income, the
contributions and projected accumulation would rise as your income
rises. For another, most people dont need the same level of income
in retirement as during their working years. For one thing, usually
mortgages are paid off by that time. And having the time do things
yourself rather than pay for services usually allows people to
reduce their budgets by 20 to 40 percent once they retire.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, even though its always a question mark, there is
always the prospect that Social Security will be kicking in when
your husband reaches age 62, or, if he so elects, at a later age.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Id feel a little more secure if you could advance your
savings level a bit, but probably things should work out fairly
well on your current course.
</P>
<P>
   As for the portfolio I think its well diversified. I'd probably
have chosen Janus Overseas rather than Janus Worldwide, since the
latter holds a good dollop of U.S. large-cap stocks, which are
already well-represented in the portfolio. But if a change would
bring you an ugly tax bill, probably just as well to leave it as it
is. And if your TIAA account is in an annuity rather than the CREF
stock funds, I would change that. In addition, if the brokerage
account in which your husbands rollover IRA is invested has been
underperforming recently, you should analyze how its invested, and
if youre not satisfied with the performance, consider a different
investment. After all, at this point, its the largest single
segment of your retirement savings.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, while I applaud your program of charitable giving, you
also might consider that without additions or withdrawals, that
$36,041 would grow to $242,465 over 20 years, presuming 10 percent
average growth. You might then factor that in as money to protect
you against inflation in the later years of retirement _ and also
earmark that money for charitable bequests in your estate planning.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. In this age of high technology, I am becoming increasingly
concerned about the safety of my assets which are currently
invested with one of the biggest mutual fund companies. As I
approach retirement age and reliance upon the funds I have
accumulated in my IRA accounts, the ease with which a computer
nerd, hacker, or even a high school kid with computer savvy could
gain access to these accounts is alarming to me -- to the point of
my considering the transfer of these funds to CDs at my local bank,
where at least I am recognized. The company with which I am
invested -- one of your favorites -- allows withdrawals with just a
telephone call, their only safeguards being that you provide your
name and address as it is on the account, provide your account
number, and give your Social Security number. Apparently these
safeguards absolve the company from all responsibility. I may sound
paranoid, but I dont want to have to be flipping burgers at
McDonald's in my golden years. Can you address these concerns?
</P>
<P>
   L.S., Wellesley, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. I presume that my one of my favorites you mean the Vanguard
fund family. When you opened your IRA account, you were given a
choice of authorizing -- or not authorizing -- telephone
withdrawals. You can simply write Vanguard and change that
election, at which point neither you nor anybody else can direct a
withdrawal by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, even if a telephone withdrawal has been approved, the
funds cannot be sent anywhere but to the address of record of the
owner of the account, thus considerably reducing the possibility of
interception by a hacker or thief.
</P>
<P>
   I suggest that you simply inform Vanguard, or any other trustee
that you may use, in writing of the conditions which you require
for an authorized withdrawal from your accounts.
</P>
<P>
   You're right, in this modern electronic age there is a hazy
middle ground between being prudent and being paranoid. But if your
account is set up properly, I think you have very little to worry
about.

FALLOUT FROM MUSEUM FIRINGS CROSSES POND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He said he was sorry about firing those prestigious curators,
and he even gave them meaningless ``emeritus'' jobs to keep them
quiet. And yet bad publicity continues to dog the Boston Museum of
Fine Arts boss Malcolm Rogers's controversial four-month-old
``restructuring'' plan, better known as the Boston Massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Item: Art collector and longtime MFA overseer Robert Pirie
penned an astonishing letter to London's Art Newspaper, accusing
Rogers of padding the MFA's record-breaking attendance figures and
taking credit for exhibitions and fund-raising achievements that
should properly belong to others. Pirie, a friend and supporter of
sacked European decorative arts curator Anne Poulet, states that he
is not ``a recent member of the anti-Rogers bandwagon . . . when he
first became director, I found his combination of arrogance and
pathetic insecurity so unsettling that I called one of the trustees
to express my deep concern.''
</P>
<P>
   A museum spokeswoman called the letter ``mean-spirited,
outrageous, and inaccurate. It's perfectly natural for the director
to take pride in the achievements of the staff and the trustees.''
</P>
<P>
   In a pointed envoi to his missive, Pirie wrote that several
years ago he alerted Rogers to ``serious questions as to the ethics
and integrity of a member of staff. He informed me that he was
aware of the problem and that (he) had been authorized by the
trustees to fire the individual in question. It is particularly
disappointing to discover that under the new plan the individual
has been promoted to one of the most senior positions in the
museum.''
</P>
<P>
   Item: In response to an all-points bulletin from art historians
Ruth Butler and Paul Tucker of the University of Massachusetts, and
Patricia Hills of Boston University, about 30 academics from every
major area college and university gathered at the Friends Meeting
House in Cambridge Wednesday evening to discuss the impact of
Rogers's MFA reorganization on educational programs. ``We talked a
lot about plans for museum education, and it seems that there is no
plan,'' said one participant. ``The trustees seem to be totally
oblivious about what we do.'' The group plans to write a letter to
the trustees asking for a meeting to discuss educational and
curatorial concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Item: An icy editorial in London's prestigious Burlington
Magazine compares Rogers's reorg to a similar mixmastering at the
Victoria and Albert Museum 10 years ago. (Interest in the
British-born Rogers is intense in London, where he spent many years
at the National Portrait Gallery.) ``It is a source of unease for
British observers that an approach to museum restructuring thought
to be derived from US practices and tried out in Britain with
disastrous results in the 1980s should now have been re-exported
across the Atlantic. And it is hard to imagine how anyone who lived
through the aftermath of the V &AMP; A affair could imagine that a `big
bang' restructuring would prove acceptable, or that its `collateral
damage' _ to borrow a euphemism from the US military _ would be
swiftly forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Item: The MFA has decided to loan out one of its most precious
paintings, a 12-foot-long Paul Gauguin canvas called ``Where Do We
Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?'' In the past, the
painting has been deemed too frail to travel, and hasn't left the
building since 1951. Most notably, it was not loaned out to the Art
Institute of Chicago's Gauguin megashow of 1988-1989 that traveled
to Washington's National Gallery and to Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Now ``Come From etc.'' is slated to travel to Paris's Musee
D'Orsay for an important exhibit of Gauguin's later work, on the
100th anniversary of the artist's death. Loaning out the painting
for the Boston-Paris collaboration, explains one art maven, ``is
all about Malcolm's next job, which isn't going to be in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers's great protector, Ned Johnson, hates controversies that
he can't contain. I wonder what he thinks of this?

FROM THE HEARTLAND, A DARKLY POETIC `BOYS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``In Cold Blood,'' ``Badlands,'' ``The Executioner's Song,'' and
now, joining those grisly milestones on the heartland hit list, and
every bit their equal, is ``Boys Don't Cry.''
</P>
<P>
   While all four films are based on brutal killings that took
place in so-called real life, the circumstances attached to the
heartbreakingly brief life of Teena Brandon, who yearned to be male
and reinvented herself as Brandon Teena, are both more wistful and
more complex. They're captured rivetingly in Kimberly Peirce's
extraordinarily layered film, which is as much about isolation and
identity as about passions that boiled over into bloodshed. Driven
by astonishing performances from Hilary Swank and Chloe Sevigny,
``Boys Don't Cry'' not only revisits the crime, but convinces us
we're being taken inside it.
</P>
<P>
   The film is as much a meditation on identity and the need of
people to live in their fantasies as it is a thriller, although no
film this year piles up the dread like ``Boys Don't Cry.'' Again
and again you ask yourself why, if Brandon needed to flee Lincoln,
Neb., he went only 75 miles down the road to the forlornly
homogeneous town of Falls City and not to the kind of large urban
center that would have offered better survival odds. The answer, as
Hilary Swank makes clear in only one facet of a richly complex
character, is that Brandon was drawn by his own hunger for
acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   Warped as it may seem, it doesn't take Swank's Brandon long to
stand on its ear the American myth of the stranger in town.
Although slightly built and nowhere near as strapping as the local
guys, Brandon's energy and spirit draw people to him. He's high on
the locals' acceptance of his reinvented self, and they're high on
him. He's a fun guy who works at making people like him, especially
the girls. He's more sensitive to them than any of the guys they
grew up with, knows how to please them, offers them intimacy.
Before long, he's regarded as the best kisser in town, and the guys
he joshed with over six-packs and went bumper surfing with suddenly
are markedly cooler toward the new guy in town.
</P>
<P>
   What they don't know is that Brandon is conflicted, has identity
problems, and is fleeing trouble with the law. The treats he buys
his friends and the girls he romances come from the proceeds of
stolen checks and ATM cards, and it's only a matter of time before
he slips up. At the moment, he's too happy to care because he's
actually found a girl who accepts him, reciprocates his romantic
attentions, regards his differentness as an asset. Swank does an
electrifying job of getting under Brandon's complicated skin.
Brandon is spunky, even when he's scared, even when he should be
able to sense the gathering of ominous energies and flee.
</P>
<P>
   Simultaneously, you can feel Brandon fighting to try to finish
sculpting an identity, yet also throwing himself at partying with a
reckless exhilaration. It's his venturesomeness in the face of
their own clipped wings that lies at the heart of the threat he
poses to the two guys who befriended him, then can't handle the
energies he releases. When Brandon wins the heart of Chloe
Sevigny's local queen of cool by appealing to her wish to break out
of her confining environment, you can feel her ex-boyfriend begin
to unravel, lose what little control he has, and will his buddy
into a downward spiral that ends with bodies lying dead on the
floor of a shabby little farmhouse in a stark tundra.
</P>
<P>
   Swank's identification with the buoyant, gutsy, confused Brandon
is so complete that you don't realize until the scene is over that
you've been holding your breath, hoping that Brandon's hard-won
identity won't unravel after one of the most pitiless rape scenes
on film. The others are uniformly excellent, too, especially
Sevigny, who takes the smoky cool she summoned for ``The Last Days
of Disco'' and turns it into something anchored in documentary and
behavioral realism, yet instantly mythic. Beneath her affectless
exterior beats a warrior's heart. Brandon's yearning enkindles
hers. That's part of the reason she loves him and refuses to be put
off by him. Swank and Sevigny convince us that theirs is a
spirit-to-spirit union.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Sarsgaard, as the threatened end of the triangle, makes
the killer's terrible trajectory not only believable, but grounded
in the most mundane clodhopper behavior. He isn't a drooling
monster, he's a guy you wouldn't look at twice at a bar or a
convenience store. Without ever trying too hard, Peirce makes us
feel the ironic contrast between the wide-open spaces and the
fear-driven narrowness that rules them. The texture is unerring in
``Boys Don't Cry.'' The sullen vulnerability we can feel in
Sarsgaard and Brad Sexton's damaged misfits flies off the screen
like a distant early warning of the rage that's also gathering in
their inadequate innards.
</P>
<P>
   The flat, dilapidated world of the film defines hell as a
Nebraska of the soul, where bleakness is all, where social life
consists of leaning, stoned, against the wall of a Qwik Stop in the
middle of the night after the bars close. You can feel the force of
aborted dreams morphing into a thunderbolt of horror bent on
striking down the outsider who dares to deviate from the prevailing
misery. It's rare when a film compels you to identify with a
character on any level. In the case of ``Boys Don't Cry,'' with its
characters dancing on the line between liberation and
self-destruction, we identify with their longing souls. Peirce
turns hate crimes into felt knowledge as she turns ``Boys Don't
Cry'' into a dark poem of emotional nuking.

DESPITE TECHNOLOGY, `BATS' FLIES AT B-MOVIE LEVEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Bats'' is a reassuring little cheeseball of a movie. It proves
that if you use the latest computerized technology and you really,
really try, you can make a film that's just as cheesy as
yesteryear's B-movies in which budget-disadvantaged directors
dangled rubber bats that would absurdly bob up and down in the
frame while we went out for popcorn. Those bats were less scary
than the ones kids used to pull out of cereal boxes. The bats in
``Bats'' are superbats, genetically altered, we're told, but
they're not much scarier. Big, mean, and fast, they seem modeled on
gargoyles, which in turn were modeled on bats, so fair enough, I
guess.

   As a rural Texas sheriff, Lou Diamond Phillips looks as if he,
too, might have climbed down from a niche in a Gothic cathedral,
especially when he narrows his eyes and says, ``I'm not gonna let
'em blow my town off the face of the earth without a fight.'' The
military, whose experiments in weapons development started all the
trouble, offers its usual solution, which is to bomb the whole area
into rubble. What it doesn't realize is that doing so will only
scatter the bats. So Phillips and Dina Meyer's batologist descend
into a cave that's filled with all the guano you could hope for,
having hatched a plan to eliminate the bats with more finesse then
the Army could, although not much more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bats'' is too silly to warrant further discussion, except
perhaps to note that it's the first film from a new company,
Destination Films. It now occupies the coveted nowhere-to-go-but-up
mode and soon will escalate, one assumes, from films with two
dimensions to films with three. At least ``Bats'' has enough of a
sense of humor to feature ``Nosferatu'' on the marquee of the only
theater in town. Still, ``Bats'' leaves us little to ponder, except
possibly how the intrepid bat fighters, zipped into their
contamination suits, can fall head first into a pool of liquid
guano and sport clear visors a moment later. Or why, with a swarm
of hundreds of computerized bats flying at them, they bother to
fire their pistols as often as they do, given a 1-bullet-to-1-bat
ratio. ``Bats'' bats zero.

`THREE TO TANGO' IS OUT OF STEP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``Three to Tango,'' Matthew Perry and Neve Campbell come
across as cute people saddled with a lame romantic sitcom based on
mistaken gay identity.
</P>
<P>
   The character sketching is OK, especially on Campbell's part, as
she plays the mistress of Chicago tycoon Dylan McDermott, one who's
sassy and independent and no doormat. Unlike movie mistresses of
the past, she doesn't just sit around a gilded-cage love nest. She
sculpts in metal and maintains her own social life. This keeps her
rich married boyfriend insecure enough to want to keep tabs on her.
Since he can't always be around, he bullies struggling architect
Perry, whom he erroneously assumes is gay, into acting as his eyes
and ears.
</P>
<P>
   Although his partner (Oliver Platt) is gay, Perry's character is
straight. Given the large amount of time the neglected woman and
the unhappy spy spend in each other's company, and the deepening
sympathy between them, the inevitable occurs. Until it does,
however, a panopoly of gay jokes stretches drearily through a
styrofoamlike screenplay. But so labored and unfunny is the often
gay-bashing humor that it wouldn't raise a single eyelash of the
most trigger-happy network censor. McDermott labors unceasingly to
make us keep hating the rich guy's sadistic arrogance.
</P>
<P>
   Platt throws a lot of resourcefulness at the thankless role of
the gay sidekick. Perry understandably spends most of the evening
looking trapped and uncomfortable. And Campbell's smart, spunky
character seems to have wandered in from some really sophisticated
comedy she can't find her way back to. ``Three to Tango'' trips
early and never gets up off the floor.

COSMIC QUESTIONS IN A BLACK CONTEXT

<P>
   WALKIN' THE DOG
</P>
<P>
   By Walter Mosley
</P>
<P>
   Little, Brown, 260 pp, $24.95.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first things the casual reader might know about
Walter Mosley is that he is a man of colors. The titles of his Easy
Rollins mysteries each contain a color, from ``Devil in the Blue
Dress'' to ``A Little Yellow Dog,'' and one of his four novels
outside that series is ``Blue Light.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Walkin' the Dog,'' his second Socrates Fortlow book, Mosley
is as colorful as ever. In just the second paragraph, Fortlow
recalls his Aunt Bellandra's stories about ``the black race in a
white world under a blue god'' and before 10 pages are out, 10
different hues have colored Mosley's prose, most of them more than
once.
</P>
<P>
   One of the next things the casual reader might know is that
Walter Mosley is a man, and writer, of color. With the detective
Rollins, he paints portraits of black life in Los Angeles at
mid-century, and with Fortlow, his sketches move into the present.
</P>
<P>
   Fortlow, nearly 60 but still enormously strong, spent half his
life in an Indiana prison for murder and rape. But in the nine
years he's been out, he has sought out a righteous path, taking on
the rearing of an unguided teen who himself has killed, caring for
sick friends and street people, and standing singly against a
policeman's injustice, even when he is arrested, and then ousted
from his job.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley long ago proved that he is skilled at narrative and
phrasing, and ``Walkin' the Dog'' reinforces that distinction, such
as when he describes Charlene, whose strict Baptist upbringing has
caused her to hate her beauty and look for men who'll mistreat her:
She's ``still in the streets, trading a slapper for a shouter,
turning in good men for tramps.''
</P>
<P>
   But the meat of ``Walkin' the Dog'' is not in its stories, but
in its doggedly philosophical inquiries, entirely befitting a main
character whose name is Socrates. Primary targets are God and
religion. Fortlow learned about the Lord as a child from his crazy
Aunt Bellandra, who told him that God resides remotely at sea. Her
``blue God'' barely notices humankind, and has reserved an angel
for black men who comes only when practically all has been lost.
</P>
<P>
   That angel appears to present himself on the book's opening
page, in the form of a thieving, drunken horn player named Hoagland
Mars. Much later on, Fortlow finds Mars on the street, barely alive
and deep in squalor, and carries him to an inn. Even after Fortlow
has agreed to pay for Mars's lodging for the first three months and
Mars is back on his feet, the trumpeter offers only the most tepid
of gratitude, saying he would have found the haven anyway. (It is
operated by Luvia Prine, whom he describes as ``mean in a way that
only some Christians seemed to master,'' another dig at organized
religion.)
</P>
<P>
   Mosley's questions are universal _ the caprices of God, the
burdens of violence on the soul, the nature of guilt _ but Mosley
focuses them in the black community. In the first Fortlow book,
``Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned,'' Mosley had Fortlow
frequent a mom-and-pop bookstore, presumably in Watts, that was an
oasis of black literature and thought, both on its shelves and in
the informal discussions that thrived in its reading room. But the
Capricorn was destroyed, and its mom and pop were taken with it,
during the 1992 riots, undoubtedly Mosley's comment on how rageful
violence does not discern in what it destroys.
</P>
<P>
   The discussion-group device was so valuable to Mosley that he
had to re-create it for ``Walkin' the Dog''; this time its
role-players gather at a neighborhood funeral parlor. In one scene
in the penultimate chapter, they ponder whether black people have a
right to be angry at whites, or if they ``don't have no excuse for
the misery down here an' everywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortlow, who raises the topic, explains that he's been noticing
his anger, and noticing that it doesn't help. ``I'm tired'a bein'
mad, man. Tired. I see all these white people walkin' 'round and
I'm pissed off just that they're there. And they don't care. . . .
They thinkin' 'bout what they saw on TV last night . . . some joke
they heard.'' One participant angrily questions the question.
Another offers, ``We got reasons. But reasons and rights ain't the
same thing.'' Ultimately, they agree they can't settle the issue in
one night.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Fortlow almost gives in to his anger and strikes out at a
rogue cop who has preyed on black people, but decides to attack in
a different way, leading to the book's climax.
</P>
<P>
   It can sometimes be difficult to climb the mountain of thought
in ``Walkin' the Dog,'' and it is obscure or confusing in small
ways, but its meaning and style of expression make it a rewarding
exercise. It is a public service as well: While Mosley is raising
issues he thinks should be discussed in the black community, he's
giving white people glimpses of black life we rarely could
otherwise see.

BATTLE LINES ARE DRAWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first-and-10 technology is one of those innovations that
cause viewers to ponder just how they managed to watch a football
game without it.
</P>
<P>
   The yellow line superimposed on the field has added a new
dimension to watching the game. Since its unveiling on ESPN last
season, viewers have been able to follow the chains easier than
fans attending the game.
</P>
<P>
   As new products go, this is right up there with SportsCenter _
revolutionary.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this story about algorithms and three-dimensional
image processing is not without its unseemly human side.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, Princeton Video Image, Inc. filed a claim
against its chief competitor, Sportvision, Inc., with the US Patent
and Trademark Office.
</P>
<P>
   PVI wants the federal government to determine who owns the
technology. One patent was issued to Fox Sports and licensed to
Sportvision and covers the technology that combines television
camera images with a tracking system to produce precise virtual
inserts.
</P>
<P>
   PVI claims it invented the technology in the late '70s, received
patents for it then, and wants the government to admit it made an
oversight in granting Fox Sports a similiar one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been aggressive in maintaining and defending our
patent position,'' said Carlo Basile, PVI's chief technology
officer. PVI is no stranger to court. Last June, it filed suit in
US District Court in Delaware against another rival, Scidel USA
Ltd., for infringement.
</P>
<P>
   At the filing of that suit, Brown Williams, cofounder and PVI
chairman, told reporters that he is intent on protecting the
company's investment. ``Our shareholders and industry colleagues
need to know that we will take vigorous action and use our patents
to protect our unique intellectual property,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   PVI's rivals are not rolling over. In response to PVI's claim,
Sportvision, which provided services to ABC, ESPN, and Fox, filed a
lawsuit against PVI for patent infringement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This technology was stuff we were working on in the final
stages of FoxTrax,'' said Sportvision's chief technology officer
Stan Honey in a recent issue of Broadcast &AMP; Cable magazine. ``The
way we do first and 10 doesn't practice that patent, but we're
asserting that the way PVI implements their system does practice
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The technology is worth the fight. At stake is the ability to
use the first-and-10 marker as well as insert advertisements. Its
revenue potential is limitless. Instead of getting permission from
individual teams or stadiums, an advertiser can have its logo
imposed behind home plate or in the end zone without interfering
with fans in the stands.
</P>
<P>
   PVI works with CBS and during last week's Patriots-Dolphins game
the network employed its first-and-10 marker.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how the process works: PVI's equipment is integrated with
CBS's three main field cameras stationed at the 20-yard lines and
the 50.
</P>
<P>
   Those cameras are on the same side of the field and shoot about
90 percent of the game. The key person in the process is the PVI
spotter, who is on the sidelines and tells operators in the
production truck the line of scrimmage. The yard line is entered
into the computer and the rest is left to mathematical
computations.
</P>
<P>
   The complications are many, the most notable of which is what
Basile described as occlusion. When a running back, for instance,
crosses the virtual line he is seen without interruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``The software enables the computer to determine whether
something on the field should be seen or whether the line should be
seen on a pixel-by-pixel basis,'' Basile said.
</P>
<P>
   The same thing occurs with virtual advertisements. If they are
placed behind home plate, viewers see not only the batter, catcher,
and umpire but also the advertisement in the background.
</P>
<P>
   The virtual advertisments have not made as big an impact on the
viewing public as the first-and-10 technology. Nor has it generated
any lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry. Court cases are often the unintended result of
well-intentioned ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't take the first-and-10 marker _ whoever owns it _ off
the air.
</P>
<P>
   It would be like making fans watch their local sports broadcasts
for national stories.
</P>
<P>
   It just isn't the same.

   ATTN: News editors, national editors
</P>
<P>
   (Eds: Updates first day's budget lines.)
</P>
<P>
   Cox News Service is preparing to distribute another compelling
investigative series on the U.S. military by The Dayton Daily News.
``Falling From the Sky,'' a six-day series that starts Sunday, Oct.
24, concerns the recent rise in military air crashes and its
causes. The Daily News found that the U.S. military routinely sends
planes and helicopters in the air that it knows are plagued with
deadly safety problems. The series is based in part on
never-before-seen information from three databases from the Army,
Navy and Air Force safety centers.
</P>
<P>
   Publication of the stories is likely to have a national impact.
The Daily News won a Pulitzer Prize in 1998 for a series uncovering
problems with the military's health-care system.
</P>
<P>
   For ``Falling From the Sky,'' CoxNet will produce a Focus page
for Sunday, Oct. 24, based on the comprehensive first day of the
series. That page will be available Friday afternoon for a download
charge at www.nytsyn.com/pageexpress.
</P>
<P>
   Those stories, and subsequent days' offerings, will also be
available on the New York Times wire. The Sunday and Monday
installments will move on Friday, Oct. 22. Subsequent stories will
move daily next week. Photos and graphics accompany each
installment.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a budget of the page and stories that Cox will offer
from Dayton. If you have questions, please contact CoxNet at
404-526-5456.
</P>
<P>
   Falling From the Sky
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Oct. 24: Day 1 (This installment will be available as a
CoxNet Focus page Friday, Oct. 22. Stories and photos will also
move separately.)
</P>
<P>
   CRASH-MAIN _ The U.S. military routinely sends planes and
helicopters in the air that it knows are plagued with deadly safety
problems. An 18-month Dayton Daily News examination found that
planes keep falling from the sky for the same reasons, that
hundreds of crashes can be linked to maintenance errors, and that
the military keeps hundreds of crashes off its yearly accident
totals. (Carollo, Dayton Daily News)
</P>
<P>
   CRASH-SC _ After an F-16 crashed into a South Carolina
neighborhood and killed a man, the Air Force assured the
congressman representing the district that the plane had been
``trouble free.'' But a Dayton Daily News investigation into the
crash found that in the months preceding the Sept. 13, 1988, crash,
the engine had been on two other F-16s and removed after pilots
reported smoke and fumes in their cockpits. (Carollo, Dayton Daily
News)
</P>
<P>
   CRASH-HOW _ The series wouldn't have been possible without the
release of three databases from the Army, Navy and Air Force safety
centers. Also, how to find the full report at daytondailynews.com.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Oct. 25: Day 2
</P>
<P>
   CRASH-METAL _ A type of metal is in the middle of an
investigation involving a series of crashes of the Army's CH47
Chinook helicopter. The story came to light when a whistleblower,
working at a former factory in Springfield, Ohio, found flaws in a
metal used to construct gears that power the helicopter's huge
rotor blades. Investigators now suspect that seven crashes may be
linked to the metal. (Carollo, Dayton Daily News)
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Oct. 26: Day 3
</P>
<P>
   CRASH-MAINTENANCE _ The system used to maintain military
aircraft is itself broken. Hundreds of crashes can be linked to
work performed by unqualified mechanics, parts installed
improperly, engines overhauled incorrectly and inspection records
that were falsified. (Carollo, Dayton Daily News)
</P>
<P>
   CRASH-TIMMER _ A Hamilton, Ohio, man died in a helicopter that
should have been grounded. The test result that would have grounded
the craft arrived in the field three weeks after the crash.
(Carollo, Dayton Daily News)
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Oct. 27: Day 4
</P>
<P>
   CRASH-COUNT _ Since 1980, the military has omitted hundreds of
aviation incidents from its official accident rates, the statistics
used by Congress and the public to assess military safety.
(Carollo, Dayton Daily News)
</P>
<P>
   CRASH-BUTTON _ Among those not counted: the 1997 crash involving
Capt. Craig D. Button, who took off from an Air Force base in
Arizona and crashed an A-10 jet filled with bombs into a Colorado
mountain. (Carollo, Dayton Daily News)
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Oct. 28: Day 5
</P>
<P>
   CRASH-CONTRACTORS _ Private companies that do business with the
government, including large aircraft manufacturers, are protected
against many lawsuits by the government-contractor defense. The
defense means companies have limited liability even when they
produce defective products. (Carollo, Dayton Daily News)
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Oct. 29: Day 6
</P>
<P>
   CRASH-KNIGHTS _ The military's handling of the hydraulic
problems on the CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters is typical of the way
it handled numerous other mechanical failures in many types of
aircraft. Costs are weighed against risk. Some 70 incidents,
spanning more than 11 years, can be traced to hydraulic problems on
the Sea Knights. (Carollo, Dayton Daily News)
</P>
<P>
   CRASH-MCNALLY _ Anatomy of a crash. A detailed analysis of a
1994 crash in California involving a pilot named Randall McNally.
No cause was ever determined, but a Daily News examination found
that mechanics had detected problems with the plane's stabilizer
augmentor eight days before the crash. The augmentor was never
found. (Carollo, Dayton Daily News)

   ``Falling From the Sky'' is the result of an 18-month

   Many of the findings are based on information from the
military's own records, obtained through more than 150 requests
filed under the Freedom of Information Act. The federal law gives
citizens access to government records.
</P>
<P>
   Using the law, the newspaper obtained several computer databases
from the safety centers that investigate aviation accidents for the
Army, Air Force and Navy, which is also responsible for
investigating Marine Corps accidents. The databases, which have
never before been released to the public, contained hundreds of
thousands of records on more than 87,500 military aviation
incidents that occurred since the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The databases released to the newspaper included information
typically kept secret by the services, including the identity of
parts suspected of playing roles in accidents. The newspaper used
the databases to link a single part to more than one accident.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper also obtained dozens of lengthy records of
aviation accident reports from military offices around the world.
</P>
<P>
   More than 150 people were interviewed in 13 states. Among those
interviewed were pilots and other crew members, mechanics, civilian
and military accident investigators, military commanders and
attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper received technical advice from former and current
military mechanics, pilots, accident investigators and other
aviation experts.
</P>
<P>
   Among the experts used by the newspaper was former Army
helicopter pilot Edward Monhollen, who worked for the Army Safety
Center investigating accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Monhollen, a helicopter pilot in Vietnam, now investigates
military and civilian aviation accidents for the federal government
and private attorneys through his aviation investigation firm in
San Antonio, Edward Mohhollen &AMP; Associates.
</P>
<P>
   The series was written by Russell Carollo, a staff writer of the
Dayton Daily News. He previously co-wrote a series on problems with
the military's health-care system that won the 1998 Pulitzer Prize
for national reporting.

<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The U.S. military routinely allows helicopters
and planes in the air that it knows are plagued with deadly safety
problems _ conditions, in some cases, allowed to exist for months,
years, even decades, an 18-month examination by the Dayton Daily
News found.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper reviewed thousands of pages of accident reports
and analyzed hundreds of thousands of computer records released to
the public for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Among the findings:
</P>
<P>
   _ The military's system for repairing and maintaining aircraft
is itself broken. Hundreds of in-flight emergencies and accidents _
some deadly _ can be traced to parts installed improperly, engines
overhauled incorrectly and other mistakes by mechanics or the
people supervising them.
</P>
<P>
   _ The military has concealed its true aviation safety record
from the public. Since 1980, hundreds of serious accidents were
omitted from the military's official accident rate, and the
percentage of uncounted accidents is growing, from 1.6 percent of
all accidents in 1980 to 23 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   _ Decisions critical to the safety of the men and woman who fly
on military aircraft frequently are left to private civilian
companies with millions of dollars riding on those decisions. In
some cases, those companies participate in secret accident
investigations even as they face multimillion-dollar lawsuits
involving the same accidents.
</P>
<P>
   _ Federal investigators suspect that several CH-47D Chinook
helicopter accidents may be linked to gears made with a specially
processed metal at two factories, in Chicago and Springfield, Ohio.
In August, 14 years after the first accident, problems with gear
parts made with the same metal led to a worldwide grounding of
Chinooks, the largest such grounding ever.
</P>
<P>
   _ The military operates more than 15,000 fighter jets,
helicopters and other aircraft with virtually no independent
oversight. If the safety of civilians depended on the same system,
airlines could choose their own employees to investigate accidents,
decide when to ground their own aircraft, when to replace unsafe
parts, and make these decisions in secret, with little fear of
being sued.
</P>
<P>
   The military's already flawed aviation safety system recently
has become further strained by massive downsizing and budget cuts,
the loss of thousands of experienced pilots, global conflicts and
an aging fleet of aircraft. Amid these problems, the rate of
serious aviation accidents increased this year for all the services
except the Navy, which was rebounding from an 82 percent increase
in 1998. The Army's rate for serious accidents was the highest
since Desert Storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm beginning to understand how the military deals with this
stuff,'' said James Browne, whose son was killed flying a
helicopter that Navy investigators later determined was not safe to
fly. ``They don't want to spend the money to fix something until
they're between a rock and a hard spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're willing to sacrifice as acceptable risk the lives of
military personnel.''
</P>
<P>
   The military's top safety officials said aviation has never been
safer. They acknowledged the recent increase in the accident rate,
but said their statistics during the past 30 years show a drastic
drop in the rate of serious aviation accidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I care about these sailors and Marines,'' said Rear Admiral
Frank M. ``Skip'' Dirren Jr., commander of the safety center in
Norfolk, Va., that oversees Navy and Marine Corps aviation safety.
``If we find something wrong, we fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   Brig. Gen. Gene Martin LaCoste, commander of the Army Safety
Center at Fort Rucker, Ala., said many accidents are caused by
human error, not by longstanding problems ignored by the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see guys making more mistakes because of less experience in
the cockpit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Major Gen. Francis C. Gideon Jr., commander of the Air Force
Safety Center at Kirtland Air Force Base, N.M., and the former
director of operations for the Air Force Material Command at
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, said serious aviation
accidents have become so rare that they are ``almost statistically
irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite assurances that the military is doing everything it can
to prevent accidents, planes and helicopters keep falling from the
sky for the same reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Big problems, small measures
</P>
<P>
   The engine-control assembly (ECA) in the Navy's F-18 Hornet had
failed 114 times when a pilot in Florida reported a problem on July
1, 1996. ``Multiple ECA failures fleetwide posing unacceptable risk
to aircraft crew,'' an investigator warned after that incident.
Exactly one month later, another F-18 reported the same problem.
Three months later, another was reported.
</P>
<P>
   Hydraulic failures in the Navy and Marine Corps' CH-46 Sea
Knight helicopters caused more than 71 emergencies and accidents
since 1988, three resulting in a loss of helicopters _ one of them
part of President Clinton's fleet. This year, 11 years after the
first incident was documented, two people were injured when a
helicopter filled with reporters and photographers caught fire off
the coast of California. It was the second time in four days that
hydraulic problems had forced a Sea Knight to make an emergency
landing in California.
</P>
<P>
   An electrical relay used in the vapor system for the Navy's
twin-engine E-2C Hawkeye airplane failed at least 54 times _ 26 of
the incidents causing fires or an electrical spark. In 1996, an
investigator warned: ``This situation needs to be rectified. ... We
were fortunate that this incident happened on preflight.'' Two
months later, an E-2C reported smoke in the cockpit after the vapor
system failed. Two similar cases were reported in 1997 and at least
one in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The military often chooses small, measured responses to
recurring problems, but that hasn't always been a good strategy.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the military struggled to prevent engine problems
that plagued the Marines' AH-1W Super Cobra attack helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   There were two types of malfunctions: rollbacks, causing the
engine to roll back to idle; and flameouts, the sudden loss of
engine power _ different problems that can be linked to a single
cause.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1995, an AH-1W Super Cobra helicopter from Camp
Pendleton, Calif., suffered the eighth engine malfunction by the
same squadron in a little more than a year. Mechanics first
suspected water in a wiring harness, but when they took the
helicopter up, the same engine flamed out again.
</P>
<P>
   The Super Cobra has two engines, so losing one is not
necessarily critical. In 1995 and 1996, however, the Navy
investigated reports of dual engine failures.
</P>
<P>
   In one of those cases, on April 18, 1996, an AH-1W from the
Marine Corps Air Station in Iwakuni, Japan, suffered a dual engine
failure.
</P>
<P>
   Maintenance personnel in Japan checked a fuel switch. They
swapped engines. They replaced the engines. But they couldn't fix
the problem. So the engines were sent to General Electric ``for
investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   A year later, on March 25, 1997, an AH-1W from the USS Nassau
reported its No. 2 engine had failed, prompting the commanding
officer to write: ``This is the second rollback in four months on
this engine in this aircraft. ... This hazard is being addressed
... with no fix in sight.''
</P>
<P>
   By March 1997, the military had documented more than 70
rollbacks and flameouts involving the Super Cobra.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two months later, an AH-1W Super Cobra crashed in a
field near a high school in Texas, killing both Maj. Michael J.
Browne, the father of two girls and a combat veteran of Desert
Storm and Somalia, and Lt. Robert B. Straw, also a husband and
father.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't take but a word or a thought for someone to cry,''
Browne's father said. ``His wife is alone taking care of the
girls.''
</P>
<P>
   A Naval Safety Center investigation found that the helicopter
``was not safe for flight and should have been grounded'' before it
left Bell Helicopter Textron Inc. near Fort Worth, Texas. The
investigation found outstanding ``urgent'' technical directives for
work on the aircraft _ at least two of them aimed at preventing
engine failures.
</P>
<P>
   Rear Adm. Dirren, who reviewed Naval Safety Center records of
the accident at the request of the Dayton Daily News, said: ``We
blew it.''
</P>
<P>
   Crumbling afterburners
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes problems go unresolved because the military decides
the solutions are too expensive.
</P>
<P>
   By early this year, the Air Force had documented 11 in-flight
failures of afterburners on Pratt &AMP; Whitney F-100-220 engines, used
on F-15 and F-16 fighters. The afterburner, or augmentor, fits into
the exhaust section of the jet and provides extra power by
shrinking the size of the exhaust while injecting and igniting
additional fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Pieces of sheet metal called stiffeners, each welded on in 70
places, are attached to the afterburner on the F-100-220 engine to
keep it from buckling under the tremendous heat and pressure
produced by the engine.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force found that vibration and aging caused the welds to
split until eventually the afterburner cracked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nozzle and augmentor actually came off,'' said Robert May
Jr., who as propulsion product manager is in charge of engines for
the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   An afterburner used for engines on another type of F-16 is
chemically milled, or attached without welds, May said, and the Air
Force could easily have solved its afterburner problem by putting
chemically milled afterburners on its F-100-220 engines, used on
both the F-15s and F-16s.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``To retrofit this new augmentor ... is 40 to 50 million
dollars,'' May said, and that's just for the F-16s.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was put off. After all, none of the 11 in-flight
failures had caused a major accident.
</P>
<P>
   That changed this year.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 3, an F-16 piloted by a student from Luke Air Force
Base, Ariz., crashed near Gila Bend, Ariz. No one was seriously
injured, but the $20 million aircraft was destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   The next month, on March 26, another F-16 from Luke Air Force
Base crashed on private property near an Arizona freeway. The pilot
ejected and no one was injured. The aircraft was destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Both F-16s had afterburners that were attached with welds. In
each case, the afterburner broke free and the engine fell apart,
igniting a fire as flying debris ruptured the fuel lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our risk analysis shows we were in error before,'' said Maj.
Gen. Gideon, the Air Force Safety Center commander.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Derek Kaufman, a Luke Air Force Base spokesman, said the
Air Force now plans to replace the old afterburners, but it could
take several years. Until then, he said, mechanics will do more
comprehensive inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Weighing the risks
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the military's needs _ its missions _ are deemed more
important than the risks posed by safety hazards.
</P>
<P>
   ``All U.S. Air Force missions and our daily routines involve
risk,'' says a copy of ``Risk Management'' guidelines for Air Force
officers. ``Accept necessary risk required to successfully complete
the mission or task.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Avoiding risk altogether requires canceling or delaying the
job, mission or operation, but is an option that is rarely
exercised due to mission importance.''
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Eric Johnson learned this first hand.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, the aviation representative at the Pentagon for the
Army Safety Center, had his face and legs burned on Feb. 23, 1993,
when a UH-60A Blackhawk helicopter crashed in Germany, causing a
230-gallon external fuel tank to explode.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was on fire when he ran from the burning helicopter.
Another officer's clothes were still smoldering when he stumbled
from the wreckage. Four others, including Maj. Gen. Jarrett
Robertson, the deputy commander of V Corps in Germany, were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Three years before the Germany crash, investigators working for
a congressional committee warned that putting certain types of
external tanks on Blackhawks could create ``potential dangers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we found out was that because of the weight of these
things, the nose (of the helicopter) came near to touching the
ground,'' said Lawrence Dandridge, one of four General Accounting
Office investigators temporarily assigned to the committee staff.
``We also found out they were not crashworthy fuel tanks, so we
told them not to use them.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of replacing the tanks, the Army decided to better
educate pilots of potential problems in controlling the helicopter
when the tanks are mounted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess they thought the training would help fix it,'' Johnson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Four years after the Germany crash, on July 8, 1997, a Blackhawk
helicopter crashed into a stand of tall trees in North Carolina,
rupturing both 230-gallon fuel tanks and killing all eight people
aboard as the helicopter exploded into a fireball.
</P>
<P>
   The Army issued a press release blaming the accident on pilot
error. But accident investigators noted that the crew would have
survived had it not been for the external fuel tanks rupturing and
causing the fire.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate written response to the Dayton Daily News, Army
officials at the Pentagon said the external fuel tanks were
designed to be jettisoned from the helicopter and not intended to
be ``directly involved in every helicopter crash.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not likely that a tank designed with any different
specifications would have made a difference in the crash,'' the
written response says.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said tests are under way on a safer tank but that the
Army still allows the Blackhawks to fly with the old tanks.

   DAYTON, Ohio _ After an F-16 crashed into a South Carolina
neighborhood and killed a man, the Air Force assured the
congressman representing the district that the plane had been
``trouble free.''
</P>
<P>
   And records show it had been.
</P>
<P>
   The engine was another matter.
</P>
<P>
   A Dayton Daily News examination found that in the months
preceding the Sept. 13, 1988, crash, the engine had been on two
other F-16s and removed after pilots reported smoke and fumes in
their cockpits.
</P>
<P>
   On June 2, 1988, the pilot of an F-16 from Shaw Air Force Base,
S.C., reported smoke and fumes coming from behind the pilot's seat,
causing the pilot to become nauseated and his eyes to water. To fix
the problem, mechanics put a new engine on the plane, and the
problem seemed to have been solved.
</P>
<P>
   At least for that plane.
</P>
<P>
   The engine they took off the plane, number 703938, was put on
another F-16. And the following month, on July 18, 1988, the pilot
of the F-16 which now had engine 703938 reported smoke and fumes in
his cockpit, apparently caused by oil leaking from an engine fan.
</P>
<P>
   Three months later, on Sept. 13, 1988, engine 703938 was on
still another F-16, piloted by Capt. Ronald J. Garan. Shortly after
he raised the landing gear, while the engine had less than six
hours flight time since installation, Garan heard a loud bang,
followed by an explosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a violent explosion that shook the aircraft and knocked
my feet off the rudder pedals,'' he told investigators. ``I knew I
had to get out of the aircraft so I looked in front of me and I saw
trailer parks and houses everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Garan ejected, and the F-16 crashed into a residential area in
Sumter, S.C., near Shaw Air Force Base, setting a house on fire and
injuring eight people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw it (the plane) ignite and saw the fireball sweep just to
the right of the house that caught fire, and I actually saw the
windows blow out of the house,'' Garan said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the injured, William Smith, 59, was severely burned over
50 percent of his body. He died two days later.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see where the main fuselage went through the
neighborhood,'' said Michael Brodie, who watched the plane's
descent from his pickup truck. ``There were holes in several of the
houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing I saw was a man running from our right. He was
burned bad, real bad. Someone was hollering, `There is a baby.
There is a baby.' ''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. John M. Spratt told a local newspaper reporter at the
time that the F-16 was ``trouble free.'' The engine was not
specifically mentioned. Spratt's press secretary, Chuck Fant, said
in a recent interview that Spratt made the statement after speaking
to the Air Force public affairs office.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. Francis C. Gideon Jr., commander of the Air Force
Safety Center, acknowledged that all three incidents involved
engine failures. But, he said, unlike the two prior incidents,
there was no report of smoke and fumes in the cockpit prior to the
Garan crash.

   (Eds: Updates first day's budget lines.)
</P>
<P>
   Cox News Service is preparing to distribute another compelling
investigative series on the U.S. military by The Dayton Daily News.
``Falling From the Sky,'' a six-day series that starts Sunday, Oct.
24, concerns the recent rise in military air crashes and its
causes. The Daily News found that the U.S. military routinely sends
planes and helicopters in the air that it knows are plagued with
deadly safety problems. The series is based in part on
never-before-seen information from three databases from the Army,
Navy and Air Force safety centers.
</P>
<P>
   Publication of the stories is likely to have a national impact.
The Daily News won a Pulitzer Prize in 1998 for a series uncovering
problems with the military's health-care system.
</P>
<P>
   For ``Falling From the Sky,'' CoxNet will produce a Focus page
for Sunday, Oct. 24, based on the comprehensive first day of the
series. That page will be available Friday afternoon for a download
charge at www.nytsyn.com/pageexpress.
</P>
<P>
   Those stories, and subsequent days' offerings, will also be
available on the New York Times wire. The Sunday and Monday
installments will moveon Friday, Oct. 22. Subsequent stories will
move daily next week. Photos and graphics accompany each
installment.

   CRASH-MAIN _ The U.S. military routinely sends planes and
helicopters in the air that it knows are plagued with deadly safety
problems. An 18-month Dayton Daily News examination found that
planes keep falling from the sky for the same reasons, that
hundreds of crashes can be linked to maintenance errors, and that
the military keeps hundreds of crashes off its yearly accident
totals. (Carollo, Dayton Daily News)
</P>
<P>
   CRASH-SC _ After an F-16 crashed into a South Carolina
neighborhood and killed a man, the Air Force assured the
congressman representing the district that the plane had been
``trouble free.'' But a Dayton Daily News investigation into the
crash found that in the months preceding the Sept. 13, 1988, crash,
the engine had been on two other F-16s and removed after pilots
reported smoke and fumes in their cockpits. (Carollo, Dayton Daily
News)
</P>
<P>
   CRASH-HOW _ The series wouldn't have been possible without the
release of three databases from the Army, Navy and Air Force safety
centers. Also, how to find the full report at daytondailynews.com.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Oct. 25: Day 2
</P>
<P>
   CRASH-METAL _ A type of metal is in the middle of an
investigation involving a series of crashes of the Army's CH47
Chinook helicopter. The story came to light when a whistleblower,
working at a former factory in Springfield, Ohio, found flaws in a
metal used to construct gears that power the helicopter's huge
rotor blades. Investigators now suspect that seven crashes may be
linked to the metal. (Carollo, Dayton Daily News)
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Oct. 26: Day 3
</P>
<P>
   CRASH-MAINTENANCE _ The system used to maintain military
aircraft is itself broken. Hundreds of crashes can be linked to
work performed by unqualified mechanics, parts installed
improperly, engines overhauled incorrectly and inspection records
that were falsified. (Carollo, Dayton Daily News)
</P>
<P>
   CRASH-TIMMER _ A Hamilton, Ohio, man died in a helicopter that
should have been grounded. The test result that would have grounded
the craft arrived in the field three weeks after the crash.
(Carollo, Dayton Daily News)
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Oct. 27: Day 4
</P>
<P>
   CRASH-COUNT _ Since 1980, the military has omitted hundreds of
aviation incidents from its official accident rates, the statistics
used by Congress and the public to assess military safety.
(Carollo, Dayton Daily News)
</P>
<P>
   CRASH-BUTTON _ Among those not counted: the 1997 crash involving
Capt. Craig D. Button, who took off from an Air Force base in
Arizona and crashed an A-10 jet filled with bombs into a Colorado
mountain. (Carollo, Dayton Daily News)
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Oct. 28: Day 5
</P>
<P>
   CRASH-CONTRACTORS _ Private companies that do business with the
government, including large aircraft manufacturers, are protected
against many lawsuits by the government-contractor defense. The
defense means companies have limited liability even when they
produce defective products. (Carollo, Dayton Daily News)
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Oct. 29: Day 6
</P>
<P>
   CRASH-KNIGHTS _ The military's handling of the hydraulic
problems on the CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters is typical of the way
it handled numerous other mechanical failures in many types of
aircraft. Costs are weighed against risk. Some 70 incidents,
spanning more than 11 years, can be traced to hydraulic problems on
the Sea Knights. (Carollo, Dayton Daily News)
</P>
<P>
   CRASH-MCNALLY _ Anatomy of a crash. A detailed analysis of a
1994 crash in California involving a pilot named Randall McNally.
No cause was ever determined, but a Daily News examination found
that mechanics had detected problems with the plane's stabilizer
augmentor eight days before the crash. The augmentor was never
found. (Carollo, Dayton Daily News)

   DIST:Kansas City school district goes to federal court Friday to
ask for a hearing to have the state named once again as a defendant
in the desegregation lawsuit. That means, if granted, Judge Whipple
could halt the accreditation withdrawal. The Desegregation
Monitoring Committee's semi-annual status report on the Kansas City
School District was filed Friday, too. It's expected to be a harsh
assessment of district operations. Phil O'Connor. 25.
</P>
<P>
   COLLEG (with DIST: The state Board of Education's decision to
strip the Kansas City district of accreditation is creating lots of
anxiety for high school students who fear the decision could put a
crimp in their college plans. Seniors aren't affected because the
accreditation wouldn't disappear until the end of the school year.
But underclassmen are worried. Although the principal at Lincoln
College Prep told students in an assembly Friday morning not to
worry, they're still anxious. Some college admissions people say
they look more critically at test scores when students come from
unaccredited schools, such as home schools. And test scores are one
of the areas in which district students do poorly. Students at Van
Horn High School have scheduled a protest for Tuesday over the
accreditation decision. Photo. Lynn Franey and Kevin Hoffmann. 30.

school and Family Services officials for comment; they said little
on Thursday. Also will call to get more information on the mother,

   BALL: A perfect story for Saturday, the day the World Series
begins: As a researcher on the Human Genome Project, Phil Ozersky
knows that just a tiny deviation can change a person entirely. So
what if that white sphere had been struck at an angle 5 degrees
greater? What if the wind would have been blowing 5 mph stronger?
Than maybe Ozersky wouldn't have caught Mark McGwire's 70th home
run ball a year ago and seen his life change. He became one of the
most sought-after and one of the most hated men in town when he
decided to sell it. But he learned about what makes life important.
His story is part of a new book called simply ``The Ball.'' Oscar

</P>
<P>
   BBO-WORLDSERIES (Atlanta) _ The Yankees have won two of the past
three World Series, the Braves are in their fifth World Series of
the decade, but have won only one so far. Is the winner of this
Series the team of the '90s? And is there more pressure on the
Braves, considering their many post-season opportunities that have
ended in defeat? By Murray Chass.
</P>
<P>
   BBO-WORLDSERIES-VECSEY-COLUMN (Atlanta) _ Sports of The Times
column: Bobby Cox had as many bad knees as his teammate, Mickey
Mantle _ just not as many home runs. Most people do not remember
that Cox escaped the minor leagues after eight long years, and in
1968 and 1969 he played third base for a Yankee team that had
fallen on hard times. ``We had players like me,'' Cox says,
alluding to his .229 and .215 batting averages. ``But it was great
to be around Hall of Famers like Whitey Ford and Mickey Mantle. My
first season was Mickey's last. He could still play.'' By George
Vecsey.
</P>
<P>
   BBO-WORLDSERIES-YANKS (Atlanta) _ During last year's World
Series, it was the cloud of Bernie Williams's upcoming free-agent
negotiations hovering over the Yankees. This season, the Yankees
have even more concerns on the minds as they prepare to face the
Braves: What will happen to David Cone, who doesn't seem to have a
future in the Bronx? What about Jorge Posada, who finds himself the
catcher the starting pitchers generally don't want behind the
plate? And what about the lingering bad feelings connected to the
unofficial demotion of General Manager Brian Cashman? The Yankees
are the favorites in this Series, but there all sorts of tensions
lurking beneath their surface. By Buster Olney.
</P>
<P>
   BBO-WORLDSERIES-BRAVES (Atlanta) _ Braves feature, probably
focusing on Tom Glavine, the Game 1 starter. In 1996, Glavine would
have started Game 7 against the Yankees, if the Yankees hadn't
closed out the Series in Game 6. So, in effect, Glavine is picking
up where the Braves left off three years ago. By Judy Battista.

<P>
   The first outside-the-box candidate for Massachusetts governor
in 2002 is Steve Grossman, a philanthropist who resuscitated the
Democratic National Committee for Bill Clinton and who now ponders
resurrecting the Massachusetts party, loser of three straight
gubernatorial races.
</P>
<P>
   At present, the field probably consists of three Irish guys
who've hung around the State House for decades, and another Irish
guy who's broken his term limits pledge to run for another
congressional term. There's no woman in the mix _ yet _ and no
Italian-American, despite the success of Italo candidates winning
the governorship and the mayor's job in the state's three biggest
cities.
</P>
<P>
   But Steve Grossman has the Jewish-liberal niche nailed down. If
you're looking for a well-heeled businessman with a national track
record in party operations and a truly impressive list of
charitable, educational, and assorted do-gooder causes, this
53-year-old father of three sons may be your man.
</P>
<P>
   As yet another Princeton man in politics (Bill Bradley and Steve
Forbes are Olde Nassau grads) who holds an MBA from Harvard and is
a successful business executive, Grossman will have pots of dough
to go with his experience in political organizing and fund-raising.
And while it is true that money men and backroom guys rarely make
the leap from behind the curtain to out-front candidate, Grossman
shows signs of being the kind of coalition-builder the Democrats
have not had at the top of their last three state tickets.
</P>
<P>
   John Silber, Mark Roosevelt, and Scott Harshbarger are all
estimable chaps in many ways, but none succeeded in bringing to
heel the sullen and surly satraps of the various fiefdoms that make
up the Democratic Party hereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   As a deeply devout heir to a prosperous family business in
envelopes, printing, and design _ a business that has blossomed
under his stewardship _ Grossman has made a steady, unspectacular
climb up the rungs of the civic leadership ladder.
</P>
<P>
   He's chairman of the Brandeis University trustees, and sits on a
dozen other boards (including the Museum of Fine Arts, Children's
Hospital, Combined Jewish Philanthropies, Anti-Defamation League,
Robert Kennedy Memorial). He's been chairman of the Massachusetts
Democrats, the Democratic National Committee from '97 to '99, and
formerly headed AIPAC, the domestic Israel lobby that exercises
great clout in Congress. He's married to Barbara Grossman, a
professor and theater historian at Tufts.
</P>
<P>
   He's never been elected to public office, which used to be a
drawback, but is now almost a sine qua non for outside challengers
who bring success from the private sector into races for high
public office. He is a demon organizer: ``You write the script for
a general election victory by how many Democrats and unenrolled
voters you can organize and get to the polls on primary day.'' Both
Silber ('90) and Harshbarger ('98) lost what Grossman calls
``winnable elections because of the virtual absence of party
unity.''
</P>
<P>
   While not officially declared, Grossman is recruiting top-flight
national political talent skilled in building turnout using
precinct organization, phone banks, and direct mail. He is a
student of the biz. He'd like to see experiments on the local level
with weekend elections and interactive voting via the Internet in
order to boost civic involvement. ``We're still voting the way we
were when we were an agrarian society,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to run,'' Grossman allows. ``I think I have a good
story to tell.'' His ancestors came to Massachusetts from Eastern
Europe at the turn of the century. Max Grossman, his grandfather,
and then Edgar Gossman, his father, drilled into him ``the
importance of always reinvesting in the life of the community.''
The family ethic, ``try to enrich, enlarge, and enlighten the life
of the community,'' is writ large in the Grossman clan.
</P>
<P>
   MassEnvelopePlus is a union shop of 120 employees, who average
20 years with the company. Grossman's salesman's drill translates
to politics: ``Every voter has to be treated like a customer, with
all that entails, if you want to keep his or her trust.''
</P>
<P>
   He approaches vote-seeking in businesslike fashion. ``People
want to follow people who can clearly define a sense of priorities.
We have a right to expect better than `ordinary,' better than
`run-of-the-mill.' '' Citing his stewardship at the DNC, where he
reduced the debt from $18 million to $5 million in the teeth of the
Clinton scandals gale, Grossman said, ``I have certainly
demonstrated that I can throw a punch. I think I can demonstrate
that I can take a punch. I really want to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   He'll get that opportunity. The early line on the Democratic
field to confront the plodding Cellucci administration's record is
that both legislative leaders, Senate President Tom Birmingham and
House Speaker Tom Finneran, will explore the race, as well as
Secretary of State William Galvin, and US Representative Marty
Meehan of Lowell.
</P>
<P>
   Grossman will not be the kind of candidate whose bid revolves
around the State House. His model is the 1982 campaign of Mike
Dukakis, a triumph of field organizing that toppled incumbent
Democrat Ed King in a high primary turnout of around 50 percent. He
knows he'll have to take some flak along his flight plan. ``I will
know when I'm a serious candidate, when people start training the
heavy artillery on me.''
</P>
<P>
   While Grossman does not have the service stripes of the
aforementioned four, neither is he tainted by State House longevity
or congressional hangover. Moving up statewide from either
background is problematic.
</P>
<P>
   Grossman's career is grounded in a Jewish tradition of community
service. He recites by heart a biblical proverb: ``If you offer
your compassion to the hungry and satisfy the famished creature,
then shall your light shine in darkness and your gloom shall be
like noonday. . . . And you shall be known as the rebuilder of
ancient ruins, the restorer of dwelling places, the repairer of the
breach.'' (Isaiah: 58)
</P>
<P>
   If the Democrats are looking for someone to take them back to
the ancient ruin of the Corner Office, here's a man who says he has
a plan.

</P>
<P>
   John Silber, Mark Roosevelt, and Scott Harshbarger are all
estimable chaps in many ways, but none succeeded in bringing to
heel the sullen and surly satraps of the various fiefdoms that make
up the Democratic Party hereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   As a deeply devout heir to a prosperous family business in
envelopes, printing, and design _ a business that has blossomed
under his stewardship _ Grossman has made a steady, unspectacular
climb up the rungs of the civic leadership ladder.
</P>
<P>
   He's chairman of the Brandeis University trustees, and sits on a
dozen other boards (including the Museum of Fine Arts, Children's
Hospital, Combined Jewish Philanthropies, Anti-Defamation League,
Robert Kennedy Memorial). He's been chairman of the Massachusetts
Democrats, the Democratic National Committee from '97 to '99, and
formerly headed AIPAC, the domestic Israel lobby that exercises
great clout in Congress. He's married to Barbara Grossman, a
professor and theater historian at Tufts.
</P>
<P>
   He's never been elected to public office, which used to be a
drawback, but is now almost a sine qua non for outside challengers
who bring success from the private sector into races for high
public office. He is a demon organizer: ``You write the script for
a general election victory by how many Democrats and unenrolled
voters you can organize and get to the polls on primary day.'' Both
Silber ('90) and Harshbarger ('98) lost what Grossman calls
``winnable elections because of the virtual absence of party
unity.''
</P>
<P>
   While not officially declared, Grossman is recruiting top-flight
national political talent skilled in building turnout using
precinct organization, phone banks, and direct mail. He is a
student of the biz. He'd like to see experiments on the local level
with weekend elections and interactive voting via the Internet in
order to boost civic involvement. ``We're still voting the way we
were when we were an agrarian society,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to run,'' Grossman allows. ``I think I have a good
story to tell.'' His ancestors came to Massachusetts from Eastern
Europe at the turn of the century. Max Grossman, his grandfather,
and then Edgar Gossman, his father, drilled into him ``the
importance of always reinvesting in the life of the community.''
The family ethic, ``try to enrich, enlarge, and enlighten the life
of the community,'' is writ large in the Grossman clan.
</P>
<P>
   MassEnvelopePlus is a union shop of 120 employees, who average
20 years with the company. Grossman's salesman's drill translates
to politics: ``Every voter has to be treated like a customer, with
all that entails, if you want to keep his or her trust.''
</P>
<P>
   He approaches vote-seeking in businesslike fashion. ``People
want to follow people who can clearly define a sense of priorities.
We have a right to expect better than `ordinary,' better than
`run-of-the-mill.' '' Citing his stewardship at the DNC, where he
reduced the debt from $18 million to $5 million in the teeth of the
Clinton scandals gale, Grossman said, ``I have certainly
demonstrated that I can throw a punch. I think I can demonstrate
that I can take a punch. I really want to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   He'll get that opportunity. The early line on the Democratic
field to confront the plodding Cellucci administration's record is
that both legislative leaders, Senate President Tom Birmingham and
House Speaker Tom Finneran, will explore the race, as well as
Secretary of State William Galvin, and US Representative Marty
Meehan of Lowell.
</P>
<P>
   Grossman will not be the kind of candidate whose bid revolves
around the State House. His model is the 1982 campaign of Mike
Dukakis, a triumph of field organizing that toppled incumbent
Democrat Ed King in a high primary turnout of around 50 percent. He
knows he'll have to take some flak along his flight plan. ``I will
know when I'm a serious candidate, when people start training the
heavy artillery on me.''
</P>
<P>
   While Grossman does not have the service stripes of the
aforementioned four, neither is he tainted by State House longevity
or congressional hangover. Moving up statewide from either
background is problematic.
</P>
<P>
   Grossman's career is grounded in a Jewish tradition of community
service. He recites by heart a biblical proverb: ``If you offer
your compassion to the hungry and satisfy the famished creature,
then shall your light shine in darkness and your gloom shall be
like noonday. . . . And you shall be known as the rebuilder of
ancient ruins, the restorer of dwelling places, the repairer of the
breach.'' (Isaiah: 58)
</P>
<P>
   If the Democrats are looking for someone to take them back to
the ancient ruin of the Corner Office, here's a man who says he has
a plan.

THE VIEW FROM THE STREET IS BRUTAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The violence on the screen is shocking: A handful of young men
set upon another young man in a field and beat him into the dirt.
</P>
<P>
   They pound him, fists flailing, raining blows. They kick him as
he lies there; one leans down and punches him full in the face.
Hard.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a scene out of ``Fight Club''. It is the real world
of gang activity on Fort Worth's south side _ a new member being
``beaten in'' to membership, as captured by J.B. Sanchez, a
20-year-old Cassata High School graduate who, for the past four
years, has been a member of the SUR Trece (Southern United Raza
Thirteen) gang.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, I've seen everything from domestic violence to
straight-up someone getting their brains blown out in front of
me,'' Sanchez says. ``I've seen everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Sanchez is showing the nation via ``Fight for Your Rights:
Through My Eyes,'' the latest installment of MTV's ``Fight for Your
Rights: Take a Stand Against Violence,'' a yearlong anti-violence
campaign. Sanchez is one of three young people given video cameras
by the music network and told to film examples of how violence
affects their lives. The 30-minute show premieres Sunday at 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   This past Tuesday, Sanchez was in Washington, D.C., speaking
about his experiences at a congressional conference on youth
violence. Sanchez was part of a panel discussion that followed the
premiere of ``Through My Eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Also included in the program is footage and commentary from
19-year-old Betina Lynn, who was wounded in May 1998 in a shooting
at her Oregon high school, and Rick Godoy Jr., a 23-year-old from
Long Island who is trying to come to terms with the abuse he
suffered at the hands of his father, with whom he still lives.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the three stories make for an intense, fascinating
program _ albeit one that may well leave a viewer with a desire to
know more about the three. Lynn talks about feeling alienated from
her peers even as she's leaving for her first semester of college;
Godoy's segment is heartbreaking as he confronts his father about
his beatings (which regularly escalated to 50 ``hits'' or more with
a belt) and recognizes that he, too, may become violent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good to hear those kids,'' Sanchez says of the
conference. ``We were all there to stop one thing; people are tired
of this, but nobody knows how to stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez says he joined the gang to feel a sense of family; he
was adopted, and even though he had a ``good life'' and enjoyed
gymnastics and journalism, ``blood mattered, and I didn't know any
people that were my blood. The gang became my substitute family. I
wanted a family atmosphere. A few of them became my real family;
one is my son's godfather.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez says a friend was killed in a drive-by shooting several
years ago while he was in the next room; his footage shows other
gang members proudly displaying their weapons and one showing where
bullets from another drive-by are lodged in the walls of his house.
It also shows another gang member being ``beaten out'' of the gang.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned violence can happen anywhere to anybody _ it's just
the shape the world's in,'' he says, adding that the random
shootings at Columbine High School and Fort Worth's Wedgwood
Baptist Church are ``the worst type of crime. They're so hard to
prevent. It's the outcasts. It's impossible to tell who is going to
go off.''
</P>
<P>
   J.B.'s perspective changed Feb. 11, 1998, the day his son,
Isaiah, was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking, `You have a child in your hands _ God gave you
the responsibility,' '' he says. ``We pollute kids with violence,
and I decided my son was not going to go that route.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, he says, he just wanted to ``slow down'' his gang
activity (''I was haywire''), but then he decided he had to ``step
away.'' So this summer, he took a job as a salesman at a Fort Worth
company and is settling into the life of a working joe, even as he
and his wife, Carmen, prepare for the arrival of a second son, due
Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   He is still part of SUR Trece, but not active, and he is
weighing the options of continuing to work, enrolling in a
community college or joining the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, my job is to take care of my family,'' he says.
``All the gang members want to see the best for him (Isaiah). But
if it comes down to it, if they're getting jumped or something, I'm
gonna be right there. They're my heart, and they always will be.''

WRITABLE CD-ROM DRIVES PUT TO TEST 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the most fascinating aspects of the computer revolution
is how individual devices once considered overpriced and esoteric
become mainstream, gotta-have-it features. We've seen this with
modems, scanners, color printers and digital cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the latest hot peripheral is the writable and rewritable
CD-ROM drive. Besides the fact that prices have dropped through the
floor, several trends are driving this demand.
</P>
<P>
   The first is that once people purchase a scanner or a digital
camera, they want some kind of removable storage on which to place
these images. CD-ROM disks are nearly permanent.
</P>
<P>
   Another is music _ people have long wanted a way to make copies
of music CDs just as they can with cassette tapes, and writable
drives now make that affordable. Add to that the MP3 craze: Folks
want to transfer tunes downloaded from the Net onto CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there's the good, old-fashioned need for a decent
backup system. CD-ROM disks can hold up to 650 megabytes, and while
a single one won't hold all of what's on today's multi-gigabyte
hard drives, they still have greater capacity than many other types
of removable drives.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these drives can work with disks that let you write to
them once as well as disks that allow rewriting and erasing. They
can also read standard CD-ROM disks.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at three writable CD-ROM drives you can add to
your system. All use the Enhanced IDE interface and are designed to
be installed internally.
</P>
<P>
   All the drives reviewed here include Adaptec's DirectCD
software, which lets you use the drive just as you would any other
drive on your system. You can drag and drop files onto its icon in
My Computer, create folders, even install software onto it.
</P>
<P>
   The drives also come with a ``light'' version of Adaptec's Easy
CD Creator, which lets you make audio disks and better manage the
process of storing files on a data disk. (While this software is
nice, if you get serious about using a writable/rewritable drive,
I'd strongly recommend getting the latest version, Easy CD Creator
Deluxe 4. It has a friendlier design and nifty new features,
including the ability to get song information off an Internet
database.)
</P>
<P>
   _ ZipCD, $210, Iomega Corp.: The maker of the popular 100- and
250-megabyte Zip disk drives has duly noted the writable CD-ROM
revolution. While Zip drives remain more popular than writable
CD-ROM drives, Iomega is covering its bases with this model.
</P>
<P>
   The ZipCD can record on a write-once CD at four times the speed
of the original CD-ROM drive. It also can rewrite and erase on
rewritable disks at that speed. And it can read standard CDs at 24
times the speed of the first CD-ROM drive. You'll see these
specifications usually expressed in this type of notation: 4x4x24.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Adaptec software, it includes a copy of Adobe's
Photoshop LE, Avery Media's label-making software and Iomega's
QuikSync backup software.
</P>
<P>
   The ZipCD comes with a minimum amount of printed documentation.
Most of the information is in the form of a multimedia presentation
on how the drive works and how to install it. The information is
very basic, though more details are available as Web page files
saved to your hard drive. I thought some of the information was
over the heads of most novices, particularly a crucial page that
tells you how to configure your new drive as either a master or
slave so it co-exists peacefully with other drives in your system.
</P>
<P>
   The drive performed well, though it significantly extended the
boot time on my PC. The BIOS seemed to be trying to figure out what
the drive was. Once the system was running, though, the drive
worked flawlessly.
</P>
<P>
   _ CD-Writer Plus 8210i, $249, Hewlett-Packard: Of the three I
tried, this one was my favorite. It was very easy to install, ran
flawlessly and was very friendly to my system.
</P>
<P>
   Like the ZipCD, this also has a multimedia presentation on CD
that shows you how to install the drive. However, rather than have
you figure out on your own whether to set the drive up as a slave
or master, it examines your PC's configuration and makes
recommendations as to how best to install it. You can then print
this out as a kind of customized instruction sheet.
</P>
<P>
   The 8210i also is a 4x4x24 drive, and its performance was almost
identical to that of the ZipCD. However, it didn't slow down my
PC's bootup routine.
</P>
<P>
   It comes with both the Adaptec programs, as well as CD
label-making software from Neat-O; Broderbund's Multimedia
Organizer; HP Simple Trax, a backup program; and HP Disaster
Recovery, which lets you create a CD to be used in case of a system
failure.
</P>
<P>
   _ CD-ReWriter CRW4432A, $215, Acer Peripherals: This drive is a
great buy. Not only is it faster in reading traditional CD-ROMs
than the other two drives, but it also has more internal memory
that can keep recording glitch-free.
</P>
<P>
   Acer's drive is a 4x4x32 drive, with a maximum read speed of
32X. That's as fast as a lot of standard CD-ROM drives sold in PCs
today.
</P>
<P>
   It also comes with eight megabytes of internal buffer, which can
help prevent what are known as buffer overruns. This is when the
data being written to the disk fills up the buffer, usually
resulting in corrupted files. Although having more memory won't
guarantee this won't happen _ particularly on older, slower
computers _ it can help.
</P>
<P>
   However, this drive comes with terrible documentation in a
poorly written manual that is a bad translation from an Asian
language into English. I'd only recommend this drive for more
experienced users who don't need much handholding.
</P>
<P>
   The drive also comes with a minimal amount of software _ it's
got the Adaptec titles, and that's it. However, it was the only
drive of the three to come with Windows 3.1 drivers.
</P>

SENDING MASS E-MAILS NOT AGAINST LAW IF YOU ONLY SEND TO THOSE WHO
WANT IT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Q: I am an 82-year-old novice at e-mail and I need
some help. About 18 months ago I established a Web site where I
sell queen bees and beekeeping books. Now, I want to send e-mail
advertising to my customer list, but I do not know the rules,
regulations and laws governing such use of e-mail. When I called my
provider, a technician told me that sending unsolicited advertising
by e-mail is illegal. However, I get a monthly letter from Lycos.
How do they get away with sending thousands of copies of their
advertising? Can you help me? Will you help me?
</P>
<P>
   A: The person at your Internet service provider told you wrong.
Sending unsolicited commercial e-mail, or spam, is not illegal.
There's no legislation against it. However, it probably is against
your provider's rules. So, if you do it, you can be kicked off that
particular service.
</P>
<P>
   But, the key word here is ``unsolicited.'' If you have customers
who want to get an e-mail from you about your business, that's not
spam. The key is to get their permission.
</P>
<P>
   At Lycos, when you signed up for access to certain areas of that
Web site, there probably was a check box that indicated you were
willing to receive the Lycos newsletter. You can do the same. When
someone buys from you online, set up some way to ask whether they
would like to receive information from you about your business.
Those who say ``yes'' can get the e-mail; those that say ``no''
won't.
</P>
<P>
   It's important that you let people know that you are going to
send them mail if they indicate they want it. In the mail you send
them, always indicate that you're willing to remove them should
they request it _ and then honor that request.
</P>
<P>
   You also should work with your provider so he or she knows what
you're doing. If you're sending out several thousand e-mails _
which, given the nature of your business, is probably not the case
_ you should make sure your provider can handle it. Make contact
with the provider and explain exactly what you're doing and ask for
help. That way, there are no surprises. Internet providers hate
surprises of this kind.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, regarding the legality of unsolicited commercial
e-mail ... You may see at the bottom of some spam a notice saying
the e-mail complies with a federal legislation. This is bogus, an
attempt to make the recipient think there's nothing to be done
about receiving the spam. There was a proposed bill in the Senate
that would have regulated spam, but it went nowhere. Don't be
fooled.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, remember never to respond to the instructions for
removing yourself from a spam list that appears at the bottom of
many spammers' e-mails. This is, in almost all cases, a way for the
spammer to verify that an e-mail address is good.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Thanks to the stories on MP3 music files that have appeared
in the Chronicle over the past few months, I've really gotten into
them. They sound great! But I have been trying to download some of
my favorite tunes from pirate sites without much luck. Some say to
upload something _ when I do, I still don't have access.
</P>
<P>
   A: Remember that when you grab a song from a site that illegally
posts music _ usually taken off a compact disc _ you're violating
copyright laws. By downloading these songs, you're denying the
artists who made them royalties.
</P>
<P>
   You have a right to convert songs on a CD to MP3 files _ done
using a type of software program known as a ``ripper'' _ for your
own personal use, so long as you also own a copy of the CD.
However, once you give away that file, you've violated the artist's
rights.
</P>
<P>
   On sites such as MP3.com, which are full of songs for the
taking, most of the artists essentially have given up some of their
rights, hoping to get greater exposure for their music.

<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ A team of federal investigators suspect that four
CH-47D Chinook helicopter accidents that killed seven people may be
linked to faulty gears manufactured in Chicago and at a now-defunct
factory in Springfield, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Records, released after being kept under seal for years by a
federal court, show investigators also have tried to link at least
three other crashes that killed 13 people to the gears. Each of the
helicopters that crashed had gears made with a metal that
investigators suspect may contain a potentially deadly flaw.
</P>
<P>
   In August, armies worldwide grounded hundreds of Chinooks after
a British Royal Air Force maintenance facility in Scotland found
grinding cracks in gear parts made with the same metal.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Army initially grounded its entire fleet of 466
CH-47Ds, the most Chinooks ever put down at one time.
</P>
<P>
   The metal, Vasco X2M, is used on gears that power the eight
25-foot rotor blades on the Chinook. Vasco was first used on
helicopter gears by Boeing, which patented a process to heat-treat
the metal.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation into the failures of Vasco-made gears in the
CH-47D helicopters illustrates one of the most significant
anomalies in military aviation: Private aircraft companies are
allowed to help _ relied on heavily in many cases _ determine the
official causes of military aviation accidents, even though the
same companies can face up to hundreds of millions of dollars in
civil judgments and penalties that may hinge on what the official
causes of the accidents are determined to be.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, as Boeing was faced with lawsuits questioning the
safety of its products, it was allowed to examine evidence and play
other key roles in helping the Army decide if those same products
were endangering the lives of American service personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing contracted with SPECO Corp. of Springfield, now in
bankruptcy, and Litton Precision Gears of Chicago, now Boeing
Precision Gears, to manufacture the gears.
</P>
<P>
   Litton used SKF Industries of Philadelphia and MRC Bearings of
Jamestown, N.Y., to manufacture bearings for the gears. It is those
bearings that triggered the current groundings.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government began investigating after Brett Roby, an
inspector at SPECO, warned of cracks in gears made with Vasco. Roby
eventually lost his job in a management reorganization, and filed a
lawsuit in May 1995 against Boeing in federal court in Cincinnati
under the federal False Claims Act. The act encourages government
whistleblowers and other citizens to report government contractor
fraud by offering a reward _ in the Roby case up to 25 percent of
what the government recovers.
</P>
<P>
   The suit alleges that Boeing, the world's largest aircraft
manufacturer, violated federal and common law because it ``sold, or
caused to be sold,'' defective helicopter gears to the Army.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department intervened in Roby's lawsuit in April
1997. Although Roby's lawsuit deals only with SPECO-made gears, the
investigation has expanded to include accidents involving aircraft
with gears made at Litton.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Army and Boeing defended Vasco.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Vasco is manufactured according to specifications and
made into gears correctly, the Army has verified that it is safe
for use in the helicopters,'' a prepared statement from the Army
says.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing officials deny that any Litton-made gears were linked to
crashes. They acknowledged that some SPECO gears and gear parts
machined at MRC were faulty, but they blamed the problem on human
error, not on Vasco.
</P>
<P>
   From time to time, manufacturers produce faulty gears, Boeing
officials said, but inspections are supposed to identify bad gears.
Both SPECO and MRC failed to identify the problem gear parts
through inspections, the officials said, and that caused the
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should have been caught,'' said Boeing attorney Mitchell
S. Ettinger during an interview at Boeing's corporate office in St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   John Bozogan, vice president of quality assurance and
engineering for MRC Bearings, said the company performed
inspections exactly as it was told by Boeing. But, he added: ``At
the time, Boeing was modifying the inspection requirement.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the grinding cracks that led to the current
grounding, Bozogan said: ``We are concerned that we did not find
them.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Fatal crashes through the years
</P>
<P>
   The first crash involving the CH-47D came in 1985, in Honduras.
The helicopter was destroyed but the crew escaped with no injuries.
An Army report found that two gear parts made of Vasco broke into
eight pieces each, and Boeing identified what it believed were
``grinding cracks'' on one of the Litton-made gears. The Army
report found that the gear problems did not cause the accident, but
the service ordered better inspections to identify cracks in gears.
</P>
<P>
   Three months later, on July 11, 1985, a Boeing test pilot and
three other crew members took one of the first CH-47D models for a
test flight from the company's plant in Pennsylvania. At 5,000 feet
over New Jersey, the pilot heard a loud explosion coming from the
rear of the helicopter, and smoke filled the cockpit. He parachuted
to safety, but two other crew members were killed, one hit by a
rotor blade as he tried to parachute.
</P>
<P>
   Roby's attorneys and federal investigators suspect the 1985 New
Jersey crash was linked to Vasco gears manufactured by Litton in
Chicago. However, Boeing officials said the New Jersey crash was
caused by a transmission problem, not a gear problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no proof it was a gear failure,'' said Ettinger,
Boeing's attorney.
</P>
<P>
   A CH-47D crashed near Chico, Texas, northwest of Dallas in
February 1988, killing 10 people and permanently injuring six
others. Paul Patricio lost both of his hands in the fire, and his
face and much of the rest of his body were severely burned. He
filed a lawsuit against Boeing in 1989, and won a settlement for an
undisclosed amount, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The military never determined the exact cause of the 1988 crash.
Army investigators noted that problems found on a gear were
``interpreted differently by several engineers and investigators,''
but the Army said those problems did not cause the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing officials said the Texas crash had nothing to do with
gear failure, and investigators involved in the ongoing probe
disagree over whether the crash could have been caused by the Vasco
gears.
</P>
<P>
   Ten months later, on Dec. 8, 1988, all five crew members died
when another CH-47D crashed in Honduras. Federal investigators
suspect a Vasco gear was responsible for the crash, and Boeing
officials acknowledge that a gear did fail. However, they said the
gear failure itself did not cause the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something acted on that gear and caused it to fail,'' Ettinger
said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing settled a lawsuit filed by the families of the three dead
airmen, according to their attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Congress held hearings into the Chinook crashes in 1990. A team
of congressional investigators, in a report titled, ``Let the Flyer
Beware,'' found that the Army was ``occasionally slow to react to
serious aircraft problems, tending to wait until disaster strikes
before addressing them.'' Often, even when the Army does address a
problem, the report says, it is a ``Band-Aid solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Two months after the hearings, a Chinook flying at night over
Fort Campbell, Ky., lost power and crashed, killing three of the
five people on board. The family of the instructor pilot, Chief
Warrant Officer Dale W. Tate, sued Boeing, claiming the cargo hook
was defective. The court dismissed the case in 1995, but Tate's
attorney, Brian Alexander of New York, is trying to get the civil
case reopened because, in light of the current federal
investigation, he suspects the cause could be linked to Vasco
gears, not to the cargo hook.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and Roby's attorneys also are interested
in the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tate crash sequence is, in many respects, similar to the
crash sequence of other Chinooks,'' says a request by the Justice
Department to get records from Tate's civil case.
</P>
<P>
   The federal court in Cincinnati has ordered Boeing to allow the
Justice Department to inspect certain gears from the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   Two more CH-47D crashes occurred in the early 1990s: on Jan. 11,
1991, in Saudi Arabia during Desert Storm, and June 24, 1993, in
Maryland. Both helicopters had gears manufactured at SPECO.
</P>
<P>
   There were no deaths in either accident, although some
passengers and crew members escaped the burning helicopter in Saudi
Arabia by climbing through broken windows. Both the Army and SPECO
blamed the crash on manufacturing defects in a SPECO-made gear, and
vowed to step up inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing also acknowledged that a gear was to blame in the
Maryland accident, but said it was due to human error: A SPECO
worker, they say, made a mistake trying to remove a sharp edge from
a gear surface.
</P>
<P>
   (Eds: END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Whistleblower's story
</P>
<P>
   Roby, who now lives in Arkansas, once stopped the production
line at SPECO because of what he said were structural flaws in the
metal used to construct the gears.
</P>
<P>
   According to Roby, in 1993, two high-ranking SPECO officials
asked him to stop testing gears. He said he had found flaws called
continuous innergranular carbide networking, a problem similar to a
crack on a piece of wood or plastic that can cause splitting or
cracking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I let my managers know we had this condition,'' Roby said.
``We had three out of three that were bad. I was starting to get
nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   He then contacted the Defense Criminal Investigative Service
(DCIS) office in Dayton, a civilian agency empowered to investigate
fraud, waste and abuse in the Department of Defense. Three months
later, he was laid off.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Justice Department later joined as a plaintiff in the
Roby lawsuit, which is pending.
</P>
<P>
   In February of this year, workers at a Royal Air Force
maintenance center in Scotland found cracks on a gear part, an RAF
spokesman said. The part, which is made of Vasco, holds bearings in
a gear assembly, or raceway, on which the bearings move.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a Boeing representative on site,'' the RAF spokesman
said. ``It was brought to his attention.''
</P>
<P>
   The RAF grounded its Chinooks, called Mark 2s by the RAF, on
Aug. 7 or 8, the RAF spokesman said. The U.S. Army grounded its
fleet Aug. 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``We determined the risk to be very high,'' said Mark J. Jeude
of the Army's Aviation-Engineering Directorate.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 27, the Army returned half its Chinook fleet to duty but
restricted them to 80 percent engine power.

TRENDS MAY LEAVE TRAVEL AGENTS ZERO 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JIM BARLOW 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ How low can it go? How about zero? That's the amount
of commission airlines will someday pay travel agents to sell
tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines have long sold 80 percent of their tickets through
travel agents. Now, they're doing their best to directly sell
tickets to most customers, cutting out agents. Five years ago,
travel agents received a straight 10 percent commission on air
tickets. Then came commission cuts and caps. Last week, major U.S.
airlines cut agent commissions to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why. It used to cost airlines 22 percent of the retail
ticket price for distribution. That included selling, delivering
and accounting for the tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Compare that with a 6 percent distribution cost in manufacturing
and 2 percent in banking.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
AIRLINE ADVANCES PUT SQUEEZE ON &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then technological advances cut costs, allowing airlines to save
money by cutting out travel agents:
</P>
<P>
   _ Long-distance telephone deregulation: Airlines no longer had
to staff telephone reservation centers everywhere they operated.
Long-distance costs plunged, so airlines could have fewer, but more
efficient, centers located in areas where land, buildings and labor
costs were less.
</P>
<P>
   _ Electronic ticketing: Paper airline tickets had to be mailed
or hand-delivered _ usually by a travel agent. Now, half of all
tickets are paperless. The passenger gets a confirmation number,
the same system used by hotels for decades. Take the number to the
airline counter, flash personal identification and get a boarding
pass. Issuing the boarding pass completes the bookkeeping process.
The airlines don't have to pay big bucks to reconcile computer
records with millions of paper tickets.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Internet: It costs the airlines pennies, instead of
dollars, to distribute their tickets when you book directly on
their Internet Web sites. That's why many airlines are giving those
who book on their Web sites special deals _ 10 percent off the
regular price, Internet-only deals or extra frequent flier miles.
Internet Web sites also allow airlines to bypass the existing
computerized reservation systems that charge the airlines for
booking tickets.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
DIFFERENT CLASSES, DIFFERENT EFFECTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The commission cuts will hit different classes of customers in
different ways:
</P>
<P>
   _ Large corporations: Many of these already are paying so-called
net fares. That is, the travel agency gives the corporation its
commission and charges a booking fee. The commission cuts mean
corporations will put pressure on agents to renegotiate those
booking fees. The travel agents will in turn put pressure on their
corporate customers to book more tickets on air carriers that give
the agency a price cut on tickets. Airlines are willing to make
those deals if they offer substantially more business. The
agency-corporate client customer struggle is complicated by the
fact that airlines now let corporations deal directly with them by
setting up in-house travel agencies owned by the corporation.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle will force the large travel agencies to become even
more efficient, or see their deals with large corporations
disappear.
</P>
<P>
   _ Small businesses and consumers buying air-only travel: Most
travel agents now are charging those customers fees of $10 to $15
for the booking. Expect those fees to jump by $10. These
travel-agent clients will have essentially the same choice many of
us make when we hire someone to do our income taxes. Is it
worthwhile to spend the time learning and using the Internet to
find the best fare? Or do we pay a fee to the travel agent to do it
for us?
</P>
<P>
   _ Vacation travelers: Those who buy package deals _ air plus
hotel or resort stays, rental cars and the like, will see little
change due to the commission cuts. Airlines are still paying
commissions of 10 percent or more on air fares when they are part
of a package. They don't want to take the time necessary to deal
with these kinds of customers who require much more hand-holding
than the business traveler who knows where he wants to go and when.
</P>
<P>
   So, what's going to happen to travel agents? The efficient ones
_ and that generally means big ones _ will be able to provide
cost-effective services to business travelers and will survive.
Smaller travel agencies will increasingly shift their business away
from air travel to vacation packages and cruises that still carry
commissions of 10 percent or better.
</P>
<P>
   However, inevitably, the distribution revolution also will move
into the vacation business. Leisure travel agencies must be more
than order-takers. They must really know the kinds of travel they
are selling so well that clients are willing to pay for their
expertise.

VOLUNTEERS GATHER UNDER SIX FLAGS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The labor market is tight and it's hard for employers
to find good workers. So, where can a company turn when it has to
hire a lot of workers for a short time?
</P>
<P>
   Six Flags Astroworld in Houston has hit upon a winning formula _
it finds charitable groups to bring in volunteers to work each
weekend in October during the park's Halloween promotion. The
volunteers serve food, work the cash registers and sell souvenirs
in the gift shop in exchange for a donation to their organization.
</P>
<P>
   For every worker, Astroworld donates between $5.50 and $7 an
hour, depending on how long the group has been working at the park
and how many of the scheduled volunteers show up for each shift.
</P>
<P>
   It's an appealing way to raise money for groups that are tired
of going door to door selling candy, greeting cards and wrapping
paper, said Linda Aleman, director of human resources for Six Flags
Astroworld.
</P>
<P>
   The park has a regular staff during the summer, but when the
park cranks up for Halloween, it's a struggle to find workers just
for the weekends, Aleman said. She estimates she has about 200
volunteers working each Friday, Saturday and Sunday during October.
</P>
<P>
   SixFlags has 117 registered groups, ranging from churches to
sporting teams to sororities that are doing everything from raising
money for a trip to buying baseball uniforms. Typically, each group
provides 10 to 20 volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   To make it even more appealing, the park also gives five
complimentary tickets for every 100 hours worked with at least 90
percent coming as promised, Aleman said. The group can then raffle
the tickets during a charity auction or give them away to their
volunteers who have logged the most hours.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
PARK PLEASED WITH PROGRAM &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten great people,'' said Aleman. Some have had so
much fun that they've come back as regular employees.
</P>
<P>
   And the program has been popular with the supervisors in the
park, Aleman said. Some of the managers request certain groups as
well as particular volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   The volunteers must be at least 16 years old, undergo a criminal
background check and adhere to the same rules that govern
Astroworld employees: no fingernail polish, no beards except if the
wearer has a medical condition and no multiple earrings.
</P>
<P>
   The volunteers are also asked to wear khaki bottoms _ skirt,
pants or shorts _ and navy blue shirts. They all wear a button
identifying them as a volunteer and that they're raising money for
their group.
</P>
<P>
   Because they aren't considered employees, Astroworld is required
to pay any employment taxes.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a great way to raise money, said Scott Nichols,
assistant pastor and minister of music for the Irvington
Pentecostal Church in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, church members began spending their free time at
Astroworld to raise $20,000 to send their choir to Detroit. That
worked so well that now the church is trying to raise enough money
to landscape and buy computers for its school, the Irvington
Christian Academy.
</P>
<P>
   The church should earn about $15,000 between July and the end of
October, said Nichols, which will go a long way toward buying a
computer for every student.
</P>
<P>
   It's not hard to get volunteers, Nichols said, even the 70 that
Astroworld has requested for Oct. 30. It just took about 10 minutes
out of the church service to get 55 signed up, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols, who has logged hours of picking up cigarette butts,
said he often goes to the park with his volunteers so he can give
them breaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want them to have an enjoyable experience so they
volunteer again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Funny circumstances can pop up, he said. For example, lawyers
and accountants who volunteer are sometimes supervised by
16-year-olds, he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SOME ARE NOT AMUSED &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As attractive as the volunteer opportunity is to some groups,
it's a turnoff for other organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Lori Miller, president of the Parent Teacher Organization at
Herod Elementary in Houston, floated the idea of working at
Astroworld at a recent PTO meeting. The response was less than
enthusiastic, with parents offering to ``write a check,'' instead
of spending their free time making snow cones.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't be making enough money to do it,'' Miller said
later. She said she would give it more consideration if the wages
were higher _ something on the order of $10 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our PTO does too much already,'' she said. ``It's hard enough
to get (parents) to come to school and read to kids.''

   ``Falling From the Sky'' is the result of an 18-month
examination by the Dayton Daily News. The full series is available
at www.daytondailynews.com/projects.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the findings are based on information from the
military's own records, obtained through more than 150 requests
filed under the Freedom of Information Act. The federal law gives
citizens access to government records.
</P>
<P>
   Using the law, the newspaper obtained several computer databases
from the safety centers that investigate aviation accidents for the
Army, Air Force and Navy, which is also responsible for
investigating Marine Corps accidents. The databases, which have
never before been released to the public, contained hundreds of
thousands of records on more than 87,500 military aviation
incidents that occurred since the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The databases released to the newspaper included information
typically kept secret by the services, including the identity of
parts suspected of playing roles in accidents. The newspaper used
the databases to link a single part to more than one accident.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper also obtained dozens of lengthy records of
aviation accident reports from military offices around the world.
</P>
<P>
   More than 150 people were interviewed in 13 states. Among those
interviewed were pilots and other crew members, mechanics, civilian
and military accident investigators, military commanders and
attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper received technical advice from former and current
military mechanics, pilots, accident investigators and other
aviation experts.
</P>
<P>
   Among the experts used by the newspaper was former Army
helicopter pilot Edward Monhollen, who worked for the Army Safety
Center investigating accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Monhollen, a helicopter pilot in Vietnam, now investigates
military and civilian aviation accidents for the federal government
and private attorneys through his aviation investigation firm in
San Antonio, Edward Mohhollen &AMP; Associates.
</P>
<P>
   The series was written by Russell Carollo, a staff writer of the
Dayton Daily News. He previously co-wrote a series on problems with
the military's health-care system that won the 1998 Pulitzer Prize
for national reporting.

NEW BREED OF HORROR THRILLERS CARVING OUT BETTER STORYLINES,
GRAPHICS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By TRICIA SERJU-HARRIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A new breed of vampires, assorted demons and even a
few zombie cows are carving a new image for the horror genre in
computer games.
</P>
<P>
   No longer a nightmarish afterthought in the multibillion-dollar
computer gaming industry, horror-themed games are capable of
creating the terrifying scenes once only found on the big screen.
</P>
<P>
   A few highly anticipated titles this year include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Nocturne ($49.99, Gathering of Developers and Terminal
Reality), which will hit stores by Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gabriel Knight III: Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damned
($49.95, Sierra Studios), arrives this fall.
</P>
<P>
   _ Vampire: The Masquerade _ Redemption (price not available,
Activision and Nihilistic Software) is expected this winter.
</P>
<P>
   Recent releases, such as System Shock 2 by Looking Glass
Studios, Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver by Eidos Interactive, or the
darkly humored role-playing game Dungeon Keeper 2 by Bullfrog
Productions Ltd. also have pumped up the genre.
</P>
<P>
   The stale storylines, sluggish technology and lame characters
that held back horror games in the '80s and early '90s are gone. In
the best of these games, players can expect original characters,
breathtaking settings, and the advanced software that allows
boogeymen to jump out of your monitor.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SHADOWS AND GHOULS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This year, the game that shows how far technology and visuals
have come is Terminal Reality's Nocturne.
</P>
<P>
   The storyline isn't complicated. Players are thrown into a world
where things that go bump in the night are horrifyingly real.
Werewolves, vampires, gargoyles and zombies threaten mankind. It's
up to the ``Stranger'' to keep chaos from reigning.
</P>
<P>
   But what has made Nocturne one of this year's most talked about
computer games is the technology that makes it seem like a horror
movie.
</P>
<P>
   Nocturne's lights, shadows, and fog come close to mimicing real
life. The locations are lush, and nearly photo realistic. The
animation is fluid and natural. Characters, cloth and objects all
behave based on real physical rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these elements hasten the player's willing suspension of
disbelief,'' said Drew Haworth, an artist on the Nocturne
development team. ``So, when you introduce unnatural monsters into
such a realistic environment, you can't help but consider them
real, and therefore very frightening.''
</P>
<P>
   All those effects were possible because of the game engine,
which took Terminal Reality President Mark Randel three years to
develop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nocturne is made up of many different smaller engines, each
with a specific function,'' said Randel, who is lead programmer on
Nocturne.
</P>
<P>
   Players are sent out by a government agency called the
Spookhouse to explore one of four global missions: cemeteries in
France; a ruined castle in Germany; the sinister evil of a small,
Texas town; or the creepy back alleys of Chicago. Each mission is
presented as a self-contained cinematic episode with its own story.
</P>
<P>
   Though the full version of the game is just now making its way
to retailers, two demo versions of the game were available through
magazines or from a free download online.
</P>
<P>
   Nocturne is a scary game, no bones about it. This is the one
game where you'll run from zombie cows in Redeye, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The second demo, set in Al Capone's Chicago, pushes fear to a
higher level. The game's engine makes you hear footsteps before you
see anything. You jump at shadows. And all around you are
Frankenmobsters _ Capone's goons brought back to life a la
Frankenstein.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heroic pulp is a curiously unexplored genre that Terminal
Reality recognized as perfect for gaming,'' Randel said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the dark set designs that make Nocturne a future genre
classic came from films such as ``Batman'' and ``The Crow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually got the Crescent Theater design (in the Chicago
act) from an actual movie theater I used to work at during high
school. It had been around since the 1920s and had tons of hiding
places,'' said Den Johnson, senior digital artist at Terminal
Reality. ``It's a very scary place in real life, too.''
</P>
<P>
   While most games out there will run on low-end machines, this
game demands screamingly powerful hardware. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; For example, to fully enjoy the game, a powerful graphics card
such as ATI Technologies' Rage Fury (at $299) is required. The
32-megabyte graphics card can handle the power and detail of games
like Nocturne.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
BLOOD IS THE LIFE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The creators of Gabriel Knight III used a different approach to
grab players by the throat. &UR;  &LR; Writer Jane Jensen relied on a
heart-pounding storyline here.
</P>
<P>
   This third episode, ``Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the
Damned,'' takes place in a small village and valley in rural
Europe. A child is kidnapped and it's up to the hero, Gabriel, to
solve the crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``GK is a series that takes story very seriously,'' Jensen said.
``It is closer to (the television series) `X-Files' than to (id
Software's) Doom. And like `X-Files,' the players got very attached
to the main characters, Gabriel and Grace. There's a lot of
bantering and smart aleck dialogue in GK that tempers the scary
storylines. It's a combination that people seem to like.''
</P>
<P>
   The series has undergone drastic changes, from its early
beginnings as a straightforward computer adventure to a confused
period when most games turned to full-motion video for a while. Its
current incarnation uses highly rendered 3-D art.
</P>
<P>
   ``When given a chance to do my own series, I wanted to use a
mystery format because in mystery the detective interrogates
people, examines evidence, visits crime scenes, does many things
that translate very well into interactive puzzles,'' Jensen said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike ``Sins of the Father'' or ``The Beast Within,'' this
Gabriel Knight adventure lets the player control the view _ you
move it around to check out things _ as in LucasArts' Grim
Fandango. Just click on an object to have your character respond to
it.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, a lot is lost in this departure from the popular series.
The hunt for clues gets caught up in the camera angles the player
has to make.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the animation used here doesn't seem to match Jensen's
dark storyline. It's too easy to be reminded you're playing a game
when you look at the hero's cartoon-like features.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the tension of uncovering the game's scheme will keep you
hunting for clues.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
DUNGEON MASTERS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If all this strikes you as just too dark, there are games that
have taken a lighter approach.
</P>
<P>
   In Dungeon Keeper 2, humor plays a key role _ the darkest
element here is that the player gets to be the bad guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are loads of games where players get to play the
goody-two-shoes heroes out to slay the bad, old monsters,'' said
Nick Goldsworthy, a producer at United Kingdom-based Bullfrog.
</P>
<P>
   But in Dungeon Keeper 2, you're in control of those monsters.
``In fact you control their entire realm _ a nasty, dark dungeon,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The graphics, sound and music really bring this to life. Your
evil minions grumble aloud or cackle aloud, sounding suspiciously
like they're up to no good. You'll need to keep your eye on them.
</P>
<P>
   The original Dungeon Keeper looked more like cartoon animation.
But the 3-D used in its sequel puts it on par with today's games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Visually the games are stunningly different,'' Goldsworthy
said. ``DK2 is a fully 3-D game, though you don't need a 3-D
(graphics) card to play. The original DK looked much more cartoony.
DK2 is as real as a virtual-dungeon can get.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Buster Olney's scouting report on the World Series: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; YANKEES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Pitching &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The experience of the Yankees' starters should be a major factor
in this series, as they take advantage of the reckless
aggressiveness of the Braves' lineup. Orlando Hernandez, David Cone
and Andy Pettitte will all throw off-speed pitches and breaking
balls to the fringes of the strike zone, or just out of the strike
zone, and try to tempt the Braves' hitters. Roger Clemens, who
starts Game 4, pitched poorly against Boston and Atlanta pounded
him for six runs in six innings in July, but Clemens pitched much
better at Yankee Stadium (3.56 ERA) than on the road (6.20) this
year. Mariano Rivera and Ramiro Mendoza were exceptional against
the Red Sox, but the other middle relievers _ Jeff Nelson, Mike
Stanton, et al _ have been erratic, and are a concern as the World
Series begins. Watch the match-ups of Hernandez versus Ryan Klesko
(5-for-5 in his career) and Andruw Jones (2-for-4).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Hitting &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter, as always, is the standard-bearer; Jimy Williams,
the Boston manager, felt that Boston's failure to cope with Jeter
and Chuck Knoblauch was a major factor in the Red Sox defeat. Paul
O'Neill, recovering from a broken rib, swung better in the last
games of the league championship series, but he still isn't driving
the ball with his usual authority. The Yankees should be successful
in driving up the pitch counts of Tom Glavine, John Smoltz and
Kevin Millwood in particular, and they will need the middle third
of their lineup _ Tino Martinez, Darryl Strawberry, Scott Brosius,
Ricky Ledee _ to capitalize on opportunities created by the top of
the order. The Yankees' matched up poorly with Boston's left-handed
relievers late in games.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Defense &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Just when Manager Joe Torre finally dealt with the Chuck
Knoblauch issue head on and decided to remove him in the late
innings, Luis Sojo's availability is now a question mark. But
Knoblauch's confidence seems to come and go, and after dealing with
his throwing problems publicly this week, he seemed far more
relaxed; earlier this year, he played much better after talking
about it. O'Neill and Ledee will have trouble in the expanded
outfield of Turner Field. The Yankees' pitchers do a poor job of
holding on runners, and when opposing runners steal _ and the
Braves will be aggressive _ it's usually the fault of the pitchers
most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; X-factor &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' hitters are good at making adjustments, and it may
be that if the World Series lasts five, six or seven games, the
veterans in Torre's lineup will adjust to the Atlanta left-handers,
as they become more familiar with them. John Rocker, Mike
Remlinger, Terry Mulholland might have a far more difficult time
late in the series.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ATLANTA &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Pitching &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' starting pitching has been the foundation of the
team for years, and that hasn't changed, especially when Atlanta
plays at home _ the Braves had a 3.21 ERA at home, compared to 4.06
on the road. Tom Glavine, the Game 1 starter, is like the Yankees'
Andy Pettitte in that he needs the home plate umpire to call
strikes on pitches low and away to right-handed batters; otherwise,
he might be in trouble. Greg Maddux can be dominant, but he also
has been knocked around some this year. Kevin Millwood is probably
the best of the Braves' pitchers right now, and he will pitch Game
3 and would pitch Game 7. The Braves' bullpen is much deeper than
that of the Yankees, with middle men Russ Springer, Kevin
McGlinchy, Terry Mulholland and Mike Remlinger. John Rocker is the
closer and when he threw first-pitch strikes this year, batters hit
just .136 against him.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Offense &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' hitting philosophy is patience; the Braves' is
aggressiveness. Almost all of them are free swingers, and almost
all of them are capable of stealing bases. Atlanta did manage to be
patient in the first inning of Game 6 against the Mets and scored
five runs against Al Leiter, and they need to be more patient
against the crafty Orlando Hernandez and the relentless David Cone,
who rarely gives them pitches to hit. Once they get on base, just
about everybody in their lineup, except for the catcher Eddie
Perez, will look to run and create offense. The Yankees, like other
teams, probably will try to make sure that Chipper Jones, the
likely MVP winner in the NL this year, doesn't beat them; they'll
pitch around Jones and go after Brian Jordan and Ryan Klesko, who
follow Jones. They'll all remember the dangerousness of Andruw
Jones, who slugged two homers in the first game of the World Series
in `96.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Defense &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have a great outfield, with Gerald Williams, Andruw
Jones and Brian Jordan, and all of the can throw. Bret Boone is the
best second baseman not named Roberto Alomar, and the catcher Eddie
Perez has a reputation for working well with pitchers; that's what
kept him in the big leagues for years. But Chipper Jones has not
played as well at third this year _ sometimes he seems to have
trouble on the hard infield of Turner Field _ and Walt Weiss has
minimal range at shortstop. Ryan Klesko is a terrible first baseman
who probably would be replaced late in games, when the Braves had
the lead, by Brian Hunter, who is much better.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; X-factor &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The weakness of the Yankees' pitching staff clearly is its
middle relief, but to get into that, the Braves must find a way to
build the pitch counts of the Yankees' starters. They have to be
more patient, win at least one or both of the first two games at
Turner Field and establish themselves right away.

SPORTS COLUMN: THE ATLANTA MANAGER WAS ONCE A YANKEE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Bobby Cox had as many bad knees as his teammate,
Mickey Mantle _ just not as many home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Most people do not remember that Cox escaped the minor leagues
after eight long years, and in 1968 and 1969 he played third base
for a Yankee team that had fallen on hard times.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had players like me,'' Cox says, alluding to his .229 and
.215 batting averages. ``But it was great to be around Hall of
Famers like Whitey Ford and Mickey Mantle. My first season was
Mickey's last. He could still play.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox still enjoys the only city and the only franchise he ever
represented as a player. He walks around New York on his
reconstructed knees and sometimes people recognize his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are on television a lot,'' explains this very noticeable
employee of the Turner empire.
</P>
<P>
   His main identification is man who has managed 2,725 games with
the Braves and the Toronto Blue Jays and then the Braves again, and
another 98 in the post-season. Saturday night the Braves will take
on his old team in the first game of the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Many public fignd to forget the humble people they once
were, have great gaps in the tapes of their lives. Take it from
somebody who covered the Yankees back in those bad old days: Cox
was a decent guy, scuffling to hang on in the major leagues,
grateful just to have the chance. And at the age of 58, Cox has
never forgotten the insecurities of the marginal ball player.
</P>
<P>
   The optimistic public persona of Manager Cox is directly traced
to Ralph Houk, his Yankee manager, who was known for his Pollyanna
pronouncements. When Marshall Bridges served up a grand slam in the
1962 World Series, Houk took a defiant puff on his cigar and
informed reporters, ``He only made one bad pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   One did not laugh at such pronouncements from Houk, whose
nickname to lazy headline writers was Major, because of his rank
from a battlefield commission during World War II. Once asked if
losing a doubleheader was the worst thing that ever happened to
him, Houk calmly replied, ``Yeah _ except for the Battle of the
Bulge.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, Houk rarely spoke of the war, but his
background still showed in the way he stuck up for his civilian
troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the pleasure to play for Ralph, and he was as supportive
as they come, and a real tough guy,'' Cox said the other day. ``But
he knew the value of communication, with players who normally
didn't play. The superstars always take care of themselves. It's
the other guys you have to worry about.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox was one of the other guys. His knees gave out in the spring
of 1970, and he agreed to finish his career with the Yankees' AAA
team in Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that, I was going to go back to college in California,''
Cox said. ``My agenda was to be a high-school football coach.''
</P>
<P>
   He was days away from leaving baseball when he was sought out by
Lee MacPhail, the Yankee general manager and one of the more
genteel lifers in the baseball industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lee said there was going to be an opening in Fort Lauderdale,
and he thought I should take it,'' Cox recalled. ``I always wanted
to manage, but I always felt somebody should ask you first. He
convinced me, and it was the best decision I ever made.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever gracious to people he knew way back when, Cox makes sure to
thank his two mentors whenever he sees them, or can send a message
to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really loved managing right away,'' Cox said. ``I approached
it that I was going to get everybody on my team to the major
leagues. I almost killed myself. We had an extended camp in Fort
Lauderdale into June, and I had 45 players and was pretty much by
myself. There was a workout at 10 a.m.and another at 3 p.m. and
then the regulars at 5 p.m. I loved every minute of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was living in the clubhouse, because I didn't have a lot of
money and I was there so much anyway,'' Cox said. ``One of the
executives said it didn't look so great sleeping in Ralph's office,
so I took a motel room.''
</P>
<P>
   He was a game over .500 the first year. And, yes, four of his
pitchers would have brief shots in the major leagues. ``Not bad for
the Florida State League,'' Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   He moved up the Yankee chain until he managed the Braves from
1978 through 1981, (replaced by Joe Torre, who wound up in the
playoffs his first season), Toronto from 1982 through 1985 and then
he became general manager of the Braves, returning to the dugout in
1990, always remaining a player's manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can get on a player, and have, as good as anybody in the
world,'' Cox said. ``But certainly when we leave, we understand
each other, and it hasn't been printed and nobody knows about it.
At least most of the cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Most. Nobody has missed Cox's annoyance with John Rocker for
taking on the vicious fringe of Shea Stadium, although Cox notes
that some of the language ``would make the mildest man want to
fight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves seem to regard Cox with the same professional
appreciation that the Yankees had for Houk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Bobby does a great job with the tactical side of the
game,'' said Tom Glavine, who will start Saturday night. ``What
makes a good manager is calling the right players, and then it's up
to the players to execute. But it's just a joy to play for the guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been times when I know I've pitched a terrible
game, and I read the newspaper and I'm seeing some of the things
Bobby says and I'm wondering if he was watching the same game,''
Glavine added.
</P>
<P>
   Cox was purposefully polite about Bobby Valentine of the Mets in
the past series, but he eagerly calls Torre a ``class act,'' and
praises George Steinbrenner for his intensity. Anybody looking for
a grudge match will not find it here. Bobby Cox sounds proud of
their stewardship of his old team.

IT TAKES MONEY TO RUN A CAMPAIGN, BUT IT TAKES IDEAS TO GET MONEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sooner or later, it's bound to happen. Some candidate will drop
out of the race for the Republican presidential nomination and will
NOT blame his failure on the front-runner's fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   On second thought, maybe it won't happen. Maybe the money thing
is just too convenient an excuse.
</P>
<P>
   Even Elizabeth Dole fell into the trap the other day when she
shut down a presidential campaign that was going nowhere fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line remains money,'' said Dole, explaining that
she couldn't compete with the record-setting fund raising of Texas
Gov. George W. Bush or the virtually unlimited financial resources
of publisher Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be futile to continue,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   We might have expected something more elegant and less
self-serving from Dole, who is unquestionably one of the classiest
individuals ever to wade into the muck of electoral politics. Then
again, maybe she figured that if it was good enough for Lamar
Alexander and Dan Quayle, it was good enough for her.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, it's hard to begrudge Dole the meager comfort of a
ready-made and seemingly plausible pretext for the precipitous
collapse of a campaign that she and others had assumed would be
highly competitive.
</P>
<P>
   This ``money is the message'' alibi has become the official
face-saving device for unsuccessful candidates in recent years.
Dole has as much right to use it as a rationalization for the
failure of her campaign as anyone else does.
</P>
<P>
   It's all part of the current preoccupation with campaign finance
reform as the would-be solution to every problem associated with
politics and government. A candidate who has little or nothing to
offer can distract the public from his or her lack of ideas by
whining about his or her lack of cash.
</P>
<P>
   Since money is considered the source of all evil in politics,
candidates who don't have money can pass themselves off as victims
of the predatory money machine.
</P>
<P>
   This money-is-the-problem theory undeniably makes a great excuse
for politicians who can't get their campaigns off the ground. As a
basis for analyzing what's going on in an election campaign,
however, it's about as valuable as a future-book wager on Quayle
for president.
</P>
<P>
   We're always hearing how awful it is that certain candidates are
forced to drop out of the race before a single citizen ever gets a
chance to step into the voting booth.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel that bucks are becoming more important than the
ballot,'' Republican presidential candidate John McCain told The
Associated Press after the Dole campaign bit the dust.
</P>
<P>
   Many pundits _ and many politicians who have trouble raising
money _ talk about the fund-raising aspect of seeking office as if
it's an illegitimate part of the political process. But where do
these folks think the money comes from?
</P>
<P>
   It's true that Bush has raised nearly $60 million _ but he
didn't get that money from some mysterious kingmaker who decided
that Bush should be president and wrote a check to make it happen.
Yes, Bush relies in large part on a network of experienced
fund-raisers but most of the money is contributed in amounts of
$1,000 or less _ often much less _ by individuals who believe that
he is the best person to represent the Republican Party in next
year's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true about Al Gore and Bill Bradley on the
Democratic side. The millions they have raised are the result of
the esteem and/or loyalty they command among potential
contributors.
</P>
<P>
   Whether they are drawn to a candidate's positions on issues or
his aura of leadership or merely the perception that he is
``electable,'' campaign contributors are voting with their wallets.
</P>
<P>
   McCain commented that Elizabeth Dole lost ``the battle of
bucks'' rather than the ``battle of ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Dole had truly been competitive in the battle of ideas _
if she had articulated compelling ideas and shown an ability to
sell them to the electorate _ then she'd have been competitive in
the battle of bucks as well.

OPEN AND SHUT CASE OF PUBLIC BUSINESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J.R. LABBE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was clear this wasn't going to be a run-of-the-mill
professional seminar when the CEO of a non-profit group created to
invest billions of public dollars complained about having to
conduct business in the open.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists from across the state convened in Austin this month
for the annual Freedom of Information conference sponsored by the
Freedom of Information Foundation of Texas. This year's meeting was
titled Access 2000, and topics ranged from how the Internet is
affecting access to information to horror stories from reporters
and citizens who had the devil of a time getting their hands on
what is supposed to be public information.
</P>
<P>
   In a ``What happens when public contracts go private?'' seminar,
Thomas Ricks, president and CEO of the University of Texas
Investment Management Co., said that the edict from the UT Board of
Regents _ his bosses _ for his group to abide by the open meetings
laws that govern state agencies is going to stifle honest
discussion about the company's activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is public access vs. the quality of
deliberations,'' Ricks said. ``Open meetings are scripted, devoid
of fireworks and controversy. The level of deliberation will suffer
because of the risk of having it misconstrued or scrutinized by the
media. Open meetings will drive critical self-evaluation
underground.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, isn't that a fine how-do-you-do from a man overseeing more
than 11 billion ``public'' dollars.
</P>
<P>
   A little background may be in order for readers not familiar
with UTIMCO.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Texas System is funded through the Permanent
University Fund, money that comes from surface income and mineral
receipts from state-owned land. That money is partly doled out for
academic programs and facilities in the University of Texas System
and the Texas A&AMP;M System. The rest is invested in equities, stocks
and bonds that generate dividend and interest income.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1996, the UT Board of Regents, with the blessing of the
state Legislature, created UTIMCO, a non-profit management
corporation whose only job is to invest the endowment and operating
funds that are under the purview of the regents.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, UTIMCO has handled more than $11 billion of
University of Texas endowment money as well as the PUF.
</P>
<P>
   The first three years of UTIMCO's existence have been rocky ones
when it came to relations with folks wanting to know how and with
whom that money was being invested. Decisions were made behind
closed doors, even though the fund managers were working with
billions of public dollars. It wasn't until this summer that the UT
Board of Regents finally directed UTIMCO to abide by the same open
meetings rules that every other state agency has to follow.
</P>
<P>
   But it's clear from Ricks' comment Oct. 8 that he's less than
happy about this development.
</P>
<P>
   The need for savvy investment of state money isn't at question.
Texas' institutions of higher learning should be able to enjoy the
same benefits from the booming economy and red-hot investment
markets that private investors have seen in this decade. That's one
of the reasons for Proposition 17 on the Nov. 2 ballot. It will
allow more flexibility in how the Permanent University Fund is
invested, revising a more than 120-year-old constitutional
provision that strictly limits the Board of Regents from taking
advantage of today's economic and investment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Prop 17 isn't the problem; the vehicle that the board of regents
is using to make those investments might be.
</P>
<P>
   UTIMCO held its first open meeting on Sept. 22, 1999, more than
three years after the investment mechanism was formed.
</P>
<P>
   In the dark days _ days when information about how investments
were being decided was unattainable _ serious questions arose about
relationships between board members and the companies that received
millions of dollars of state money for investment purposes. The
Houston Chronicle has been dogged in its pursuits of open meetings
for UTIMCO. In a, article March 22, 1999, the Chronicle reported
that UTIMCO directed $252 million to private investment funds run
by friends and associates of board chairman Tom Hicks.
</P>
<P>
   His name is certainly familiar to professional sports fans as
the owner of the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, Hicks was not pleased by the Chronicle's
coverage, accusing the newspaper of constructing ``an elaborate and
false scheme to explain a series of completely separate
transactions.''
</P>
<P>
   But it hasn't just been those pesky media people questioning
UTIMCO's operations. State auditors expressed concerns about the
potential for conflicts of interest for UTIMCO's board members and
criticized the secrecy of its investment decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because private investments ... may create subtle
relationships among the parties involved, strong controls are
needed to ensure that potential conflicts of interest are
adequately identified, resolved and disclosed,'' the Chronicle
reported as findings of state auditors in a 1996 report.
</P>
<P>
   Without question Hicks is a adroit businessman, and his presence
on the UTIMCO board, along with eight other highly qualified men
and women, is an asset to the state.
</P>
<P>
   But Texas voters must be able to serve as the check and balance
as to how public dollars are being invested. State appointments
must not become opportunities to feather one's nest, or the nests
of friends and business associates. The only way to assure that
that doesn't happen is to keep meetings and records open.
</P>
<P>
   The media's ``scrutiny'' of UTIMCO's activities is being done on
behalf of all Texans. Mr. Ricks, get used to it.

CARVING OUT A HIDEAWAY WHERE IT'S ALREADY HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Oct. 24) 
(jt) 
 By ANNE RAVER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I've been spending a lot of weekends down at the family farm in
Maryland sitting on a knoll overlooking a field of soybeans that
slopes down to a stream that winds through the woods.
</P>
<P>
   There's a great blue heron living somewhere nearby. I see it in
the evenings, flapping slowly along the edge of the trees. Now and
then, a hawk will sail over the field, looking for mice and voles.
Sometimes I hear its high-pitched ``screee-screee!'' from the
trees. Is it talking to its mate? Warning off other predators? Just
celebrating the light filtering through the canopy?
</P>
<P>
   I've wandered over these fields since I was a little girl. The
curves of the hills are as familiar to me as the lines of my own
body. But now, I'm looking at everything with new eyes.
</P>
<P>
   I've decided I want to build a house on this knoll, on the farm
my family has lived on for 200 years. A simple house so molded to
the land that a person walking down the old farm road would be
surprised to see it come into focus. Should it be shaped like a
small, weathered barn, I wonder, with big doors that roll open to
let in the light? Or should it be an earth house with a sod roof
that could be planted with meadow grasses? Maybe Maryland is too
muggy, too heavy with clay for such a design.
</P>
<P>
   Why not power it with a little windmill? And the sun, now that
solar cells are cheaper and smaller. And when the mosquitoes start
biting, I think ``screened porch'' _ but that doesn't go with a
barn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe you should put an old trailer down there and live on
that hill for a while,'' said a friend who built her own house on
family land in Vermont 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Then I would learn important things I've never really noticed
all these years. Exactly how the light slants through the trees
that act as a hedgerow at the top of the field. Where the water
drains during a hard rain falling on heavy clay soil. How hot it
gets in summer, how buggy, how dry, how dark. There are no lights
from roads or other houses down there, just the moon and the stars.
</P>
<P>
   And now I will get to know them, lying on my back at night,
charting the course of Cassiopeia and Orion. I'll know where the
sun rises from behind the trees in the winter, and where it comes
up in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   I'll hear the first peepers start their chorus from the wet spot
at the bottom of the field, where my grandfather built a drainage
system. Two generations later, the channels are worn, the stones
are in disarray, the wetland is reasserting itself. And I think how
nice it would be to encourage a wet meadow here, full of tall
grasses and redwinged blackbirds.
</P>
<P>
   I don't want any gardens, in the usual sense, around the house.
For one thing, the deer would eat them. But that's not the real
reason. I just don't want to change the character of the place. I
want to keep this patchwork of agriculture rolling out from all
sides of my house: the burnished, cinnamon fields of soybeans; the
feed corn, drying to a pale platinum; the newly plowed land, as
crumbly as chocolate cake, where the string bean vines were just
turned under and winter wheat was planted.
</P>
<P>
   The land's productivity is part of its powerful beauty, and
perennial beds would not do here. They belong up around the old
farmhouse and barns, where there is plenty of room for roses and
lilacs, a whole field of ornamental sunflowers, a new asparagus
patch, and kitchen garden. That is where the clan gathers, for
scrapple and eggs, ham and biscuits and talk, talk and more talk.
My mother somehow keeps track of four children, 11 grandchildren
and all their dogs, lovers and friends.
</P>
<P>
   But down in the meadow, snuggled up against the trees, will be
my little retreat. Big enough for a friend or two, and maybe
another dog. A big kitchen and a wood stove. A very loud stereo. A
place where I can cut up a little (maybe more than a little).
</P>
<P>
   I've imagined this house for years. I've lived in parts of it,
on a salt marsh in Ipswich, Mass.; by the Nissequogue River in St.
James, on Long Island. I almost bought a barn on Shelter Island one
year. And an acre of land on Long Island the next. But every time I
almost cinched the deal, that little hill in Maryland kept tugging
at my heart.
</P>
<P>
   So now I'm just saying yes. And it feels good and solid, as if
I've landed. It's not just a house I will be building. I want to
bring city kids here, and local children, too, to make dams in the
stream and to try to find the spring peepers who stop peeping,
maddeningly, when you stalk them.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they will help me plant a bird habitat around my earth
house: hawthornes, crab apples, American cranberry, viburnums and
witch hazels. Cedars, too, and something good for shade, like a
sugar maple.
</P>
<P>
   The woods by the stream are more beautiful than any garden.
Autumn clematis blooms all over the blackberry brambles and
multiflora roses. A grove of walnut trees edges the stream, and a
sycamore leans so low over the bank I can sit on its mottled trunk
and dangle my feet over the water. I could add some dogwoods and
redbuds, a little shadblow, maybe. And I don't want to clean up too
much. The animals wouldn't like it.
</P>
<P>
   The deer know the best places to cross the stream, and when I
follow their trails, I discover things, like the turtle who lives
on a little island where a fallen tree has dammed the water, making
it deep enough to teach a kid from Red Hook up in Brooklyn how to
swim. Or the tree I saw last Sunday, following a deer path through
the brambles to the top of my hill: every orange-red leaf was full
of light. Maybe it was my sugar maple. And it had been there all
along.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: The fabric of life in cotton
country
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   VICKSBURG, Miss. _ Sitting in the Beechwood Restaurant and
Lounge, doodling math in between advertisements printed on the
place mat, trying to figure out how much is 50,000 bales of cotton
...
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, still in Louisiana but almost to
Mississippi, I'd stopped for gas at a little store located, as best
I can tell, almost exactly in the center of nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   I was paying the lady at the counter when somebody behind me
hollered out as if they'd seen a long-lost friend, ``Joe! How you
doin'?''
</P>
<P>
   I whirled around, ready to shake hands with a buddy a far way
from home. Only then did I realize that there was more than one Joe
in these parts.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of farmers, Joe and somebody whose name I didn't catch,
were greeting each other enthusiastically. No telling how long it
had been since they'd seen one another _ maybe a month, maybe just
yesterday morning _ but they were eager to catch up on the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``That rain hurt you any?'' one asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nah,'' the other said, as if rain had never mattered one way
or another to him in his whole life. ``My cotton's picked.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gonna be a good year, Joe,'' the first allowed. ``I expect the
gin will do 50,000 bales.''
</P>
<P>
   On down the road, stopping the night at Vicksburg, I was still
pondering the immensity of a good year of cotton.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty thousand bales!
</P>
<P>
   Wow! That's ... Well, that's a cotton-pickin' lot of cotton.
</P>
<P>
   So it was that I was doodling, in between the advertisements
printed on the placemat and in between courses at Beechwood
Restaurant and Lounge, which has been doing business in the same
location on old Highway 80 for four decades, good years and bad.
</P>
<P>
   Ask local folks where you can find a good steak, and they'll
direct you to Beechwood. I missed it twice in the dark, going one
way, then the other and back again.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that the manager had forgotten to turn on the big
sign out front. Even so, the parking lot was full to overflowing.
</P>
<P>
   That's mainly due to James Williams. He's the chef. You can't
miss him. Beechwood has his kitchen set up at the front of the
dining room, so as to display him in the big windows looking out on
the highway.
</P>
<P>
   He has been cooking since he was 9 years old, learning from his
father and grandfather, both chefs themselves. Never mind the
degree he has from a famous cooking school. He credits his success
to the secret family recipe for marinating meat.
</P>
<P>
   ``No piece of meat it can't break down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The stuff is good for meat and, it would seem, also good for
what ails you. His grandfather lived to 104. His father is 95,
doing well in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Note, however, that James Williams' recipe book, just $4.95, is
dedicated to his mother, who always believed in him.
</P>
<P>
   If you should stop by, ask James Williams about the marinating
sauce. Maybe he'll tell you the recipe. When I asked, he changed
the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, well. I did manage to find out something about cotton.
</P>
<P>
   One bale is 55 inches tall.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty thousand bales, stacked one on top of the other, would be
2.75 million inches tall, or almost 230,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The Empire State Building, by comparison, is 1,250 feet tall.
</P>
<P>
   Good year for cotton, Joe.

</P>
<P>
   Here is a (partial) list of objects that Martha Stewart has
gilded on recent TV shows: pomegranates, pumpkins, cookies,
chocolate truffles, wrapping paper, oak leaves, acorns, and--no
kidding--okra. The only thing Martha has not gilded is the lily.
But wait till it's back in season.
</P>
<P>
   Martha has proved that alchemy is not impossible: Brush enough
gold paint on enough flora, and eventually you'll make real gold.
Tuesday's initial public offering for Martha Stewart Living
Omnimedia--Omnimedia, has there ever been a more perfect
name?--killed on Wall Street, rising from $18 to $52 before
settling at $36.
</P>
<P>
   She arrived at the stock exchange that morning toting a tray of
brioches. She left that evening holding $1.2 billion (in stock, not
dough).
</P>
<P>
   Investors bought a brilliant company: Omnimedia--a Web site,
mail-order operation, two TV shows, two magazines, Kmart
partnership, and 27 books--netted $24 million last year from the
gospel of Martha. Kmart sold more than $750 million worth of
Martha-branded products in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Her 1997 decision to divorce Time Warner and go solo--a split
that cost her more than $50 million--has never looked better.
</P>
<P>
   What was missing from Martha's IPO was the sniping and mockery
that has dogged all of her ventures. Traditionally, Martha has been
battered by three criticisms. First, she is simply ludicrous. You
could not imagine better comic material than her ideas of
``living'': the ``midnight omelet dinner for 1,000''; the fruit
baskets the size of a Chevy; the advice (in this month's magazine)
to make your own envelopes out of wood veneer, folding them with a
bone knife.
</P>
<P>
   Parodies barely exaggerate when they imagine Martha turning
water into wine (''a lovely Merlot'') or manufacturing condoms from
her own lamb.
</P>
<P>
   A second and more thoughtful batch of critics has charged her
with encouraging class division, promoting soulless domestic
conformism, and undermining working women by making them feel
domestically inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   The final criticism has been personal. As her unauthorized
biography, ``Just Desserts,'' contends, Martha is an icy, horrible
person who abused her (now ex-) husband, ignores her daughter,
belittles her mother, sues her gardener for pennies, plagiarizes
recipes from better cooks, and humiliates her staff. Her fabled
``Remembering'' columns are a hash of bunkum and hyperbole. The
persona she cultivates--the warm, welcoming hostess with a
close-knit family--is a fraud.
</P>
<P>
   These criticisms have subsided partly because of America's
culture of financial idolatry. Anyone who's worth a billion on
paper is worth sucking up to.
</P>
<P>
   Martha is benefiting from parody fatigue as well. She has been a
figure of fun since ``Entertaining'' was published in 1982, so all
the jokes are old.
</P>
<P>
   And the vitality of the economy is inoculating her. Fripperies
that seemed obscene during the early '90s recession are quite
modest by the standards of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But the critical silence may also represent a long-overdue
recognition that Martha is, as she would say, a Good Thing. In a
Tuesday TV interview, she called herself a ``teacher. ... We are
offering information, high-quality, well-researched, how-to
information.'' That is a fair description.
</P>
<P>
   What she does is not silly at all, or at least no more silly
than most advice magazines. Her magazines and TV shows retain just
enough nonsense to make them irksome (''sew your own pashmina from
home-raised llamas,'' and the like), but she supplies valuable
instruction about the mundane tasks of life.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Stewart Living may be the most useful magazine this side
of Consumer Reports. This month's issue, for example, offers
excellent advice about making spicy popcorn snacks, cleaning ovens,
and storing rugs and china, among other subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Her weekly CBS morning segment packs more helpful cooking
information into six minutes than most cooking shows do in an hour.
</P>
<P>
   It is not false consciousness that makes tens of millions of
people follow Martha every month. It is her good advice.
</P>
<P>
   But the grievement of Martha's domestic gospel is not
practical but moral. She has a puritanical sensibility. She
believes in the uplifting power of work. She instructs you so that
you will know how to create objects yourself, grow plants yourself,
learn home repair yourself, cook food yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Doing something well is good and liberating and fulfilling. It
strengthens friendships and families: When I saw her making waffles
the other day, it made me want to make waffles this Sunday. If I
make waffles on Sunday, I will invite the downstairs neighbors up
to eat them, and that is undoubtedly a Good Thing.
</P>
<P>
   Martha practices materialism, but not consumerism. She believes,
rightly, that it makes you wiser and happier to cook your own
applesauce than to buy it. Well, you may say, it's easy for her to
make homemade applesauce. That's her job. But she did it when it
wasn't her job, too.
</P>
<P>
   Even if most viewers rarely practice anything Martha
preaches--she calls such slackers ``Martha Dreamers'' as opposed to
``Martha Doers''--she is still a worthy goad.
</P>
<P>
   Her DIY credo makes Martha democratically snobbish. She hews to
a country-house sensibility, but anyone can follow it. It doesn't
cost much, because you do it yourself. If a middle-class Polish
girl like Martha can blossom into an affected, Breck-girl
faux-WASP, you can too!
</P>
<P>
   The final, and most important, reason Martha is escaping
criticism is that Martha Stewart the person has been separated from
Martha Stewart the brand. The principal topic of discussion about
the Martha Stewart Living IPO was Martha Stewart's death. Analysts
speculated what would happen to Omnimedia if Martha were hit by a
bus or cab (or succumbed to an accident in ``the potting shed,'' as
the New York Observer's Christopher Byron nicely put it).
</P>
<P>
   There were two answers: First, the company has bought a $67
million life-insurance policy on her. Second, Martha Stewart the
brand can survive without Martha Stewart the person, as Ralph
Lauren the brand survives without Ralph Lauren selling every shirt.
(Martha does not appear at all in the current issue of Living.) The
zooming stock price is evidence that Wall Street can distinguish
Martha from her product.
</P>
<P>
   We should do the same. Critics have savaged her fraudulent
persona and monomaniacal perfectionism for a long time. There is a
subtle sexism in that: The female domestic tycoon is obliged to
behave better than the guys. (This is why Oprah's private life is
examined more carefully than David Letterman's.)
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, commerce has trumped personality. Martha is finally
being treated as the CEO of a company called Omnimedia, not as a
bitchy hausfrau. In the age of the divine entrepreneur, no one
cares how badly you treat your kid. We admire perfectionist
monomania in Internet tycoons, so why not in Martha? Politicians
get away with advertising bogus family bliss; Martha should too.
</P>
<P>
   On television, Martha shows us how to make a romantic dinner for
the husband she doesn't have, host a party for the kids she doesn't
like, bake muffins for the neighbors who hate her.
</P>
<P>
   But those are her tragedies, not our business (or Wall
Street's). The muffins are still tasty, and that's what matters.

<P>
   Here is a (partial) list of objects that Martha Stewart has
gilded on recent TV shows: pomegranates, pumpkins, cookies,
chocolate truffles, wrapping paper, oak leaves, acorns, and--no
kidding--okra. The only thing Martha has not gilded is the lily.
But wait till it's back in season.
</P>
<P>
   Martha has proved that alchemy is not impossible: Brush enough
gold paint on enough flora, and eventually you'll make real gold.
Tuesday's initial public offering for Martha Stewart Living
Omnimedia--Omnimedia, has there ever been a more perfect
name?--killed on Wall Street, rising from $18 to $52 before
settling at $36.
</P>
<P>
   She arrived at the stock exchange that morning toting a tray of
brioches. She left that evening holding $1.2 billion (in stock, not
dough).
</P>
<P>
   Investors bought a brilliant company: Omnimedia--a Web site,
mail-order operation, two TV shows, two magazines, Kmart
partnership, and 27 books--netted $24 million last year from the
gospel of Martha. Kmart sold more than $750 million worth of
Martha-branded products in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Her 1997 decision to divorce Time Warner and go solo--a split
that cost her more than $50 million--has never looked better.
</P>
<P>
   What was missing from Martha's IPO was the sniping and mockery
that has dogged all of her ventures. Traditionally, Martha has been
battered by three criticisms. First, she is simply ludicrous. You
could not imagine better comic material than her ideas of
``living'': the ``midnight omelet dinner for 1,000''; the fruit
baskets the size of a Chevy; the advice (in this month's magazine)
to make your own envelopes out of wood veneer, folding them with a
bone knife.
</P>
<P>
   Parodies barely exaggerate when they imagine Martha turning
water into wine (''a lovely Merlot'') or manufacturing condoms from
her own lamb.
</P>
<P>
   A second and more thoughtful batch of critics has charged her
with encouraging class division, promoting soulless domestic
conformism, and undermining working women by making them feel
domestically inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   The final criticism has been personal. As her unauthorized
biography, ``Just Desserts,'' contends, Martha is an icy, horrible
person who abused her (now ex-) husband, ignores her daughter,
belittles her mother, sues her gardener for pennies, plagiarizes
recipes from better cooks, and humiliates her staff. Her fabled
``Remembering'' columns are a hash of bunkum and hyperbole. The
persona she cultivates--the warm, welcoming hostess with a
close-knit family--is a fraud.
</P>
<P>
   These criticisms have subsided partly because of America's
culture of financial idolatry. Anyone who's worth a billion on
paper is worth sucking up to.
</P>
<P>
   Martha is benefiting from parody fatigue as well. She has been a
figure of fun since ``Entertaining'' was published in 1982, so all
the jokes are old.
</P>
<P>
   And the vitality of the economy is inoculating her. Fripperies
that seemed obscene during the early '90s recession are quite
modest by the standards of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But the critical silence may also represent a long-overdue
recognition that Martha is, as she would say, a Good Thing. In a
Tuesday TV interview, she called herself a ``teacher. ... We are
offering information, high-quality, well-researched, how-to
information.'' That is a fair description.
</P>
<P>
   What she does is not silly at all, or at least no more silly
than most advice magazines. Her magazines and TV shows retain just
enough nonsense to make them irksome (''sew your own pashmina from
home-raised llamas,'' and the like), but she supplies valuable
instruction about the mundane tasks of life.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Stewart Living may be the most useful magazine this side
of Consumer Reports. This month's issue, for example, offers
excellent advice about making spicy popcorn snacks, cleaning ovens,
and storing rugs and china, among other subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Her weekly CBS morning segment packs more helpful cooking
information into six minutes than most cooking shows do in an hour.
</P>
<P>
   It is not false consciousness that makes tens of millions of
people follow Martha every month. It is her good advice.
</P>
<P>
   But the great achievement of Martha's domestic gospel is not
practical but moral. She has a puritanical sensibility. She
believes in the uplifting power of work. She instructs you so that
you will know how to create objects yourself, grow plants yourself,
learn home repair yourself, cook food yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Doing something well is good and liberating and fulfilling. It
strengthens friendships and families: When I saw her making waffles
the other day, it made me want to make waffles this Sunday. If I
make waffles on Sunday, I will invite the downstairs neighbors up
to eat them, and that is undoubtedly a Good Thing.
</P>
<P>
   Martha practices materialism, but not consumerism. She believes,
rightly, that it makes you wiser and happier to cook your own

   SINGLE-CHILD (New York) _ In contrast to suburbia, where two or
more children is the norm, Manhattan has become a veritable
only-child paradise. Demographers using figures supplied by the
city, say that the single-child family is now the most-common
family unit in Manhattan. More than 30 percent of all married women
on the island in their early 40's _ that is, women who are largely
past childbearing age and whose family size is most likely set _
have only a single child. By Nancy Hass. Photo. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NITEOUT-CUBAN-BAND (New York) _ It was shortly before 8 p.m. on
Thursday, and Diane Ghioto, the owner of Isla, a spanking new Cuban
restaurant on Downing Street in Manhattan, stood overseeing the
polishing of windows and chrome table tops. A small crowd of music
industry executives had showed up to welcome the Buena Vista Social
Club band, who, since their last visit to New York, last year, have
toured the world and have become an international sensation as
masters of son cubano, the rural folk style that forms the
foundation for much of Latin music, from mambo to salsa. By Douglas
Century. Photo. &QL;

<P>
   CAMPBELL-LOUNGE (New York) _ Since it opened at Grand Central
Terminal on Sept. 30, the Campbell Apartment, as the lounge is
called, has been packed almost nightly, drawing a stream of the
curious, who between cocktails, crane their necks to take in the
30-foot wood-beam ceilings. The hall, which resembles a

<TEXT>
<P>
   I recently entered into high-level negotiations for an interview
and photo shoot with a young Hollywood actress, soon to co-star in
her first big-budget movie. Her publicity agent dictated the terms:
Star Girl wouldn't wear fur in photographs. My magazine couldn't
discuss her relationship with her boyfriend (also an actor). We had
to mention in the photo credits the cosmetics line she endorsed.
And most important, we couldn't pose her in provocative clothing:
no bikinis, lingerie or cleavage, despite the fact that Star Girl
had made her initial splash baring her breasts in a steamy thriller
only a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, we agreed to it all. Believe me, if we hadn't,
somebody else would have.
</P>
<P>
   I am the style director of US magazine, but I've also held
similar jobs at Detour and Interview, and stories like this could
be echoed a hundred times by my counterparts at other glossy
magazines. It's no secret that we are increasingly relying on
Hollywood celebrities to sell our shiny sheets, to a public whose
appetite for the minutiae of stars' lives _ their shoes, houses,
favorite toothpastes _ seems to know no bounds.
</P>
<P>
   The more we need celebrities, the more leverage they _ or their
representatives, publicity agents _ gain over the decisions we used
to think of as our own, like who to assign to photograph and write
about them, how to edit the layouts and what questions to ask in
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations editors must go through with publicists are so
time-consuming that many magazines have created a new job:
so-called celebrity wranglers, editors who are better at
power-lunching, writing thank-you notes and sending flowers than at
smoothing out copy.
</P>
<P>
   Typically listed as West Coast Editor on mastheads, they cozy up
to the celebrities and publicists poolside in Hollywood, while we,
back in New York, grudgingly abide by whatever deals they make.
Actual editors have never been pushed further away from the
subjects they're featuring in their pages.
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to make an entertainment editor fantasize about
working for Sports Afield. Big-horn sheep _ you don't suppose they
have publicists, do you?
</P>
<P>
   Here, under the new rules, is how the game is played. Before a
publicist gives the go-ahead for a magazine to photograph and
interview a star, it's common practice for the editor to agree not
to bring up taboo topics _ a former addiction, a current love, a
sordid rumor. The stars would love it, though, if we would tout
their upcoming movies even before we've seen them.
</P>
<P>
   We permit the publicists to help pick the photographers who will
shoot their clients, and sometimes even the writers. This requires
a lot of back and forth, overnighting photographers' portfolios and
writers' clips. Many times, the publicists already know exactly who
they want. They're just putting us through the motions so as not to
look, well, controlling.
</P>
<P>
   If a photographer is known for making over famous faces,
``experimenting with their look,'' as publicists say, they will
likely reject the suggestion. ``We had a situation with him
before,'' they will say vaguely.
</P>
<P>
   Other rejections are more specific. I've heard a photographer
who regularly shows in art galleries dismissed with the line, ``He
makes all the guys he shoots look gay, and the girls all come out
looking like drag queens.''
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, magazine photographers are working in a style
called modern realism, meaning they portray subjects with a sullen,
disaffected or caught-off-guard look. But publicists see only that
Cover Girl could use a little makeup, that Cover Boy needs a shave
and haircut.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   What's particularly galling is that publicists aren't
professional editors; 9 out of 10 times, their choice of
photographer is dreadful, based on whether an upbeat,
conventionally flattering picture will result. There is little
interest in portraiture that reveals a subject's inner life.
Publicists want a puffy article and a pretty picture, nothing more.
It's what their clients pay them for.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, we editors brought it on ourselves. About two
years ago, style and fashion magazines decreed that supermodels
were passe, and they began going after movie stars as cover
subjects. The results are on the newsstands: the cover of the
October issue of Vogue features Winona Ryder, Harper's Bazaar has
Michelle Pfeiffer and the latest Allure has Patricia Arquette. Back
then editors thought: ``Enough with models. Models are late, models
are moody. Mostly, though, they're boring.'' A bit naively, we
believed that actors had character, a ``story'' to tell.
</P>
<P>
   How wrong we were. Do you want your writer to really get to know
a cover subject? You'll be lucky if the publicist allots more than
a ``chat and chew'' _ an hourlong interview over lunch. They're so
very busy, these movie stars. If a writer's clips suggest he or she
likes to get personal _ say, dipping into a Jacuzzi with the star
as part of the reporting _ publicists will deem the reporter ``too
controversial.''
</P>
<P>
   More often than not, the result has been lame stories and boring
pictures. Almost everybody looks and sounds alike. With magazines
promoting more and more movie figures, too many are being sold to
readers as the Next Big Thing, but most fall short of stardom.
Consider the ballyhooed former cover subjects Matthew McConaughey,
Liv Tyler and Elisabeth Shue, all of whom graced multiple magazines
a while ago; they've turned out to be reliable, working actors _
but no big deals.
</P>
<P>
   After a dozen years in the business, I'm hardened to the process
of ``giving cover.'' Little surprises me. But it still came as a
shock late last year when a celebrity backed out entirely at the
last minute. I was the editor of Detour magazine, and Sean Penn had
agreed to grace our December cover. We agreed to let him help
select both writer and photographer through his publicist. We
compiled a wish list of literary, tough-guy writers we imagined
would appeal to Penn, including Barry Gifford, Denis Johnson, Harry
Crews and David Mamet. All were either rejected by Penn or
unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   For a photographer, we proposed Richard Burbridge, well known
for his pockmarks-and-all portraits. We assumed Penn and his agent
would approve. No dice. ``He blinds people,'' the publicist said.
``They get black eyes from his flash-bulb technique, and they don't
go away for days.'' (A few months later, The New York Times
Magazine assigned Burbridge to shoot Penn for its cover without any
objection from the actor's representatives.)
</P>
<P>
   We kept lobbing out names of other photographers, but suddenly,
weeks before the magazine was due to be shipped to the printer,
Penn withdrew from the story altogether. His father had recently
died, it was explained; quite understandably, he was reeling from
his loss. So were we.
</P>
<P>
   The apologetic publicist offered another of his clients: Winona
Ryder, and we happily agreed, but it was not to happen. The
photographer the publicist wanted was known for extravagant expense
sheets, and Ms. Ryder's schedule would cause the magazine overtime
production costs. Now, it was our turn to back away.
</P>
<P>
   After one other aborted effort involving another actress, it
became too late to shoot an original cover, so we frantically
reviewed pictures of actors already in-house.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Hudson, who bore a striking resemblance to her famous
mother, Goldie Hawn, and was set to co-star in an ensemble comedy,
``200 Cigarettes,'' seemed like a possibility. Calls were made.
</P>
<P>
   ``She may not be ready for a cover yet,'' her publicist told me,
concerned that too much attention too early could hinder Ms.
Hudson' career. But he eventually gave a thumb's up, on the
condition that he could approve the cover shot.
</P>
<P>
   I liked a semi-sexy portrait of Ms. Hudson in a black leather
coat with her red underwear peeking out. It was flirty, but not
tacky.
</P>
<P>
   The publicist, though, thought it was too provocative and voted
for a black-and-white shot of Ms. Hudson in a long evening gown. It
was flat, and I said no. Then he delivered his ultimatum: If we
used the ``panty shot,'' as he called it, his agency, with its
roster of A-list stars, would boycott our magazine in the future.
We gave in. The result: the worst-looking cover in my tenure as
Detour's editor.

OUT OUT DAMN STAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Oct. 24, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON

<P>
   Q. When I took up an area rug, the rubber mat under it bled
through to the floor, making a yellow stain. How can I clean that
stain?
</P>
<P>
   MARY ANNE FITZGERALD, Milton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Try cleaning it with paint thinner; apply the thinner and let
it sit for 30 seconds; add thinner if it starts to evaporate. Then
rub vigorously with the cloth you applied the thinner with. Then
wipe everything up with a dry cloth.
</P>
<P>
   If that doesn't work, dip very fine steel wool in paint thinner
and rub lightly.
</P>
<P>
   Another treatment is to spray the stain with WD-40, wait 15
minutes, and wipe it all up with a dry cloth.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My two-family house has a center chimney, with the furnace of
each apartment feeding into the chimney. Some of the clay flue
liner tiles in the chimney have broken and we took them out. Some
liners have stayed in place. I cannot find a company that will take
out the rest of the liners and put in a metal flue. I can only find
companies that want to drop in stainless steel liners. Is this OK?
</P>
<P>
   TONI SANDONATO, Medford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. It is if the chimney is big enough to accommodate two liners.
Two liners that fit snugly in the chimney will also keep any flue
liners that remain in the chimney in their place. If the two
burners are gas, you might be able to install one stainless steel
liner and allow each furnace to duct into it. Two is better than
one.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The 25-year-old fireplace and chimney in my Cape Cod house
are made of old bricks and are leaking water into the house. A man
said he would seal them with a sealer, once a year. I don't like
sealing every year. Can I apply a skimcoat of mortar to the brick?
</P>
<P>
   MARGARET RUTKOWSKI, Woburn, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't blame you for not wanting to have the chimney sealed
once a year; that can get expensive, and it also points out the
shortcomings of clear sealers. They might do a yeoman job, but only
for a year. That is not long enough. Yes, you can skimcoat the
chimney with mortar; it is called parging, and will be a permanent
leak-proof job. While the brick chimney is essentially a rough
finish and mortar will stick to it, I suggest you apply a bonding
agent to the chimney before skimcoating, to make the skimcoat stick
better.
</P>
<P>
   Another thing about sealer. A regular clear sealer will seal the
chimney against outside water, but it also can seal in moisture and
cause interior leaks and decay of the bricks. There is a cure for
that, too: chimney sweeps have a sealer they call Chimney Saver; it
waterproofs the bricks but allows interior moisture to evaporate,
preventing not only leaks but also decay. If you use a sealer, use
Chimney Saver, which must be installed by a pro.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My new house was built in 1909, with a built-in cast iron
tub. The ceiling below the tub is all bubbly and cracking,
indicating a leak. A plumber suggested caulking around the tub. Is
there any other way of stopping the leak?
</P>
<P>
   CLAUDIA SORGI, Hingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Caulking around the tub both at the floor and where tub meets
wall may stop leaks from showering and spilled water. If so, all's
well and you can repair the ceiling, and repaint.
</P>
<P>
   But if the leak is in the drain or supply pipe (most likely the
drain, particularly if the leak occurs only during a shower or when
the tub is draining), the only way to find it is to take down the
ceiling below the tub and simply take a look, and take it from
there.
</P>
<P>
   If you can find the leak, fix it, and now replace the ceiling
that you would have had to do anyway.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My new rubber roof is less than a year old, and has developed
a hole about 4 by 4 inches. Is there a patching material I can use
to fix it?
</P>
<P>
   JUDY KEYMONT, Stoughton
</P>
<P>
   A. First off, call the roofer; the roof is in warranty (for
about a year, generally), and the roofer is, or should be,
responsible for fixing it, no matter what caused the hole. Getting
him to fix the hole is another matter. Fixing it yourself might be
iffy, because I don't know if the rubber roof material is available
as a patch. If it is not, and you still want to or have to fix it,
you can try this: Buy any kind of sheet rubber or rubber-like
compound, and adhesive to go with it, and glue it over the hole.
</P>
<P>
   Another trick is to buy a tire repair kit; if you can get the
patch big enough, glue it down with the stuff that comes with the
tire kit. If it holds against a high-pressure tire, then it should
do well on the roof.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. One of my tenants wants to put a satellite antenna on the
roof. It is 18 inches in diameter. Would such an antenna cause
leaks?
</P>
<P>
   STEVE RIVARD, Woburn
</P>
<P>
   A. Anything secured to the roof can cause leaks, especially if
the fastener is not caulked or treated with roofing cement. Make
sure it is secure enough to prevent the wind from rocking it loose.
</P>
<P>
   And, a small dish like that can be mounted, instead, on the
wall, where it will not cause leaks and can be heavily secured.
</P>

VOTING BEGINS FOR CONTROL OF THE SCREEN ACTORS GUILD  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By RICK LYMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Voting is under way in what has become an unusually
contentious battle for control of the Screen Actors Guild, the
union representing some 97,000 movie, television and commercial
performers across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Masur, the film and television actor, who has been
president of the guild for four years, is facing an energetic
challenge from William Daniels, the veteran stage, screen and
television actor. Daniels is backed by an upstart faction called
the Performers Alliance that has steadily accumulated seats on the
guild's national board in recent elections and now hopes to
consolidate those gains with a sweep of the union's national
offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone asks me, Why are you doing this?'' said Daniels, who
is 72. ``This is a job a lot of people would avoid. My whole
experience in the Army was, never volunteer for anything. But they
approached me and asked me to do it and, I have to tell you, I've
learned a lot in the last four or five weeks. Something has to be
done, because the union's current leadership is not paying
attention to half of its members.''
</P>
<P>
   Ballots were mailed to the guild's members Oct. 13 and are due
back on Nov. 3, with an announcement of the results two days later.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Performers Alliance and Masur's slate, which is called
ProAct, complain that the contest has become increasingly fractious
and personal, with frequent attacks on Masur for what opponents
describe as an autocratic management style and on Daniels for his
admitted lack of union experience. In recent weeks, a third
candidate has entered the race, Angeltompkins, a film and
television actress and national board member who has run
unsuccessfully against Masur in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the fire, though, has been between Masur and Daniels,
largely because their contest is a mirror of the continuing battle
between the union's current leadership and the alliance. The
conflict seems to focus on how the union should be run and how
confrontational it should be in its dealings with the entertainment
conglomerates and with its own staff.
</P>
<P>
   The Performers Alliance began as a group of Hollywood-based
actors who were angry with declining wages and what they saw as an
unresponsive national union leadership, said Chuck Sloan, an
alliance member of the guild's national board and one of Daniels'
advisers. In the last two elections, the alliance won a working
majority on the union's Hollywood board, though not enough votes to
dominate the entire national board when votes from New York and
elsewhere in the country are included.
</P>
<P>
   Masur believes that the alliance is too confrontational _ in its
rhetoric, in its approach to union issues and in the way its
members treat the union's national staff and behave during board
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important for people to realize that this is no
longer 1974 and not every issue of interest to performers can be
resolved across the bargaining table,'' Masur said. ``It's my sense
that the opposition seems completely ignorant of the fact that
critically important problems require in-depth analysis and
strategic thinking and must be addressed in an organized and
focused manner on the legislative front, the public policy front
and in outreach to our highest profile members.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of these actions are part of their agenda. The only thing
they talk about is contract. Because of my opponent's complete lack
of knowledge and experience and his advisers' myopic view of
contract negotiations as the only thing of import to members, I
think it would be a tragedy for this organization if that old way
of thinking were to prevail at this union.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Daniels said, is not his lack of experience but the
union's failure in recent years to take a harder line in contract
talks and in enforcement of those contracts. ``The industry knows
this union is a soft union,'' he said. ``They know this union
doesn't want to strike.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Daniels and his supporters believe that Masur
maintains too much day-to-day control of union activities and has a
tendency to look after the interests of the more successful actors
at the expense of those struggling at the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Of the guild's 97,000 members, about half are based in Southern
California, a quarter in New York and the rest scattered around the
country. All of the union's national officers are up for
re-election _ president, treasurer and recording secretary _ as
well as four national vice presidents and about one-third of the
seats on the 105-member national board.
</P>
<P>
   At heart, Masur said, the alliance challenge is a power play by
a group that saw significant gains in recent elections and now
wants to turn that into control of the entire union. The result, he
said, would be more fractious behavior during meetings of the
Hollywood board _ that portion of the national board that
represents Hollywood-based actors, which is now dominated by
alliance members _ and more tension within the union.
</P>
<P>
   Alliance members see it differently, of course _ not as
obstructionism but as activism on behalf of struggling actors.
</P>
<P>
   Whichever view prevails, Daniels said, perhaps the group that
wins the election will be able to find a calmer path to the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we will have a healing process,'' he said. ``There
are a lot of good people on both sides.''

 By DOUGLAS CENTURY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was shortly before 8 p.m. on Thursday, and Diane
Ghioto, the owner of Isla, a spanking new Cuban restaurant on
Downing Street, stood overseeing the polishing of windows and
chrome table tops. ``Everything has to be just right tonight,'' she
told her staff of waiters in guayabera shirts as they awaited the
arrival of the Buena Vista Social Club.
</P>
<P>
   A small crowd of music industry executives showed up to welcome
the band, who, since their last visit to New York, last year, have
toured the world and have become an international sensation as
masters of son cubano, the rural folk style that forms the
foundation for much of Latin music, from mambo to salsa.
</P>
<P>
   The Buena Vista Social Club, a loose collective, was back in
town, for a sold-out show at the Beacon Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Just before 9 p.m., they arrived, led by Ry Cooder, the
guitarist and producer who first brought Buena Vista to an American
audience. They looked somewhat weary, having stepped off a bus from
Atlanta, by way of Washington. Several were wearing souvenir
Georgia peach ball caps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happily tired,'' the diminutive, 80-year-old pianist Ruben
Gonzalez said through an interpreter. ``I'm tiredly happy.'' While
other members enjoyed mojitos, the classic Cuban drink of crushed
mint and lime and white rum over ice, Gonzalez contented himself
with a tall glass of milk.
</P>
<P>
   At a semicircular white leather booth, Ibrahim Ferrer camped out
with his wife. At 72, the silky-voiced Ferrer _ dubbed the Nat King
Cole of Cuba _ looked boyish in his trademark tan-colored Kangol
cap and canvas K-Swiss sneakers.
</P>
<P>
   Even indoors, he did not take off his polar fleece pullover or
loosen the thick wool scarf wrapped around his neck to protect his
vocal chords. He beamed when Ms. Ghioto sat down and presented him
with a gift-wrapped box. ``Oh, Ibrahim loves dominoes,'' said
Caridad Diaz Surita, Ferrer's wife, when his fingers tore off the
tissue paper.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrer explained, ``In Havana, we play until the early hours in
the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   At 9:30, a Champagne toast was raised by David Bither, the
senior vice president of Nonesuch Records, as he presented
individual Grammy Awards to Messrs. Ferrer and Gonzalez that they
had won in 1998 but did not collect at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm only going to talk for a few minutes, because we Cubans
are brief,'' Ferrer said. Gonzalez, dressed in an open-neck
charcoal-gray shirt, told the guests that he felt ``requete bien''
_ a Spanish phrase that translates as ``better than good.''
</P>
<P>
   The success of the various Buena Vista projects has resulted in
a remarkable late-life transformation for many of the band members.
``Buena Vista Social Club,'' the acclaimed documentary about the
band by the Dutch filmmaker Wim Wenders, released this year,
details Gonzalez's 30-year struggle just to play the piano, after
his original instrument was eaten my wood worms.
</P>
<P>
   Before his career's resurrection, Ferrer was shining shoes for
cigarette money in the Havana streets.
</P>
<P>
   Were these maestros aware that they'd arrived in America on the
wave of a great Latin explosion, with crossover records by Ricky
Martin and Jennifer Lopez topping the charts, and a novelty hit by
Lou Bega, ``Mambo No. 5,'' blending '50s Cuban rhythms with the
flavor of hip-hop? Several musicians offered indifferent shrugs.
</P>
<P>
   Translating their overlapping responses, Bernardo Palombo, an
Argentine composer who acts as the band's interpreter, said: ``In
Cuba, the younger people still don't give a damn about this music.
They follow American rap and commercial salsa. The younger
musicians told Ibrahim many times that he was a relic. `Go and sing
in the cemetery,' they told him.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the night, waiters strolled past, offering Cuban
delicacies like grilled sugar-cane chicken and bacalao fritters.
Tony Jimenez, a tenor saxophonist, commented that while the food
was delicious, ``it has a Mexican touch of spiciness _ back in
Havana we don't use so much spice.''(The chef, Aaron Sanchez, is in
fact Mexican-American.)
</P>
<P>
   In Isla, Ms. Ghioto and Kate Webb, a designer, have faithfully
recreated the breezy, opulent atmosphere of Havana's
pre-revolutionary years _ down to the restaurant's script logo,
borrowed from the guest book of a 1950s Cuban hotel. Through clouds
of cigar smoke, bronze-faced great-grandfathers were twirling their
dancing partners across the cobalt-blue floor. ``None of these guys
needs Viagra,'' one young woman said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   As the dancing grew more frenzied, Andrea Strong, Isla's
manager, began to worry that the plates of hors d'oeuvres weren't
going to be enough. ``These Cuban guys have big appetites,'' she
said. ``They're hungry and they're drinking and they need more
food.'' Ms. Ghioto went into the kitchen in a rush, exclaiming,
``We have a special request from Ibrahim _ he wants more
tostones.''
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Ghioto passed out cigars _ Cuban, of course _ Ferrer
shook his head, staring at the hand-rolled robusto with a wistful
smile. ``I stopped smoking about a month ago,'' he said. ``The
doctor suggested that it's not good for my bronchitis.''
</P>
<P>
   Out on Downing Street, people were lighting up their cigars, and
passersby had stopped to gape at the collection of elderly men
dancing to ``Dos Gardenias.''
</P>
<P>
   The white-mustached Gonzalez had gone from milk to stronger
spirits and was now feeling euphoric. ``When you come to Havana,
ask for Ruben Gonzalez,'' he told a complete stranger. ``You don't
need my address because everybody will tell you where to find me.''

MAGICAL JOURNEY ON HOLD FOR NOW

<P>
   The plan was simple: We had four free plane tickets, and we
decided to go to Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   A quick weekend jaunt. Maybe we'd take in Epcot's millennial
celebration or the new Cirque du Soleil.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly, the trip was intended to introduce our youngest to
the classics. Yes, it's a parent's penance to be required to ride
Small World and Dumbo the Flying Elephant with each of their
children by age 3.
</P>
<P>
   I'm no stranger to doing Disney, having lived in Central Florida
for 30 years. I've visited the parks yearly since I was 10, when
there were still E tickets and hokey special effects. I remember
the thrill of going through The Haunted Mansion, Pirates of the
Caribbean and Space Mountain for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   My son and I had annual passes to the parks when he was a
preschooler, and just because we had moved a few hundred miles
north, I didn't want to deprive my daughter of that Disney magic.
</P>
<P>
   My husband was a harder sell. Having grown up in the Midwest,
he's a Mouse skeptic if there ever was one. One of his firm
resolves in life was to never set foot on Disney property,
believing, like Carl Hiaasen, that Disney ``is so good at being
good that it manifests an evil'' (from ``Team Rodent: How Disney
Devours the World.'') But even Jim was willing to go along for the
sake of second-child equity.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it wasn't to be.
</P>
<P>
   First came the stomach virus with amazing staying power, able to
leap from person to person in a single fortnight. We left for the
airport on the children's first day back on solid foods.
</P>
<P>
   Did I give in? NO!
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to Disney World,'' I said with conviction.
</P>
<P>
   That afternoon at the airport, I settled into a vinyl chair and
watched TV reports of Hurricane Irene, spinning her green arms
toward Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're GOING to Disney World,'' I muttered to The Weather
Channel reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, our plane was ready to board. We could see it out the
window. But the crew was flying in from Boston and had been delayed
and would be in Atlanta by ... 8:45 p.m. No, 9:45. Well, make that
11. Oops, 12:40 a.m. -- maybe.
</P>
<P>
   I held our screaming 3-year-old (``I wanna go HOME! I wanna go
HOME! Don't care about Mickey Mouse, I wanna go HOME!'')
</P>
<P>
   I looked over at my husband, at The Weather Channel, at my
exhausted, wane children trying to curl up on the bright orange
airport chairs. I pictured us all dragging into the hotel suite at
3 a.m. and waking to Irene's dark and dreary embrace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to Disney World,'' I said wearily, and we
headed home.
</P>
<P>
   We slept 11 hours and woke to a sunny, cool morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear it's raining in Florida,'' my husband said.
</P>
<P>
   I hit him with the pillow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still going,'' I warned. ``Come wind or rain or plague
or pestilence or pilot problems. Just as soon as I can
reschedule.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no doubt,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   You're only 3 once, after all. All too soon, Sarah will realize
that Mickey and Minnie are just employees dressed like giant
rodents, elephants can't really fly and that endless, chipper song
is downright irritating.
</P>
<P>
   We have to get her there while the stardust is still fresh.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Time and again this summer, Michael Kane was drawn up
a marble staircase at Grand Central Terminal, then up two more
flights in the terminal's southwest corner to a glass door guarded
by ornate metal gates. Behind those doors, he had heard, was a hall
that resembled a 13th-century Italian palazzo, once the private
offices of a tycoon named John W. Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept coming by and asking, `How long is it going to be?'''
said Kane, a marketing manager at The New Yorker, who on a recent
night was finally seated in the restored room, which has been
turned into a lounge. ``Then I forgot about it, until my friend
called tonight to say it was open.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost all of those in the elegant bar mentioned that they, too,
had been drawn by the promise of a certain mystique.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's that immediate intrigue,'' said Ted Brumelene, an
architect who was having a drink with his brother while waiting to
catch a train. ``What was that space? Why was it hiding? It's like
sneaking into someone's living room.''
</P>
<P>
   Since it opened on Sept. 30, the Campbell Apartment, as the
lounge is called, has been packed almost nightly, drawing a stream
of the curious, who between cocktails, crane their necks to take in
the 30-foot wood-beam ceilings.
</P>
<P>
   They admire the deep blue Moroccan-inspired rug, the overstuffed
couches set against stone walls and the huge steel safe installed
by Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they've really done here is blend the modern with
something that is not post-modern but truly antique,'' Kane said.
</P>
<P>
   The bar's owner, Mark C. Grossich, is a specialist in retro
night life _ he founded a chain of cigar bars _ and he has adopted
a persona to fit: a young fogey in a custom double-breasted suit
with antique polka-dot silk scarf peeking out of the breast pocket
and suede bench-made shoes. He says the key to his success is
avoiding trendiness and creating instead a classic ambiance that
encourages people to return.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, trendy means loud and abusive and intense,'' he said.
``We do not want to be the flavor of the month or the year. We want
to be in it for the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   That claim may sound just a bit disingenuous.
</P>
<P>
   Grossich's chain of smoking lounges, known as Bar and Books, are
as heavily themed as anything from the Disney Imagineers. Each
contains built-in bookshelves or floor-to-ceiling humidors. At the
height of the cigar craze, he owned four of them, but now he
operates two. It was Grossich's reputation in the lounge business
that prompted the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to ask him
two years ago to restore the Campbell Apartment. He said he jumped
at the chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Bar and Books we were manufacturing history,'' he
said. ``With the Campbell Apartment we could leverage the real
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   By his account, he spent $1 million renovating the space,
working with Connie Beale, an interior designer in Greenwich,
Conn., to restore the ceiling, stone fireplace and stained-glass
windows. He added a few touches of his own, like an expansive bar
with blue leather stools.
</P>
<P>
   Grossich has gathered many stories about the Campbell
Apartment's original owner, who was the chairman of the Credit
Clearing House, which was later taken over Dun &AMP; Bradstreet.
Campbell rented the space beginning in 1923, using it as a private
office by day and holding lavish parties by night. Legend has it
that even his boxer shorts were custom-made, along with his shirts
and shoes, and that he never wore socks.
</P>
<P>
   Grossich is quick to admit that he's not the bon vivant Campbell
was reputed to be. He shies away from the role of host, rarely
mingling with customers. On any given night, he might be found on
the Campbell Apartment's balcony playing pool with a custom-made
cue. Or he might be standing near the front door, smoking his
favorite cigar, a Temple Hall Maduro.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the spirit of John Campbell would be quite pleased,''
he said recently, surveying the crowd.

   Chilly Canadian gales will buffet parts of the Great Lakes on
Saturday in the wake of a formidable but weakening low pressure
system over Ontario. Gusts to 45 mph or more are possible across
northern Michigan, owing to the large contrasts in barometric
pressure between the low and a high centered over the central
Plains.
</P>
<P>
   Father east, waterspouts are possible over Lakes Erie Ontario as
a pocket of very cold air several thousand feet above the surface
drifts over relatively tepid water.
</P>
<P>
   Showers of snow and rain will speckle the region from the Great
Lakes to the mountains of western Pennsylvania, northern West
Virginia and western Maryland, with some of the high ground
whitened by Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Farther east, moderate rains will douse parts of northern New
England the first part of the day as a secondary area of low
pressure associated with the Ontario low exits slowly into the Gulf
of Maine.
</P>
<P>
   In its wake, variable clouds with limited intervals of sun will
prevail over the rest of the Northeast seaboard as cold air aloft
promotes the growth of cumulus clouds. Sunday will be windy and
chilly across the entire Northeast seaboard.
</P>
<P>
   Chilly air will also invade the Southeast, with temperatures
dropping off into the 30s and 40s on Saturday night as far south as
northern Florida. Meanwhile, a weekend warming trend will commence
in the Plains.
</P>
<P>
   The recent spell of dry weather in the Pacific Northwest will
come to an end Saturday as a cold front and a trailing jet stream
disturbance arrive from the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: TEXAS CHILL
</P>
<P>
   Record chill invaded the lower Rio Grande Valley on Friday
morning as the mercury sank to 48 degrees at Brownsville, Texas,
the lowest reading ever recorded on October 22. In fact,
Brownsville has not been as cool since April 17 and the last time
readings fell below 48 degrees was on March 15. Oddly, the autumn
cool snap in south Texas has come because a much colder air mass is
surging southward into the Mississippi and Ohio valleys. This has
forced rather cool and very dry air well south into Texas. The
brunt of the new cold air mass will be felt in the East during this
weekend.

HOUSE MEMBERS CHALLENGE CLINTON'S AUTHORITY TO BOMB YUGOSLAVIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Does the White House or Congress have the right to
send American troops into battle?
</P>
<P>
   That constitutional question was argued Friday before a federal
appeals court here as 31 House members urged the three-judge panel
to let them challenge President Clinton's decision to order the
bombing of Yugoslavia in March and continue the attack beyond 60
days.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers maintained that Clinton violated the 1973 War
Powers Act by failing to get congressional approval for the
bombing. The act requires the approval for ``introduction into
hostilities'' of U.S. forces lasting more than 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton's 60-day period ended on May 25 without
congressional approval, the House members, led by Rep. Tom
Campbell, R-Calif., sued, saying that president was legally
required to end the bombing. Clinton refused, and the bombing
continued until June 10 when Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
agreed to withdraw his troops from the province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In June, a federal judge dismissed the lawsuit, saying the House
members didn't have standing to sue because they failed to show a
``constitutional impasse'' between the president and Congress in
the matter.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Court Judge Paul Friedman said Congress and the
White House had not come to ``an actual confrontation'' about the
Yugoslav bombing campaign. He added that Congress had sent
``distinctly mixed messages'' about whether it supported or opposed
Clinton's commitment of U.S. forces in the allied bombing that
began March 24.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman noted that on April 28, the House approved several
conflicting measures. It voted against a declaration of war,
against withdrawal from the war, for a requirement that Congress
give its approval before the dispatch of any ground forces, and, in
a 213-213 vote, against a resolution to support the air war. The
Senate never voted on any measure condoning or condemning the
Yugoslav campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Congress takes a firm stand on one side of the issue, and
the president firmly resists that stand, members of Congress have
no legal right to sue over Clinton's military actions, Friedman
ruled.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Campbell and the other House members asked the
three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia to reverse that decision.
</P>
<P>
   Jules Lobel, attorney for the House members, said the bombing
campaign was the best case to date to test the War Powers Act. He
argued that the 213-213 vote against the resolution to support the
air war showed that Congress was against the bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, they (the administration) flagrantly ignored (the War
Powers Act),'' Lobel, a law professor at the University of
Pittsburgh, told the judges. ``The question here is since Congress
stepped up to the plate and performed its duty, will the courts do
so?''
</P>
<P>
   But the judges appeared reluctant to take on that duty. ``You're
putting a lot of pressure on the judiciary,'' said Judge Laurence
Silberman, who was U.S. ambassador to Yugoslavia from 1975 to 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Silberman told Lobel that if the judges ruled in his favor, they
would force courts to decide which military conflicts reach the
level of being called a war. ``Are we at war with Iraq or Korea?''
he asked. ``I don't know, and I don't know if the court should have
to decide.''
</P>
<P>
   Lobel replied, ``You would have to blind yourself to reality to
say the (bombing of Yugoslavia) wasn't a war.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department lawyer William Schultz, representing the
president, argued that Congress never took a ``firm stand'' against
the bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was there overwhelming support for the bombing?'' he asked.
``No. But nor was there overwhelming support to end the bombing.
Frankly, Congress didn't know what it wanted.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Under the Constitution, Congress has the power to declare war.
But over the years, particularly during the Cold War, presidents
often dispatched troops without prior authority.
</P>
<P>
   However, in the wake of Vietnam, Congress sought to rein in
executive war-making by passing the War Powers Act, which
essentially delegates to the president the power to make war for a
limited period. It requires the president to report within 48 hours
after introducing U.S. forces into hostilities.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress does not declare war or otherwise explicitly
authorize its continuation, the president has 60 days ``to
terminate any use'' of U.S. forces, with a 30-day extension, if
necessary, to extricate them safely. Under the war powers law, if
Congress votes funds for the troops, that does not mean it is
sanctioning the war.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1973 every president has scorned the act as an
unconstitutional infringement of executive power but has issued
reports on the dispatch of troops. Most recent conflicts _ Ronald
Reagan's invasion of Granada in 1983 and President George Bush's
invasion of Panama in 1989, Clinton's 1998 strikes against Sudan
and Afghanistan _ have ended before the 60 days ran out. In the few
cases where forces stayed longer, the president either had
congressional approval _ such as Bush in the 1991 Persian Gulf War
_ or worked out a compromise with Congress that provided some color
of authority _ such as the agreement with Reagan to keep troops in
Lebanon in 1982.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A few weeks ago, Mia Walker, a former television
producer who is just about to have her second child, asked some
friends to give her a ``nonshower.'' Absolutely no presents, she
insisted. Instead, as she tearfully told her girlfriends gathered
in an East Side brownstone, she wanted them to assure her she
wouldn't ``disappear down a black hole'' as a mother of two in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Although she was ecstatic to be having another baby, she said,
she couldn't help but be a little worried about fitting her new
double stroller into the elevator, or giving up the ease of jumping
on the subway or visiting museums and restaurants with just a
toddler, versus a toddler plus an infant.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Walker was experiencing a classic New York syndrome: two
children puts you in a different universe. ``I'm really happy about
having another baby, but there is something looming about the onset
of child No. 2 in New York,'' she said. ``When you have one kid
here you have the world at your fingertips.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to suburbia, where two or more children are the
norm, Manhattan has become a veritable only-child paradise.
Demographers, using figures supplied by the city, say that the
single-child family is now the most-common family unit in
Manhattan. More than 30 percent of all married women on the island
in their early 40s _ that is, women who are largely past
childbearing age and whose family size is most likely set _ have
only a single child. Add to that the number of women under 40 with
one child, and you have a raging plurality that the demographers,
Andrew Beveridge and Susan Weber of Queens College, say could top
40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the national figure for women ages 40 to 44 who
have ever been married and have just one child is about 21 percent,
according to Census Bureau data.
</P>
<P>
   In the suburbs, only children are still often considered a
curiosity, sometimes even a sad one. But in Manhattan, there is
virtually no stigma attached to them. They are as much a part of
the cultural fabric of the city as the unique circumstances that,
in a word, breed them: small, expensive apartments, a huge
proportion of women who delay marriage and childbearing to pursue
careers, inadequate public schools and sky-high private school
tuitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nowhere else that the two-parent, one-child ratio is
regarded so positively,'' said Len Covine, 46, an architect who
lives in SoHo with his wife, Sophie, and their 5-year-old daughter,
Lena.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walking on the streets here you can forget about the whole SUV
thing, the whole play-date thing, the whole soccer-mom thing,'' he
said. ``Instead, you can remember the museum thing, the Central
Park thing, the matinee thing, the hop-into-a-taxi thing. Having a
child here, one child, is completely different than the family
experience anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Another parent-of-one, Anita Farrington-Brathwaite, whose
daughter, Monet, is 8, said: ``I feel I have the best of both
worlds. I have a career that's really meaningful to me, and I have
a great deal of time to devote to my daughter. I really shudder at
the thought of having to spread myself thinner.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Farrington-Brathwaite, an undergraduate dean at New York
University, grew up in Queens and was herself an only child. She
said she never thought of having more than one. ``I grew up knowing
that I had a really good deal, that my parents, who really didn't
have that much money, were able to give me security I wouldn't have
had otherwise,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Farrington-Brathwaite, whose husband is also a college
administrator, lives in a two-bedroom NYU-subsidized apartment and
sends her daughter to the Little Red School House, a private school
that has a large percentage of only children. ``There is no way I
could have done that if I had more than one child,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Now that New York has been dubbed safe again and small-town
schoolyard shootings are still fresh in the public's imagination,
fewer couples seem to be moving out of town right after the birth
of their first child. Then, a few years later, at the time most
people decide to have a second child, these couples are loath to
move. ``New York,'' said Ms. Walker, who has returned to school to
become a psychotherapist, ``just gets in your blood.''
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Ms. Walker and her husband, who recently left a
family business to start an Internet venture, many people simply
decide not to have another child. Where members of an earlier
generation might have felt guilty or conflicted about that
decision, fearing they were depriving their child of sibling
companionship, today a large body of research shows that only
children do not suffer social or intellectual repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   And a welcome aspect of having an only child in Manhattan is
that such families do not stand apart, parents say. Amy Virshup,
40, a journalist who has a year-old son, Nicholas, lives with her
husband, an architect, in an Upper West Side building that may
stand as a microcosm of Manhattan: among the 24 apartments, there
are seven couples with one child. Each of the children is old
enough to suggest that the parents are unlikely to be planning
more. ``The only person who asks me when I'm going to have another
kid is my cleaning woman,'' Ms. Virshup said. ``She says I'm
lazy.''
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   With so many only children in town, the usual services and
activities for infants and toddlers take on a special tinge. Play
groups and luncheon clubs that specialize in first-time mothers _ a
disproportionate number of the total mothers in the city _ have
sprung up everywhere. ``When I grew up as an only child, it was
awful,'' recalled the novelist Dani Shapiro, 37, whose son, Jacob,
is now 5 months old. ``I was the only one in my entire private
school class. But I know that if I don't decide to have another
baby, Jacob will have lots of kids in his class who are only
children. That really makes a huge difference to me.''
</P>
<P>
   While the percentage of only children in Manhattan is the
highest in the United States, there has been a subtler boom in
one-child families across the country. Only children are the
nation's fastest-growing family demographic. Three-person families
have grown from 10 million in 1972 to more than 15 million today,
and between 1980 and 1990, the most recent census, there was a 76
percent increase among women nearing the end of childbearing with
one child. That trend, plus the rising number of childless couples
(nearly 18 percent), has lowered the United States birthrate to
less than two per family. Demographers trace the decline to a
rising divorce rate, higher costs to rear and educate children, a
rise in the number of working women and a rising age of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Although choice is not always a factor in the decision to have
an only child _ infertility is rising as women delay marriage and
childbirth into their 30s _ more people than ever are consciously
opting to have just one, experts say, especially in Manhattan.
``Here there is a self-selection factor,'' said Dr. Kathleen
Gerson, an NYU sociologist and the author of ``Hard Choices: How
Women Decide About Work, Career and Motherhood'' (University of
California, 1985). ``They say, `If staying in New York means having
only one kid, I'll do it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Only children may no longer be seen as deprived, but their
parents still sometimes come in for criticism for being
self-centered or for spoiling their offspring. ``We seem to have a
generation of Eloises in Manhattan,'' said Danielle Crittenden, a
cultural critic and the author of ``What Our Mothers Didn't Tell
Us: Why Happiness Eludes the Modern Woman'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster,
1999). ``Our standards for what we think we need to give our
children, in space and in things, is outrageous, absurd. Children
are like consumptive items, like a Jaguar. It's very sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gerson, who has a 16-year-old daughter who is an only child,
said she is now interviewing 18- to 30-year-olds for her research,
many of whom are themselves only children and ``take having only
one kid pretty much as a given.''
</P>
<P>
   Those decisions may well be influenced by the remarkable
turnaround in the attitude of psychologists and child-rearing
experts. Until the 1970s, the prevailing wisdom among experts, and
society in general, was that having an only child was tantamount to
cruelty. This view, shaped by turn-of-the century studies of the
pioneering psychologist G. Stanley Hall, held that only children
were spoiled and self-centered. ``Being an only child,'' Dr. Hall
wrote in 1892, ``is a disease in itself.'' Dr. Hall's influence was
profound: surveys throughout the years have shown that the primary
reason people cite for having a second child is to make sure their
first child isn't maladapted, Dr. Gerson said.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last 20 years, there has been a 180-degree shift.
Now, experts say there is virtually no difference between only
children and first-born children in self-esteem, generosity,
popularity and relations to parents. In fact, many studies show
that only children score higher on I.Q. tests and are more popular
with peers than children with several other siblings. The
psychologist Toni Falbo published a review of 141 studies in 1984
and concluded, ``Only children scored significantly better than
other groups in achievement motivation and personal adjustment and
were in all other respects indistinguishable from children with
brothers and sisters.''
</P>
<P>
   Scanning volumes on child-rearing in Barnes &AMP; Noble, it is
virtually impossible to find a condemnation of the choice to raise
an only child. A new generation of name-brand experts in
child-rearing has emerged, all of whom insist that Dr. Hall's
studies had no basis in fact, including Ann Laybourn of the Centre
for the Study of the Child and Society at Scotland's Glasgow
University and Susan Newman, author of ``Parenting an Only Child''
(Doubleday, 1990). Last year, the journalist Bill McKibben wrote
``Maybe One'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1998), an ecological defense of
only childhood that used a battery of new studies as ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   To cynics, and some parents of more than one child, it may be
hard not to wonder if psychology is not merely reflecting changes
in the societal landscape. With more women in the work force by
choice or necessity, and higher rates of infertility, it may seem
all too pat that new research shows that only children are not
disadvantaged. ``There is no doubt that we have a great ability to
mold our ideas of what is good for our children based on what is
good for us,'' Dr. Gerson said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA, Ohio _ Louis Hezebicks was dreaming of being reunited
with his son, Shawn Berry, whom he last saw as a toddler 20 years
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   He was hoping that Shawn and his older brother would drive
Shawn's battered, gray Ford pickup the 1,270 miles from Texas to
northeastern Ohio for a grand reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Then a network television news report about a racial crime
caught his eye. Three white men had dragged a black man to death
near Jasper, Texas, where his sons lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked up and saw this picture of this gray pickup truck ...
and I knew right then,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, the confirmation of his worst fears came
when his son, Shawn, was identified as one of the three white men
arrested in one of the most vicious racial crimes in modern
history.
</P>
<P>
   The truck he had hoped would bring his sons to him had instead
been used to drag James Byrd Jr. almost three miles down
back-country roads. His decapitated body had been found in front of
a black cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Berry, now 24, goes on trial for capital murder Monday in
Jasper, Texas, for his role in the June 7, 1998, slaying. Juries
have already convicted his two companions at the time, Bill King,
also 24, and Russell Brewer Jr., 32. Both were sentenced to die.
</P>
<P>
   Berry claims he had no part in the murder and tried to stop the
other two when they began beating Byrd in a forest clearing before
they chained him to the truck. Berry admits, though, that he was
driving in the early morning hours of June 7, 1998, when he stopped
to pick up Byrd, 49, as the older man staggered home drunk from a
party.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime after Berry's arrest, Hezebicks called the Jasper
County Jail and was allowed to talk briefly with his son. ``He
called me Dad,'' Hezebicks said. ``He told me he didn't do it. And
I have to believe him because he's my son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe that anybody who has any part of me in them
could do anything like that. I feel so bad about the Byrd family.
What a terrible thing for them to go through,'' Hezebicks said in
his first interview about the Jasper case.
</P>
<P>
   He heads the shipping department of an electronics company in
this blue-collar town about an hour's drive from Cleveland. At 43,
he suffers from emphysema and said financial problems may keep him
from making the long trip to Jasper to be with his son during the
trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to go down there and just walk around and talk to
people, if they'd talk to me,'' he said. ``I'd like to see the Byrd
family and tell them how sorry I am for all of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's parents and sisters have embraced relatives of the other
two defendants during the earlier trials. They have asked for
justice, not retribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to talk to that sheriff down there or somebody and
see if there's any way I could just see my son and hug him,'' he
said. ``I may never get to do that again.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would also like to visit with Shawn's girlfriend,
Christie Marcontell, and the couple's toddler son, Michael Montana.
</P>
<P>
   If Berry is convicted of capital murder, he faces either life in
prison or the death penalty. In either case, his visitors in prison
wouldn't be allowed to touch him. If he gets a life sentence, he
wouldn't be eligible for parole for 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd never see him come out,'' Hezebicks said. ``I won't live
that long.''
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Berry was the second son born to Hezebicks and Kathleen
Berry, high school lovers whose relationship began when he saw her
across the cafeteria in Geneva Junior High School.
</P>
<P>
   She was a couple of years older, hungry for adventure. He would
ride his bicycle, cutting through a trailer park to the street
where she lived with her parents across from her grandparents' mink
farm.
</P>
<P>
   He was barely 17 and still in high school when their first son,
Louis Berry, was born. Hezebicks said he wanted to get married, but
their parents and even a minister suggested they live together
instead, he recalled. He said he worked 48 hours a week at a gas
station while trying to finish high school and take care of his
little family.
</P>
<P>
   By then, her &UR;  &LR; parents had moved to Jasper County and Kathie, as
she was known, restlessly moved back and forth between Ohio and
Texas. Eighteen months after Louis, Shawn was born. He had his
mother's green eyes, but in adulthood, his dark hair and slender
build is much like Hezebicks'.
</P>
<P>
   Kathie was a ``free spirit,'' Hezebicks remembered, who was more
interested in having good times than trying to build a family. She
took off to Texas with their sons. On Dec. 12, 1976, she married
Don Hopson in Jasper.
</P>
<P>
   Hezebicks said he even wondered sometimes if he really was
Shawn's father. Then last month he watched an interview of his son
on the CBS-TV program ``60 Minutes II.'' ``There's no doubt now,''
he said. ``We just look too much alike.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathie and Don Hopson were together just two years, long enough
to have a daughter. Hezebicks said he got a phone call from Kathie,
saying she had gotten a divorce and wanted to come to Ohio but
couldn't make the trip alone with three small children. He flew to
Beaumont, Texas, and drove her and the kids to Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long, however, before he learned that the divorce
wasn't final and that money was still owed on the car she was
driving. Hopson and his family arrived to pick up the baby daughter
and ended up taking the two boys back to Texas as well. Kathie's
parents in Kirbyville got custody of the boys.
</P>
<P>
   That was the last Hezebicks ever saw of Shawn. His mother kept
up with the boys over the years, exchanging letters and pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Don Hopson remained a father figure for Shawn and Louis. They
lived with him and his parents at different times over the years,
even though he and their mom had both married other people by then.
At one time, they lived with Hopson in a house on Huff Creek Road,
near where Byrd was slain. In the ``60 Minutes'' interview, Berry
said he and his dad, meaning Hopson, had lived on that road.
</P>
<P>
   Hopson committed suicide in 1990. By then, Shawn was 15 and
Louis 17 and they were largely on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials in Jasper say they have no idea where
Berry's mother is.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1991, Kathleen Wright, as she was then known, was
sentenced to seven years in prison after pleading guilty to a
charge of delivery of a small amount of cocaine. Records indicate
that &UR;  &LR; she never went to prison, but was paroled after serving about
three months in county jail.
</P>
<P>
   She was indicted in a similar case in 1993, but records indicate
she was never arrested on that charge.
</P>
<P>
   Hezebicks eventually married, had three daughters, divorced and
remarried. He and his family live in a Civil War-era house near the
center of his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Although he says he at last has the family he always wanted,
Hezebicks says he has always wondered about his sons. ``There was
always this piece of me that was missing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then a couple of years ago his wife, Gina, began a search for
the boys on the Internet. She gave Hezebicks phone numbers to try.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even remember what I found or how I found it,'' she
said. ``I just tried everything I could think of and we started
coming up with some numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Then one night about three years ago, Louis, who had learned of
his father's search, called him.
</P>
<P>
   That phone reunion led to a few visits by Louis Berry. He once
spent several months living with the Hezebicks and even found a job
there.
</P>
<P>
   Louis went back to Texas, but said he planned to return. Perhaps
he would come back with Shawn, and maybe with their girlfriends.
They would make the trip, he said, in Shawn's gray pickup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sure wish they had come up here before all this happened,''
Hezebicks said.
</P>
<P>
   He is convinced his son was in the wrong place at the wrong
time.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors, however, contend that Shawn Berry was a thrill
seeker who eagerly joined in the brutal slaying with his buddies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wish there was some sort of way I could go back and
make this all just not happen,'' Hezebicks said. ``If I could go
down there and chain myself to the back of a pickup truck, I'd
gladly let myself be drug down that road if it could make Mr. Byrd
come back. Nobody deserves what happened to that poor man.''
</P>
<P>
   If his son is acquitted or somehow eventually released from
prison, Hezebicks said he would urge him to move to Ohio, change
his name and start a new life.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had my way, their names would have always been
Hezebicks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to just walk around down there in Jasper and talk to
people and ask them if they know my son and what they think about
him,'' he said. ``I'd like to know if they think he's somebody who
can do something like that.''

BABBITT SAYS `NEVER AGAIN' AT JAPANESE AMERICAN MEMORIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A few months after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor
on December 7, 1941, Masaji Inoshita, his parents and nine brothers
and sisters were forced to leave their California farm and move to
an internment camp in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   This, despite the fact that Inoshita and his siblings were born
in the United States and had never set foot in their ancestral home
of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his anger at the government for questioning his loyalty,
Inoshita readily signed up when U.S. Army recruiters came to the
internment camp looking for volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   Inoshita spent more than three years with the Japan-American
442nd Regimental Combat Team fighting in Italy and France while his
family remained at the Gila River Internment Camp surrounded by
barbed-wire fences and armed guards. More than 33,000 Japanese
Americans served in U.S. forces during World War II and the 442nd
would become one of most decorated units in U.S. military history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt we had to prove ourselves,'' Inoshita said of his
decision to fight for the country that had imprisoned him and
120,000 other Japanese Americans during World War II. ``I was born
here. This is my country.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 60 years later, Inoshita, age 80, represented the Gila
River Internment Camp during a ground-breaking ceremony Friday for
the National Japanese American Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial will sit in a triangular park between the U.S.
Capitol and Union Station and is expected to be open to the public
in about a year.
</P>
<P>
   Also attending were representatives from the nine other
internment camps the U.S. government set up to confine Japanese
Americans during the war.
</P>
<P>
   The monument will contain the names of the more than 800
Japanese Americans who died fighting in World War II as well as the
names of the 10 internment camps on a curved granite wall.
</P>
<P>
   The center of the monument will be a 14-foot bronze statue of
two Japanese cranes struggling to free their wings from barbed
wire.
</P>
<P>
   Nina Akamu, a third-generation Japanese-American sculptor, said
she designed the statue to depict Japanese Americans' struggle to
free themselves from the camps and become fully recognized U.S.
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial is being paid for with $10 million in private funds
but it will be turned over to the United States Park Service when
it is complete.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, who oversees the Park Service
said, ``This monument is here to say this must never, ever happen
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Rep. Norman Mineta, D-Calif., who helped the National
Japanese American Memorial Foundation raise funds for the memorial,
told the audience, ``The American government could not make a
distinction of those who were leading the attack on Pearl Harbor
and Americans who were by accident of birth of Japanese ancestry.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial ``is a reflection about that time and the progress
that has been made over the years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mineta was also the author of 1988 legislation in which the
United States government formally apologized to the Japanese
Americans forcibly imprisoned during the war. The law also
authorized the payment of $20,000 to each of the 82,000 internment
camp survivors.

<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mineta was 11 years-old when he and his family were forced to
leave their San Jose, Calif., home for an internment camp shortly
after President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066
on Feb. 19, 1942, authorizing imprisonment of people of Japanese
heritage from the West Coast out of fear that they would align
themselves with the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt's action followed a wave of hysteria that swept the
region in the weeks following Pearl Harbor. Thousands of people
prepared for an attack on California as rumors spread that Japanese
ships were spotted off Santa Barbara and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   From San Diego to Seattle, people of Japanese heritage were
relocated to the 10 camps. Some Japanese Americans were sent as far
away as Colorado and Arkansas where they stayed until the war ended
in 1945.

MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF EXCESS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga.)  (For release Thurs., Oct. 28)  
(mk) 
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   SAVANNAH, Ga. _ Be careful of too much success. Your house could
become so famous they'd have to install a porta-potty across the
street.
</P>
<P>
   In this center of southern charm and intrigue, where men fought
duels and ladies wilted, you can quickly tell you're at Mercer
House, the red brick mansion where antique dealer Jim Williams shot
his young assistant and lover Danny Hansford. Right in the middle
of Monterey Square, among the old oaks dripping with Spanish moss,
is a portable toilet for the comfort of tourists who come to stare
at Mercer House.
</P>
<P>
   You must know about Jim and Danny. If you came to Savannah and
didn't know them or Selena or Adler or Lester or Lady Chablis
because you hadn't read ``Midnight in the Garden of Good and
Evil,'' you wouldn't catch half the references on the tour bus.
Savannah has been around a lot longer than The New York Times best
seller list but given the preponderance of ``Midnight'' gewgaws
hawked just about everywhere, you'd think it was the city's only
real claim to fame.
</P>
<P>
   The book is nothing to be ashamed of. It's a good story based on
bizarre and real events and well written but it's no classic.
Flannery O'Conner, who lived in Savannah, was a writer of classics.
There are bookstores that give her her due but she doesn't have a
coffee mug and a refrigerator magnet in her name. Nor, apparently,
does fellow Savannahian poet Conrad Aiken.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no escaping ``Midnight'' and renditions of its
cover, the statue of the Bird Girl, which is reproduced in
bookends, cookbook covers and Christmas ornaments.
</P>
<P>
   You don't see any obvious voodoo priestesses or people drinking
martinis in cemeteries, nor standout drag queens, at least none as
hot as Lady Chablis, who still occasionally performs around town
and has her own Web site and book.
</P>
<P>
   ``Midnight's'' author, John Berendt, who made an estimated $9
million so far just on the hardcover, comes back now and again,
recently for a party to kick off the paperback version. Every
interview with him that's seemingly ever been done is plastered on
some wall in some gift shop or bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   The book has been out since 1994. It's sold 2.5 million copies
in hard cover alone. It was on the best seller list for four years.
It's a good yarn and stacked with sex and violence and that
peculiar decadence that oozes Southern. But after a couple of days
of seeing it everywhere, you kind of begin to hate the thing.
</P>
<P>
   At one gift store, with three rooms singularly devoted to
``Midnight,'' a clerk sat watching a football game, perhaps trying
to drown out the movie soundtrack which played the same song,
``Skylark,'' over and over. A potential customer said she'd
purchase her postcards elsewhere. ``I don't like to encourage this
kind of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   One guidebook says that the book has brought in more than $10
million in tourist revenue. It's even boosted real estate prices.
And while some locals are said to be fed up to their feathers with
``Midnight'' hype, others are loving the attention and waiting for
it to happen again.
</P>
<P>
   They're getting ready to film a movie in Savannah with Will
Smith and Matt Damon, directed by Robert Redford, according to a
waiter who also whispered that downstairs at that very moment Matt
Damon was dining with Winona Ryder. They like going to his
restaurant because they can be left alone, he said, going on to
tell the surrounding tables the same news, as well as sharing the
code name they use when making reservations. He said we also might
keep an eye out for Redford.
</P>
<P>
   Savannah's done others. Here is the park where Forrest Gump sat
on a bench and defined life. Here is the restaurant where Julia
Roberts spied on her husband in ``Something to Talk About.'' Before
I went there I imagined Savannah looking like a scene out of
``Prince of Tides,'' but that movie was actually filmed up the road
at Beaufort, the same place where they filmed ``The Big Chill.''
Maybe high school kids would learn geography better if they could
link famous movies to different parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
   What's happened in Savannah, though, is more than having a movie
crew come to town to memorialize its pretty face. Here it's life
imitating art imitating life. Before Jim Williams met author
Berendt he was embroiled in a debate with another city figure over
how the town was growing. Some of the graceful old homes were being
ripped down and turned into parking garages. Now Jim is dead, his
lover is dead, Berendt is rich and Savannah is saved, in a manner
of speaking.

IN AN INFLATION MEASURE, A WAY TO PLAN FOR GOLD  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 24) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Fla.)   (af)  
 By MARK HULBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What makes gold soar will eventually make stocks swoon.
</P>
<P>
   That simple truth explains much about the recent downward path
of the stock market. The gold market came to life well in advance
of the Dow's most recent correction, which started in late August.
</P>
<P>
   The price of gold is up 20 percent since it began its rise on
July 20, despite weakness last week. Moreover, gold mutual funds
gained an average of 19.2 percent during the third quarter,
according to Lipper Inc., the research firm, after a 2 percent
increase in the second quarter, the first time in four years that
gold funds have produced back-to-back quarterly gains.
</P>
<P>
   Many investors may not make the connection between the rise of
gold and the selloff in stocks because they see gold's rally as
artificial. That is not entirely unreasonable, because the sharpest
part of the rally was seemingly prompted by an external event that
did not have much to do with gold's economic fundamentals _ the
announcement on Sept. 26 by European central banks that they would
limit their sales of bullion.
</P>
<P>
   The rally has been propelled further by another nonfundamental
factor: Short covering from traders who had been aggressively
shorting gold.
</P>
<P>
   Still, after studying gold forecasting models tracked by The
Hulbert Financial Digest, I have concluded that the fundamental
cause for gold's rally was not the central banks' announcement, but
increasing inflationary pressures, against which gold is a
traditional hedge. In fact, one of the most successful models bases
its buy and sell signals on inflationary trends, and it had turned
bullish on gold in mid-September, well before the steepest part of
the rise.
</P>
<P>
   This forecasting model was devised by the Institute for
Econometric Research of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., a newsletter
publisher. The model is simple, based not on the absolute inflation
level but on whether or not inflation is accelerating.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, it compares the Consumer Price Index's most recent
12-month percentage change with the corresponding reading three
months earlier. If the most recent reading is higher, then the
model is bullish, and investing in gold funds and shares is
recommended.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Labor Department announced in mid-September
that the Consumer Price Index was at 167.1, or 2.3 percent higher
than it was a year earlier. In June, three months before that
announcement, the index was at 166.2, or 2.1 percent higher than in
June 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The model thus indicated that inflation was accelerating, and it
issued a buy signal for gold. (That trend was supported by the
consumer price report last Tuesday, which showed inflation over the
previous 12 months at 2.6 percent; in July, that figure was 2.0
percent.)
</P>
<P>
   Because conditions were already ripe for a bullish move in gold,
I believe that if the central banks hadn't provided the straw that
broke the gold market's bearish back, sending gold prices up 14
percent in a week, something else would have. Those who analyzed
the inflation data might well have seen what was coming _ 11 days
ahead of the central banks' move.
</P>
<P>
   Though the institute's record is not perfect, it is impressive.
Over the last 15 years, by my calculations, an investor who
switched a portfolio in and out of the gold market on the model's
signals would have gained 2.6 percent, annualized. That doesn't
seem striking until it is compared with the 0.2 percent loss,
annualized, that he would have suffered by buying and holding
bullion.
</P>
<P>
   Picking specific gold-mining stocks is trickier. Many companies
sell their gold production in the futures market. The hedging
protects against declines in gold's price. But it means that they
won't be benefiting immediately from higher gold prices. That is
why one of the favorite mining companies among gold newsletters is
Franco-Nevada Mining of Toronto, whose policy is to not hedge its
production.
</P>
<P>
   Among newsletters I track, the most-recommended no-load gold
fund is American Century Global Gold. The stocks it holds are
geographically diversified, use different hedging strategies and
represent both high- and low-cost producers.

<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The U.S. Army knew it had a potentially deadly
problem when an OH-58 Kiowa Warrior helicopter lost power and
crashed into an Alabama pine forest, destroying the aircraft and
injuring both pilots.
</P>
<P>
   A secret Army report on the Nov. 8, 1993, crash concluded that a
fuel filter used on OH-58 helicopters was prone to trap air and
``may cause engine malfunction.''
</P>
<P>
   Five months later, an OH-58 Kiowa Warrior carrying Lt. Michael
A. Aguilar and Capt. Kenneth A. Sexton crashed into a Nevada
hillside. Army investigators again suspected the same type of fuel
filter trapped air and choked off power to the helicopter's only
engine.
</P>
<P>
   Both Army officers died.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they knew something was wrong with it, why did they let it
go on?'' said Ernest Aguilar, an Army veteran of two wars and the
father of the pilot. ``Something should have been done.''
</P>
<P>
   Every day thousands of men and women go into the sky believing
in an unspoken promise: The military is doing all it can to keep
them safe.
</P>
<P>
   But an 18-month Dayton Daily News examination found that the
military breaks that promise virtually every day.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper found that the military routinely allows
helicopters and airplanes in the air that it knows are plagued with
potentially deadly safety problems _ conditions, in some cases,
allowed to persist for months, years or even decades.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News reviewed thousands of pages of accident reports
and analyzed hundreds of thousands of computer records made public
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Among the findings:
</P>
<P>
   _ The military's system for repairing and maintaining aircraft
is itself broken. Hundreds of in-flight emergencies and accidents _
some deadly _ can be traced to parts installed improperly, engines
overhauled incorrectly and other mistakes by mechanics or the
people supervising them.
</P>
<P>
   _ The military has concealed its true aviation safety record
from the public. Since 1980, hundreds of serious accidents were
omitted from the military's official accident rate, and the
percentage of uncounted accidents is growing, from 1.6 percent of
all accidents in 1980 to 23 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   _ Decisions critical to the safety of the men and woman who fly
on military aircraft frequently are left to private civilian
companies with millions of dollars riding on those decisions. In
some cases, those companies participate in secret accident
investigations even as they face multimillion-dollar lawsuits
involving the same accidents.
</P>
<P>
   _ Federal investigators suspect that several CH-47D Chinook
helicopter accidents may be linked to gears made with a specially
processed metal at two factories, one in Springfield. In August, 14
years after the first accident, problems with gear parts made with
the same metal led to a worldwide grounding of Chinooks, the
largest such grounding ever.
</P>
<P>
   _ The military operates more than 15,000 fighter jets,
helicopters and other aircraft with virtually no independent
oversight. If the safety of civilians depended on the same system,
airlines could choose their own employees to investigate accidents,
decide when to ground their own aircraft or when to replace unsafe
parts, and make these decisions in secret, with little fear of
being sued.
</P>
<P>
   The military's already flawed aviation safety system recently
has become further strained by massive downsizing and budget cuts,
the loss of thousands of experienced pilolicts and an aging fleet
of aircraft. Amid these problems, the rate of serious aviation
accidents increased this year for all the services except the Navy,
which was rebounding from an 82 percent increase in 1998. The
Army's rate for serious accidents was the highest since Desert
Storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm beginning to understand how the military deals with this
stuff,'' said James Browne, whose son was killed when he flew a
helicopter that Navy investigators later determined was not safe to
fly. ``They don't want to spend the money to fix something until
they're between a rock and a hard spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're willing to sacrifice as acceptable risk the lives of
military personnel.''
</P>
<P>
   The military's top safety officials said aviation has never been
safer. They acknowledged the recent increase in the accident rate,
but said their statistics during the past 30 years show a drastic
drop in the rate of serious aviation accidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I care about these sailors and Marines,'' said Rear Admiral
Frank M. ``Skip'' Dirren Jr., commander of the safety center in
Norfolk, Va., that oversees Navy and Marine Corps aviation safety.
``If we find something wrong, we fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   Brig. Gen. Gene Martin LaCoste, commander of the U. S. Army
Safety Center at Fort Rucker, Ala., said many accidents are caused
by human error, not by long-standing problems ignored by the
military.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see guys making more mistakes because of less experience in
the cockpit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Major Gen. Francis C. Gideon, Jr., commander of the Air Force
Safety Center at Kirtland Air Force Base, N.M., and the former
director of operations for the Air Force Material Command at
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, said serious aviation accidents
have become so rare that they are ``almost statistically
irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
   Problems continue despite warnings
</P>
<P>
   Despite assurances that the military is doing everything it can
to prevent accidents, planes and helicopters keep falling from the
sky for the same reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The engine-control assembly (ECA) in the Navy's F-18 Hornet had
failed 114 times when a pilot in Florida reported a problem on July
1, 1996. ``Multiple ECA failures fleetwide posing unacceptable risk
to aircraft crew,'' an investigator warned after that incident.
Exactly one month later, another F-18 reported the same problem.
Three months later, another was reported.
</P>
<P>
   Hydraulic failures in the Navy and Marine Corps' CH-46 Sea
Knight helicopters caused more than 71 emergencies and accidents
since 1988, three resulting in a loss of helicopters _ one of them
part of President Clinton's fleet. Earlier this year, 11 years
after the first incident was documented, two people were injured
when a helicopter filled with reporters and photographers caught
fire off the coast of California. It was the second time in four
days that hydraulic problems had forced a Sea Knight to make an
emergency landing in California.
</P>
<P>
   An electrical relay used in the vapor system for the Navy's
twin-engine E-2C Hawkeye airplane failed at least 54 times _ 26 of
the incidents causing fires or an electrical spark. In 1996, an
investigator warned: ``This situation needs to be rectified. . . .
We were fortunate that this incident happened on preflight.'' Two
months later, an E-2C reported smoke in the cockpit after the vapor
system failed. Two similar cases were reported in 1997 and at least
one in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes recommendations go unheeded even after problems turn
deadly.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Warrant Officer David E. Glamuzina, 46, and Specialist
Thomas Nessmith, 22, were flying in an AH-1F Cobra helicopter above
a pineapple field in Hawaii on March 5, 1996, when Glamuzina
radioed the nearby Wheeler Army Airfield tower that he was having a
maintenance problem.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen seconds later, tower officials received another
transmission from the helicopter, one they couldn't hear well
enough to understand. Witnesses heard the Cobra's engine begin to
wind down as it descended through trees, snapping a tree with an
18-inch trunk as it crashed and slid 60 feet into a deep ditch that
ran through the pineapple field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the absolute worst place to go down,'' said Army Lt.
Col. Stan Nessmith, who flew to the site from his job at Maxwell
Air Force Base in Alabama upon hearing that his only brother was in
a helicopter crash.
</P>
<P>
   Glamuzina and Nessmith were killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``For as long as I can remember, Thomas Nessmith wanted to be a
soldier,'' Lt. Col. Nessmith wrote in a memorial he had published
in a Florida newspaper. ``I never knew anyone who knew him who
didn't like him. He had a way of walking into a room and within
minutes he would have everyone laughing.''
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks after the crash, Army technicians concluded that a
gear failure ``produced ferrous metal debris'' or metal chips in
the engine oil system _ a problem usually preceded by a ``chip
detector'' warning light.
</P>
<P>
   That light illuminated when a magnet in the engine oil system
collected enough debris to signal a potential problem.
</P>
<P>
   The magnets were left in the engine's oil system, but the
warning light on this helicopter _ and on 800 others _ had been
disconnected after pilots complained of unnecessary emergency
landings. That system had been replaced by a new warning system
manufactured by a company owned by Eaton Corp. of Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   The new system, located in a different part of the aircraft,
vaporizes metal debris with an electrical current. Unlike the old
chip detector system, the Oil Debris Detection System, or ODDS, was
designed to warn pilots only when the electrical current cannot
vaporize the debris.
</P>
<P>
   After the Hawaii crash, Army technicians recommended that the
service reconnect the old chip detectors because they provided ``an
effective warning of impending failure.''
</P>
<P>
   But the lights were not reconnected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We received the recommendation and decided there was no value
added'' by reconnecting the old warning lights, Army spokesman Mark
J. Jeude said during a September briefing to Dayton Daily News
reporters at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   The lights are wrong most of the time, Jeude said, and nuisance
lights are ``not something we want to accept.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's unbelievable that somebody made that decision,'' Lt.
Col. Nessmith said. ``It seems to me it's not worth the chance of
somebody's life.''
</P>
<P>
   On March 1, 1997, nine months after Army technicians recommended
that the service reconnect the warning lights, four soldiers from
the Indiana National Guard were flying 200 feet above an Indiana
pine forest when the engine failed on their UH-1V Huey helicopter.
The pilot, Chief Warrant Officer Thomas L. Miller, started a
desperate diagonal descent toward a clearing in the trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't make it to the landing area,'' said Staff Sgt. Keith
Pyle, the crew chief, who was strapped in just behind the pilots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking this was a bad situation and life as I know it
was over. It was not a pretty picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Just 40 yards from the clearing, with the helicopter pointed
downward in a 45-degree angle toward the intended landing site, the
aircraft crashed skid-first into a small grove of trees.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, a father of two, was killed in the crash. Pyle, whose
full-time civilian job was driving trucks, broke his back and needs
metal braces to walk. The other two crew members, Lt. Todd Bouslog
and Staff Sgt. Don Brinker, also were seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   The Army sent the engine to the same shop, supervised by the
same people who oversaw the examination of the Hawaii wreckage.
Again, the technicians recommended reconnecting the old
chip-detector warning lights.
</P>
<P>
   If the Army wasn't going to reconnect the old warning lights,
the technicians recommended, it should remove the old system
altogether. The old system, they said, may be hiding potential
problems by collecting debris in the engine oil system before the
debris is able to make it to the ODDS warning system.
</P>
<P>
   Again, the Army decided not to follow the recommendation of its
experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old chip detector has not been reconnected or removed,''
said Army spokeswoman Martha Rudd. ``There was no need to.''
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared statement, the Army acknowledged that the old chip
detector ``might still occasionally collect some metal debris that
settles to the bottom when the engine is shut down.'' But the ODDS
system, the Army said, should alert pilots of any problems caused
by this debris.
</P>
<P>
   This year the Air Force, through the Air Force Material Command
at Wright-Patterson, began buying 65 ODDS kits for its helicopters.
An additional 135 kits are earmarked for the Greek Army, and
negotiations are under way with the governments of Taiwan, Turkey,
Jordan and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing of the newspaper's findings, Pyle, Bouslog and
Miller's widow, Josephine, filed a lawsuit against the companies
involved in the manufacturing of the ODDS system. The suit, filed
in the federal district court in Indianapolis, alleges that the oil
debris detection system on the helicopter was defective.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Parsons, a spokesman for the Eaton Corp., referred
questions about the ODDS system to the Army.
</P>
<P>
   `No fix in sight'
</P>
<P>
   Even when it acts on a potentially deadly problem, the military
often chooses small, measured responses, postponing more difficult
solutions until the same problem leads to more accidents.
</P>
<P>
   After the OH-58 Kiowa Warrior helicopter crashed in Alabama in
1993, the Army issued a technical bulletin requiring mechanics to
use new procedures to bleed air from the fuel system.
</P>
<P>
   Months later, after Lt. Michael A. Aguilar and Capt. Kenneth
Sexton were killed in another OH-58 crash, Army technicians
recommended further steps to keep air from the fuel system,
including the possible introduction of a vent.
</P>
<P>
   Some aircraft, however, fly for years or decades as the military
struggles with persistent mechanical problems.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the military struggled to prevent engine problems
that plagued the AH-1W Super Cobra attack helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   There were two types of malfunctions: rollbacks, causing the
engine to roll back to idle; and flameouts, the sudden loss of
engine power _ different problems that can be linked to a single
cause.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1995, a AH-1W Super Cobra helicopter from Camp
Pendleton, Calif., suffered the eighth engine malfunction by the
same squadron in a little more than a year. Mechanics first
suspected water in a wiring harness, but when they took the
helicopter up, the same engine flamed out again.
</P>
<P>
   The Super Cobra has two engines, so losing one is not
necessarily critical. In 1995 and 1996, however, the Navy
investigated reports of dual engine failures.
</P>
<P>
   In one of those cases, on April 18, 1996, an AH-1W from the
Marine Corps Air Station in Iwakuni, Japan, suffered a dual engine
failure.
</P>
<P>
   Maintenance personnel in Japan checked a fuel switch. They
swapped engines. They replaced the engines. But they couldn't fix
the problem. So the engines were sent to General Electric ``for
investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   A year later, on March 25, 1997, an AH-1W from the USS Nassau
reported its No. 2 engine had failed, prompting his commanding
officer to write: ``This is the second rollback in four months on
this engine in this aircraft. ... This hazard is being addressed
... with no fix in sight.''
</P>
<P>
   By March 1997, the military had documented more than 70
rollbacks and flameouts involving the Super Cobra.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two months later, Alice Ruff was sitting at her desk
at Ruff House Ministries about 15 miles southeast of downtown
Dallas when she spotted a Super Cobra helicopter that appeared to
be in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw it come over the tree,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty minutes after takeoff, the helicopter crashed in a field
near a high school, killing both pilots. The helicopter, however,
missed the five-acre ministry property, which includes dormitories
housing homeless families.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a Christian organization,'' Ruff said. ``We don't call
it luck. We call it blessed. But I felt bad for the people in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Michael J. Browne, the father of two girls and a combat
veteran of Desert Storm and Somalia, and Lt. Robert B. Straw, also
a husband and father, were killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't take but a word or a thought for someone to cry,''
Browne's father said. ``His wife is alone taking care of the
girls.''
</P>
<P>
   A Navy investigation found that the helicopter ``was not safe
for flight and should have been grounded'' before it left Bell
Helicopter Textron Inc. near Fort Worth, Texas. The investigation
found that there were outstanding ``urgent'' technical directives
for work on the aircraft _ at least two of them aimed at preventing
engine failures.
</P>
<P>
   Rear Adm. Dirren, who reviewed Naval Safety Center records of
the accident at the request of the Dayton Daily News , said: ``We
blew it.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time of the Dallas crash, the Navy had assembled a
special ``tiger team'' to investigate the cause of the engine
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tiger team was window dressing,'' said Dallas attorney
John Howie, a former Navy pilot who now represents the Browne
family in a lawsuit against Bell and General Electric Co. Inc.,
which manufactured the engine. ``Somebody was going to die. It was
predicted before this crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the helicopters cannot be flown safely, you park them.''
</P>
<P>
   Dirren said that the Navy never found the exact cause of the
Dallas crash.
</P>
<P>
   On May 5, 1998, a year after the Dallas crash, an AH-1W assigned
to the USS Wasp reported an engine flameout. A report on the
incident says: ``Since this incident, there has been another
aircraft flameout occurring.''
</P>
<P>
   In November 1998, more than four years after the Navy begin
documenting engine failures in the AH-1Ws, drains were installed to
prevent fuel from building up in the engines, Dirren said, adding
that the new drain was a result of the tiger team investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we have an issue (with rollbacks and flameouts),'' the
admiral said. ``We think we got a fix.''
</P>
<P>
   Cost is a factor
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes problems go unresolved because the military decides
the solutions are too expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look back at the risks,'' said Marine Corps Col. Roger
Dougherty, who until this year was aviation safety chief at the
Naval Safety Center in Norfolk, Va. ``What's the severity of the
risks and what's the potential of it happening again?
</P>
<P>
   ``And then we have to make hard choices based on dollars and
cents. If it's a high risk that's going to happen often, it gets
fixed. That's the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   In the system used to ensure civilian aviation safety,
independent federal regulators can mandate safety changes. In the
military system, the services decide for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the independence is a critical part of the
investigation,'' said Gene L. Sundeen, chief of regional operations
and general aviation for the federal National Transportation Safety
Board.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to ask an agency to investigate itself and
criticize itself. When an agency is asked to investigate itself, it
often has an urge to hide problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Free to choose, the military has made some poor choices, writing
problems off as not warranting expensive solutions only to find the
same problems turn catastrophic.
</P>
<P>
   By early this year, the Air Force had documented 11 in-flight
failures of afterburners on Pratt &AMP; Whitney F-100-220 engines, used
on F-15 and F-16 fighters. The afterburner, or augmentor, fits into
the exhaust section of the jet and provides extra power by
shrinking the size of the exhaust while injecting and igniting
additional fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Pieces of sheet metal called stiffeners, each welded on in 70
places, are attached to the afterburner on the F-100-220 engine to
keep it from buckling under the tremendous heat and pressure
produced by the engine.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force found that vibration and aging caused the welds to
split until eventually the afterburner cracked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nozzle and augmentor actually came off,'' said Robert May
Jr., who as propulsion product manager is in charge of engines for
the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   An afterburner used for engines on another type of F-16 is
chemically milled, or attached without welds, May said, and the Air
Force could have easily solved its afterburner problem by putting
chemically milled afterburners on its F-100-220 engines, used on
both the F-15s and F-16s.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``To retrofit this new augmentor... is 40 to 50 million
dollars,'' May said, and that's just for the F-16s.
</P>
<P>
   Forty to 50 million dollars is roughly the cost of a couple of
F-16s.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was put off. After all, none of the 11 in-flight
failures had caused a major accident. The F-15s, which have two
engines, continued to fly on one engine, and the F-16s, which have
only one engine, were able to land before the problems turned
catastrophic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't rush to put these parts on because none of the
events caused Class A (accidents),'' May said.
</P>
<P>
   That changed this year.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 3, an F-16 piloted by a student from Luke Air Force
Base, Ariz., crashed near Gila Bend, Ariz. No one was seriously
injured, but the $20 million aircraft was destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   The next month, on March 26, another F-16 from Luke Air Force
Base crashed on private property near an Arizona freeway. The pilot
ejected and no one was injured. The aircraft was destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Both F-16s had afterburners that were attached with welds. In
each case, the afterburner broke free and the engine fell apart,
igniting a fire as flying debris ruptured the fuel lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our risk analysis shows we were in error before,'' said Maj.r
Gen. Gideon, the Air Force Safety Center commander.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Derek Kaufman, a Luke Air Force Base spokesman, said the
Air Force now plans to replace the old afterburners, but it could
take several years. Until then, he said, mechanics will do more
comprehensive inspections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inspections allow us to mitigate the risk, but we know the
real fix is replacement parts,'' Kaufman said. ``We can't manage
risk through inspections forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Michaels, a national resource specialist for the Federal
Aviation Administration, said that in similar situations involving
civilian aircraft the FAA would issue a safety warning after one or
two reports of parts falling off planes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't have waited for three,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cost also was the reason the Navy denied a recommendation to
install a safety feature following the Dec. 17, 1992, crash that
killed Lt. Cmdr. James E. Boyle when his Navy F-16 crashed in
Idaho. An officer assigned to investigate the crash blamed pilot
error, but he also found that the Navy wasn't using a computer
software package that warns F-16 pilots when the plane is at a
dangerous angle. The Air Force, the investigator found, already was
using the software on its F-16s to warn pilots when they are flying
close to terrain.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy decided that installing the safety feature would not be
``cost effective'' because its F-16s would only be used for two
more years.
</P>
<P>
   `Accept necessary risk'
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the military's needs _ its missions _ are deemed more
important than the risks posed by safety hazards.
</P>
<P>
   ``All U.S. Air Force missions and our daily routines involve
risk,'' says a copy of ``Risk Management'' guidelines for Air Force
officers. ``Accept necessary risk required to successfully complete
the mission or task.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Avoiding risk altogether requires canceling or delaying the
job, mission or operation, but is an option that is rarely
exercised due to mission importance.''
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Eric Johnson learned this first hand.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, the aviation representative at the Pentagon for the
Army Safety Center, is permanently scarred from an aviation
accident.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's face and legs were burned on Feb. 23, 1993, when a
UH-60A Blackhawk helicopter crashed in Germany, causing a
230-gallon external fuel tank to explode.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was on fire when he ran from the burning helicopter.
Another officer's clothes were still smoldering when he stumbled
from the wreckage. Four others, including Maj. Gen. Jarrett
Robertson, the deputy commander of V Corps in Germany, were killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had there not been a fire, three of those four individuals
would have survived,'' said Johnson, who filed suit against the
helicopter manufacturer, United Technologies Corp. ``I'm not
speaking for the Army, only from a personal aspect.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason they didn't survive, Johnson said, is that the huge
external fuel tanks, added to the helicopter so it can fly longer
without landing, were never designed to survive a major crash. In
addition, he said, the helicopter was never designed to fly
regularly with the tanks.
</P>
<P>
   An Army report on the accident says one passenger was killed by
impact forces, and seven other passengers were either killed or
injured by ``thermal injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years before the Germany crash, investigators working for
a Congressional committee warned Congress that putting certain
types of external tanks on Blackhawks could create ``potential
dangers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we found out was that because of the weight of these
things, the nose (of the helicopter) came near to touching the
ground,'' said Lawrence Dandridge, one of four General Accounting
Office investigators temporarily assigned to the committee staff.
``We also found out they were not crashworthy fuel tanks, so we
told them not to use them.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Germany crash, Johnson said he tried to convince the
Army Safety Center to consider using crashworthy tanks, just as the
congressional investigators had done three years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I raised it as an issue,'' he said. ``I think the safety
center has always been interested in crashworthy tanks, but it just
wasn't a top priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of replacing the tanks, the Army decided to better
educate pilots of potential problems in controlling the helicopter
when the tanks are mounted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess they thought the training would help fix it,'' Johnson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Four years after the Germany crash, on July 8, 1997, a Blackhawk
helicopter crashed into a stand of tall trees in North Carolina,
rupturing both 230-gallon fuel tanks and killing all eight people
aboard as the helicopter exploded into a fireball.
</P>
<P>
   The Army issued a press release blaming the accident on pilot
error. But accident investigators noted that the crew would have
survived had it not been for the external fuel tanks rupturing and
causing the fire.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate written response to the Dayton Daily News, Army
officials at the Pentagon said the external fuel tanks were
designed to be jettisoned from the helicopter and not intended to
be ``directly involved in every helicopter crash.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not likely that a tank designed with any different
specifications would have made a difference in the crash,'' the
written response says.
</P>
<P>
   Following the Fort Bragg crash, the Army took further steps,
requiring that missions involving Blackhawks using the external
fuel tanks must be first approved by a high-ranking officer,
usually someone with the rank of least a lieutenant colonel or
above.
</P>
<P>
   Nine years after the investigators warned Congress, the Army
still allows Blackhawks to fly with the old tanks. Johnson said
tests are under way on a safer tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``They continue to use them,'' Johnson said. ``The leadership in
the military is not forceful enough to simply say, `It wasn't
designed for that. Let's quit using it.''

<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ In early 1994, Brett Roby wore something special
to work at SPECO, a now-defunct factory in Springfield, Ohio, that
produced military aircraft parts for more than 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   He wore a wire.
</P>
<P>
   Department of Defense investigators planted the hidden
microphone underneath Roby's clothes after he raised questions
about the safety of American soldiers flying on the CH-47D Chinook,
the U.S. Army's chief transport helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   Roby, an inspector at the Springfield factory, had warned that
the metal used to make gears for the helicopter contained a common
but potentially dangerous flaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was raising a lot of hell about the possibility that we had
a material that was unstable,'' said Roby, a former Dayton resident
now living in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   A team of federal investigators in Dayton and Washington, D.C.,
and Roby's private attorneys in Cincinnati now suspect four
accidents that killed seven people may be linked to gears made with
the metal. Records, released after being kept under seal for years
by a federal court, show investigators also have tried to link at
least three other crashes that killed 13 people to the gears.
</P>
<P>
   And in August, more than five years after Roby went to federal
investigators, armies worldwide grounded hundreds of Chinooks after
a British Royal Air Force maintenance facility in Scotland found
cracks in gear parts made with the same metal.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Army initially grounded its entire fleet of 466
CH-47Ds, the most Chinooks ever put down at one time.
</P>
<P>
   The metal, Vasco X2M, was first used on helicopter gears by
Boeing, which patented a process to heat-treat the metal. Vasco was
used on gears that power the eight 25-foot rotor blades on the
Chinook, the first production aircraft to fly using the metal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because Boeing invented this and had the patent rights and was
trying to make a market for this material, (Boeing was) trying to
use the Chinook as a guinea pig to show that this material could be
used in aircraft applications,'' said Roby's attorney, James B.
Helmer Jr. of Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation into the failures of Vasco-made gears in the
CH-47D helicopters illustrates one of the most significant
anomalies in military aviation: Private aircraft companies are
allowed to help _ relied on heavily in many cases _ determine the
official causes of military aviation accidents, even though the
same companies can face up to hundreds of millions of dollars in
civil judgments and penalties that may hinge on what the official
causes of the accidents are determined to be.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, as Boeing was faced with lawsuits questioning the
safety of its products, it was allowed to examine evidence and play
other key roles in helping the Army decide if those same products
were endangering the lives of American service personnel.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1995, Roby filed a lawsuit against Boeing in federal
court in Cincinnati under the federal False Claims Act. The act
encourages government whistle-blowers and other citizens to report
government contractor fraud by offering a reward _ in the Roby case
up to 25 percent of what the government recovers.
</P>
<P>
   The suit alleges that Boeing, the world's largest aircraft
manufacturer, violated federal and common law because it ``sold, or
caused to be sold,'' defective helicopter gears to the Army. The
Justice Department has joined Roby in the legal action, and the
government is seeking hundreds of millions of dollars from Boeing
for the cost of destroyed or damaged helicopters and replacing
gears in existing helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   SPECO was one of four companies that made gears or gear parts
using Vasco for the CH-47D. Boeing also contracted with Litton
Precision Gears of Chicago, now Boeing Precision Gears, which used
SKF Industries of Philadelphia and MRC of Jamestown, N.Y., to
manufacture bearings for the gears.
</P>
<P>
   Although Roby's lawsuit deals only with SPECO-made gears, the
investigation has expanded to include accidents involving aircraft
with gears made at Litton. In addition, faulty gear parts machined
at MRC are linked to the current groundings.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Army and Boeing defended Vasco.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Vasco is manufactured according to specifications and
made into gears correctly, the Army has verified that it is safe
for use in the helicopters,'' a prepared statement from the Army
says.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing officials deny that any Litton-made gears were linked to
crashes. They acknowledged that some SPECO gears and gear parts
machined at MRC were faulty, but they blamed the problem on human
error, not on Vasco.
</P>
<P>
   From time to time, manufacturers produce faulty gears, Boeing
officials said, but inspections are supposed to identify bad gears.
Both SPECO and MRC failed to identify the problem gear parts
through inspections, the officials said, and that caused the
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should have been caught,'' said Boeing attorney Mitchell
S. Ettinger of Washington, D.C., during an interview at a Boeing's
corporate office in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam prompts search for stronger gears
</P>
<P>
   Following Vietnam, the military decided it needed gears that
would continue working even after a helicopter lost oil from battle
damage or mechanical problems. The Department of Defense contracted
with a number of companies, and Boeing began experimenting with
Vasco, a metal invented by another company and used to make tools.
</P>
<P>
   The outer portion of aircraft gears, the case, is supposed to be
very hard, but the core needs to be softer. Vasco could maintain
its tool-steel hardness even under high temperatures and without
oil, but it was unsuitable for the inside or core.
</P>
<P>
   So Boeing changed the composition of the metal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a new process,'' Ettinger said.
</P>
<P>
   SPECO, once one of the nation's leading gear manufacturers,
first used Vasco for aircraft gears in the early 1970s, when it
contracted with Boeing to produce gears for a huge military
transport helicopter prototype.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got to remember that was a development program, and part
of the program was to develop Vasco,'' said Tom Stevens, who worked
at SPECO for 30 years and left as manager of contracts when the
company went out of business in 1996. ``Vasco was supposed to be a
material that provided extra strength and extra wear-capability
under high temperature conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   But the program to build the huge helicopter was canceled, and
the prototype never flew.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the 1970s, Litton used Vasco to make gears for another
Boeing military helicopter prototype. Although that prototype flew,
it was never put into production because Boeing lost the
competition to what eventually became the UH-60 Blackhawk
helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary report from a 1977 NASA-sponsored test at the Army
Research Laboratory in Cleveland found that the teeth of gears made
with Vasco fractured during heat treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The apparent sensitivity of the modified Vasco ... casts
doubts on the practicality of using this material at the present
time beyond laboratory and prototype testing,'' the report says.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing claimed the method used for the 1977 test was flawed, and
company officials say the final NASA report in 1980 was more
favorable.
</P>
<P>
   The CH-47 Chinook, first used by the Army in 1962, weighs 10
tons and stands as high as a two-story building. The helicopter can
carry up to 36 soldiers and crewmembers.
</P>
<P>
   When the program to build the huge transport helicopter was
canceled, the Army moved to upgrade its existing transport
helicopter, the Chinook, creating a D model. Boeing was selected
for the Chinook upgrade and Vasco was used for many of the gears.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no secret that Vasco was a difficult material to
process,'' said SPECO's Stevens. ``Processing Vasco required
operations not required for other material.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, five years after the first NASA test, Litton detected
grinding cracks in some of the gears, according to an October 1982
memo from Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   Then, less than three years after the Boeing memo, came the
first crash involving a D model.
</P>
<P>
   On April 21, 1985, Chief Warrant Officer Alexander Brazalovich
was aboard a CH-47D Chinook on his way to a classified mission with
an unusually heavy load of fuel and personnel. Ten minutes after
landing in Honduras, as the helicopter refueled, Brazalovich knew
there was trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard an explosion, and the aircraft started rocking left to
right,'' he recalled during an interview. ``I hit my shoulders on
the side of the wall. The next thing I know I am on the ground. I
was pulled out of the aircraft because I was covered with debris.''
</P>
<P>
   The helicopter was destroyed, but the crew escaped with no major
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   An Army report later found that two gear parts made of Vasco
broke into eight pieces each, and Boeing identified what it
believed were ``grinding cracks'' on one of the Litton-made gears.
The Army report found that the gear problems did not cause the
accident, but the service ordered better inspections to identify
cracks in gears.
</P>
<P>
   Brazalovich, who had access to the Army's secret conclusions and
findings, said the Army blamed the accident on a bolt that came
loose.
</P>
<P>
   ``The official explanation didn't match what the maintenance
people thought,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Three months later, on July 11, 1985, Boeing test pilot Albert
L. Freisner, 48, and three other crew members took one of the first
CH-47D models for a test flight from the company's plant in
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   A month before the flight, during an inspection of gears on all
CH-47Ds, a Vasco gear on the helicopter was rejected because of
what the inspectors believed was a manufacturing defect.
</P>
<P>
   At 5,000 feet over New Jersey, Freisner heard a loud explosion
from the rear of the helicopter, where many of the gears and
transmission are located. Smoke filled the cockpit. Freisner
parachuted to safety, but two other crew members were killed, one
hit by a rotor blade as he tried to parachute.
</P>
<P>
   Roby's attorneys and federal investigators now suspect the 1985
New Jersey crash was linked to Vasco gears manufactured by Litton
in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing officials said the New Jersey crash was caused by a
transmission problem, not a gear problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no proof it was a gear failure,'' said Ettinger,
Boeing's attorney.
</P>
<P>
   15 die in two helicopter crashes
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, SPECO began making Vasco gears for Boeing at its
70-acre parts factory in Springfield, which once employed as many
as 2,200 people.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, on Feb. 25, 1988, a CH-47D from Fort Sill,
Okla., was flying at 3,000 feet near Chico, Texas, northwest of
Dallas, when the crew heard a popping sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then there was a loud bang,'' Sgt. First Class Frank Prather
told investigators. ``Immediately after the loud bang, the aft,
right side of the aircraft was engulfed in flames.''
</P>
<P>
   The helicopter slammed into the ground at more than 130 mph. Of
the 19 people on board, 10 were killed and at least six others
suffered permanent injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Patricio lost both of his hands in the fire, and his face
and much of the rest of his body were severely burned. He sued
Boeing in 1989 and won a settlement for an undisclosed amount, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to look at myself,'' Patricio said during an
interview this year at his business in Seattle. ``At one time, I
broke down. I didn't have any hands. I had to depend on people ...
to feed me.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no way I was going to give up.''
</P>
<P>
   The military never determined the exact cause of the 1988 crash.
Army investigators noted that problems found on a gear were
``interpreted differently by several engineers and investigators,''
but the Army said those problems did not cause the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing officials said the Texas crash had nothing to do with
gear failure. Investigators involved in the ongoing probe disagree
over whether the crash could have been caused by the Vasco gears.
</P>
<P>
   Ten months later, on Dec. 8, 1988, Chief Warrant Officer Randall
B. Potter was piloting a CH-47D over Honduras when witnesses heard
a loud bang, followed by what appeared to be smoke coming from the
rear of the helicopter. As with the Texas crash, the bang was
followed by a much louder explosion and fire.
</P>
<P>
   The burning helicopter crashed, killing all five crew members.
</P>
<P>
   The Army at first suspected a high-intensity radio transmission
could have caused the accident but later ruled it out.
</P>
<P>
   The Army offered a reward to people in Honduras to locate
helicopter parts, and someone brought in a Vasco gear part, which
federal investigators suspect may be linked to the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Miami attorney Bob Parks represented the families of three dead
airmen in a lawsuit against Boeing. The company settled the case,
he said, but he couldn't recall the amount.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing officials acknowledged that a gear, made of Vasco and
manufactured at Litton, failed, but they don't know what caused the
gear to fail. They also said the gear failure itself did not cause
the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something acted on that gear and caused it to fail,'' Ettinger
said.
</P>
<P>
   Crash deaths alarm Congress
</P>
<P>
   The 1988 Texas crash alarmed Congress, and a team of
investigators was dispatched to study aviation safety in the Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious that something was occurring because the birds
were falling out of the sky,'' said Leo Sullivan, one of four U.S.
General Accounting Office employees loaned to a congressional
committee for the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Congress held hearings in 1990, the Chinook had been
the subject of 84 safety messages: Five requiring immediate
groundings of all aircraft, 11 indicating a ``hazardous condition''
that may or may not result in groundings and 30 requiring mandatory
maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   The team of congressional investigators, in a report titled,
``Let the Flyer Beware,'' found that the Army was ``occasionally
slow to react to serious aircraft problems, tending to wait until
disaster strikes before addressing them.'' Often, even when the
Army does address a problem, the report says, it is a ``Band-Aid
solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither the hearings nor the yearlong investigation by the team
of investigators dispatched by Congress identified Vasco or the
gears made from it as a common link in the accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Concerning the 1985 New Jersey crash, Gen. Donald R. Williamson,
who headed the Army Aviation System Command, said during the 1990
hearings that the accident was caused by an ``improperly assembled
transmission,'' and he also noted that control rods on the
helicopters needed fire protective coatings. The Army, he said,
started a ``paint application program'' to prevent the problem from
happening again.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the 1988 Honduras accident, Gen. Williamson told
Congress, was linked to a gear that had failed ``due to unknown
causes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence available indicates a one-time isolated event
that will not reoccur and that the fleet is operating under safe
conditions,'' the general assured Congress.
</P>
<P>
   As the Army assured Congress the CH-47D was safe, commanders
prepared to ground the helicopter for the seventh time in two
years.
</P>
<P>
   `I heard a loud bang'
</P>
<P>
   On July 24, 1990, two months after Gen. Williamson tried to
reassure Congress that the Chinooks were safe, Lt. Nancy A. Schulz
was flying a CH-47D at night over Fort Campbell, Ky., a
15,760-pound concrete block dangling from a line attached to the
helicopter cargo hook.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard a loud bang, and the aircraft started shaking real
bad,'' Schulz told investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Suspecting the concrete block might be the problem, Schulz
pushed the cargo release button. But the power was gone, and the
helicopter began to turn upside down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were flying through the air upside down,'' Schulz said in a
deposition for a lawsuit filed against Boeing by the family of one
of the crewmembers. ``The forward portion of the cockpit was all
gone. There was no wind screen. There were no instruments. ... I
closed my eyes and just pulled my legs together in as tight as I
could.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the helicopter crashed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next thing I really recall is crawling from the
aircraft,'' Schultz said in the deposition. ``And I saw ... a crew
member at the time at the nose of the aircraft screaming.''
</P>
<P>
   Three of the five people on board were killed. Schultz and
another crew member escaped with only injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The family of the instructor pilot, Chief Warrant Officer Dale
W. Tate, sued Boeing, claiming the cargo hook was defective. The
court dismissed the case in 1995, but Tate's attorney, Brian
Alexander of New York, is trying to get the civil case reopened
because, in light of the current federal investigation, he suspects
the cause could be linked to Vasco gears, not to the cargo hook.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander said he wanted to get the gears, but he learned Boeing
took them. Boeing officials said they purchased the gears, along
with other wreckage, from the Army, and Boeing is currently using
the wreckage for aircraft training in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and Roby's attorneys also are interested
in the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tate crash sequence is, in many respects, similar to the
crash sequence of other Chinooks,'' says a request by the Justice
Department to get records from Tate's civil case.
</P>
<P>
   Army officials said they have no records showing what happened
to the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   The federal court in Cincinnati has ordered Boeing to allow the
Justice Department to inspect certain gears from the wreckage. The
court, however, has sided with Boeing in denying the Justice
Department access to records from Tate's civil lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing officials said the Kentucky crash had nothing to do with
problems with the Vasco gears.
</P>
<P>
   Bad gears found after Saudi crash
</P>
<P>
   One month after the Kentucky crash, on Aug. 23, 1990, Brett
Roby, then a newly hired quality assurance inspector at SPECO,
officially requested that all grinding on Vasco gears be stopped, a
request that effectively blocked production.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had people coming to my desk asking me what the hell I was
doing,'' said Roby, who had been at SPECO only six months when he
issued the order. ``You got to understand, I created a huge
bottleneck in the production process, something the culture of this
facility doesn't tolerate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the kind of stuff that makes a guy wake up at night and
sweat when you're working on these parts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under strong pressure from several officials at SPECO, which was
years behind schedule, Roby said, he agreed to lift his order to
stop work.
</P>
<P>
   Months later, on Jan. 11, 1991, during Operation Desert Storm,
Chief Warrant Officer Robert D. Gardner, a Vietnam veteran, was
flying a CH-47D carrying 18 crew members and passengers over Saudi
Arabia when he noticed an engine caution light.
</P>
<P>
   As the helicopter was 15 to 20 feet above the ground, smoke
poured from an area near an engine, and as the forward wheels
touched the sand, the rear of the helicopter exploded.
</P>
<P>
   As the passengers and crew escaped with their lives _ some
crawled through broken windows _ the ammunition inside exploded,
and fire destroyed the helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   The Army and Boeing blamed the crash on manufacturing defects in
a SPECO-made gear. Following the crash, the Army, with the help of
Boeing, inspected its fleet of CH-47Ds with SPECO gears.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 360 gears inspected, 20 were identified as having similar
problems and replaced.
</P>
<P>
   `The whole aircraft shuddered'
</P>
<P>
   On June 24, 1993, Donald Defenbaugh was flying one of the
CH-47Ds that had cleared an inspection after the Saudi Arabia
crash. Defenbaugh, a civilian Army employee, recalled that everyone
thought the inspections solved the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the basic understanding in the military: That all the
bad ones had been replaced,'' said Defenbaugh. ``The whole aviation
community thought it was solved.''
</P>
<P>
   Defenbaugh was giving an Army Reserve pilot a test flight over
Maryland with four people on board when smoke started pouring from
the engine. Then the gears exploded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were only 20 feet off the ground when it happened,'' he
said. ``The whole aircraft shuddered in an unusual vibration.''
</P>
<P>
   He made an emergency landing, and, though the aircraft suffered
substantial damage, no one was injured. About a third of one of the
helicopter's gears broke off, Defenbaugh said.
</P>
<P>
   Defenbaugh said the Army never made him aware of the problems
with the CH-47Ds, and he recalled that the Army treated his
accident as an isolated incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was my feeling at the time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing blamed the Maryland crash on a mistake by a SPECO worker
trying to remove a sharp edge from a gear surface.
</P>
<P>
   Following the Maryland accident, the Army grounded its fleet of
CH-47Ds just long enough to check similar gears in other
helicopters. Following the inspection, three more gears were
replaced, but Boeing said in court documents that the three gears
were replaced ``for other reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Roby said he requested more tests on the gears. It
was then, Roby said, he became aware of tests done years earlier
showing that Vasco had flaws making the metal susceptible to
cracking. The flaws were called continuous innergranular carbide
networking (CICN), a problem similar to a crack on a piece of wood
or plastic that can cause splitting or cracking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I let my managers know we had this condition,'' Roby said.
``We cut it (more gears) up and found the same thing. We had three
out of three that were bad. I was starting to get nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in 1993, Roby said, he was asked by two high-ranking SPECO
officials to stop testing gears. Not long after that, in January
1994, Roby contacted the Defense Criminal Investigative Service
(DCIS) office in Dayton, a civilian agency empowered to investigate
fraud, waste and abuse in the Department of Defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them I didn't think it (CH-47D testing) was being
handled properly,'' Roby said.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1994, the Department of Defense inspector general
issued a ``Notification of Defective Transmission Gears''
concerning the CH-47D. The notification, which outlined the
investigation by the Dayton DCIS office, advised military and
civilian authorities to take ``any action deemed appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what action was taken in response to the notification, the
Army said in a written response, ``The U.S. Army continued to fly
the CH-47s.'' The notification, the Army said, was eventually
withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   In the records Boeing filed with the federal court in
Cincinnati, the company says the existence of carbide networking in
VASCO ``was fully disclosed to the Army in 1993.'' In 1994, the
court records say, the Army begin its own analysis of carbide
networking in Vasco.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Boeing says, the Army concluded that carbide networking
identified by SPECO did ``not present a safety hazard.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing officials called Roby's claims ``unsupported
allegations,'' and they said no gear failures can be linked to
Vasco.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are thousands of Vasco gears in service today
manufactured by SPECO and Litton, and the CH-47 fleet has
collectively flown in excess of 600,000 flight hours without mishap
due to material deficiencies,'' Boeing wrote in a prepared response
to the Dayton Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   `I had a moral responsibility'
</P>
<P>
   Three months after Roby went to the Defense Criminal
Investigative Service, he was laid off from SPECO. Although other
employees were also laid off, Roby said he felt his layoff was
connected to his complaints about Vasco.
</P>
<P>
   ``They called it a management reorganization,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On May 22, 1995, Roby filed his lawsuit in federal court in
Cincinnati against Boeing Co. under the False Claims Act.
</P>
<P>
   On April 30, 1997, the Justice Department intervened in the suit
Roby filed. That same year, a test conducted at Wright-Patterson
Air Force Base for the Justice Department found CICN flaws in Vasco
gears.
</P>
<P>
   In February of this year, workers at a British Royal Air Force
maintenance center in Scotland found cracks on a gear part, an RAF
spokesman said. The part, which is made of Vasco, holds bearings in
a gear assembly, or raceway on which the bearings move.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a Boeing representative on site (in Scotland),'' the
RAF spokesman said. ``It was brought to his attention.''
</P>
<P>
   The RAF grounded its Chinooks, called Mark 2s by the RAF, on
Aug. 7 or 8, the RAF spokesman said. The U.S. Army grounded its
fleet on Aug. 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``We determined the risk to be very high,'' said Mark J. Jeude
of the Army's Aviation-Engineering Directorate.
</P>
<P>
   Documents filed in federal court in Cincinnati show that in
1991, eight years before the current groundings, Boeing ordered
examinations for cracks on bearing raceways. Ettinger, Boeing's
attorney, said the 1991 examination concerned a ``different
anomaly'' than what caused the current groundings, and the earlier
examination was closed in 1994, after Boeing decided there was ``no
cause for concern.''
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 27, the Army returned half its Chinook fleet to duty but
restricted them to 80 percent engine power.
</P>
<P>
   SPECO, which closed in 1996 and filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy, was
a defendant in Roby's lawsuit but settled in 1997, agreeing to pay
$20 million to the government and $332,017 to Roby and his
attorneys. No money has been paid out because of the pending
bankruptcy case, and Roby's attorneys expect that, at best, they
will recover a fraction of the amount.
</P>
<P>
   Litton was purchased by Boeing and is now called Boeing
Precision Gears, currently the sole manufacturer of the CH-47
gears.
</P>
<P>
   Under the False Claims Act, the contractor can be forced to pay
the government three times the amount lost due to fraud, and an
additional $5,000 to $10,000 for each false claim. Roby is alleging
240 false claims, and his attorneys estimate that the government is
seeking hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Trial on his lawsuit is expected to begin sometime next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect a settlement,'' Helmer said.
</P>
<P>
   Roby, who is currently unemployed and living off Social Security
for a spine disease, said he doesn't regret what he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``It boils down to this: I had a moral responsibility,'' he
said. ``I got to shave in the morning. I think they knew they had a
problem with the processing of the metal.''

BEAUTY AND THE BEASTS: IT'S A MYSTERY

<TEXT>
<P>
   Henry Horenstein claims he doesn't know very much about animals.
Yet his appreciation of them is graphic.
</P>
<P>
   In two new books _ ``A is for . . . ?'' (Harcourt Brace) and
``Creatures'' (Pond Press) _ the photographer invites readers into
a secret realm in which even the most recognizable animals become
riddles.
</P>
<P>
   In so doing, he translates into film a truth that the most
ardent nature lover knows well _ animals are ultimately unknowable.
No matter how much you learn about them, there is still mystery.
That's how it is with a great romance.
</P>
<P>
   Horenstein found himself looking straight into the eyes of some
animals. Connecting. But also wondering. ``Who the hell knows
what's going on in there?'' he says with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   In these books, as well as in a current exhibit at the New
England School of Photography on Commonwealth Avenue, Horenstein
surprises in brown-toned portraits of zoo and aquarium animals.
</P>
<P>
   With soft, sensual images produced using black-and-white film
and color processing, Horenstein, a seasoned photographer who
teaches at the Rhode Island School of Design and has written a
classic textbook on photography, shows off a passion for form _
concentrating on lines and curves rather than cliched, standard
images.
</P>
<P>
   Most often, it's just a part of an animal we see. And not the
parts one might expect. His giraffe shot doesn't include the neck.
No trunk to depict his elephant. And there isn't even a glimpse of
a shell in his tortoise portrait.
</P>
<P>
   With the children's book ``A is for . . . ?,'' this becomes a
game in which the reader has a letter from the alphabet and a small
segment of an animal as clues. And guessing which animal is not
always so easy. You have to think. Sometimes hard.
</P>
<P>
   Horenstein knows the feeling. ``I love animals,'' he says, ``but
I really don't know what's going on with them.'' The photographer
says his editor pushed him ``to look for mystery'' in the animal
world, and that, in fact, is what he always saw.
</P>
<P>
   Through four years of lugging 60 or 70 pounds of camera
equipment into various zoos and aquariums, often working with
natural light, Horenstein was often surprised:
</P>
<P>
   By the cownose ray (looking exactly like a society matron, pearl
necklace and all) who kept coming back to stare at him. ``I
definitely had a feeling she was watching me,'' Horenstein says.
</P>
<P>
   By the cheetah at Roger Williams Park Zoo who sat up suddenly at
the sound of dinner approaching and gave Horenstein an unusual
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   By the delicate fingernails on the walrus's flipper.
</P>
<P>
   And by the beauty of the hippo's back, which appears on the
cover of ``Creatures,'' taken with a cheap camera picked up at the
last moment during a trip to Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Horenstein's pictures surprise too. He makes a duck look
pensive. A beluga look blissful. And akomodo dragon appear wise,
notmenacing.
</P>
<P>
   And now Horenstein is hooked. Though he's documented lots of
worlds with his camera _ flowers, baseball, bicycles _ he's
plotting his next animal adventures. He'll be checking out animals
in European zoos for a possible ``Creatures Redux,'' and he's
looking into fellowships that just might help him keep his eye on
animals.

   Good night with Goodall: Famed chimpanzee expert Jane Goodall is
back in the spotlight with a new documentary and companion book
both called ``Jane Goodall: Reason for Hope.'' The show airs twice,
Nov. 7 at noon, and Nov. 8 at 10 p.m. on WGBH-TV (Ch. 2). ``Reason
for Hope'' traces Goodall's spiritual journey from a child growing
up in Bournemouth, England, to National Geographic pinup girl in
Tanzania in the 1960s, to the revered globe-trotting naturalist she
is today.
</P>
<P>
   What drove Goodall to share her thoughts about spirituality? The
woman seems incapable of fudging. In a 10-minute interview
conducted just before a talk she gave at Harvard a few weeks ago,
she revealed that the family home in Bournemouth is in desperate
need of repair, and the offer from the publisher was just right.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the film, narrated by Harrison Ford, is as
uplifting as it is moving, with great archival footage, recent
scenes, and music from Bobby McFerrin accompanying Goodall's
thoughts. Despite the ongoing destruction of chimpanzee habitat,
and the horrifying conditions in which so many lab chimps are kept,
Goodall dares to be optimistic as she travels constantly around the
world to raise awareness and funds.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times recently poked fun at Goodall, calling her
latest adventures ``a little icky-poo.'' But at the same time, the
writer also referred to chimpanzees as monkeys. They're apes _ the
chimps, that is. ``Reason for Hope'' gets the proverbial two
opposable thumbs up.

COSTELLO PROVES HE'S A LONG-PLAYING CUT

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's fair to say that singer-songwriter-guitarist Elvis Costello
isn't moving boatloads of CDs these days, what with his Burt
Bacharach collaboration and the perception that this veteran
English artist might have been supplanted by too much
sentimentality.
</P>
<P>
   But he's gathered a rabid audience of faithful fans over his two
decades-plus in the public eye and he reels 'em into the concert
halls. Costello, 45, did this Thursday night at Boston's Orpheum
Theatre, playing with keyboardist extraordinaire Steve Nieve, a
longtime anchor of Costello's now-defunct backing group the
Attractions, and touring without any particular album to support.
</P>
<P>
   These turned out to be very good things _ the duo format and the
implied freedom to pick and choose from his expansive, eclectic
catalog of material without the concern of pushing current product,
the latter being the reason most tours exist to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   Costello and Nieve are out on the road for the joy (and, yes,
the financial remuneration) of it and were still going strong at
the two hour-and-10 minute mark, when we exited to make deadline
with the expectation they'd go another 20 minutes and play five
more songs.
</P>
<P>
   The ``regular'' set started in near darkness with a terse new
song, ``Alibi,'' and lasted 70 minutes, closing with the sweetly
malevolent ballad ``Alison''; Costello and Nieve were in the midst
of their sixth set of encores, playing the pulsating, teasing
``Green Shirt'' (with Nieve adding Tangerine Dream-like synth lines
and Costello coaxing gutteral growls from his electric guitar) when
duty called.
</P>
<P>
   Nieve, introduced as ``maestro'' by Costello, has become the
Keith Emerson of, well, whatever genre he's playing in. He's all
over the keyboards and consoles _ piano, synth, rhythm box _
banging away like a madman when appropriate or laying down an
exquisite, quiet cluster of notes. At one point, during the
syncopated, mutant-techno version of ``Clubland,'' he seemed like
the Chemical Brothers' third sibling.
</P>
<P>
   For ``Watching the Detectives,'' he kept the reggae pulse and
added spare, jarring effects, pumping up the tension in conjunction
with Costello's staccato riffs.
</P>
<P>
   It's been said before but bears re-stating: Costello, once the
most abrupt and antagonistic of performers (first Orpheum show,
1978, played in under an hour; left stage to deafening guitar
feedback to drive patrons out) has turned into the most loquacious
and generous of performers.
</P>
<P>
   His vocal prowess has grown; his writing has remained razor
sharp, for the most part. That was all on display under the
beautiful, subdued (mostly red) stage lighting. Costello shifted
moods from the ballads (``What's Her Name Today?'') to the rockers
(``Temptation'') expertly.
</P>
<P>
   Deeply emotional songs, like the cry-in-your-beer crooner
``Almost Blue'' and the long, raw-nerved, obsessive ballad ``I Want
You,'' were on the same high ground as brooding pop songs like
``Girls Talk'' (maybe the best opening line ever: ``There are some
things you can't cover up with lipstick and powder . . .''),
``Little Triggers'' and ``(I Don't Want to Go to) Chelsea,'' and
mature embattled-relationship songs like ``Indoor Fireworks'' and
``Motel Matches.'' ``Veronica,'' all breezy melody and acute
observation, again shone as one of the most sad/uplifting songs
about aging.
</P>
<P>
   New tunes, ``You Lie, Sweetly,'' about two new lovers and the
uncomfortable truth of the morning after, and ``45,'' about the
conflicts of the age itself and memories of 45 RPM records (Hey,
George Harrison got away with ``33 1/3''), held their own. The only
fault you could find might be with Costello's shameless encore
milking.
</P>
<P>
   But, really, when you're given an abundance of riches like this,
it's hard to begrudge how often he exits and mounts the stage. Hard
to believe, perhaps, but 22 years down the road and Elvis is still
king.

OUR CONVERSATION WITH GREGORY PECK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``My agent told me, `You could be a big Western star.' But I
liked to talk,'' Gregory Peck says, chuckling. Instead, Peck
emerged as the kind of actor who starred in more different types of
movies that audiences hold close to their hearts than perhaps any
other major actor. Certainly, the stars of Peck's era _ Henry
Fonda, James Stewart, John Wayne, Cary Grant _ made pictures that
audiences took to, but they rested in a specific type of persona.
</P>
<P>
   Peck combined warmth, masculinity and good looks, and he varied
his film resume in a career that varied from ``The Gunfighter'' in
1950 to ``Roman Holiday'' in 1953 to ``The Omen'' in 1976. And even
to working with Alfred Hitchcock on ``Spellbound'' (''He was not an
actor's director,'' he remarks of Hitchcock, although Peck politely
describes the experience as ``satisfying'' and ``pleasant.''
Hitchcock's direction consisted of ``just drain your face of all
emotion.'')
</P>
<P>
   Peck's more of a protean actor. In the cable special, ``A
Conversation With Gregory Peck,'' running this month on TCM,
audience members _ literally from all over the globe _ stand up to
testify about the effect a Peck performance had on them. Peck will
offer a similar opportunity to audience members this afternoon at
Bass Performance Hall, when, as part of the Fort Worth Film
Festival, he turns his life into a one-man show and takes questions
from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came from the theater,'' Peck muses, ``where the idea was to
do a variety of things. I guess I could've gotten into a groove,
but I wanted to take a chance.'' What Peck isn't as well regarded
for is that his roots as an actor are very similar to those of
Marlon Brando and James Dean. Studying at New York's Neighborhood
Playhouse with Sanford Meisner _ a seminal teacher who encouraged
his students to look upon acting as behavior rather than simple
representation _ Peck brought a searching quality to his work,
which contradicted his broad-shouldered confidence. That training
gave Peck an important tenet upon which he could build his work:
(Meisner) ``kept hammering on acting as doing. I would always
remind myself of that. I had to learn to be a movie actor. And it
took some time, I must say. But I never found acting for film
difficult. I never felt put upon by it at all.'' Peck credits yet
another teacher for the elegant way he moves on screen _
dancer/choreographer Martha Graham, with whom he studied for three
years.
</P>
<P>
   Peck feels that he came into his own in his second film, ``The
Keys of the Kingdom,'' in which he was an aging priest who plays
over all the deeds of his life. ``When I did `Keys,' I was very
sincere,'' he notes, then adds, ``I learned to put a little gravy
on it.'' He definitely ladled on the flavor for ``The Macomber
Affair,'' an adaptation of Ernest Hemingway's short story ``The
Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber'' and one of the best literary
translations ever brought to the screen. (It wasn't his last
Hemingway protagonist; Peck also starred in ``The Snows of
Kilimanjaro.'') He found himself attracted to leads that were less
than classical protagonists. ``That's true,'' he responds,
modestly. ``I did play some nonheroes in my day. Quite a few of
them, actually. But (starring in an adaptation) of the Great
American Novel was not daunting.''
</P>
<P>
   That capacity to make a deeper contact with an audience isn't
something that just happens, Peck believes. Proof of that is the
work that it took to get ``The Yearling'' _ the damp-eyed classic
adaptation of Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings' book, in which he plays the
father of a young boy who develops a special relationship with his
pet deer _ to the screen. ``I was pretty green at the time. (The
movie was made in '46.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``In the scene when we named the little fawn, we had to keep him
in the shot. And the deer didn't want to stay in the shot. It was
110 degrees _ I remember they would come and rub us down with cool
chamois cloths between takes _ and the deer just refused to stay
put. It kept walking off. It took 76 takes in all to get it.''
Which may explain why Peck appears to be so patient and thoughtful
in the film; he learned it the hard way.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly, Peck's roughest time came on his most ambitious
role, starring as the obsessed Captain Ahab in director John
Huston's ``Moby Dick.'' ``Young people still come up to me and say,
`I remember ``Moby Dick''; it shook me up.' But it got mixed
reviews when it cam out. I took a little lambasting for it when it
came out. And it was difficult, shooting all that stuff on the
water was very trying for all the actors. But I never regretted
trying it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Peck limited his men-wrestling-with-damage roles to
literary adaptations. He fights his conscience in, of all things,
the romantic comedy ``Roman Holiday,'' which was the first of his
collaborations with director William Wyler. ``I met Wyler at
Grauman's Chinese (the legendary movie theater in Hollywood) at the
premiere of `Twelve O'Clock High.' '' And how did Peck get the lead
in ``Holiday''? ``Well, (Wyler) said to me, `Can you play comedy?'
I told him I played the Mischa Auer part in `You Can't Take It With
You' onstage. And I was funny.'' Not only is he funny, but he's
complicated. Peck is a journalist secretly running around Italy
with a princess-in-hiding (Audrey Hepburn) and wondering whether he
should expose her. ``(Holiday'' takes on even more resonance in
light of the tragedy surrounding the death of Princess Diana.)
</P>
<P>
   And one of the biggest moments in ``Roman Holiday'' is a test of
truth, when Peck and Hepburn stick their hands in the mouth of a
stone idol _ which will bite it off if they're lying (and both are)
_ and Peck pretends to withdraw only a stump. ``That's an old trick
of Red Skelton. Wyler thought it was corny, but he said, `It's only
film.' '' Peck says with a laugh. `` `Go ahead and do it.' '' It
seems, too, that Peck was falling in love with Hepburn, as the
world would when ``Holiday'' was released. ``Well, of course. She
was luminous.'' Even though it was her first starring role, Peck
pushed for Hepburn to get a credit equal to his: ``She deserved
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Peck reflects on the relationship that audiences have with his
films, the affection that sent so many young people into law school
after seeing his heroic country lawyer Atticus Finch in ``To Kill a
Mockingbird.'' ``They don't get it out of there unless you put it
there,'' Peck says. ``You deal in feelings, but you can't get too
sloppy about it. But not all of my movies touch off the hair of the
back your neck. Sometimes, it's just work. And that can be a good
thing, too. But in those cases where the movies came to mean
something, I can't think of one that I did not respond to when I
read the script.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean,'' he laughs, ``that's why you say, `Yes!' ''

 &HT;    MAGAZINE SEES 'GRIDLOCK' IN U.S. AIR TRAFFIC
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The normally staid and technical magazine Aviation
Week is pushing the alarm button in a special report filled with
dire predictions of worsening congestion, narrower safety margins
and increasing delays in air travel.
</P>
<P>
   After evaluating the worldwide air traffic system, David M.
North, the magazine's editor-in-chief, writes in Monday's issue,
``we found that Europe is indeed in a state of crisis with delays
and gridlock, and the U.S. is rapidly approaching that point.''
</P>
<P>
   With an expected 50 percent increase in the U.S. flying public
over the next decade, the report predicted that an average travel
day in 2010 will have the feel of a current Wednesday before
Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   The report blames the problems on an ``archaic'' air travel
infrastructure and the failure of the Clinton administration, the
U.S. Transportation Department and Congress to act on
recommendations made by three commissions.
</P>
<P>
   Passenger discontent has yet to unite into a movement strong
enough to force action, said the report, despite a doubling of
complaints filed with the government this year compared with 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine outlines an action plan including:
</P>
<P>
   _ Splitting the Federal Aviation Administration into two parts,
one to oversee safety and the other to provide air traffic
services.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gradually privatizing the air traffic control system,
described as using outmoded methods that are incapable of handling
current traffic.
</P>
<P>
   _ Using all of the $10 billion Airport and Airway Trust Fund,
which is collected from airline ticket taxes, toward building and
expanding airports and runways. Some of those funds have been used
to reduce federal deficits in the past.
</P>
<P>
   _ Guaranteeing better treatment of passengers, including minimum
seat space in economy class.
</P>
<P>
   Even with such improvements, the magazine offered a pessimistic
outlook for the near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sadly, the U.S. air travel system has been allowed to go so
long without a workable and sustained plan for modernization that
it is too late to have a solution in place before things get
worse,'' said North's editorial.
</P>
<P>
   Eliot Brenner, spokesman for the Federal Aviation
Administration, acknowledged that problems exist but argued that
the government is making improvements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our system is beginning to show strain,'' he said, but ``the
administration has worked diligently over the past several years to
bring a new way of doing business and to modernizing the air
traffic control system.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the air traffic equipment is now being updated to
handle increasing traffic. He added, ``Congress is now working on
the reauthorization bill that should contain some changes that
should assist us.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Aviation Week concluded that the government effort has
fallen short and pinned hopes on a new administration that would
make the problem a high priority.
</P>
<P>
   Said the magazine: ``Unless this reform is addressed quickly,
the air transport system could slowly grind to a halt in some
sectors. Much worse, the margin of safety now in place with
everyone doing their job, could be seriously eroded.''
</P>
<P>
   Brenner dismissed safety concerns. ``We will never compromise
safety,'' he said. ``We'll slow traffic down before we compromise
safety.''

   CENTAM-MITCH _ MARCOVIA, Honduras _ Maritza Espinar spent four
terrifying days clinging to the high branches of a tree last year
after Hurricane Mitch flattened her home in a village near here.
When new floods in September sent a tributary of the Choluteca
River once again rising toward the place she lived, she didn't
waste any time evacuating. Such stories are not uncommon around
this poor, mountainous nation of 5 million people. Mitch was the
worst disaster in more than a century, killing some 9,000 people
and leveling or damaging more than 50,000 homes. Most people had
hoped that by now, a year after Mitch blew ashore on Oct. 25, the
storm would be nothing more than a frightful memory. But the recent
floods are evidence that Mitch is still having an impact.

   MITCH-REBUILD _ MARCOVIA, Honduras _ The walls are unadorned

tiny structure, holding her breath. To her, this diminutive house _
the size of a typical two-car American garage _ may as well be a
millionaire's mansion. One year after Hurricane Mitch devastated
Central America, life is getting better for thousands of the killer
storm's victims. Although new flooding has brought more misery to
many of those left homeless by Mitch, a massive rebuilding program
spearheaded by charities worldwide has made significant progress.

RAY EVERNHAM MOVES TO DODGE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK ZIER   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ray Evernham could have played it safe. He could have stayed at
Hendrick Motorsports. The deal was done.
</P>
<P>
   Rick and John Hendrick, who own and run what many regard as the
most powerful team in Winston Cup, knew Evernham wanted to be more
than just Jeff Gordon's crew chief.
</P>
<P>
   So they had worked out an arrangement whereby beginning next
year, Evernham was to become chief operating officer and general
manager of Hendrick Motorsports.
</P>
<P>
   But at the last minute, Evernham turned them down.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he opted for a new role, electing to head up Dodge's
return to Winston Cup racing in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   For Evernham, it was a challenge, just as molding an unproven
driver and a new team into a consistent winner had been. But once
Gordon and that team, the Rainbow Warriors, reached the pinnacle of
success, some of the fire left Evernham.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel like I was making a big enough contribution
anymore,'' he said. ``I felt like they could go on without me and
keep winning and I was right. They are going to go on and get
better even if I'm not there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, a change benefits everybody,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dodge brought Evernham in because of his innovative skills and
his methodical pay-attention-to-every-detail approach.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, he is excited about starting a program from ground
zero. Others are excited for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, when you're starting with a blank sheet of paper,
you can make everything the very best,'' said Ford's Robert Yates,
one of the most respected and successful car owners in the
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evernham knows how to organize things,'' said Yates, who owns
the cars driven by Dale Jarrett and Kenny Irwin. ``He knows the
sport from the inside. He knows the people.`He shouldn't have a
problem getting guys to work for him.''
</P>
<P>
   When Evernham left Hendrick, he brought along Ed Guzzo, who had
been chief mechanic on Gordon's car.
</P>
<P>
   He also plans to rely heavily on the engineering manpower at
Dodge, which Lou Patane, in charge of DaimlerChrysler's motorsports
program, said will be freely available to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be directly involved with the race team in design and
fabrication,'' Patane said. ``We've got a lot of development work
to do. Not only do we intend to compete, we intend to win, and few
people know more about winning at this level than Ray Evernham.''
</P>
<P>
   While courting Evernham, Dodge also tried to lure Gordon into
coming along as his driver. But Gordon elected to stay put,
recently signing what has been called a ``lifetime contract'' with
Hendrick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have liked to have had Jeff Gordon, and we talked
about it,'' Evernham said. ``But we both decided this was the best
thing for me to do, and that staying with Hendrick was the best
thing for him to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we decided that, there was no effort to say `come with
me.' We shook hands, and we're still good friends,'' Evernham said.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, Evernham isn't concerned with who will end up
driving his cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, the focus is on building a competitive car and a
competitive race team,'' Evernham said. ``Like they say in Field of
Dreams, if you build it, they will come.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be doing some testing next year, and we'll need
somebody to do that,'' he said. ``But first, we want to build the
race team and then as drivers become available, hopefully they'll
take a look at us.''
</P>
<P>
   So Evernham is off on a new venture, already counting down the
days to the 2001 Daytona 500, when Dodge makes its debut.

SEEING IS BELIEVING, SO ILLUSTRATIONS ARE AN ESSENTIAL PART OF
SCIENCE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC MESSINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the inventor of the lightning rod, Sir William Harris,
needed to illustrate the phenomenon of electricity for a new
treatise, he decided against a minutely observed etching or a
complex numerical chart. Instead he lined several pages of the
manuscript with gold-leaf and then simply ran an electric current
right across them.
</P>
<P>
   If the experiment didn't quite capture electricity itself, it
certainly caught its aftermath. Harris' book, ``Observations on the
Effects of Lightning on Floating Bodies,'' published in 1823, still
bears the series of ragged burn marks that sizzled across the
pages.
</P>
<P>
   But was Harris engaging in a pictorial gimmick or something
more?
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing Is Believing,'' an exhibition that opens Saturday, at
the New York Public Library, argues such illustrations are more:
they are an essential part of the creative process, playing a
critical role in the history of scientific and medical ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scientists or historians of science know these images; they
just haven't taken them that seriously in conjunction with the
text,'' said Miriam Mandelbaum of the library's rare books
division, who was the co-curator of the show with her colleague
Jennifer B. Lee. ``It's like words convey the ideas, and the images
are seen as pretty additions _ like children's book pictures or
something. We're showing that the relationship between text and
image is much more complicated. Images can make ideas more
accessible, forceful, popular.''
</P>
<P>
   To Ms. Mandelbaum, even the most famous illustrations have been
undervalued in terms of their importance in communicating ideas,
whether they are medieval renderings of an Earth-centered cosmos or
the first X-rays of the human body in the late 19th century. The
exhibition, which is dominated by works from the library's own
collections, includes some of the seminal scientific texts of the
last millennium, with Darwin's 1859 masterwork, ``Origin of
Species,'' and Sir Isaac Newton's ``Principia Mathematica'' (1687)
among them.
</P>
<P>
   Prof. Edward Tufte of Yale, who has written extensively about
information design, goes further, arguing that an image is often
indivisible from an idea. ``If you think about it, most scientific
problems are either inherently visual or inherently mathematical,
and the words are a human code, a layer of abstraction away from
the underlying mathematical visual phenomenon,'' he said. ``It's
hard to imagine how you could reason about anything of any
complexity that's physical without involving vision.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider Andreas Vesalius' ``De Humani Corporis Fabrica'' or
``The Structure of the Human Body,'' the first book to detail human
anatomy. Over time the richly illustrated 1543 work revolutionized
medicine by showing that anatomy should be learned directly from
the dissection of human bodies (and not animals) and by introducing
the scientific method.
</P>
<P>
   Or William Harvey's publication of ``De Motu Cordis,'' ``On the
Motion of the Heart,'' in 1628. His explanation of how blood
circulates _ arguably the greatest medical discovery in history _
is persuasively captured in graphic drawings delineating the veins
and arteries of body parts.
</P>
<P>
   Medical and scientific illustrations haven't always received the
recognition they deserve, argues Tufte, who will be speaking as
part of the library's lecture series, because of ``accidents of
publishing.''
</P>
<P>
   Vesalius' sumptuously colored original copy was hand painted for
Emperor Charles V, so it was not mass-produced. By the end of the
19th century, however, the process of chromolithography made color
printing cheap and pervasive. That's why another of the show's
displays, Prang's Prize Babies (1888), a saccharine print of six
rosy-cheeked infants, could be sold door to door.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the original manuscripts of da Vinci or Galileo
or Newton, they integrate words and images _ it's all part of a
coherent verbal-visual narrative,'' Tufte explains. ``The problem
is when their manuscript then passes through economizing
printers.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said: ``You can see how, say, Newton talks about
prism ABC'' in the manuscript, ``but he doesn't then put a picture
of prism ABC in the back of the book. The publisher does that.
Newton has it in the text.''

FSU-CLEMSON GAME PITS FATHER AGAINST SON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., S.C., W.Va.)  (mk) 
 By BRIAN ETTKIN   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ The acorn did not fall far from the family
tree, even as the dummy swung from a branch in effigy.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Bowden was coaching West Virginia 25 falls ago, in the
midst of his worst season ever, and his son Tommy, a receiver on
the 1974 team, was among the first to see it. Tommy strode to the
tree on the college campus and intended to remove the unflattering
caricature of his father, but a school security guard stopped him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy says, `This is public property. You can't take that
guy down,''' recalled Tommy, Clemson's coach. ``I said, `But that's
my father.' And he said, `Well, you still can't.'''
</P>
<P>
   This is how Tommy unequivocally proved he is his father's son.
Instead of clenching his fists in anger, Tommy disarmed him with
Southern charm.
</P>
<P>
   And, as Bowdens nearly always do, he won.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, I said, `I'm not trying to cut it down. I am trying
to add more stuffing,''' Tommy said. ``He's fatter than what y'all
made him out to be.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby and his wife, Ann, say that of their six children, Tommy
is the one most like his father. He kills you with kindness before
his football team treats you unkindly. Christian fundamentalists
who coach so unconservatively.
</P>
<P>
   When coaches Bobby and Tommy make history in Saturday's first
father vs. son Division I-A football game, in Clemson's Death
Valley, you'll see similarities in demeanor and Florida State's and
Clemson's offenses. Tommy influenced Bobby to incorporate the
shotgun formation when Charlie Ward was FSU's quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   It will be as if Tommy was born for the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he was.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy still has an old profile that compares the personality
traits of the Bowden boys and their father. The readings for Bobby
and son Terry, the former Auburn coach who now serves as a college
football analyst for ABC, were askew in several categories.
</P>
<P>
   ``You connect the dots and all that, then you send it in,''
Tommy said. ``Mine and my father's are graphically in line in every
category.''
</P>
<P>
   Take fear, for example. Neither Bobby nor Tommy throw caution to
the wind ...unless it's a spiraling football.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tommy stayed out of trouble,'' Bobby said. ``This (son) would
do that, or this one would do this. But not 'ol sweet Tommy. Tommy
hated whippings. I could spank Terry and he'd say, `Hurry and get
through, so I can get back out and do it again.' Tommy, boy, it
would just kill him if you ever had to spank him. That's where he
was like me.''
</P>
<P>
   Tommy is one of the three Bowden boys who followed the siren's
call of their father's whistle and became coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Steve, who is in private business, and Terry and little
brother Jeff, FSU's receivers coach, Tommy never veered from the
sideline.
</P>
<P>
   Some 30 years ago, when young Tommy had to write an
autobiography in sixth grade, choosing his vocational pursuit was
easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a college head football coach were the direct words,''
Tommy said. ``Probably like most kids at that age, they choose the
profession that their father is in. That's why I chose it at that
time, but I never really deviated from that. That's the only thing
I really had strong feelings about.''
</P>
<P>
   Both compete fiercely. When Tommy coached receivers, his charges
were known for their blocking. Now, when Bobby watches game film
with Jeff and sees an FSU receiver miss a block, he'll remark:
``Tommy's receivers wouldn't have done that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows he's just kind of twisting the knife a little bit,''
Jeff said. ``He's a lot more hard-nosed than maybe people think.''
</P>
<P>
   It felt like a dagger had been jabbed into Tommy's rib cage
during a game against Southern Methodist, when he played for his
father at West Virginia. Tommy broke a rib, which punctured a lung,
but even as he was gasping for breath, he was responsible for
shuttling plays into the offensive huddle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember his daddy saying, `Tommy, you've got to get those
plays in quicker,''' said Dave Van Halanger, FSU's strength coach
who played on that West Virginia team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daddy, I'm taking them in as fast as I can,'' Tommy replied
and continued to play. After the game, doctors poked a hole through
his chest, inserting a tube so the lung could be reinflated. The
scar remains, Bowden's badge of courage.
</P>
<P>
   A victory against Tommy would be Bobby's 300th in Division I.
Bobby is fifth in major-college career victories and won the 1993
national championship. Terry went 111-52-2 in 15 years, including
an undefeated season, in 1993, at Auburn.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy is 21-7, after transforming downtrodden Tulane into a
winner; he now is attempting to return Clemson to a position of
national power.
</P>
<P>
   But during the '74 season, the Mountaineers' faithless tossed
beer cans in the Bowdens' front yard and planted ``For Sale''
signs. Tommy was incensed when he read a letter to the editor in
the school paper, ripping his dad and claiming the players lacked
confidence in him.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy clipped and saved the article, and months later, after
somebody recognized the name of the author, Tommy and five of his
larger teammates marched to the man of letter's frat house and
demanded a retraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``He turned completely white,'' said Van Halanger, who was among
the muscle on hand. ``He said, `Yeah, no problem. I'll do it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Tommy had won again.

   No. 5 Penn State 7-0
</P>
<P>
   No. 20 at Purdue 5-2
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday, in handing Michigan State its first loss, Drew
Brees of Purdue passed for 509 yards. Penn State's defense (eight
sacks against Ohio State) should be tougher. Its offense is led by
quarterback Kevin Thompson, despite a slight separation of his
passing shoulder, and Eric McCoo, who rushed for 211 yards against
Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   No. 9 Tennessee 4-1
</P>
<P>
   No. 3 at Alabama 5-1
</P>
<P>
   A clash of Southeastern Conference powers. In its last three
games, Alabama beat Arkansas, Florida and Mississippi, all
nationally ranked, and averaged 451.3 yards in total offense. As
quarterback Andrew Zow said, ``People are now starting to take us
seriously.'' Alabama can run and Tennessee can stop the run.
</P>
<P>
   No. 1 Nebraska 6-0
</P>
<P>
   No. 18 at Texas 5-2
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Ryan Nunez of Texas said of Nebraska, ``Take that
logo off their helmets and they're just another team.'' Maybe so,
but Nebraska has one of the nation's best defenses, and in its last
game it rushed for 439 yards against a good Iowa State defense.
</P>
<P>
   No. 4 Florida State 7-0
</P>
<P>
   at Clemson 3-3
</P>
<P>
   For the first time ever in major-college football, the head
coaches are father (Bobby Bowden of Florida State) and son (Tommy
Bowden of Clemson). The father should collect career victory No.
300, especially with Peter Warrick back at wide receiver.

<P>
   Tulane (2-3)
</P>
<P>
   at East Carolina (5-1)
</P>
<P>
   East Carolina's good defense should contain Patrick Ramsey of

<P>
   Illinois (3-3)

   Ohio State (4-3)
</P>

 &HT;    To the suburbs and back
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Oct. 24.
 &HT;    By Catherine Fox
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As this century expires, politicians, media and a new
generation of planners are waging war on suburban sprawl. The
contemporary equivalent of the medieval plague, suburbia has been
blamed for everything from the Columbine High School murders in
Colorado to the increase in deer road kill in upstate Michigan, not
to mention the road rage-inducing commutes that metro Atlantans
endure every day.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Cassandras who warned of the consequences of
unplanned and unlimited growth even before the turn of the 19th
century, we built countless residential subdivisions, strip
shopping centers and regional malls to create the perpetual
gridlock that has finally gotten America's attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``During recent elections, there were more than 250 development
and growth measures on state ballots,'' says Michael Stanton,
president of the American Institute of Architects. ``This suggests
to me that the state of our environment has become an issue to the
average citizen. People are reacting to a nagging sense that
something has gone wrong with the way we live.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, it is time to address the mess we've made. We should,
however, understand the factors that brought us to that point, or
we might, to alter the old saw a bit, be condemned to repeat
ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   Sprawl is a result not only of historical forces, planning
philosophy and geography, but also of American ideals. To change
living patterns, do we have to modify minds and hearts as well as
zoning laws and streetscapes?
</P>
<P>
   Forget a chicken in every pot. What Americans have always wanted
is a house with a yard. In a country in which life is not centered
around the cathedral or the palace, our homes have truly become our
castles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American idea that cities could be made almost entirely of
free-standing private houses with their own gardens was an original
notion, at least in Western culture,'' architectural historian
Witold Rybczynski writes in his book ``City Life.'' ``It was a
powerful cultural idea that would later create all sorts of
difficulties as urban areas spread ever more widely to accommodate
this desire.''
</P>
<P>
   The notion of a plot of one's own runs deep. Thomas Jefferson
envisioned America as the land of rural self-reliance. The pioneers
fulfilled their manifest destiny with a little house on the
prairie. America started building suburbs by the mid-19th century.
No wonder returning World War II soldiers leapt at the chance for a
tract house in Levittown, the subdivisions in New York and
Pennsylvania whose name became synonymous with suburbia. The desire
has not abated until recently, when some have come to question
whether the costs outweigh the benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Suburbia is the ying to the American city's yang. According to
David Galernter, author of ``A History of American Architecture:
Buildings in Their Cultural and Technological Context,'' we began
moving out of cities in response to industrial factories belching
smoke, overpopulation and the shifting social order caused by
immigration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The development pattern of concentric rings of residential
suburbs segregated from commercial zones became defining
characteristics of the American experience,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   American capitalism egged on unplanned, or expedient, growth.
Chicago, for instance, gave up itide to the railroads. The
Windy City also gave birth to the skyscraper, which changed the
scale of cities and the real estate value of downtown property. In
fact, it helped create the idea of downtown as distinct from
residential neighborhoods and reinforced the segregated planning
patterns. (Even the ranch house, the stereotypical suburban home,
originated in part in Chicago with Frank Lloyd Wright's horizontal,
open-plan Prairie houses; Wright also invented the carport.)
</P>
<P>
   Of course, suburbs kept expanding because they could. Unlike
Europe, America boasted lots of open space, and, thanks to Henry
Ford, we had the means to go where we wanted. The Model T first
rolled off the assembly line in 1913. By 1925, Americans owned
about 20 million cars.
</P>
<P>
   We like to paint all suburbs with the same damning brush. But
prized intown neighborhoods such as Ansley Park were originally
suburbs before growing cities absorbed them. Some of our earliest,
pre-automobile suburbs were more compact because their residents
depended on rail or trolley. The street was a public space rather
than a conduit for cars. Places such as Chestnut Hill, outside
Philadelphia, had their own commercial centers, too. Unfortunately,
post-automobile subdivisions were more like Radburn, N.J. Built in
1928 and billed as a town for the motor age, it featured open
space, curving roads and cul-de-sacs, and, since the street was
given over to cars, houses turned their backs on the traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The suburbs really started sprawling after World War II, with
the swelling population of returning GIs and their families and
low-cost government mortgage loans. By 1950, developer Levitt and
Sons was producing a four-room house every 16 minutes. Folk singer
Pete Seeger immortalized the result in Malvina Reynolds' ``Little
Boxes,'' his famous song about ticky-tacky suburbia.
</P>
<P>
   Strip centers and malls closer to home quickly replaced downtown
as retail and even civic centers. Between 1960 and 1970, a total of
8,000 shopping centers were built. In the next two decades, the
number swelled by 25,000. Commercial development followed the
population. Atlanta's Perimeter Mall area typifies the resulting
``edge cities,'' aggregations of office parks, shopping malls and
subdivisions navigated only by car. They obviated the need to go to
the city at all.
</P>
<P>
   As the suburbs grew, cities withered. Between 1930 and 1945
urban centers stopped gaining population. Already blighted by
industry and slums, they suffered at the hands of wrongheaded
zoning.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of the early movements advocating orderly planning had a
provision for regulating private property, so zoning became the
planning device,'' says Randall Roark, a professor of urban
planning at Georgia Tech. ``Though zoning laws were intended to
protect residential districts from commercial encroachment, they
ended up isolating pieces of the city.''
</P>
<P>
   The combination of zoning, modernist planning and architecture
was almost lethal. Planners in the thrall of French architect Le
Corbusier came close to instituting his vision of ``La Ville
Radieuse,'' a cityscape of high-rise islands connected by roadways.
The refined sensibilities of the best modernist structures, like,
say, Mies van der Rohe's Seagram Building in New York, devolved
into acres of cheaply constructed, flat-top, curtain-wall buildings
as boringly uniform and placeless as the suburban subdivisions were
accused of being. Siting them as lone objects in paved plazas made
the city more lifeless. Applying those architectural and planning
principles to low-cost housing only ensured more slums. Urban
renewal it was not.
</P>
<P>
   President Dwight D. Eisenhower's Interstate Highway Act of 1956
paved the way for more urban destruction, as expressways rolled
through downtowns and neighborhoods. No wonder planning patriarch
Lewis Mumford called the cloverleaf the national flower.
</P>
<P>
   Civic leaders tried all manner of attempts to revive their
cities _ pedestrian main streets, festival marketplaces, aquariums,
tax incentives _ with limited success. They even brought
suburban-style housing and shopping into the city. Faced with lousy
schools, crime and urban decay, Americans continued to decamp to
the green beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Here and there, cities garnered support. In 1961, Jane Jacobs
blasted modernist planning and advocated for dense, mixed-use urban
blocks in ``The Death and Life of Great American Cities.'' That
same year, architect John Portman, in the true spirit of urban
renewal, anchored the convention business downtown by building the
Merchandise Mart. The 1972 demolition of Pruitt-Igoe, a high-rise
housing project in St. Louis, was official acknowledgment of the
failure of these environments for improving the well-being of poor
residents.
</P>
<P>
   Other forces came into play. The preservation movement
popularized the idea of finding new uses for old buildings we
ordinarily tore down. In 1965, old warehouses near Fisherman's
Wharf in San Francisco were revived as Ghirardelli Square. The
grass-roots fight to save the Fox Theatre in the 1970s was
Atlanta's benchmark.
</P>
<P>
   Architect Robert Venturi and his co-authors incubated
postmodernism in their 1966 book, ``Complexity and Contradiction in
Architecture.'' Whatever one thinks of that movement, buildings
designed under its banner introduced some variety into the
cityscape _ remember the splash Philip Johnson's One Atlantic
Center made when it opened in 1987 _ and also called attention to
the importance of context in building cities.
</P>
<P>
   On the neighborhood front, London architect Leon Krier tried to
resurrect the organization of the pre-industrial city. He was
mentor to Miami architects Andres Duany and Elizabeth
Plater-Zyberk, who put ideas into practice in Seaside, the Florida
Panhandle resort that rehabilitated small lots and carefully
orchestrated public spaces, not to mention the front porch, the
picket fence and walking. It was ground zero for new urbanism, the
philosophy of planning that preaches a return to old values.
</P>
<P>
   Other anti-sprawl voices have sounded in the past two decades.
To promote denser development close in, Portland, Ore., drew a
growth development line in the outskirts and will not extend water
and sewer lines beyond that point. Next year Milwaukee will start
dismantling the freeway system that carved up its downtown. All
over the country, the children of those who had turned up their
noses at the city started moving back.

SECOND GENERATION PROTESTS DEAL TO TEAR DOWN ILLEGAL OUTPOSTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DEBORAH HORAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIVAT HAREL, West Bank _ Shira Drori was 2 years old in 1975
when Israeli soldiers forcibly removed her family from a mobile
home perched on a West Bank hilltop.
</P>
<P>
   She was still a child the first time she trekked up a rocky hill
with her mother, Daniella Weiss, a founder of Israel's religious
settler movement, to help others stake claims to remote West Bank
land.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Drori watched as settler leaders from her mother's
generation sent trucks to tear down two of 12 West Bank outposts
that the government of Prime Minister Ehud Barak has deemed
illegal. Drori, now 26, stood and protested with the sons and
daughters of other icons of Israel's religious settlement movement.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, their pragmatic parents made an unprecedented
deal with Barak's government to peacefully evacuate the 12
outposts.
</P>
<P>
   But Drori and the other young protesters remain defiant and
pledge that settlers will not come down from the hilltops quietly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if we don't succeed in preventing everything Barak is
doing, at least we didn't sit in our homes and say, `This is it',''
Drori said. ``We have to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   Calling themselves the Second Generation, these young settlers
have picked up where their parents _ settlers who carved enclaves
in the heart of Hebron and the hills of Samaria in the 1970s and
'80s _ left off, staking claim to vacant West Bank land and defying
government orders to evacuate.
</P>
<P>
   Many, like Drori, have moved into the new settlements that have
cropped up in the West Bank over the last three years in a
last-ditch attempt to prevent the land from being handed to the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to put pressure on the Israeli government,'' said
Malachi Levinger, 26, whose father, Rabbi Moshe Levinger, helped
found a militant Jewish settlement in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
   Second Operation started operating in earnest two months ago,
when Barak's government began serious discussions about dismantling
some of the outposts. But the idea for the group has germinated
since the day six years ago when Daniella Weiss met some young
settlers who were cultivating land near one of the hilltop
settlements dismantled this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found that they were very pure and idealistic and
dedicated,'' Weiss said. ``So I started to understand that I should
cultivate the young ones to believe in their ability to settle''
the land.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of an organization called Amana that was founded
by their parents, the young people followed their elders' example.
They cut dirt roads into the rocky hills, brought in water towers
and trailers, and hooked their new homes to telephone and
electricity lines.
</P>
<P>
   But times have changed since their parents' day. Early settlers
blazed an unknown trail in new territory captured from Jordan in
the 1967 war. Much of the Israeli public respected the drive to
settle the land.
</P>
<P>
   Today's young settlers are grabbing hilltops in a different
political climate, analysts say. Peace agreements govern relations
between Israelis and Palestinians. Most Israelis are resigned to
the emergence of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   And many see the settlers as an obstacle to peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parents' generation operated in what was, in many ways, a
political and ideological vacuum,'' said Joseph Alpher, a political
analyst who directs the Middle East office of the American Jewish
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no peace process,'' said Alpher, former acting head
of the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies at Tel Aviv University.
``Now, 80 percent of Israelis think there will be a Palestinian
state.''
</P>
<P>
   That reality has forced the veteran settlers to alter their
strategy. Though they once stood in opposition to any government
willing to cede territory to the Palestinians, the pro-settlement
National Religious Party today is part of Barak's centrist
coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the old leaders say they realize that the dream of
settling all of biblical Judea and Samaria _ today's West Bank _
ended with the signing of peace agreements with the Palestinians.
Their objective now is to save as many settlements as they can.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the agreement with Barak. The settlers' council agreed to
dismantle the 12 outposts deemed illegal peacefully and without
interference from the Israeli army. So far, they have taken down
six uninhabited ones without incident. Dismantling the other six,
inhabited by a few militants, may prove more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Settler leaders say the compromise amounted to an official seal
of approval for 30 other West Bank settlements that otherwise might
not have been allowed to stay. The agreement, they believe, was a
smart move.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's government as well as settlers critical of the
compromise portray the deal as a crucial precedent. Now that Barak
has proved he can remove outposts _ with settler compliance, no
less _ it will be easier to tear down additional settlements in a
final peace agreement with the Palestinians, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now Barak can say, `So what, you've already dismantled a few
settlements. What's a few more?''' Drori said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Second Generation seems to consist mainly of young
idealists who feel that the older generation of settlers has grown
tired. One analyst called the group ``a few kids at a lonely
outpost''
</P>
<P>
   Second Generation members say that they are ready to give up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't just say, `Oh, there's a peace process, so we should
forget our ideology,'' Drori said. ``We know we have to do
something.''

 &HT;    Future may require change in way designers, builders work
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Oct. 22.
 &HT;    By Catherine Fox
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ No crystal ball can show us what our architectural
environment will look like in the next century, but chances are it
will be designed differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a whole new generation of technology that
will change how we think of architecture and empower the
profession,'' says Atlanta architect Mack Scogin. ``It will
re-establish architecture's role in the culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Scogin says he thinks that new technologies, from the laser
cutter and computer programs to high-speed 3-D and digital cameras,
will forge a closer link between architects and construction
technology. He believes it will revive the classical tradition of
the designer and maker working side by side.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will completely change the nature of the profession
during the next 20 years,'' he says. ``It's going to leave a lot of
people in the dust.''
</P>
<P>
   Scogin is among those who sees a redensification of the city in
the future. This is, indeed, already happening. But the decisions
we make now will determine how successful that process is. In
California architect Eli Naor's view, the future health of our
cities will depend on the transportation systems designed in the
next few decades. Given finite energy sources, pollution, gridlock
and the other sprawl-induced ills, the willingness to embrace more
compact development also will be decisive.
</P>
<P>
   That will entail hard personal decisions. For instance, the
trend toward ever-larger, energy- and land-eating houses will have
to stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the recycling we do is meaningless unless we make the
right macro decisions, such as how big our house is, where we live
and what kind of car we drive,'' says Michael Stanton, president of
the American Institute of Architects.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the broader development, he warns that no city or
suburb can afford to be an island anymore if the larger issues of
livability are to be addressed. ``The biggest challenge will be to
deal with regional governance _ of water, transportation,
schools,'' says the San Francisco architect. ``We have so many
redundancies. The lack of (regional governance) is our biggest
hindrance to progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the matter of wise development, both inside and
outside city boundaries. A recent Atlanta Journal-Constitution poll
suggests that residents of Gwinnett County, for instance, have come
to believe that the developers wield too much power over land-use
decisions. Atlanta has some rethinking to do as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps Atlanta will get to the stage where it realizes its
desirability as a place to live,'' Stanton says. ``The most
desirable places _ San Francisco, New York, London _ are the
hardest places to build. Atlanta needs to get to the point that it
doesn't feel it necessary to accept every development that comes
along.''
</P>

<P>
   ATLANTA: started moving back.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, governmental concern about air quality is such
that federal funds that would once have been spent on highways now
are earmarked for projects that support pedestrians and public
transit. The Environmental Protection Agency has blessed the
Atlantic Steel project in Atlanta, which is supposed to transform a
138-acre brownfield into a vanguard model of a new kind of urban
renewal, with emphasis on transportation alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, even Atlanta, a favorite example of suburban sprawl, is a
microcosm of urban repopulation. Older homes are selling at
astronomical prices. Infill development and adaptive reuse of
warehouses and office buildings as residences abound, from the
pre-Olympics loft conversions in the Fairlie-Poplar historic
district downtown to construction on Peachtree Street in Midtown.
In Buckhead, developers are building pretend lofts. Centennial
Place, a mixed-income project, is replacing the Techwood and Clark
Howell Homes housing projects.
</P>
<P>
   This shift brings its own set of problems. Held up as the savior
that will deliver us from sprawl, new urbanism has become such a
powerful buzzword in Atlanta of late that uttering the term in
connection with a project is like holding a cross up to a vampire.
It's not enough to build one apartment close to the street.
Construction must be planned in concert with alternatives to the
car. Indeed, if public transportation doesn't meet the needs of our
growing population, the city will be as gridlocked as the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   This brings up one of the keys to achieving any meaningful
change in the suburbs or the city: the recognition that there is no
single answer, but rather the need for interrelated and
well-coordinated planning that encompasses zoning, infrastructure
(such as water and sewers), construction and transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Blueprint Midtown is an exemplar of such a plan. It addresses
land use, finance, retail, housing, traffic and transportation,
even marketing to get the word out. A zoning ordinance will soon be
introduced in Atlanta City Council that will give the plan
legislative teeth. Susan Mendheim, Midtown Alliance president,
asserts that there is much potential for change intown, where there
is still a lot of open land used for surface parking or the sites
of unused buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Opportunity is everywhere,'' she says, ``and you don't even
need to change the infrastructure.''
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey planner Anton Nelessen, consultant to Blueprint
Midtown, sees cities all over the country embarking on planning
crusades to solve their problems. He is working in Milwaukee, which
is trying to solve its traffic/pedestrian problem through a program
called ``park once.'' It will encourage people to leave their cars
in decks near the expressway by offering a phalanx of
transportation alternatives, including trolleys and water taxis on
the Milwaukee River.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest challenge in urban redevelopment is bringing the
middle class back,'' says Georgia Tech professor Roark.
``Gentrification is not the way to go. You need a mix of income
brackets and ages as well as housing types, shopping amenities and
transportation choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Improving public schools, which is out of planners' hands, will
be critical: Schools draw families.
</P>
<P>
   Roark, who works with the Georgia Conservancy on smart growth
initiatives, sees such thinking popping up all over the state.
Covington is in the midst of planning, so that it can accommodate
growth without losing the small-town qualities its residents
cherish. The Georgia Conservancy is tackling the area along Ga.
316, where fields lie ripe for development. Commuter rail will be
critical there.
</P>
<P>
   ``County planning will be the key in making or breaking smart
growth,'' says Roark. ``The counties need to exercise their
land-use control to support intelligent development.''
</P>
<P>
   Change is possible, but it means thinking differently. One of
our new century's resolutions should be to think smaller _ smaller
lots, more compact neighborhoods _ so that people can be closer to
public transportation. It should also be thinking bigger _ giving
up one-niche neighborhoods and understanding the symbiotic
connection between the city and suburbs, giving up fiefdoms for
regional planning.
</P>
<P>
   Americans will have to temper their love affair with the
automobile. We will need to give up some autonomy by accepting
regional planning solutions, but public officials have to repay
that trust by acting wisely. For instance, they will have to see to
it that public transportation is more economical and convenient
than private vehicles; few people will abandon their cars purely
out of concern for the ozone.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps in the new century we'll see a better balance between
home and community, which has been off-kilter for at least half of
this one. That shouldn't mean rewiring human nature. The need for
communal connection is just as basic as home. After all, when
modern suburbs and cities excised traditional spaces for
interaction _ the commons, Main Street _ we gathered at malls. As
Roark says, ``The village is still the basic unit (of culture). The
suburb is nothing more than a village. Urban or suburban, people
are looking for a sense of community and a place where the car
doesn't dictate the quality of life or the shape of the
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelessen has uncovered that sentiment as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever I conduct my lifestyle preferences surveys,'' he
says, ``people invariably want the same thing _ pleasant places
with a human scale and natural beauty in which they can interact
with other people.''

 &HT;    West Virginia novelist runs for governor to challenge coal's
hold on her home state
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Oct. 24.
 &HT;    By Teresa K. Weaver
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, W.Va. _ Coal is everywhere here. Barges brimming
with the black stuff slice the green waters of the Kanawha River in
the heart of Charleston. Trains filled to overflowing stretch to
the far horizon near every active coal mine in the southwestern
wedge of the state. Because the substance is such an integral part
of West Virginia's history, its identity and its economy, coal has
long been a battlefield _ first between mine owners and union
organizers, but nowadays between warriors for the environment and
defenders of the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   It is not an issue split neatly along racial, socioeconomic,
age, gender or even family lines. ``I Love Coal'' bumper stickers
show up on everything from beat-up pickups to brand-new Volvos, as
do the ones that read ``I Love Mountains.''
</P>
<P>
   Can you love coal and mountains?
</P>
<P>
   Not around here. Not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   For generations, miners had to dig coal out of these mountains
with picks and shovels. Today, gigantic, multimillion-dollar
earth-moving machines chew it out. Very simply put, miners no
longer extract coal from the mountain. Now machines remove the
mountain from the coal.
</P>
<P>
   Locals call this technique ``mountaintop removal.'' Mining
officials call it something a little more palatable: ``mountaintop
mining.''
</P>
<P>
   Denise Giardina, a novelist, professor and now a candidate for
governor from the newly formed Mountain Party, calls it war.
</P>
<P>
   For years, she has been a relentless environmental activist,
speaking at rallies and writing passionate broadsides against water
pollution, deforestation and anything else that threatens the
pristine beauty of her beloved Appalachia. With Big Coal, though,
the stakes are higher than ever. Tired of waiting for Democrats and
Republicans to do the right thing, this soft-spoken woman who
relishes her solitude is walking into the most brutally public of
arenas: politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider this a defense of my home,'' she says quietly.
</P>
<P>
   Her well-traveled Mazda Protege sports three bumper stickers:
``Almost Level, West Virginia,'' ``I Love Mountains'' and ``I'm Pro
Mountain and I Vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Giardina has spent all but eight years of her life in this
beautiful, sometimes violent, coal-hardened region. She grew up in
a coal camp in McDowell County, in the southernmost tip of the
state. Her grandfather and two uncles were miners; her father was a
company bookkeeper, and her mother was a nurse. In 1963, her father
was laid off and the family moved to Kanawha County.
</P>
<P>
   She set two of her novels, ``Storming Heaven'' (which TNT has
just announced that it plans to make into a TV movie) and ``The
Unquiet Earth,'' in coal camps, drawing much from family lore and
from the true, tragic experiences of early union organizers in West
Virginia and Kentucky. She still recalls the ``traumatic loss of
community'' that followed the shutdown of her father's mine, a
memory that's jarred every time she points out the remnants of coal
camps along the roadside _ ghost towns where thriving communities
used to be.
</P>
<P>
   But now that the damage has been done, it's difficult for anyone
to imagine a future without coal, much less plan for one.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no easy answers,'' Giardina concedes. ``It's not as
easy as saying we need to replace coal with this other industry.
After coal, we almost need a statewide Marshall Plan. ... We've got
an emergency here.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 12, Giardina made her first official stump speech as a
candidate, to a handful of people at the annual Putnam County
homecoming. By the time the big parade started at 1 p.m., thousands
had pitched their picnic camps across the courthouse grounds in
Winfield. But at 11:30 a.m., when political candidates were invited
to the small Lions Club stage to speak briefly, only a few dozen
were on hand.
</P>
<P>
   With the strains of a gospel quartet's ``Let Us Have a Little
Talk With Jesus'' still hanging in the air, Giardina took the
microphone first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Small-business people are the heroes of this state,'' she told
the gathering. ``They come in, create jobs and they stay. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be one of the few candidates to tell you coal is
on the way out. We can either wait for that day to come and moan
about it, or we can plan for it now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the only candidate who's going to talk to you about
post-coal.''
</P>
<P>
   Four elderly women lining one side of a picnic table in a prime
shady spot listened politely as she began and broke into
simultaneous applause when the topic turned to life after coal.
Four elderly men standing nearby kept their hands in their pockets.
</P>
<P>
   The parade that capped the day's festivities in Winfield drew
people from the surrounding communities of Nitro, Eleanor, Duff,
Buffalo and Pocatalico (home of the Poca High School Dots,
naturally). Even the red-smocked clerks at the IGA grocery store
across from the courthouse left their checkout lines long enough to
cheer for the candidate _ or beauty queen or marching band _ of
choice.
</P>
<P>
   This was politics at its purest, its most immediate, its most
comprehensible. And its most uncomfortable for someone not given by
temperament to pressing the flesh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard walking up to people and saying, `Hi, I'm Denise
Giardina, and I'm running for governor.' Over and over again. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is important,'' she adds. ``Until now I've only
talked to people at environmental rallies, which really is
preaching to the choir. From now on we have to concentrate on more
events like this, getting to people who don't know much about us.''
</P>
<P>
   `I hope it breaks your heart'
</P>
<P>
   Larry Gibson, a 53-year-old retired maintenance worker turned
environmental activist, recently moved a mobile home onto his
family's 50-acre homeplace on Kayford Mountain, just south of
Charleston. Some 300 of his kinfolk are buried there, on a site
overlooking what used to be another mountain peak. Now it more
closely resembles a dust bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The ground drops several hundred feet into a scene from an
apocalyptic movie, with magnificent equipment parked near huge
stacks of coal and rubble. A choking coat of white dust turns
everything green to gray on the surrounding roads and hillsides.
And in the near distance, flat-topped buttes crusted over with
rough grass _ a very different shade of green _ and a few stunted
trees replace what used to be peaks.
</P>
<P>
   After allowing Giardina, a reporter and a photographer to view
the mine site from his unusual vantage point, Gibson shakes his
head and looks away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope what you saw here just breaks your heart,'' he says
slowly and evenly. ``I hope it breaks your heart.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot more hearts would be broken, Giardina says, if more West
Virginians had the chance to see firsthand before-and-after scenes
of these mines. But Gibson is one of a very small number of
landowners who won't accept lucrative offers from coal companies to
mine property that has been in families for generations. And access
to any of the mines being worked is strictly controlled.
</P>
<P>
   Looking down from Kayford Mountain, Giardina says, ``Most West
Virginians have never seen this. They have no idea. ...''
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1998, an environmental group called the West
Virginia Highlands Conservancy and 10 coal field residents filed
suit in federal court, claiming not only that mountaintop removal
destroys the environment but that existing laws meant to mitigate
the damage are not being enforced. Three of the 10 residents have
since dropped out of the lawsuit, but each side continues to
present its case.
</P>
<P>
   Coal officials don't deny that mining operations change the
landscape. But they're doing as little permanent damage as
possible, they say, while still extracting a resource that people
demand.
</P>
<P>
   The subjective nature of beauty makes it difficult to imagine
this debate ever ending. And the sheer power of Big Coal _ it
accounts for 7 percent of West Virginia's state product, provides
more than one-third of its business-tax revenue and is very
generous with campaign contributions _ makes even talking about the
environment troublesome.
</P>
<P>
   But there are other numbers that can't be explained away. West
Virginia is 49th among the 50 states in household income. And in
this very poor state, the poorest counties are the southern ones,
where most of the coal mines are.
</P>
<P>
   ``People out here don't have a lot of options,''
</P>
<P>
   Giardina concedes. ``It's impossible not to have sympathy for
them. But if coal has been so good to us, why are we still one of
the poorest states in the country?''
</P>
<P>
   State employment records raise deeper doubts about the
not-so-distant future: Mountaintop removal employs 4,317 workers in
West Virginia, less than 1 percent of its job force. Overall,
mining employment in the state has fallen from 130,000 in the 1940s
and '50s to 16,000 now. Machines do most of the work. And if mining
continues at current rates _ with no acceleration _ coal reserves
in West Virginia will be depleted in less than 30 years, according
to a recent analysis. After that, mining won't be an issue at all
here. It's the interim, though, that has environmentalists working
at fever pitch. Many mountains can be razed in three decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coal is an outlaw industry,'' Giardina declares. ``I'm all for
business, especially small business. But coal is not a business.
It's a monster. It's the evil empire, as far as I'm concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   The economic alternatives aren't clear-cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going to something besides coal is a difficult, slow
process,'' Giardina says. ``It's difficult because of the land
ownership in those areas _ most land is owned by corporations and
leased to coal companies. But I've talked to lawyers, who've said
that the governor could use eminent domain _ just like with
highways _ to condemn some of the property and then recruit small
industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, it's a difficult area to attract industry to
because the school systems are poor, and a lot of places don't even
have good water available. So it wouldn't be easy.''
</P>
<P>
   High-technology industry should be pursued, she says, and
tourism is one source of revenue that hasn't been explored enough,
especially in some of the areas that haven't already been
moonscaped.
</P>
<P>
   ``And lately I've been studying up on windmills and wind
turbines, which are used a good bit out West,'' she adds. ``It
seems that an operation like that could work on some of these
flattened mountaintops. You could hire people who used to mine coal
to build and maintain them. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of things to think about.''

   CHARLESTON, W.Va.: things to think about.''
</P>
<P>
   Economic analysts cite an encouraging influx of jobs over the
past few years, in service industries such as telemarketing,
discount stores, travel-related industries including hotels-motels,
and amusements. But there is no one core industry that can replace
Big Coal. Or pay as well: Whereas coal miners earn around $50,000 a
year, the average store employee might expect to make $13,500.
</P>
<P>
   Cecil Underwood, the incumbent governor _ and a former coal
company executive _ has created a task force to look at economic
diversification. And the state's congressional delegation has vowed
to help recruit clean, high-tech industries. But to Giardina, the
diversification efforts under way are too little, and far too late.
</P>
<P>
   Many third-party obstacles
</P>
<P>
   Getting onto the ballot as a third-party candidate in West
Virginia isn't easy. Obtaining signatures from 13,000 registered
voters, in a state where party allegiances run deep and only 20
percent of eligible voters care enough to show up on Election Day,
is hard enough. But the biggest impediment may be a convoluted
state law: Independent candidates are required to tell every
potential signer that putting their name on a petition forbids them
from voting in either the Democratic or Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to tell them they can go to jail if they're caught,''
Giardina says. ``Trouble is, the state dropped the penalty portion
of the law, but kept the law itself intact. We still have to say
they can be punished, though. It's nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Early this month the Mountain Party sued the secretary of state,
seeking to clarify the law, and got a hearing scheduled for Nov. 4.
On Oct. 15, the state Democratic Executive Committee filed a motion
to intervene in the lawsuit. In the motion, Democratic Party
Chairman Pat Maroney and co-Chairman Steve White argue that anyone
who signs a petition for Giardina and then votes in the primary
would be ``casting a vote twice in the gubernatorial primary.''
</P>
<P>
   While the lawyers hash out the issue, a loosely knit group of 60
volunteers fans out across the state, showing up at political
rallies, the state fair or any other place where there's a crowd,
with clipboards in hand and petition speech well-rehearsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of politics in West Virginia,'' says Missy Anthony,
an early and enthusiastic volunteer for Giardina. ``You can't tell
the difference between the Democrats and the Republicans anymore.
Denise offers something that we need: another option. And a glimmer
of humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   The volunteers _ and the candidate _ know they face long odds.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many legal and historical factors that make
third-party candidacies especially difficult in this state,'' says
Paul Owens, political editor of the Charleston Daily Mail, one of
two daily newspapers in the capital city. ``And if people have to
actually write in her name _ if Denise doesn't make it on the
ballot _ that's a real problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent newspaper column, Owens contrasted Giardina's
fledgling candidacy with the most famous third-party victory of
late: Jesse Ventura's ascent to the governor's office in Minnesota
last November. None of the factors that made that possible, Owens
says, exist in West Virginia, a state of entrenched party
loyalties, no public campaign funds and more restrictive
registration rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters who believe in Giardina and her message should, by all
means, support her,'' Owens concluded in that column. ``But they
shouldn't fool themselves that she has any real chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The true value of a third-party candidacy is clear to Owens, who
has observed West Virginia politics for eight years. In this case,
Giardina is bringing up issues the other nominees would prefer to
avoid.
</P>
<P>
   ``You basically have an incumbent governor who makes almost no
concession to people who are concerned about mountaintop removal,
and a Democratic front-runner who says he supports `responsible'
mountaintop mining,'' Owens says. ``But `responsible' can mean
whatever you want it to mean.
</P>
<P>
   ``Denise is going to get 90 percent of her support from
Democrats,'' Owens predicts. ``You just don't find many Republicans
who are concerned about mountaintop mining. Oddly enough, the
people who have been most hostile to Denise's candidacy are liberal
Democrats, who believe that she is going to be responsible for
handing the governor's job back to the Republican incumbent.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Giardina says that two top-ranking officials of the
state Democratic Party, apparently concerned about the effect she
would have on the election, offered her a state House seat if she
would drop her gubernatorial crusade. And at the Putnam County
homecoming, Democratic front-runner Bob Wise _ who performed his
traditional clog-dancing routine in the parade _ confronted
Giardina with a stern challenge: ``I hope you can live with
yourself if Underwood gets re-elected.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Charleston Gazette recently, Thomas Rodd, a former deputy
state attorney general, wrote a stinging column labeling Giardina's
campaign ``creepy,'' ``phony'' and a ``power trip.'' He questioned
her legitimacy as a candidate, criticized her supporters'
intentions and warned of dire setbacks to environmental causes as a
backlash.
</P>
<P>
   Politics isn't pretty. Even this early in the campaign _ the
party primaries aren't until May _ Giardina vows that she's in it
for the long haul. Even if thereare many issues, such as school
consolidation and health care, that she's still learning about:
``Maybe people are actually ready to hear a politician say, `I
don't have all the answers, but I think we can work together to
find them.'''
</P>
<P>
   Human contradictions
</P>
<P>
   When some disgruntled Democrats first approached Giardina about
running for office, her immediate reaction was, ``Yeah, right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I thought about it,'' she adds, ``and this may sound
hokey, but I prayed about it. And it just felt like the right thing
to do right now. My life is kind of cleared out in other ways, and
this is something I feel really strongly about. It seems like a
constructive thing to do for the next year and a half.''
</P>
<P>
   Moral responsibility is a topic that Giardina returns to time
and again in her fiction. Whether her novels are set in medieval
England or Nazi Germany, she revels in sin and redemption, right
and wrong, the human condition and its spiritual underpinnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Human beings are so fascinating,'' she says,
</P>
<P>
   ``capable of such wonderful deeds and such horrible deeds. All
of us, no matter how good we are, struggle with certain questions,
and we're never really sure if we're doing the right thing. Finally
we just fall back and say, `I just have to do what I have to do'
and hope that something redeeming comes out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   At its best, politics is almost pastoral for Giardina. ``You
meet people and they tell their stories. You see people afraid of
losing their job. You see people really in pain.''
</P>
<P>
   And though she admits to a certain naivete, she insists that
politics is still capable of doing good. In Putnam County, she
issued a challenge to all other candidates running for office in
West Virginia: to donate 10 percent of all money raised to charity
after the election next fall. Sure, it's politics, she says, but
why not at least let all that money go for something worthwhile?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm at least as cynical as the next guy,'' Owens, the
political editor, wrote recently, ``but I think
</P>
<P>
   Giardina's idea is a breath of fresh air.''
</P>
<P>
   If all the candidates who ran for governor and the state
Legislature in 1996 had taken Giardina's pledge and given away 10
percent of their campaign contributions, West Virginia charities
would have collected $570,000.
</P>
<P>
   And so, with $7,000 in the bank and 6,000 signatures on the
ballot petition, Giardina settles into campaigning, trading in her
treasured solitude and writing ways for endless hand-shaking and
self-introductions. Occasionally, while tooling around the mountain
highways on the way to or from a political rally, she's taken aback
by what her life has become.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every once in a while it strikes me how odd it is to be doing
this _ running for governor! I should be writing books!''
</P>
<P>
   While not sure she'll even get onto the ballot, much less get
elected, Giardina's motivations for being part of the campaign are
powerful.
</P>
<P>
   ``These mountains are special,'' she says. ``If you grow up
here, you get attached to the landscape. They're like a security
blanket. You can feel them around you when you go to sleep at
night.''
</P>
<P>
   After a long pause, she adds with a smile, ``And if nothing
else, there might be some great fiction coming from all this.''

 By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some 50 years ago, the science fiction writer Isaac Asimov
formulated the three laws of robotics. The first is, ``A robot may
not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being
to come to harm.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, there is nothing to worry about from the robot
now under consideration. It has a pair of caterpillar treads, bent
yellow arms with multiple sockets, touch sensors and two rubber
bands. It even follows the second law of robotics: it obeys orders
without question _ after a program is fed into its central
processor via infrared signals from a desktop computer.
</P>
<P>
   And so far, even the third law seems to be holding up: ``A robot
must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not
conflict with the first or second law.'' The two touch sensors turn
off the power when the robot reaches the edge of the table,
preventing destruction on the floor below.
</P>
<P>
   But the future may be less certain as these robots evolve.
Similar constructions, created out of Lego blocks and the Lego
Mindstorms Robotics Invention System, are proliferating.
</P>
<P>
   The $219 set, which contains familiar Lego pieces along with
light sensors, motors, touch sensors, gears and a minicomputer
``brick,'' has been an immense success since its introduction last
year.
</P>
<P>
   A Lego machine is made with the brick at its center. Then a
program is written on a computer and beamed into an infrared sensor
on the robot, which is then set free to follow its prescribed
orders. Lego is now introducing a Star Wars Droid kit ($109), in
which the robots take on forms familiar from the films' quirkiest
characters, and a Discovery robot set ($159) for more elementary
constructions that don't require a computer to program.
</P>
<P>
   What is most astonishing, though, is not one's ability to
instruct that yellow-armed table-sensor robot to back up from the
edge, nor to make an R2D2 model that will respond to coded signals
from a flashlight. It is what happens once technologically
sophisticated adults get hold of these machines' primitive
abilities.
</P>
<P>
   Mindstorms robots have become techno-toys with as much appeal as
the latest Nokia phone or Palm Pilot organizer. One Silicon Valley
start-up company, Nuvo Media, had to make an office rule: no Lego
play during work hours. One inventor, Anthony Fudd, has created an
elementary motorized copy machine with the Mindstorms set that uses
only one non-Lego part: the pen that is raised and lowered as it
sketches out the copy.
</P>
<P>
   Hackers have gone to work on the Lego computer brick, dissecting
its hardware, and the Internet has become host to proliferating
robotic improvisations. (There are discussions at www.lugnet.com,
Lego's own www.legomindstorms.com, and such hacker sites as
www.crynwr.com/lego-robotics.)
</P>
<P>
   Now two books are being published with more sophisticated
robotic instructions, engineering ideas and new programming
languages: ``Lego Mindstorms'' by Jonathan B. Knudsen (O'Reilly &AMP;
Associates) and the forthcoming ``Definitive Guide to Lego
Mindstorms'' by Dave Baum (Apress).
</P>
<P>
   The results might seem a far cry from the model towns that
children began building out of interlinking Lego pieces in the
1950s. But there are deep connections between the old and the new,
between, say, the minutely detailed pirate ship with monkeys
hanging from the riggings that Lego produced in 1989 and Knudsen's
invention of a Minerva Lego robot with a mechanical grasping arm.
The transition not only illustrates the evolution of technological
play but also reveals something about how computer technology
itself might be understood and even taught.
</P>
<P>
   The very name of the Lego robot set, Mindstorms, is taken from
the 1980 book of the same name by the Seymour Papert, a computer
scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who argued
that training in computer programming may be one of the most
promising ways to teach children about the nature of problem
solving. Lego later financed some of his research, and an early
version of the Lego programmable brick was developed at the MIT
Media Lab.
</P>
<P>
   What has been the nature of Lego's evolution? Consider the style
of Lego that has been in place since the Danish company produced
its first plastic pieces in 1949. The basic Lego element has always
been the rectangular brick marked with circular studs; before the
1970s, it seems as if no curved elements were created at all.
</P>
<P>
   Even when curved shapes were created for use in particular
models of ships or cars, the brick esthetic ruled: the point wasn't
to hide the bricks but to show how their edges and protrusions
could be used to suggest curves and movement. The more ``pure'' the
Lego model, the less use it has of specialized pieces with unusual
properties.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the appeal of a Lego model is that it displays its
origins by showing its mechanical skeleton; that skeleton is all
the more astonishing because it can be reorganized to form an
entirely different body.
</P>
<P>
   This is what makes Lego seem like a technological toy, even when
the models are nontechnological. Many of the models of the 1980s,
including towns and castles and pirates, are parts of traditional
children's fantasies; almost all of them (aside from the various
machinelike Technic toys) are also pretechnological in character.
</P>
<P>
   But the meaning of technology _ the word grows out of Greek
linguistic roots invoking craft, making and mastery _ is evident
not just in the process of their construction but also in the
nature of their appearance. While some toys are put together to
seem as if they weren't put together, Legos proclaim their own
making; they display their technology.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And the Lego instruction booklets are often exquisite
demonstrations of the process behind the display. There are no
words, only images. Pieces that previously seemed inconsequential
turn out to serve an important purpose; there is continuing
surprise as form and function align.
</P>
<P>
   But this notion of Lego technology is not just metaphorical.
What is being learned in classic Lego construction is a kind of
digital language. The use of block accumulations to create
illusions of smoothness is not unlike the way discrete numbers
become waves of sound in the playing of a CD.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a practiced Lego builder gradually learns that
there are certain ways in which pieces are combined again and again
to create arches, axles, walls, turrets, gear systems; they could
almost be conceived of as modules, small models that are regularly
called upon for continued use in larger systems.
</P>
<P>
   This is very close to the way one has to think to make computer
programs. There are very few ``smooth'' instructions, instructions
that might tell a mechanical robot, for example, ``Turn in a
circle.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead every smooth idea has to be broken down into the
smallest individual steps: turning in a circle requires moving in
minuscule movements up and across while slowly shifting direction,
each moment of which must be specified in a program. Moreover,
every programming language has certain procedures that are needed
again and again; like the Lego modules, these miniprograms become
ready-made ingredients for use in larger systems.
</P>
<P>
   So Lego construction and computer programming already have
certain similarities. And the Lego programming language for
Mindstorm robots _ based on a language developed by Papert at MIT _
makes those parallels clear. The program is constructed on the
screen of the computer. Each instruction appears as a colored block
that is then connected to another block.
</P>
<P>
   One block on the screen, might, for example, start the robot's
power; the next might choose its direction of motion, and a third
might instruct it to check a sensor and move only if a light is on.
Lego also has an educational division, Dacta, that develops
extensive curricula for schools and uses more advanced robotic
programming languages developed at Tufts University.
</P>
<P>
   Papert, who studied with Jean Piaget, has argued that this
constructive process is also precisely the process by which
children's education should take place. Computer literacy is not a
matter of knowing how to use Microsoft Word, it is a matter of
understanding how computers ``think'' and how humans might learn
from thinking like a computer.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Papert developed an early version of a robot he
called a Turtle that moved on the floor, following explicit
instructions from a computer. Children had to figure out precisely
which instructions would cause the motion they desired. They had to
dissect the motion and then reconstruct it. Papert has argued that
all construction inspires learning, and all learning is a form of
construction.
</P>
<P>
   Papert's successor at MIT's Media Lab, Mitchel Resnick, is
working on objects that may become the next generation of Lego
Mindstorms, including small computer blocks called ``crickets,''
which not only receive programs from a PC but also send
instructions to each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal,'' he said in an interview, ``is to bring back a
craft spirit. We think of computers as a new kind of material used
to create things in the world.'' The computer, he suggested, should
seem more like modeling clay or finger paint and less like
television.
</P>
<P>
   This celebration of material manipulation gives the Lego robots
an even closer connection to traditional Legos than many of the
other Lego sets that have recently been made. Several years ago, as
Lego was being overshadowed by video games and other forms of
electronic play, Lego styles changed.
</P>
<P>
   The company developed sets aimed at girls (which were far less
successful here than in Europe) while making other attempts to
rival video games. Models were created that make sound and flash
lights. Lego machines were used in duels, with scores being kept by
electronic counters. Objects began to take on the fantastical
appearance of the latest sci-fi fantasies.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of castles, there are Insectoid space ships shaped like
spiders and beetles. Instead of a medieval catapult, there is a
Stingray submarine with a swinging tail ostensibly searching for
magic crystals. Technology runs wild.
</P>
<P>
   The ornate sets have many specialized parts _ green windshields,
insect wings, rock grinders _ that could fit in no other
application, something that almost violates the elegant principles
of Lego building.
</P>
<P>
   The new Star Wars models hark back a bit more to the
technological spirit of traditional Legos, despite their
specialized accouterments. They are at the same time stringent and
fantastical.
</P>
<P>
   But it is in the Mindstorms and Droid sets that the old Lego
principles fully come into their own: the use of the blocks and the
creation of the programs are interwoven activities.
</P>
<P>
   Lego has celebrated the act of making while displaying that act
in the objects being made: the Mindstorms creations, with their
mixture of engineering and programming, combine pretech mechanisms
and high-tech software and celebrate the union of making and
thinking. Who knows where this might lead?
</P>
<P>
   Voice synthesizers, subtle motor control, musical abilities,
robots conversing _ perhaps, one day, we will even come to be
grateful for Asimov's three laws.

IN CAPITOL HILL OFFICES, LAWMAKERS DISPLAY THEIR FAITH  
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CARL HULSE and SEAN LOUGHLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Southern House members are lining up behind a new
campaign to post the Ten Commandments in public buildings, agreeing
to display a copy in their own offices on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Critics dismiss the gesture as a gimmick, but the move reflects
the powerful role that religion continues to play in American
politics. At a time when Democrats and Republican squabble over
budget numbers while most Americans tune out, conservatives believe
they can engage voters by turning to religious and moral issues.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative activist Janet Parshall said the campaign serves as
``a reminder for our nation that the Ten Commandments belong in the
public square.'' Parshall's group, the Family Research Council, is
pressing schools and other public buildings to display a copy of
the Ten Commandments.
</P>
<P>
   The roster of lawmakers who have agreed to post the Ten
Commandments includes Republicans Robert Aderholt and Spencer
Bachus of Alabama, Jim DeMint of South Carolina, Cliff Stearns of
Florida and Walter Jones of North Carolina. Mike McIntyre of North
Carolina is one of the few Democrats to join the effort.
</P>
<P>
   McIntyre, who already displays a tableau of the Ten Commandments
in his office, said they held a special ``history, heritage and
hope'' for Americans. ``They're the fundamental legal code of
Western civilization,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Republicans have repeatedly backed the Ten
Commandments as a symbol. They've passed resolutions supporting a
state judge in Alabama who displays a copy behind his bench, and
they've passed other measures supporting states that allow such
postings in public buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Lynn, executive director of Americans United for the
Separation of Church and State, predicted that the courts would
eventually strike down the latest efforts to grant a government
endorsement to religious displays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would personally feel more comfortable if members hung the
Bill of Rights rather than the Ten Commandments in buildings,''
Lynn said.
</P>
<P>
   Starved for Attention
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Spencer Bachus, R-Ala., would be the first to tell you that
his recent 24-hour fast to draw attention to the plight of
struggling Third World countries was a small sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bachus, who wants the United States to forgive up to $1
billion in debt owed to it by foreign nations, said the break from
food wasn't easy. He rejected the advice of doctors who told him
that weaning from meals would be a good idea before going without
all food for 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking about his fast a few hours before it started, Bachus
quipped: ``Just thinking about it yesterday, I ate three packs of
M&AMP;Ms.''
</P>
<P>
   Money Men
</P>
<P>
   A new report from a campaign watchdog group shows that
politicians aren't just good at collecting money, they've developed
a knack for giving it away too.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers who held safe seats in the last election cycle still
collected millions of dollars for their campaigns. But many of them
wound up giving some of their cash away to their political parties
or fellow candidates. Such a move engenders good will among allies
and makes it easier to ask for favors later.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Responsive Politics, in its ``Sharing the
Wealth'' report, found that candidates who were coasting to
re-election gave $22.4 million to political parties and other
candidates. The parties, which can collect unlimited donations,
claimed the lion's share of that amount.
</P>
<P>
   The top contributors to political parties include Sen. Richard
Shelby, R-Ala., who doled out $500,000 to the GOP, and former
Louisiana Rep. Robert Livingston, another Republican, who handed
out $602,000 to his party.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston, who briefly laid claim to the House speaker's post
before leaving office last winter because of a scandal related to
an extramarital affair, also was generous in handing out money to
other candidates, contributing $66,361.
</P>
<P>
   Bush Whacked
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole won kudos from friends and admirers on Capitol
Hill after dropping out of the presidential race. But Texas Gov.
George W. Bush quickly picked up her endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sorry that she had to end her quest prematurely, but I am
equally delighted to lend my support to Gov. Bush,'' said Rep.
Howard Coble, R-N.C., who called Dole an ``important voice'' in the
GOP. An aide to Coble said Bush supporters were on the phone to
Coble's office within an hour of Dole's announcement, seeking the
lawmaker's support.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tillie Fowler, R-Fla., congratulated her close friend Dole
for her ``grace and dignity,'' but quickly hopped on board the Bush
bandwagon. ``With Elizabeth's departure from the race, it's
critical that we all unite behind Gov. Bush,'' Fowler said.

   IRAN-KHALKHALI (Qom, Iran) _ Much about Ayatollah Sadegh
Khalkhali these days _ his simple white smock, his bare feet, his
shuffling gait, his concern for his visitors' well-being _ speaks
for an almost penitential gentleness. Long gone are his days as the
chief judge of Iran's revolutionary courts in the early 1980s, when
his name was enough to strike terror, his word sufficient to set
execution squads to work with their gallows, their shootings and
their stonings. Twenty years ago, Khalkhali was the Islamic
revolution's Robespierre, the grim avenger who condemned hundreds
and possibly thousands of men and women to death, some of them
after trials that lasted only five minutes, or after no trials at
all. He made his grim mark on the American consciousness in April
1980, when, in cleric's robes and turban, he was reported to have
poked at the charred bodies of American commandos killed in the

fantasy of itself as the chivalrous competitor, far too polite to
pour beer on an enemy fan, there is room for a dream of serial
slaughter. Faced with the possibility of vanquishing not just one
but two New York baseball teams in a single October, including one
with the name that represents everything Atlanta seems to recall
hating, the city is becoming positively bloodthirsty as the World
Series nears its opening here on Saturday night. In an entirely

ANOTHER PERFECT DAY IN THE PERFECT LIFE OF DEREK JETER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Derek Jeter eases out of the dugout at Yankee
Stadium or glides along the streets of Manhattan or hustles through
a hotel lobby in any city, it is fascinating to watch the people
who find themselves near him. They point, they whisper, they nod.
Some squeal.
</P>
<P>
   There was an overly aggressive woman who followed Jeter out of a
bar in Boston during the All-Star Game break and hounded him until
he had escaped in a cab. There was a hopeful teen-ager who jumped
up and down at Kennedy Airport when she learned that Jeter was on
her flight. There was a man at a restaurant in New York who ambled
to a pay phone before babbling about being 10 feet from Jeter. Yes,
that Derek Jeter.
</P>
<P>
   It is just as revealing to watch how Jeter reacts to these
stares, glares and advances. With his shifting green eyes and his
honed intuition as his only bodyguards against the world that
demands access, Jeter enforces his own protection.
</P>
<P>
   I am nice, but I am not a mannequin, his body language
announces. I will give you some time, but do not push and make me
uncomfortable, he communicates without moving his lips. Watch him
bob, weave and stay in control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of whether you're in the spotlight, you have to be
wary of how you're perceived,'' Jeter said earlier this week. ``I
think you want to be perceived as someone that you are. You don't
want to get in trouble. You shouldn't want to get in trouble. If
you are in the spotlight, you have to be more careful with what you
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter is the dynamic player who symbolizes these successful
Yankees, the youngest player, the most popular player and maybe
even the most indispensable player. Jeter is synonymous with the
Yankees and winning because he has reached the post-season for five
straight seasons, including the last four as the slick starting
shortstop. He keeps getting better and never acts as if playing is
any less enjoyable than a free vacation to Maui.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me,'' Joe Torre said, ``he's the coolest cat in town.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not a coincidence that the Yankees have rocketed to the
top of the baseball world at exactly the same time that Jeter
strolled into the Bronx. The Yankees will continue pursuing their
third World Series championship in four years when they face the
Braves in Game 1 on Saturday night, an experience that has become
commonplace for Jeter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I've been in the right place at the right time,'' said
Jeter, who this season set career highs in average (.349), home
runs (24), runs batted in (102) and runs (134). ``We've been
winning since I've been here. I think it would be tough where
you're losing. It's something I've never experienced and don't want
to experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter claimed that he does not consider himself different from
other 25-year-olds, other than having a better job. Sure. Jeter is
the most recognizable player on the best team in baseball, the lead
actor in a traveling soap opera.
</P>
<P>
   ``He likes being that guy,'' Paul O'Neill said. ``A lot of
people don't need that and don't like it. He does. He's not playing
to become a star, but he likes being here, winning, playing well
and being that person.''
</P>
<P>
   The phone rings in Jeter's apartment or in a hotel room on the
road every day with the same message from Charles or Dorothy, his
parents; the same advice that they have given Derek since he was a
boy in Kalamazoo, Mich., and signed contracts with his parents that
would describe academic and athletic goals for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Though Jeter has asserted himself as one of the premier players
in the major leagues, has been on the cover of GQ and endorses
everything from shoes to a cereal called Jeter's, the calls do not
stop. If anything, they intensify.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tell him we hope he's making good decisions,'' Dr. Charles
Jeter said. ``He's been fortunate, so don't mess up. We tell him to
be wary of who he's with. We do this often. We trust him, but we
ask about everything. It's routine.''
</P>
<P>
   With a confident gait, Jeter struts through the Yankee
clubhouse, teasing teammates and neatly adapting to different
situations. There are things he will not do or say, ways that he
will not act and that will not change. It is futile to try to get
Jeter to budge.
</P>
<P>
   Flash back to the Chad Curtis incident in August, when Curtis
chastised Jeter in front of his teammates for acting nonchalantly
alongside Seattle's Alex Rodriguez during a bench-clearing
squabble. Jeter, who was privately irked by the attention his
action received, said: ``I guess the best way to put it is, you
asked me if I'm worried about something Chad Curtis said. No, I'm
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Hank Aaron, the career home run king, sought out Jeter and
introduced himself before the All-Star Game, causing Jeter to gush,
``Can you believe that?'' Jeter was selected by Michael Jordan to
help launch a line of athletic apparel, an invitation he called
``overwhelming.'' Jeter once stared up at a music video on a
clubhouse television in Tampa, Fla., and expressed a desire to date
the singer Mariah Carey, which he eventually did. Now he does not
discuss Carey or other women he dates, figuring gossip writers can
do their own reporting.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is this side of Jeter: He speaks about his family more
than any father with triplets, he is very close with Don Zimmer, a
68-year-old coach, and he had enough foresight to begin his own
Turn 2 Foundation for children with substance abuse problems. He
was only 22 when he recruited his father over a pizza in a hotel
room to leave his job as a psychologist and run the foundation,
which has raised $600,000 in less than three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think too many people realize how much he really wants
to do the right thing,'' Dr. Jeter said. ``He takes being a role
model seriously. Sometimes, I wonder if people realize how
important it is to him. He wants to do everything right.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, Jeter does. He is still a bachelor making $5
million in salary alone, meaning there are always temptations.
Jeter says he is cautious, but still has fun, so those late nights
he reportedly spends at the China Club, Moomba and Jimmy's Bronx
Cafi cannot all be blamed on creative writers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going out with Jeter,'' David Cone has said, ``is like going
with Elvis.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter's life is such that he sits by his locker answering
questions about whether his life is perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not perfect yet,'' Jeter said. ``It's getting there.''
</P>
<P>
   Someday, he will likely become the first $100 million Yankee and
maybe the team's first captain since Don Mattingly. He is gradually
constructing a potential Hall of Fame career, and it is reasonable
to discuss 3,000 hits for a player who has 807 at 25. Jeter dodges
talk about legacies _ bobbing, weaving and staying in control while
focusing on today. It should be another perfect day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing something that I've always wanted to do for as long
as I could remember,'' Jeter said. ``That's play shortstop for the
Yankees, go to the World Series and win championships. It's like
everything is this big dream story. If I was writing a story when I
was younger, this is exactly how I would have written it.''

<P>
   Baz Snider was making his way through the afternoon crush of
pedestrians in Rockefeller Center when the sight of a green,
four-wheeled, six-passenger frog stopped him cold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, that is one (italics)ugly(end italics) car,'' Snider, of
Manhattan, volunteered even before he could be asked his opinion of
the Fiat Multipla parked near the ``Today'' show studio.
</P>
<P>
   Just short of dumbfounded, he seemed unable to take his eyes off
the oddly shaped mini-minivan, which has sold briskly in Europe in
the year since it went on sale. After sitting at the wheel, though,
and poking around in the spacious cabin, Snyder assessed the car
more charitably, conceding that the unusual design incorporated a
number of tricks that made the Multipla practical and pleasant. He
even mellowed a bit toward the styling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ugly,'' he affirmed again before disappearing into the
rush hour. ``But I'm not into style. Look at me _ I wear bow
ties.''
</P>
<P>
   Snider was among many New Yorkers brought up short by the
Multipla and by another tiny car, the Ford Ka, that stood out in
Manhattan like snowplows in Miami. Motorists pointed in traffic and
crowds gathered wherever the two cars were parked, proving that
although many Manhattanites are blase about automobiles, they
respond enthusiastically to daring designs and the lure of the new
and different.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the success of the Museum of Modern Art's recent
exhibition entitled ``Different Roads: Automobiles for the Next
Century,'' which closed last month. The Multipla and the Ka were
among the nine futuristic auto designs in the exhibit, which was
organized by Christopher Mount, assistant curator of the museum's
department of architecture and design, with Phil Patton as
curatorial consultant.
</P>
<P>
   While new to Americans, the two cars are on their way to
becoming common sights on the streets of Europe. But neither is
destined to be sold here in the land of the garantuan sport
utility, where faint demand for small, fuel-efficient, odd-looking
vehicles cannot justify the costs of meeting American crash and
emissions standards. Furthermore, Fiat has not had an auto-sales
network in North America since 1983.
</P>
<P>
   There is another hurdle: Neither car offers an automatic
transmission. That is no problem overseas, where small-car drivers
disdain automatics for sapping the power and reducing the economy
of tiny engines. But relatively few Americans are able or willing
to shift for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is efficiency high on most American car shoppers' lists of
essential characteristics. Still, a number of recent designs,
including two inexpensive cars that have just gone on sale in the
United States, the Ford Focus and Toyota Echo, demonstrate that
economy can happily co-exist with spacious cabins, distinctive
styling, responsive handling and people-friendly features.
</P>
<P>
   The Ka and Multipla go a couple of steps further, with designs
that may be too extreme for American tastes. While successful as
hands-off displays in the Modern's sculpture garden, does their
function match their form when they roll onto crowded streets? Can
they be appreciated for the way they drive and ride, as well as for
their innovative use of space?
</P>
<P>
   Fiat and Ford, which had brought extra cars to New York in
conjunction with the Modern's exhibit, made them available recently
for test drives. Both the Multipla and the Ka proved even more
impressive in traffic than as static sculptures of sheet metal.
Indeed, each car offers answers to some questions posed by
internal-combustion cars in the concrete jungle of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Multipla: Space Before Style
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the Fiat Multipla's frog-eyed face _ due to the rounded
front and high-beam headlamps up near the windshield, like
amphibian eyes _ the car is most striking for its bolt-upright side
windows. ``It is a vertical car,'' said Paolo Vannini, vice
president for corporate communications at Fiat USA.
</P>
<P>
   Though the high design looks ungainly, its beauty lies within,
where six tall passengers sit high and comfortably. Huge windows
make the cabin exceptionally airy. The driver's view is superb, if
not as high as that from the biggest sport utilities (though one
cannot see even a bit of the downward-sloping hood from behind the
wheel).
</P>
<P>
   The name of the car, which sells in Italy for the rough
equivalent of $16,000 to $20,000, denotes its multiplicity of uses
_ as sedan, station wagon, van or what the Europeans call a
multi-purpose vehicle, akin to an American sport utility _ as well
as its four potential power sources.
</P>
<P>
   The car's impressive interior volume defies its overall length
of 157 inches _ half a foot shorter than a Volkswagen Golf. The
space trick was accomplished by topping a low basic body module
(the working part of the car, which is no larger than necessary)
with a high greenhouse of glass for the passengers.
</P>
<P>
   A low waistline separates the two pieces and forms a line atop
the fenders. The side windows are as tall as the body beneath them,
and because they do not curve inward, they do not intrude on
passenger space.
</P>
<P>
   Another benefit of this design is safety. In a crash, the lower
module absorbs the impact, in theory, instead of the cabin.
</P>
<P>
   Getting in or out is easy, thanks to high, wide doors and seats
that are comfortably but not excessively high. There are three
identical seats up front and three in the back; they are all
equally roomy. They can also can be detached and removed by lifting
latches _ flush with the floor and designed with Italian flair.
</P>
<P>
   The middle seat up front, in fact, can be replaced with a
console that includes an insulated box that can be heated or
chilled. A small refrigerator can slip into the spot occupied by
the middle rear seat.
</P>
<P>
   The cabin floor is flat, and there is a surprising amount of
cargo space behind the second row of seats. There are storage
compartments everywhere, including neat bins that fold out of the
roof above the sun visors. Controls are clustered in the center of
the dashboard, including the manual shifter, which protrudes from a
pod to the driver's right and frees the floor for legs.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   With the speedometer in the middle, the space ahead is available
for the screen of an optional navigation system. This screen can
also be plugged in on the passenger side and operated by remote,
giving children in the rear something to occupy their time.
</P>
<P>
   The interior is flamboyantly Italian, down to the modern fabric
that covers the top of the dash, to the asymetrical sun visors _
one small, one huge _ and a tiny lid on the floor that lifts to
reveal the ID number.
</P>
<P>
   Its odd look is only part of what makes the Fiat different. It
was brought to the Modern in part because of the choices of power
sources it offers: gasoline only, diesel only, a dual Bi-Power
system that can be switched from gasoline to natural gas and, yet
to come, a gasoline-electric hybrid.
</P>
<P>
   The car I drove in New York was the Bi-Power version, but its
natural gas tanks were empty at the time. On gasoline, the
four-cylinder engine (1.6 liters, 16 valves, 103 horsepower on
gasoline) moved briskly through midtown traffic with three
occupants on board.
</P>
<P>
   The car's small size, solid chassis and light, precise steering
made it easy to maneuver around stopped cabs and slow trucks. With
independent suspensions at front and rear, the car rode smoothly
over streets ravaged by pre-millennium construction. The outside
mirrors, which include a separate, convex portion for a wider view,
retract electrically in tight quarters.
</P>
<P>
   But it is inside where the Fiat makes the biggest impression.
The roomy cabin; comfortable, flexible seats; excellent outward
view, and well-though-out amenities lead one quickly to the thought
that this would make an ideal taxicab in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Fiat is selling a taxi version in Europe. Big-boned New
Yorkers would find a Multipla cab comforting, too, but they are
unlikely to get a chance to hail one.
</P>
<P>
   Ka: Commuting Module With Flair
</P>
<P>
   While the Multipla seems a dandy alternative to yellow, metered
Ford Crown Victorias, the Ford Ka has more room than a crowded car
on the D train, handles a lot better than the M104 bus and offers
some of the fun of in-line skates in a safer, weather-resistant
package. It is a commuting device with style and a smile.
</P>
<P>
   The Ka, in short, is a tiny city car _ too small to rate three
letters, perhaps. Its layout is conventional (it uses the
front-drive platform and 1.3-liter four-cylinder engine of the Ford
Fiesta sold overseas), but the design is bright. The styling is New
Edge, with rounded planes broken by creases, wrapped around a
passenger cabin that is higher and more spacious than the exterior
would lead one to believe.
</P>
<P>
   To hold down costs in Europe, where cars are generally more
expensive, Ford used cheap materials; the headliner is molded foam,
and a thin feltlike material masquerades as carpeting. But there
are plenty of clever touches, including an oval bin that pivots to
reveal slots for cassette tapes on one side or a small, hinged
storage box on the other.
</P>
<P>
   There are depressions in the floor, front and rear, that hold
coins or other small items. A postmodern analog clock punctuates
the minimalist dash.
</P>
<P>
   In town, 60 horsepower never felt so good. The short-throw
shifter is light and precise, and the Ka is geared to zoom when the
light turns green. Quick steering lets the Ka dart around backed-up
buses and trucks like a minnow in a school of tuna, and tiny
curbside gaps become feasible parking spots.
</P>
<P>
   On a drive with Kathleen Hamilton, who works in Ford's New York
office, we encountered a semi-truck backed up to a loading dock,
blocking nearly the entire width of West 28th Street. After pausing
for a second to judge the scant remaining space, we roared ahead
and squeezed through the gap with fractions of an inch to spare.
</P>
<P>
   And when we encountered a backup near the Lincoln Tunnel
entrance from Ninth Avenue, we discovered that a fleet of Ka's
could do much to relieve gridlock. Caught in the intersection as
the light turned red, I shifted to first, gunned the engine and
jammed in between a bus and a truck.
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible to block the box in a car as a short as a Ka.
</P>

A RETIREE'S WORK: DIPPING INTO THE NEST EGG  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 24) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Md., N.Y.)   (af)  
 By JAN M. ROSEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many Americans have taken to heart the advice to save for
retirement, socking away some $2.61 trillion in
defined-contribution plans like 401(k)s, according to the Spectrem
Group, a business research and consulting company in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the first members of the generation responsible for
their own retirement savings begin to leave work, comes the second
part of the equation: withdrawing money from these plans.
</P>
<P>
   Don't assume that this is the easy part. To avoid running out of
money, retirees need to consider every aspect of their finances and
life styles. ``The issues in retirement planning are very
complicated,'' said Avery E. Neumark, who is in charge of
retirement planning for the Rosen Seymour Shapss Martin &AMP; Co., a
New York accounting firm. Because few retirees can handle all the
complications on their own, he recommends that they seek
professional advice.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph P. Healy, manager of retirement and advisory services for
T. Rowe Price, the Baltimore mutual fund and investment advisory
company, says that in addition to considering market volatility,
interest rate shifts, inflation and tax laws, retirees must think
about individual variables like their risk tolerance, life
expectancies, living standards and whether they wish to leave money
to children or anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Many people _ even some financial professionals _ look only at
average rates of return. Say Mary Smith calculates that she will
need $25,000 a year to supplement a pension and Social Security.
She concludes that if she has $250,000 in her 401(k) plan, and it
earns 10 percent, she will be fine.
</P>
<P>
   Whoa. Her calculations have failed to account for possible wide
swings in annual returns and for inflation. T. Rowe Price, having
studied the performance of a wide range of portfolios from 1968 to
1998, concluded that a vicious bear market early in the period,
like the one of 1973-74, could cause the rapid depletion of such a
portfolio. That depletion would be further accelerated by the need
to withdraw an average of 3 percent more each year to keep up with
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The rich have long relied on investment advisers and fee-based
financial planners to manage portfolios and devise withdrawal
strategies. Nowadays, the middle class could also use professional
help.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Neumark's clients also receive retirement guidance from
brokerage firms, among them Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   For $500, T. Rowe Price has a new service to analyze the options
for middle-class people within two years of retirement, or who have
retired recently.
</P>
<P>
   Clients fill out detailed questionnaires, and the firm uses
computers to consider hundreds of possible retirement income and
withdrawal strategies, as well as possible market performance
variations. From the results, it recommends three possible courses,
tailored to individual goals and preferences. The cost includes an
annual review for those who invest with Price.

TEXAS OFFICIALS TARGET 25 PLANTS IN SMOG PROBE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BILL DAWSON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Texas officials say they have narrowed their search
for the cause of an unusual ``smog episode'' earlier this month to
25 plants that handle two specific chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, they have said they suspected a chemical leak at an
unknown industrial facility was to blame for the outbreak of high
smog readings Oct. 7.
</P>
<P>
   But state records show there were no company reports of
accidental releases involving the two targeted chemicals on that
day or the day before.
</P>
<P>
   That suggests the high smog readings Oct. 7 _ including the
Houston area's highest in a decade _ may have resulted from a
chemical leak that wasn't reported to government officials, as
state regulations require.
</P>
<P>
   The series of high pollution readings showed up in a striking
northward progression, one after another, at seven area monitoring
stations.
</P>
<P>
   The highest reading _ 251 parts per billion of ground-level
ozone, at nearby Deer Park _ was double the national health
standard's permissible maximum. The other six stations also had
ozone readings above the standard.
</P>
<P>
   Ozone, smog's main ingredient, is a respiratory irritant linked
to lung damage. High ozone levels also indicate the presence of
other chemicals that produce ozone when they react in sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   These ozone-forming chemicals include ethylene and propylene,
the two that officials are now scrutinizing in connection with the
Oct. 7 episode.
</P>
<P>
   That day's high ozone levels occurred at sites where monitors
also detected the presence of ethylene and propylene.
</P>
<P>
   Ozone measurements increased as the levels of those two
chemicals declined at the same monitoring station _ a telltale sign
that they were reacting to form ozone, said Patrick Crimmins, a
spokesman for the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Regulations permit routine, controlled releases of the two
chemicals _ along with many other ozone-forming chemicals and other
air pollutants _ at numerous industrial facilities in Harris and
Galveston counties.
</P>
<P>
   According to the latest company-reported data available, 33
Harris County plants regularly release ethylene and 38 regularly
release propylene. In Galveston County, six release ethylene and
seven release propylene.
</P>
<P>
   Crimmins said the TNRCC's investigation is focusing on 25 plants
because of an analysis of wind directions recorded Oct. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Ethylene and propylene could have been blown from those 25
locations toward the pollution-monitoring sites where the high
ozone levels occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The high smog readings Oct. 7 pushed Houston ahead of Los
Angeles as the metropolitan area with the most days when at least
one ozone measurement exceeded the health standard. As of Friday,
the Houston area had 46 such days and the Los Angeles area had 43. &QL;

AT HOME AGAIN, A LEADER EXHORTS COUNTRYMEN TO REBUILD EAST TIMOR

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ With controlled fury, as if with each word
he could begin to rebuild his shattered homeland, the leader of
East Timor, Jose Alexandre Gusmao, exhorted his weeping countrymen
Friday to show the world their strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we would suffer!'' he shouted, his words echoing
through a microphone across a vista of burned and vandalized
buildings, and broad- cast on Indonesian television. ``But we are
still here.''
</P>
<P>
   Under threat from the Indonesian-backed militias that continue
to torment East Timor in a campaign of organized vengeance, Gusmao
was flown in secret on Thursday night to the capital, Dili, by
international peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   As he addressed a crowd of 500 people on his first visit home
since his arrest and imprisonment in Indonesia in 1992, Gusmao was
flanked by bodyguards in battle fatigues, holding rifles and
scanning the surroundings through dark glasses.
</P>
<P>
   The return of the man who is widely seen as the future leader of
an independent East Timor was a signal of the slow rebirth of the
territory, which was ravaged by the militias in response to its
vote of nearly 80 percent on Aug. 30 to become independent of
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   In a moment of national humiliation on Wednesday, the Indonesian
national assembly formally accepted that vote. The recognition of
the democratic choice of the territory it invaded in 1975 coincided
strangely with the assembly's choice of a new president, an
experiment in electoral politics after a generation of one-person
rule.
</P>
<P>
   Gusmao's words Friday, enunciated slowly and fiercely in the
local language, Tetun, seemed to try to begin East Timor's revival
by infusing his people with a sense of determination and hope for
the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will show the world, we will show Indonesia, we will show
ourselves that we can do it!'' he shouted to the crowd, in which
most people had lost their houses and possessions and many were
still searching for missing relatives.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether it was tears or rage or the battle cry of
a former guerrilla leader that caused his voice to break and seemed
to fill each word with pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must put in the past the evil they have done to us,''
Gusmao said. ``Tomorrow is ours.''
</P>
<P>
   The return was a month after the arrival in Dili of the first
elements of the 8,000-member security force.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as it deploys slowly throughout the territory, the force
has begun to engage in small fire fights with militias. Military
officers say they believe that some of the militia members are in
fact renegade Indonesian troops.
</P>
<P>
   The international force has also begun finding evidence of
killings in twos and threes and fours, bodies in wells, in creek
beds, in ponds and in fields. But so far, the troops and U.N.
officials say, they have not found evidence of the large-scale
massacres that had been feared.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations is expected in the coming days to approve the
creation of an international administration for the newborn nation,
backed by 10,000 soldiers, that would run its affairs for two to
three years while Gusmao and his allies put a government apparatus
in place.
</P>
<P>
   That process will require the writing of a constitution, the
passing of laws and the creation of the fundamentals of an
independent nation, from law enforcement to electrical power
supply.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The creation of a new East Timor will literally be from the
ground up. Most people now have no houses. Those with houses often
have no roofs. And for now, few building materials or tools are to
be found anywhere in the burned and vandalized territory.
</P>
<P>
   Small markets have sprung up in Dili and in some other towns.
But they sell almost nothing besides vegetables and black-market
Indonesian military rations. International aid agencies have begun
streaming into the territory, often competing or working at cross
purposes with one another, according to officials there.
</P>
<P>
   Many groups have set up clinics and hospitals, and the news from
those centers offers a rare encouraging sign _ there is little
evidence of starvation, epidemic or injury by armed men.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of thousands of East Timorese have been driven from
their houses and are still too frightened to return from
mountainside refuges. But the humanitarian disaster that had been
feared has not materialized.
</P>
<P>
   What is striking in this aftermath is the seeming pointlessness
of the campaign against the East Timorese. Six weeks after it
began, it is evident that the rampage of destruction, killings and
forced evacuations _ unlike many other eruptions of violence around
the world _ was not fired by any ideology, territorial claim,
ethnic conflict or tactical design.
</P>
<P>
   The rampage appeared to be an almost wholly negative enterprise
of retribution, engineered by what may have been a relatively small
group in the Indonesian military, against a people who had rejected
them after a failed 24-year campaign of armed pacification.
</P>
<P>
   As they departed, Indonesian soldiers or their militia
surrogates set fire to almost every administrative building,
including their own barracks, that could be used by a new
government. On the burned out buildings they left graffiti that
served as explanatory captions like ``Freedom in the jungle.'' And,
in a warning that people there would starve: ``A free East Timor
will eat stones.''
</P>
<P>
   But the last small units of Indonesian soldiers are pulling out
now, following the vote of their parliament, and Friday the last
word belonged to Gusmao.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tried to kill us,'' he said. ``But we are still here,
crying and suffering but still alive. We will rebuild our homeland.
Nothing can stop us.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ For two decades, Michael Sheldrake was the
coffee king of Second Street here. With virtually no competition
within 20 miles, his Polly's Gourmet Coffee dominated the market in
the affluent Belmont Shores section of the city.
</P>
<P>
   But Sheldrake's idyll, like those of many other small-business
owners, was disrupted by the coming of the ``category killer''
chains. In his case, he found himself up against arguably the most
formidable mass retailer of this decade, Starbucks.
</P>
<P>
   Polly's sales fell 10 percent to 15 percent when a Starbucks
store appeared a few blocks away in Long Beach in 1994. And in
1998, another Starbucks opened just 78 yards from Polly's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were getting despondent,'' Sheldrake said. ``We were just
trying to hang on. We had a chain problem and didn't know what to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no phenomenon has more profoundly transformed American
Main Streets in the 1990s than the ``chain problem.'' From tiny
Annapolis, Md., to the Melrose district of Hollywood to bohemian
Harvard Square in Cambridge, Mass., retail streetscapes have been
steadily homogenized as well-managed and heavily marketed national
chains have outgunned and displaced locally owned rivals, whose
resources and organization generally pale in comparison with the
likes of Starbucks.
</P>
<P>
   But the way Polly's responded to the chain problem demonstrates
that resistance is not futile. In a turn of events that suggests
some hope for small-scale retailers, Polly's fought back, and has
managed to grow and thrive even with two Starbucks in its
neighborhood. Sales rose 40 percent in 1998 and are on a pace for a
30 percent rise this year.
</P>
<P>
   With help from a retail consultant, Bob Phibbs, who specializes
in helping independent businesses cope with chain-store
competitors, Polly's decided to take aim at Starbucks in two ways:
beating the chain at its own game by operating even more
efficiently, and exploiting the inherent vulnerability of many
chains: ``The problem with a chain is that it's like a mall: it's
all mechanical, and there's no relationship with the customers,''
said Phibbs, 41, whose other clients have included independent
hotels and pet stores. ``I think people are getting sick of the
megastores. People are disaffected.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Polly's, Phibbs advised the company to stress the
fact that the store roasts its own coffee on site, which is
impractical for a sprawling chain like Starbucks, and to emphasize
the wider variety of coffees Polly's offers. Starbucks, considered
trendy by many of its customers, was derided in Polly's local
advertising as a mere purveyor of ``ordinary'' coffee.
</P>
<P>
   But Polly's resurgence was built on more than positioning.
Phibbs urged the store's management to adopt the chains' best
organizational and management ideas, like putting an end to a
plethora of special arrangements between employees and longtime
customers for free or cut-rate services and tightening cash
management procedures. Employees attended mandatory classes to
improve their sales skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advantages of the chains are their procedures and
administration,'' Phibbs said. ``If an independent doesn't learn
how to be just as efficient, they're going to be dead, fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Many retail experts say the chains' organizational advantages
and economies of scale will eventually overwhelm most independent
businesses, even if a few, like Polly's, swim against the tide for
a time.
</P>
<P>
   Yves Sistron, a principal at Global Retail Partners, a venture
capital company based in Los Angeles that invests in aspiring
chains, observed that mass retailers are continually invading once
secure small-business preserves, even in areas like cosmetics,
educational toys, watches, fruit juices and Chinese food.
</P>
<P>
   To Sistron, who has invested in successful chains like Jamba
Juice and P.F. Chang's China Bistros, it is only a matter of time
before well-financed and managed chains gobble up just about
everything on Main Street. ``Who gets beat up?'' he said. ``The
smaller independent stores, the mom-and-pops. I'm not saying it's
not dreary. But it's true.''
</P>
<P>
   In the future, he said, if shoppers want to find anything like a
traditional Main Street, ``it's going to be Main Street,
Disneyland.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the continuing success of Starbucks lends credence to
Sistron's view. The company's sales at stores open at least a year
were 8 percent higher in September than they were in September
1998, and it has bought out one smaller competitor after another;
it now has 2,500 stores worldwide, up from just 11 a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Starbucks' chief executive, Howard Schultz, has spoken of
growing to 20,000 outlets, rivaling McDonald's 25,000 stores for
sheer ubiquity.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is Starbucks' concentration on growth, Phibbs said, that
gives companies like Polly's their opportunity. The bigger
Starbucks gets, he said, and the further afield it goes, the more
trouble it will have maintaining consistent high quality in its
products and in customer service.
</P>
<P>
   The chain's expansion into other kinds of drinks, including
sweetened iced coffees, and Schultz's Internet ambitions to turn
the Starbucks Web site into a dominant ``premier life style
portal'' have not yet excited much enthusiasm on Wall Street, where
analysts are concerned about a perceived lack of focus.
</P>
<P>
   Translated into Main Street terms, Phibbs said, Starbucks risks
squandering its cachet as an upscale coffee house. ``Starbucks is
not a coffee business any more,'' Phibbs said. ``It's a drinks
business _ a McDonald's of the 1990s.''
</P>
<P>
   Starbucks did not respond to repeated requests for comment for
this column.
</P>
<P>
   For entrepreneurs like Sheldrake of Polly's, any weakness in the
strategic focus of a powerful chain represents a chance to survive
and thrive. But given the chains' marketing muscle, Sheldrake said,
he knows that independents like Polly's can never afford to
backslide or become lazy.
</P>
<P>
   ``A small business can stand up to a chain,'' Sheldrake said.
``But you can only do it if you have procedures as good as theirs _
and better coffee, too.''

 &HT;    Small Delta group votes for union
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ By a razor-thin margin, a small group of Delta Air
Lines workers has voted to join the Transport Workers Union.
</P>
<P>
   The vote among pilot ground-training instructors marks the first
union win in decades at Delta, the least-unionized major airline.
</P>
<P>
   It comes as Atlanta-based Delta faces organizing drives among
much larger groups, including ramp workers and flight attendants.
</P>
<P>
   The National Mediation Board on Friday said 55 of 107 eligible
instructors submitted ballots supporting a union, with 54 voting
for the TWU and one voting for another group. A majority of
eligible workers must vote for unionization, so supporters won with
a single vote to spare. The results still must be certified by the
NMB, which would consider any company appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Delta spokesman John Kennedy said he was unaware of any plans to
challenge the result.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are disappointed that (the instructors) have chosen an
outside entity to become involved in the relationship between them
and their company,'' he said. He added Delta would work
``professionally and constructively with their representatives.''
</P>
<P>
   The TWU, which in coming months will enter initial contract
talks for the instructors, hailed the vote as ``just the
beginning,'' predicting ``others will soon follow.'' The union said
it will seek a vote ``in the very near future'' among Delta's
10,000 ramp workers. It sought a vote among rampers in 1997, but
the NMB ruled that it lacked the required employee support at that
time.
</P>
<P>
   The Association of Flight Attendants also is trying to organize
Delta's 20,000 attendants and hopes for an election next year. A
union must get signed cards from 35 percent of eligible workers
before the NMB will call an election.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Delta's 9,200 pilots and 175 flight dispatchers were
its only unionized groups. The airline, which contends workers are
paid and treated as well or better than those at other carriers,
has long been resistant to other organizing efforts.
</P>
<P>
   But activity heated up after employee cutbacks during a
financial slump in the early 1990s, followed by a management
overhaul. Employee organizers in the current campaigns say they
primarily want the security and negotiating rights afforded by a
union contract.
</P>
<P>
   Delta is vigorously fighting the drives, and Chief Executive Leo
Mullin has issued personal memos urging workers not to support
further unionization.

<P>
   Ted Stone robbed convenience stores and shot a man during the
early 1970s. Now the rugged-looking North Carolinian is a respected
trustee of Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``God gave me a second chance,'' Stone said this week during a
break at the seminary's fall trustee meeting. ``This is a land of
second chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Stone's is a remarkable story of an up-and-down life. He grew up
in Durham, N.C., which is still his home. He was on the right path
during his years in high school and college.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to do everything right,'' he said. ``I even wanted to
become a minister.''
</P>
<P>
   But Stone got sidetracked _ for a while.
</P>
<P>
   He graduated from Wake Forest University and went into business,
working long hours as a real estate salesman and as the owner of a
thriving florist business in Durham.
</P>
<P>
   To keep himself going, Stone remembered the advice of his
fraternity brothers in college, who had urged him to take
``uppers'' to stay awake during all-night study sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had refused to take them in college,'' he said. ``I was
afraid of them.''
</P>
<P>
   But when business pressures increased, he began overdosing on
amphetamines, or ``speed,'' to keep his energy level high.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went from taking two a day to 15 a day,'' he said. ``I
became very violent. I bought a gun and started robbing stores for
the thrill of it. I shot a man in a robbery. Luckily, he didn't
die.''
</P>
<P>
   Stone was convicted of armed robbery and attempted murder and
served four years and three months in Central State Prison in
Raleigh, N.C., and in Caledonian Prison Farm in northeast North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Since his release in 1976, he has spent his life warning people
that drugs _ both legal and illegal _ can destroy your life.
</P>
<P>
   Legal drugs are also dangerous, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who eat valium tablets can have just as many troubles
as those who snort cocaine,'' Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 and 1998, Stone walked across America, carrying an
American flag. He spoke in schools, churches and prisons.
</P>
<P>
   ``When prisoners see me, it gives them hope,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to mark the year 2000 by trekking from the Texas-Mexico
border near Laredo northward through Fort Worth and all the way to
Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walk every step of the way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During his walks he averages 16 miles a day. Then an associate
picks him up and takes him to a speaking engagement or a hotel. His
ministry is supported by his own funds and by donations.
</P>
<P>
   He addressed students at the Fort Worth seminary this week and
urged them to sign cards pledging they would not abuse drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you sign something, you are more likely to keep your
promise,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stone said about 200,000 people have signed the pledge cards.
During one of his walks, Stone persuaded Gov. Gary Johnson of New
Mexico to sign a card. Johnson advocates legalization of such drugs
as cocaine, heroin and marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Johnson doesn't use drugs. I agree with him that we
need to have a national dialogue about drug abuse,'' Stone said.
``But I think legalizing drugs would make them easier to obtain and
would put more people in danger.''
</P>
<P>
   The Southern Baptist Convention, the nation's largest
non-Catholic denomination, now has a task force for drug-abuse
prevention, which was suggested by Stone.
</P>
<P>
   This week, he asked the Fort Worth seminary to include more
drug-abuse prevention courses in its curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get calls from pastors all the time telling me one of their
people has a drug problem and they don't know what to do,'' Stone
said.
</P>
<P>
   After he got out of prison, Stone did graduate work at
Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary and Duke University. He
spent five years as a member of the North Carolina Mental Health
Commission and has served as chairman of the Durham County
Substance Abuse Advisory Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In one of Stone's writings, he declared, ``America's youth needs
a new set of heroes. There can be no better hero than a family
member or friend who embraces sobriety and self control as the key
to happiness, success and inner peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Stone is not a hero in his own eyes, his incredible
efforts to warn people about drug dangers lifts him into the class
of some of those needed champions.

INDONESIA'S NEW LEADERS FACE A DAUNTING TASK: ECONOMIC REVIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By MARK LANDLER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two days after he became the first democratically elected
president in Indonesian history, Abdurrahman Wahid spent Friday
closeted with five eminent local economists.
</P>
<P>
   That Wahid would spend his second day in office grappling with
economic matters is no surprise. The political upheaval that
vaulted him to power originated from an economic crisis. While the
political drama may be over, the economic crisis rages on.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Baird, the World Bank's representative in Jakarta, likens
Indonesia to a drowning swimmer who has broken the surface after a
fierce struggle. ``Now they've got to swim 10 miles to shore,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's economy is still the sickest in Asia, with its banks
and many of its companies paralyzed by debt. Modest growth has
returned, but not enough to offset the devastating effects of the
recession. Inflation and interest rates have returned to earth,
though few banks have any money to lend.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's currency, the rupiah, rose to its highest level
Friday since last summer. But at an exchange rate of 6,800 rupiah
to the dollar, it is still worth only a third of what it was before
the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most disturbing to a populist leader like Wahid, some 20
million people have slipped under the poverty line since the crisis
began two years ago, according to the World Bank. This crippling
loss of wealth has left one-fifth of Indonesia's 200 million people
living in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``His principal economic agenda has to be domestic,'' said
Eugene K. Galbraith, an economist and expert on Indonesia. ``He
must sew the place together after it was rent apart over the last
two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Wahid's agenda is likely to be reinforced by his newly elected
vice president, Megawati Sukarnoputri. Although Megawati's support
comes from Jakarta and other cities, while Wahid's constituency
tends to be rural, both built their reputations as champions of
social justice.
</P>
<P>
   For all that, Wahid, 59, has tried to allay fears that he would
depart from the policies of his predecessor, B.J. Habibie. In a
speech after he was sworn in on Wednesday, he pledged his fealty to
open markets and the need to make Indonesia competitive. Those
statements seemed aimed at the financial markets, and if the robust
performance of the rupiah has been any guide, they hit home.
</P>
<P>
   As a practical matter, economic analysts note, Wahid has little
room for maneuver. Indonesia cannot do without the $43 billion
rescue package assembled by the International Monetary Fund, the
World Bank and other agencies in 1997. That money comes with strict
policy prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still very much in a straitjacket for the next year or
two,'' said Umar Juoro, an economic adviser to Habibie. ``The new
government will have to be quite careful.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the IMF and the World Bank recently halted the flow of
aid amid suspicions that Jakarta was trying to cover up a growing
bank scandal. The agencies said they may soon resume the aid,
following a Supreme Court ruling in Indonesia earlier this week
that required the government to release the results of an outside
investigation of the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not finally resolved, but this was an important step,''
said Hubert Neiss, the director of Asia-Pacific operations of the
monetary fund. ``We'd have to see evidence that a legal prosecution
is under way.''
</P>
<P>
   Economic analysts express optimism that Wahid will pursue legal
action against the officials implicated in the banking scandal.
Much of his appeal, they note, is rooted in a perception that he
symbolizes a break from Indonesia's corrupt past. But they also
point out that the president has more pressing priorities, among
them assembling a cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid and Megawati met on Thursday night, just after Megawati
was sworn in as vice president, to begin drawing up a cabinet.
Political analysts said names could be announced on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Given his ecumenical style, experts believe that in addition to
senior officials from his own party, Wahid is likely to draw some
from Megawati's party and even from Golkar, the party of Suharto
and Habibie, whose patrimonial rule was abruptly terminated by the
Parliament this week.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of cabinet ministers will be particularly crucial
because neither Wahid nor Megawati has the aptitude or interest to
delve into the nitty-gritty of policy-making.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of them are essentially symbolic leaders,'' said Rizal
Ramli, an economist. ``They will need a proactive cabinet to
compensate.''
</P>
<P>
   How proactive remains to be seen. Some expect Megawati's chief
economic adviser, Kwik Kian Gie, to assume a senior post like
finance minister. Kwik, an outspoken ethnic Chinese economist,
ruffled feathers last June when he suggested that Indonesia should
peg the value of the rupiah to the dollar, a policy that is
anathema to the monetary fund.
</P>
<P>
   Others predicted that Kwik's views would disqualify him. Indeed,
in some political betting parlors Friday, Fuad Bawazir, a finance
minister under Suharto, was being mentioned as a possible finance
minister in the new government.
</P>
<P>
   Neiss said Wahid had expressed his support for the fund's
program in a meeting with some of its top officials. Wahid has a
few pet projects, like increased aid to farmers, that go beyond the
existing program. But Neiss said they could be accommodated without
ripping up the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Agricultural policy is a nettlesome issue in Indonesia. Last
year, the devaluation of the rupiah and a damaged distribution
system caused a shortage of rice, Indonesia's staple. Skyrocketing
prices led to food riots in eastern Java. While Indonesia has
adequate stores of rice this year, economic analysts said Wahid was
keenly aware of the danger posed by any future shortages.
</P>
<P>
   H.S. Dillon, an agricultural economist, said Wahid may grant new
subsidies to rice farmers. If so, he could clash with the IMF,
which has pushed Jakarta to eliminate subsidies and tariffs.
</P>
<P>
   Given Indonesia's perilous finances, Wahid will not be in a
position to hand out much. Under the IMF's program, Indonesia now
has a targeted budget deficit equal to 5.8 percent of its gross
domestic product. Economists warn that this number will swell as
the government spends tens of billions to bail out its debt-ridden
banks and corporations.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In March 1998, the government's total debt was $51 billion. The
World Bank estimates this will grow to $136 billion by the end of
this year, largely because of the cost of the bank bailouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be their biggest headache,'' said Mari
Pangestu, an economist at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies in Jakarta. ``They've got to reduce
expenditures, including some sensitive ones, like fuel subsidies.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time Indonesia cut fuel subsidies, in May 1998, it
ignited fierce riots that forced the resignation of Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   Rebuilding the banks is the nut that Wahid must crack,
economists said, if he is to restore the economy. The government
has made some progress _ closing 66 private banks, taking over 12,
and recapitalizing eight. But the state-owned banks remain a mess,
with most hopelessly insolvent.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia has been distracted in its efforts by the political
tumult and the banking scandal, which involves one of the nation's
leading private banks, Bank Bali, and the state agency that is
responsible for taking over troubled banks.
</P>
<P>
   The longer Jakarta dithers, the more the clean-up will cost.
Earlier this year, the government estimated the cost at 300
trillion rupiah, or $43 billion. Now, economists say, it is closer
to 500 trillion rupiah, or $72 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Such numbers can seem insurmountable, even to the most
optimistic of government officials. After all, Indonesia had a
total gross domestic product of only $96.8 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there has been remarkably little doomsaying in Jakarta this
week. That is because the elections of Wahid and Megawati produced
something more precious than gold in Indonesia: a sense of
stability.
</P>
<P>
   Stability is crucial to Indonesia both at home and abroad. At
home, it will reassure domestic business people, not least the
ethnic Chinese entrepreneurs who spirited billions of dollars out
of the country after anti-Chinese riots last year. Abroad, it will
lure foreign investors back to the country.
</P>
<P>
   It was two years ago this month that Suharto appealed to the IMF
to rescue Indonesia's hemorrhaging economy. Indonesians hope that
Suharto's humbling plea and Wahid's proud ascension will come to be
seen as bookends in their country's turbulent journey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's hope they select a team that can manage the economy,''
Ms. Pangestu said. ``But let's start with law and order _ and peace
on the streets.''

   ``A Little More About Me''
</P>
<P>
   By Pam Houston
</P>
<P>
   Personal essays
</P>
<P>
   Norton, $23.95
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   I have nothing in common with Pam Houston, the Arctic musher; or
Pam Houston, the Salmon River rafter; or Pam Houston, the Himalayan
trekker. But Pam Houston, the person? We are kindred spirits.
</P>
<P>
   I came to this conclusion five years ago while reading Houston's
first book of short stories, ``Cowboys Are My Weakness,'' which
describes in raw, wrenching and hilarious detail several women's
unsuccessful romantic interludes with a series of hard-lovin',
range-rovin', noncommittal types. At the time, I was living in
Chicago and dating a vegetarian MBA student who had ridden a horse
twice in his life. Yet I still felt an abiding connection with
Houston's words. Yes, even then.
</P>
<P>
   The same thing happened with ``Waltzing the Cat,'' her second
book of short stories, and it's deja vu all over again with this
next installment, a collection of deeply personal essays titled,
``A Little More About Me.'' This time, Houston does away with the
thin veil that previously separated her fiction from her real life.
This time, she gives the reader herself _ imperfections,
insecurities and all.
</P>
<P>
   Houston wrote these essays over a difficult five-year period.
She divorced. She watched her best friend die of cancer. She buried
her mother. She started questioning her motivations and exploring
the childhood influences that shaped her adult self. ``The Long Way
to Safety,'' the introductory essay, not only sets a mood _
introspective, funny, unabashedly real _ it sets a theme.
</P>
<P>
   Houston is, foremost, the quintessential thrill-seeker _
something readers of her previous fiction might or might not have
picked up on. She's a daredevil skier and an whitewater rafting
addict, an Alaskan hunting guide and avid explorer of the
farthest-flung corners of the globe. These are the fascinating
adventures on which she takes her readers. ``I've never felt like
I'm on vacation,'' she writes, ``if there's not a little bit of
suffering involved.''
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic landscapes of the American West intoxicated Houston
as a young woman, and she has yet to glance back east (except for a
depressing stint in Ohio). Her love of the land is maternal in its
intensity, and she professes an insatiable need for flora, fauna,
mountain and river. Houston lives on a 120-acre Colorado ranch
along the Continental Divide and, she notes, is four hours from the
nearest health-food stores.
</P>
<P>
   But it's her penchant for pushing the envelope _ she's come
close to death on more than a couple of occasions _ that Houston,
in her mid-30s, begins to question. With each essay, she gives
readers a few more coordinates with which to map her inner
landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Little by little, we learn about her embittered mother, her
angry and impossible-to-please father, her habit of choosing men
whom she feels the need to impress, her irrationally competitive
side, her paralyzing insecurities about her body. These are the
facts that bring Pam Houston off the tundra and into our lives.
This stuff, we can relate to.
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of these essays lies in the interconnectedness of
Houston's physical conquests and emotional struggles. Her
adventures become metaphors: A near-fatal hunting expedition in
Alaska gives her strength to end a bad relationship. A brutal
midwinter camping trip with a new boyfriend is, in the end, ``a
great big love test'' for the guy. A failed attempt at scaling the
biggest Grand Teton becomes a lesson in priorities.
</P>
<P>
   But the most affecting essays find Houston nowhere more exotic
than strolling down a San Francisco beach, lying on a doctor's
examination table or sitting on her front porch. These pieces make
up a section called ``One Long Look in the Mirror,'' and they probe
deepest into Houston's soul.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in a house that was filled with anger and
bitterness, so much rage that I was afraid nearly all of the
time,'' she writes in ``Pregnancy and Other Natural Disasters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The violence in my house was bred of resentment: my mother's
resentment over sacrificing a promising acting career to get
pregnant, my father's resentment over many things, including giving
up his most-eligible-bachelor status to marry my mom. If we believe
the theory _ and I do _ that we repeat our childhood traumas over
and over as adults until we get them worked out, that is at least
one explanation for why I keep finding myself in the middle of all
those tornadoes and hypothermic 3:00 a.m.s and all those near
misses with grizzly bears. It also explains why I was so afraid to
give them up.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston's prose is clear and straightforward. She's less likely
to pen a sublime turn of phrase than to allow the power of her
words to build up over the course of several rhythmic sentences.
Her insights almost sneak up on you.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is only one story of our lives,'' Houston writes, ``and
we tell it over and over again, in a thousand different guises,
whether we know it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, Pam, bring it on. I'm ready for a lot more about you.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The dean of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine has
overruled a vote by a group of prominent American writers to honor
Ezra Pound with a place in the Poets' Corner of the cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   The Very Rev. Harry S. Pritchett Jr. said in a letter to the
writers last week that the cathedral could not commemorate Pound
because of his anti-Semitic writings and broadcasts from Fascist
Italy during World War II and the lingering pain they have caused
members of the cathedral's congregation.
</P>
<P>
   The dean's decision is but another chapter in a dispute that has
shadowed Pound's reputation for more than 50 years. Can the work of
Pound, who is arguably the greatest American poet of the 20th
century, be judged separately from his political stands and moral
life?
</P>
<P>
   The Poets' Corner electors had voted to honor Pound and F. Scott
Fitzgerald, and Pritchett said in an interview that he intended at
first to accept the nominations. But when some members of the
cathedral's congregation learned of the nomination, they signed a
letter of protest and threatened to demonstrate if the Poets'
Corner went ahead with plans to install a carved stone to
commemorate Pound.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter the dean said he had ``struggled deeply'' over the
decision but had concluded that because of Pound's ``destructive
prejudices and anti-Semitism'' and the hurt that still lingers from
them, he could not agree to honor him.
</P>
<P>
   The Poets' Corner, in keeping with the Episcopal Cathedral's
tradition as a spiritual center for the arts, is modeled after the
appearance of the Poets' Corner in Westminster Abbey. It was
founded in 1984 to celebrate American writers.
</P>
<P>
   Carved flat stones of about 2 by 3 feet are laid side by side to
commemorate 33 writers in the corner, which is on the north side of
the cathedral's nave. They include Edgar Allan Poe, Walt Whitman,
Emily Dickinson, T.S. Eliot, William Carlos Williams and William
Faulkner.
</P>
<P>
   The electors who chose Pound and Fitzgerald were led by Daniel
Hoffman, a former poetry consultant at the Library of Congress and
the cathedral's poet in residence. The panel has 13 established
writers and poets, including John Updike and Robert Pinsky. Pound's
nomination was supported by a majority of the votes but fewer than
Fitzgerald's.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the electors defended their votes for Pound, voicing
repulsion with his political activity but citing him as a seminal
poet, but others could not be reached.
</P>
<P>
   One member, the poet Donald Hall, said Friday: ``I nominated
Pound and I know the horrendous things that Pound did, and I also
know that he was a great American poet not only in his own work,
but a great facilitator of the work of other American poets, from
Robert Frost to T.S. Eliot to James Joyce, who was another
beneficiary of his generosity. I admire him and I suggested him for
his poetry, but there were so many generous things in his career
before he became a megalomaniac and paranoiac. I think that the
malice of his madness is not relevant to his stature as a poet.''
</P>
<P>
   In broadcasts from Italy from January 1941 to July 1943, Pound
blamed Jews and other groups for the world's economic problems. He
was indicted for treason in 1943 and was arrested by American
forces and imprisoned in 1945 in a special cage at an Army
installation near Pisa. Later that year he was judged mentally
unfit to stand trial and was confined to St. Elizabeths Hospital, a
mental institution in Washington. In 1958 he was released through
the intervention of Frost, Eliot and other major poets.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967 the poet Allen Ginsberg visited Pound in Italy, and
Pound offered what some took to be an apology for what Pound called
his ``stupid suburban prejudice.''
</P>
<P>
   To Marsha Ra, a warden of the cathedral's congregation and a
leader of the protest against honoring Pound, the statement was not
enough. Pound is ``not representative of Christian values,'' Ms. Ra
said in an interview. ``He was giving anti-Semitic radio broadcasts
while my relatives were being gassed.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ra, who was born a Jew and converted to Christianity, said
she had lost 15 cousins in the Holocaust. ``The belief in art for
art's sake is neither Christian nor Jewish,'' she said. ``We are
not a temple to the Muses.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ra, a librarian, circulated a petition in the congregation
that was signed by a 100 members and forwarded to Pritchett.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman, the cathedral's poet in residence, called Pound's
anti-Semitic statements ``vituperative and incoherent,'' but said,
``We had hoped the general public by now would agree with the
electors and would celebrate the heroic achievements of his work as
distinguished from the prejudicial opinions and comments of his
crazy economic theory.''
</P>
<P>
   Others on the electors' panel were John Updike, Robert Pinsky,
Rita Dove, Dana Gioia, Rachel Hadas, Michael Harper, Carolyn Kizer,
Grace Schulman, William J. Smith, Molly Peacock and Henry Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman said that there was no formal debate about Pound before
the vote because his name had been put forward several times in the
past. ``The votes were cast after long reflection by each of the
electors who voted for Pound,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said, ``I believe that the dean is within his rights. I
clearly nominated him knowing that some or many people would
object. But if the literature is the criteria he belongs there, and
in fact his absence is utterly ludicrous.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The question of Pound's moral guilt and the shadow it casts over
his poetry continues to preoccupy Pound scholars, said Tim Redman,
author of ``Ezra Pound and Italian Fascism,'' published by
Cambridge University Press. Redman, who is working on a new
biography of Pound, said that without doubt Pound was deeply
anti-Semitic, ``and he contributed to a climate of opinion that
enabled the Holocaust to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Redman said he believed that Pound was fully aware of the moral
weight of his actions. ``It is interesting that the anti-Semitism
does not enter Pound's poetry,'' he said. ``He knew that it was
morally wrong. The most important thing to Pound was to be known as
the great poet. He would not contaminate that which he held dearest
with this.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Pound's daughter, Mary de Rachewiltz, whose mother was Pound's
companion, Olga Rudge, said in a telephone interview from northern
Italy, where she lives, that her father's anti-Semitic utterances
had always been misunderstood. ``He tried to stop the war,'' she
said. ``He tried to keep America out of European embroilment, to
follow the line of John Adams and Jefferson and people who had
worked for peace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We all say things when we are angered and misunderstood and
teased into something,'' Ms. de Rachewiltz said. She said that she
was disappointed with the reversal and had planned to attend the
ceremony. ``I thought it was time to be magnanimous,'' Ms. de
Rachewiltz said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Pritchett said his decision presented him with ``an incredible
ethical dilemma that reaches beyond this incident.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, it has to do with the relationship between art and
the artist's own ethics and the broader community,'' he said. ``It
is a question of developing an esthetic theology.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUM, Iran _ Much about Ayatollah Sadegh Khalkhali these days _
his simple white smock, his bare feet, his shuffling gait, his
concern for his visitors' well-being _ speaks of an almost
penitential gentleness. Long gone are his days as the chief judge
of Iran's revolutionary courts, when his name was enough to strike
terror, his word sufficient to set execution squads to work with
their gallows, their shootings and their stonings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drink your tea, it will get cold, it won't be good for you''
Khalkhali said, several times, to a visitor who dropped in
unannounced at his home here in the holy city of Shiite Muslims. It
is a two-hour drive across the desert from Tehran. Once, he
hastened away to fetch his wife, saying she could speak German,
then returned apologetically to say she felt unwell. Later, he
bobbed up to fetch copies of his books on Islamic theology, signing
several as mementos.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, Khalkhali was the Islamic revolution's
Robespierre, the grim avenger who condemned hundreds and possibly
thousands of men and women to death, some after trials that lasted
only five minutes, or after no trials at all. He made his grim mark
on the American consciousness in April 1980, when, bushy-bearded,
in cleric's robes and turban, he was reported to have poked at the
charred bodies of American commandos killed in the failed attempt
to rescue hostages from the U.S. embassy.
</P>
<P>
   In this nation of 60 million, struggling now to emerge from the
shadows of the Islamic revolution and build a more magnanimous
society, the mere mention of Khalkhali makes people uneasy, as
though summoning his memory alone might set the tumbrels rolling
again. Even the Iranian government, caught between a reform faction
that wants more democracy and a rearguard of clerical hardliners
that wants the clock to remain stopped at 1979, behaves as if it
would rather have Khalkhali forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   For Khalkhali, 73, it is a double bind. Conservatives who want
nothing to disturb the power of the ruling clerics regard him as a
liability now better discarded. But he is an embarrassment, too, to
reformers, since he has announced his support for those favoring
more democracy, tolerance and respect for law. Caught between the
two views, in a sort of no-man's land, watched around-the-clock by
a police guard that doubles as a cordon to try and keep visitors
away, sits Khalkhali.
</P>
<P>
   It is a life far removed from the days of blood and revolution.
His house is modest and sparsely furnished, and its garden wall
scribbled with graffiti, not for the revolution but for the local
soccer club. Khalkhali said that he was in demand as a teacher of
Islamic law at the theological colleges that are clustered in Qum,
but a room stacked to the ceiling with copies of books he has
written suggested otherwise. When other leading ayatollahs in the
city were asked where he lived, several professed not to know.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, his conversion to the reform cause is less
astonishing than it seems. The overwhelming popularity of the
reformers, and of the 53-year-old cleric who is their
standard-bearer, President Mohammed Khatami, has caused a wave of
surprising political conversions, even if few are as striking as
Khalkhali's. Those urging more accountable government include
former student leaders who seized the American embassy, as well as
other high-ranking clerics who only a few years ago were counted as
zealots of Islamic rule.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, a two-hour conversation suggested that Khalkhali is
not so much a new man as the old one with a reformed sense of what
is politically correct. Along with his elaborate courtesies, he
conveyed the old revolutionary's sense of a world filled with
enemies and plots.
</P>
<P>
   He was with Khatami ``100 per cent, more or less,'' he said, but
not with the ``troublemakers'' who attached themselves to the
reform cause. ``There are always troublemakers, everywhere,'' he
said. ``Our enemies in the western world would like nothing better
than for us to fall into chaos, but it won't happen, I can assure
you.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When the talk turned to the American rescue raid, he said he
wanted a message passed to former President Carter, who ordered the
raid in April 1980 in a bid to free 56 embassy hostages held in
Tehran since the previous November, only to have the mission
collapse when an American helicopter and a C-130 transport collided
while re-fueling in the Iranian desert. Carter excoriated Khalkhali
after news reports described the Iranian cleric as having poked the
bodies of eight American servicemen killed in the raid, and having
held up one of the skulls.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Iran's paramount
leader, had sent him to the crash site at Tabas, in the desert 500
miles southeast of Tehran, with instructions to see that the
Americans' bodies were properly looked after. What the reporters
had seen, he said, was not him poking or cutting the bodies, but
using a penknife to cut the knots on the Americans' death shrouds,
which were dirty and made of plastic, so that they could be
replaced with the clean white muslin shrouds prescribed by Islam.
</P>
<P>
   ``How crazy can a man be, saying I was cutting up bodies,
calling me a monster?'' he said, referring to Carter. ``The truth
is, I felt sorry for the Americans, especially those who were
black, because Ayatollah Khomeini had told me to treat them with
dignity. My attitude was, when they came here to kill us, they were
our enemies, but after they died their care was entrusted to us by
God. It was God who saved us, because it was He who sent the
sandstorm that caused the American helicopters to have problems,
even before the crash.''
</P>
<P>
   When the talk turned to the executions, Khalkhali became
animated again, gripping the arms of his chair and saying that
there was nothing _ ``absolutely nothing!'' _ to regret. Contrary
to Western reports, he said, he had only directly ordered the
execution of ``100 or so'' people, leaving others to be sentenced
by judges under his command. In any case, he said, moving to a
bookcase to pull down a copy of the decree by Khomeini appointing
him to head the revolutionary courts, ``Everything I did, I did
under the holy authority of the Imam. I did only what he wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Accounts from the period describe Khalkhali as the ultimate
hanging judge, roaming Iran in pursuit of new victims, presiding
over secret trials that ended with the execution of hundreds of
officials and military officers who had served Shah Mohammad Reza
Pahlavi, Iran's ousted ruler, even eating ice-cream outside a
prison where executions had taken place. Later, as head of a
special anti-narcotics task force known as the ``hit squad,'' he
condemned still more people. Other victims included scores of Kurd
tribesmen who were caught up in rebellions in Iran's
Kurdish-majority regions.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he proved too harsh even for Khomeini. In December
1980, after a bloodbath that lasted nearly two years, Khomeini
bowed to the demands of more moderate elements in the new
government who had protested the widespread use of torture and
execution in the anti-narcotics drive, and dismissed Khalkhali. But
by then, his actions had helped to mold an image of the Islamic
takeover as unremittingly vengeful and violent.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if it were true that he had said he would execute all of
his victims a second time if they were ``to walk the earth again,''
he replied, ``Well, they're not going to walk the earth again, are
they? But if they did, the answer is yes, yes, absolutely, I'd
execute them again, especially Hoveyda; he sold Iran to America.''
The reference was to Amir Abbas Hoveyda, prime minister in the
shah's government for 12 years until 1977. Hoveyda was credited
with policies that brought wider prosperity and educational
opportunity to Iran, as well as a close military and political
alliance with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Hoveyda was executed by firing squad in April 1979, after
Khalkhali dismissed his pleas at a cursory trial. One common
account in Tehran is that Hoveyda was awaiting appeal of his
sentence when he was called away from writing a defense document
and summarily shot.
</P>
<P>
   When some in the revolutionary government challenged his
methods, Khalkhali asked whether they had in mind Western or
Islamic legal principles, and added: ``Under Western principles,
criminals have top lawyers and other matters to escape the law.
Yes, it's true, I never paid attention to these principles.''
</P>
<P>
   After years of reflection in Qum, Khalkhali said that he was
more sure than ever that his methods were correct. ``Remember, it
was a revolution, and there was no time for reflection,'' he said.
``If we hadn't executed them, they would have executed us the next
day. In any case, didn't you Westerners hold a trial at Nuremberg,
and execute the Nazis? I don't see the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   In afterthought, he added: ``When I stand before God, I have
complete confidence that I will be judged favorably for what I have
done. There will be no questions about the executions, not a single
one.''

   Apple dropped the tutti-frutti bomb a year ago when iMac
computers were deployed encased in transparent skins of blueberry,
strawberry, grape, tangerine and lime.
</P>
<P>
   Instantly, the world changed.
</P>
<P>
   The fallout from the sale of over 2 million colorful iMacs
realigned target customers, diverted the product design palette to
preschool color preferences, and in a bold confrontation with the
changing millennium, cloaked spiritual issues in a colorful shroud
of commercial exploitation.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like a lot to pin on the chromatic difference between tan
and tangerine, but there it is.
</P>
<P>
   The happy color bomb, designed in Northern California Apple
labs, targets the most desirable customer _ the trend-setting
generations younger than the baby boomers, known variously as Gen
X, Gen Y and the echo boomers. They cruise the various highways in
apple-green Volkswagens, work on blueberry iMacs and use
angora-sweater-pink Nokia phones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The colors of the new iMacs represent the current demographics
of those who are buying computers _ innovators and young-minded
people who are open to the use of color,'' says Leatrice Eiseman,
author of ``Colors of Your Every Mood.'' These multihued folks are
easy to distinguish from the black-clad boomers driving silver
SUVs.
</P>
<P>
   Upon tutti-frutti detonation, the traditional high-tech color
signifiers of black-on-black and institutional beige became
obsolete. Any company that isn't currently changing its hues soon
will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to be competitive, the manufacturers of these things
have to think of other ways to make their products more
desirable,'' says Emily Davidow, chief executive of Home Cinema
Designs.
</P>
<P>
   Where style used to be dictated by German carmakers and Italian
fashion designers, control is now in the hands of Silicon Valley
geeks, and the choice of Gummi Bear colors is the dominant
influence on consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
   Within months of the fruit-hued debut, electronics and
communications devices were being wrapped in cellophane colors _
rainbow-colored phones from Nokia, cherry LifeSaver colored two-way
radios from Motorola. By August, school supplies were encased in
similar see-through Crayola-colored plastics, and Target stores
were displaying CD players and cameras in eye-candy colors.
</P>
<P>
   What does the trend toward bright colors say about society? For
one thing, it says we're happy. The positive appeal of bright
colors reflects a childlike sense of expectation and an optimistic
view of the new century. ``Optimism has to be expressed in bright
colors,'' Eiseman says.
</P>
<P>
   The Color Marketing Group, an association of 1,500 color
designers, noted in 1998 that expressions of optimism would be
playing a role in color choices at the big turn of the calendar. Of
the six influences that would shape the consumer color palette in
the new century, this was No. 3: ``Optimism and hopefulness are the
result of more interest in spiritualism. With the economy strong,
we are more comfortable expressing ourselves through intuition and
spiritual sides.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Designers are using color more than ever as the hope and
prosperity of the new millennium draws near,'' explains Lisa
Herbert, vice president of Pantone, a color research, development
and communication company.
</P>
<P>
   Pantone coordinates colors so that cerulean blue will be the
same blue for printers, painters and yarn dyers. Cerulean is on
Pantone's short list of ``the five most directional colors for
spring 2000.'' The others are hot coral (orange), opaline green,
primrose yellow and toast. It is no coincidence that three of their
choices are from the iMac color wheel.
</P>
<P>
   The two most popular colors chosen by the respondents in a color
preference study conducted by marketing consultants Roper Starch,
Worldwide and Pantone were blue (No. 1) and green (No. 2). A
bright, clear blue was the leading choice among trendsetting 18- to
19-year-old men and a light sky blue was popular among women.
</P>
<P>
   Purple (iMac grape) and red (iMac strawberry) are the third and
fourth most-popular colors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes as no surprise that Americans overwhelmingly chose
the color that best evokes a soothing, calming tranquillity in a
frantically fast, often insecure world,'' says Eiseman, who, as
well as being an author, is the executive director of the Pantone
Color Institute. ``It may seem a stretch to equate color and design
directions with our state of mind and body, but these trends have
always reflected society's concerns and interests, and surviving
stress is a key issue in today's world.''
</P>
<P>
   Bright orange was the respondents' least favorite color, but it
has the highest acceptance in the youth market, especially with
adolescents. When Apple introduced iBook, the Apple laptop, it was
offered in two colors: blueberry, the most popular color, and
tangerine, a color approved by preteens.
</P>
<P>
   Was apple's choice of these two hues, the ones most likely to
blanket the age spectrum, driven by demographic preferences?
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't comment on our color choices,'' says an Apple
spokesperson.
</P>
<P>
   Neither will the company admit to back-pedaling by including a
new color, ``graphite,'' in the latest iMac release. The
transparent black computer housing looks like a throwback to
Italian design. An Apple spokesperson is horrified at the
suggestion. ``We are not going backward.'' The graphite color is
even more transparent than the fruit group. ``It's completely
translucent; you see the workings of the machine.''
</P>
<P>
   And indeed, all this twiddling with transparency is on the
forward wave, say color forecasters. They predict optical effects
will be the next change _ metallics, opalescence and iridescence.
After that, they'll fiddle with degrees of transparency with optic
shifts, chameleon capabilities and finally, sheer transparency.
</P>
<P>
   The optics of water and its effect on colors will influence
color in the near future. Water is No. 4 on the Color Marketing
Group's list of 21st century influences:
</P>
<P>
   ``Water, cleansing and pure, is the physical symbol of our
themes of simplicity and spirituality,'' says the CMG. ``Water is
the final evolution of nature's influence on the world's color
palettes.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also the most recent inclusion on the iMac color wheel.

DEAL `IN THE WORKS' AS SIDES CLOSER ON OVERALL SPENDING BILL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ White House and congressional budget negotiators
said Friday they were close to agreeing on overall spending levels
for the Year 2000 budget, but the sides were still far apart on
funding priorities and how to pay for some increases wanted by both
Democrats and Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deal is in the works. We can get there. In terms of
spending we are ... really close. But it's policy differences that
are holding it up,'' said one Republican official close to the
talks.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the negotiators were searching for common ground at
a Capitol Hill meeting, Republican leaders were busy attacking
President Clinton as a big-spending liberal intent on paying for
his favored programs by raising taxes and raiding the Social
Security Trust Fund.
</P>
<P>
   At a rally held within earshot of where negotiators were
talking, House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, and other GOP
leaders charged that if Clinton and the Democrats get their way in
next year's budget, retirees will end up suffering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats continue to fight us all the way because they want
to increase spending. To all the Democrats who want to raise taxes
or raid Social Security to balance the budget, the Republican
Congress says no,'' DeLay said.
</P>
<P>
   The comments drew an angry response from Clinton and the
Democrats, who already have been stung by negative Republican
campaign ads being aired in key parts of the country that depict
Democrats as little more than criminals who want to pilfer Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican attacks, Clinton charged Friday, defy history.
Noting that Republican House leaders spoke publicly four years ago
about possibly phasing out the Social Security and Medicare
programs, Clinton said it was cynical of them to portray themselves
now as the guardians of Social Security who are trying to keep evil
Democrats from spending it.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Clinton said he was ``committed to turn the other
cheek'' until he sees if he can strike a deal with the GOP on
overall spending for next year. ``I guess it's easier when you're
not running for anything to do that,'' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   But White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart did not turn the
other cheek. Speaking to reporters, he accused DeLay of playing
politics with the budget in an attempt to enhance Republican
efforts in next year's elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``The open question is whether ... the strategy he has
articulated of bringing the Democrats to their knees is the
strategy of the Republican Party,'' Lockhart said. ``That is not a
strategy that's looking after the interests of the American people.
It is a strategy that is designed for maximum political advantage,
and in that environment, if that is the overall guiding principle
of the Republicans, this is going to be a long, tough battle.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans gave notice Friday of just how difficult the
budget battle could get. Despite a veto threat by Clinton, they
unveiled a plan to cut federal spending across-the-board by about
1.5 percent next year to help head off any borrowing from Social
Security money to underwrite next year's budget.
</P>
<P>
   They said the reduction would require government departments and
agencies to eliminate waste. Republican aides said that without the
reduction, the final GOP spending plans for next year could end up
tapping the Social Security Trust Fund for at least $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans have already passed 12 of the 13 appropriations
bills needed to fund government operations through the 2000 fiscal
year. They will likely pass the last and largest of those measures
_ a bill covering labor, health and education _ early next week.
Clinton has signed seven of the bills sent to him, but has
threatened to veto the rest unless Republicans agree to spend more
money on foreign aid and to hire teachers and police officers, and
unless they remove provisions he says could hurt the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has proposed paying for those programs by closing
corporate and foreign tax loopholes, raising cigarette taxes, and
penalizing polluters. But those ideas have been rejected by
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't raise taxes and we won't raid the Social Security
Trust Fund. End of story,'' said one Republican leadership aide.
``We're willing to negotiate all the details, but not the big
picture.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans, meanwhile, are pressing ahead with their plan
to pass all 13 appropriations bills before striking a deal on
overall spending with Clinton, even though the president has
already vetoed two bills and will likely veto at least three more
when they reach his desk.
</P>
<P>
   The appropriations bills contain accounting techniques to help
pay for increased spending that Republicans wanted. The accounting
measures include borrowing from the 2001 budget and declaring as
``emergencies'' some routine spending matters such as the 2000
Census.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order for us to say that we've done our work, we're going
to have to pass every appropriations bill (without) dipping into
the Social Security Trust Fund monies,'' said a GOP aide. ``But
right now we're about $5 billion over where we're supposed to be.
That's where the one percent across-the-board cut comes into
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders are planning to force a vote in the House
next week on their 1.5 percent cut of all government programs, with
the exception of Social Security, Medicare and welfare benefits.
Pay increases next year for lawmakers and federal workers, which
has already been signed into law by Clinton, also would not be
affected.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, however, contends that an across-the-board cut
would be too harsh for some agencies to absorb even though next
year's budget is expected to be 3-percent to 4-percent higher
overall than 1999 spending.

 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Almost two out of three companies in the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index have reported earnings that exceeded
analysts' expectations for the third quarter. So why is the index
itself up only 1.47 percent since the quarter ended?
</P>
<P>
   Fears that rising interest rates will cut corporate
profitability have contributed to the S&AMP;P's malaise in October. And
warnings that fourth-quarter earnings might disappoint are keeping
a lid on some stocks.
</P>
<P>
   But here's another theory for why great earnings are not
translating into ever higher stock prices today. Investors may be
realizing that positive earnings news is less an indication of a
company's financial health than it is evidence that the company is
good at playing the earnings management game.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterly earnings announcements have been a well-choreographed
waltz for some time. As investors relied more on short-term
earnings forecasts to help them value shares, astute executives
learned to manage expectations for their companies' performance
down to a level that they could then breeze past.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of how well companies have managed earnings can be seen
in the number of reports that beat Wall Street estimates by a
single penny a share. According to Thomson/First Call, of the 311
S&AMP;P companies that have reported earnings for the third quarter,
21.5 percent beat their estimates by one cent. In each of the last
six quarters, 18 percent of companies, on average, beat their
estimates by a penny.
</P>
<P>
   Paired with management in the earnings waltz were security
analysts who are supposed to conduct independent research on
companies they follow. As quarterly earnings numbers became
paramount, analysts grew more dependent upon company management for
``guidance'' to the correct earnings forecast. The more help they
received, the less work they did.
</P>
<P>
   This dance went smoothly for awhile. Companies met or beat the
analysts' estimates and their stocks went up.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, many companies who had been great at managing
earnings are caught in a vise of rising expectations: A company
that merely matches Wall Street's forecasts in a given quarter may
see its stock price tank on the news.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Crooks, a research analyst at Thomson/First Call, explained
it this way: For a company that has beaten Wall Street's forecast
by a penny a share over the last eight quarters, beating the number
by a penny soon becomes the equivalent of matching expectations. As
a result, he said: ``Now you have to beat by two pennies to get a
positive surprise.'' Managers have to run faster to stay in place.
</P>
<P>
   If they don't, they are taken to the woodshed. Louis V. Gerstner
Jr., chairman of IBM, had been a master of the earnings game until
last Thursday when he stunned investors with a 1 percent drop in
hardware sales in the third quarter and forecast weakness in coming
quarters. IBM shares fell 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the dark side of earnings management. After years of
watching executives achieve more than expected, investors punish
those that no longer can. With the market trading near its record
highs, there is less margin for error than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a penny a share is that critical to the value of the
company, then the stock is overvalued,'' said Robert A. Olstein,
manager of the Olstein Financial Alert fund. ``Investors are
starting to see the ridiculousness of the situation. It's starting
to unravel and that's why you're seeing these tremendous
corrections.''

THE QUIET HELP OF FAMILY MEMBERS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 24) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ind., Pa.)   (af)  
 By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. _ Linda K. Williams ticked off her expenses:
rent for the small, neatly furnished apartment that she shares with
her teen-age son, electricity, phone, groceries, medicine, life
insurance, occasional evenings out, new clothing, the bus commute
to work, the boy's allowance and lunch money.
</P>
<P>
   The expenses total nearly $19,000, but her take-home pay as a
secretary is only $15,700. How does she make ends meet? Gradually,
Ms. Williams explained how her sisters help, and also a boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   The boyfriend _ Ms. Williams is 43 and divorced _ shops with her
occasionally for food and clothes and bought her the delicate gold
chain that she wore during a recent interview at her apartment
here. But the four sisters are Ms. Williams' real safety net. Each
earns more than she does, and they often appear at her home with
food or detergent or some other household item they have bought for
her while shopping for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I let my finances get to me, I would be way down there, and
I am way up here,'' Ms. Williams said. ``If I lose my job, my
backup plan is my sisters. They are going to help me, I know
that.''
</P>
<P>
   So will government, of course, through unemployment insurance,
Medicaid, food stamps and other support payments. But help from
family and friends, particularly boyfriends in the case of single
mothers, is turning out to be a huge part of the social safety net
in an era when new jobs are constantly being created, most of them
at $10 an hour or less.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of Americans like Ms. Williams find themselves
struggling to make ends meet on family incomes below $20,000 a
year. Roughly 20 percent of the nation's 104 million families fall
into this category.
</P>
<P>
   Family help, in cash or in kind, is hardly new. It is routine
practice in immigrant communities, and it became a means of
survival during the Great Depression, when in-laws, elderly parents
and close friends often shared an apartment or home, contributing
what income they had to the household's upkeep.
</P>
<P>
   Until Social Security benefits began to increase annually just a
generation ago, it was common for grown children to support their
parents financially through old age. And among the wealthy, parents
still often provide the down payment for a married son or
daughter's first home in an upscale neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   But as the nation grew wealthier after World War II and the
self-supporting nuclear family became the ideal, and often the
norm, help from family declined somewhat, even among blue-collar
workers and others at the lower end of the income scale _ only to
rebound over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Sociologists have detected the widespread practice in recent
research, and it was evident in interviews with low-wage workers in
Middle American cities like Indianapolis, where incomes and living
costs closely match the national average.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think of resources being shared within a nuclear family or
a household,'' said Kathryn Edin, a University of Pennsylvania
sociologist. ``Our official statistics encourage that view. But
resources are shared more broadly in a social network, which helps
to explain why poor people are not flocking to homeless shelters or
to charity in greater numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might have a situation where your grandmother gives you
money, and you might not pay her back in cash,'' she continued.
``But you are expected to help her when she is sick, clean her
house or shop for her. Reciprocity is important.''
</P>
<P>
   The contributions of boyfriends or biological fathers, often not
living in the household, are also undercounted, Ms. Edin has found.
Her research, which has involved dozens of poor families in several
cities over the last six years, found that such men often provide
important if intermittent help in forms like cash gifts to a single
mother, clothing for the children, or name-brand sneakers for a
son.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you add up the formal and informal, you find that twice as
many families are receiving support as official statistics
suggest,'' Ms. Edin said.
</P>
<P>
   Parents and grandparents play big roles in the support network
for many low-income households, partly because much of their
working lives came before wage stagnation crippled the incomes of
low-skill workers and before the minimum wage lost so much ground
to inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Pinner, 35, a receptionist and clerk, is plagued by
break-ins and burglaries at the home she rents. She will soon move
with her two children to a home in a better neighborhood that her
father owns and that she will rent from him _ an improvement in
circumstances that she says she could not have managed on her
income of $15,500 a year without his help.
</P>
<P>
   Her father worked for 34 years on a Chevrolet assembly line and
has a union pension. ``He picks me up in the morning and drives me
to work,'' Ms. Pinner said. ``If we don't have anything to eat,
he'll help. Maybe once a month he pays for the shopping, and my
aunt gives me a few dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton Administration views family support as a valuable
supplement to government benefits like the earned income tax
credit, rent subsidies, training, Medicaid and the like. The
Republicans emphasize community support for the poor, charity being
one element and family help another.
</P>
<P>
   Missing from the policy mix of either party is strong
endorsement of higher wages. That would be achieved in part through
a greater increase in the current minimum wage of $5.15 an hour
than either Al Gore or Bill Bradley, the two contenders for the
democratic presidential nomination, have proposed so far.
</P>
<P>
   Neither proposal would exert the sort of upward pressure on the
wages of the poorest workers that the minimum exerted in its heyday
back in the 1960s. And a higher wage, after all, is the solution
favored by the working poor themselves.

THE SLUMBER IS OVER AS LA-Z-BOY EXPANDS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 24) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mich., N.C., Miss., Ohio)   (af)  
 By MICHELLE LEDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, La-Z-Boy Inc. had a somewhat sleepy image: a midsized
Midwestern company that was modestly well run and known for its
signature product _ a comfortable reclining chair. But a string of
acquisitions _ three announced this year _ have some investors
thinking there may be a lot of spring in this 72-year-old business,
which is based in Monroe, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 28, La-Z-Boy announced its biggest deal: a plan to
acquire Ladd Furniture, based in Greensboro, N.C., for $267.2
million, including debt of $101.5 million; the deal is expected to
be completed early next year.
</P>
<P>
   In March, La-Z-Boy announced that it would buy Bauhaus USA, a
furniture maker in Saltillo, Miss., for about $60 million; that
purchase closed in June. And in April it announced that it would
acquire Alexvale Furniture of Taylorsville, N.C., for undisclosed
terms. That deal is expected to close this year.
</P>
<P>
   After all the acquisitions are completed, La-Z-Boy will be the
largest publicly traded home furniture company, with sales of more
than $2 billion, just ahead of Furniture Brands International.
La-Z-Boy hit the $1 billion sales mark only two and one half years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The deals will broaden La-Z-Boy's product mix. Ladd has done
well in two markets where La-Z-Boy has had no presence: children's
furniture and furniture sold to hotels and other institutions. The
Bauhaus line of upscale contemporary furniture gives La-Z-Boy a
path into chains owned by Federated Department Stores and May
Department Stores, two big retailers with which La-Z-Boy has had
few dealings.
</P>
<P>
   ``La-Z-Boy has been very successful at making acquisitions and
going after niche markets, and they've been able to do that without
missing a beat in earnings growth,'' said Elliott L. Schlang,
managing director of the LJR Great Lakes Review, a research firm in
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   But the company has not neglected its core business. In April,
La-Z-Boy introduced the Oasis, a recliner that sells for about $999
and features in one armrest a cooler that can store a six-pack; its
sales are going well according to Gene M. Hardy, La-Z-Boy's
secretary and treasurer.
</P>
<P>
   La-Z-Boy shares closed at $17.9375 on Friday, down 27 percent
from a 52-week high of $24.5625 on July 1 and just 11.7 times
analysts' estimates for fiscal 2000 earnings. Schlang has a 52-week
target of $33 on the stock.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts attribute the lackluster stock price to concerns that
higher interest rates will slow new-home sales, thus dampening
furniture sales. Rivals have suffered too. Furniture Brands, which
closed at $17.75 on Friday, is down 34.9 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expect La-Z-Boy to post profits of 41 cents a share
when it reports fiscal second-quarter results on Nov. 3. That would
be up 17 percent from the quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
   For its first quarter, ended July 24, La-Z-Boy posted profit of
25 cents a share, nearly double the figure a year earlier and ahead
of analysts' expectations of 21 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Shelly Hale, an analyst at Bank of America Securities,
recommends La-Z-Boy stock and has a 52-week target of $29. One
worry is whether La-Z-Boy has the expertise to manage the various
brands. ``I have some concern that they are a bit disparate,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lance James, a longtime La-Z-Boy investor who runs the Babson
Enterprise II fund, sees the stock's low price-to-earnings ratio as
a buying opportunity. After the Ladd announcement, he raised his
La-Z-Boy stake to 3 percent of the fund's assets. And La-Z-Boy
itself has been buying back shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether you're a long-term investor or a value investor,''
James said, ``this is everything you're looking for.''

SWISS HAND OVER NAZI COLLABORATOR TO FRENCH POLICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By SUZANNE DALEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The manhunt for Maurice Papon, the 89-year-old Nazi
collaborator, ended swiftly when the Swiss police arrested him late
Thursday at a modest hotel in one of Europe's most exclusive ski
resorts, where he was hiding under a false name.
</P>
<P>
   As the officers were arresting Papon, who fled France rather
than begin his 10-year sentence for sending hundreds of Jews to
Nazi death camps, he began complaining of chest pains and was taken
by ambulance to the prison ward of a hospital in Bern.
</P>
<P>
   But late Friday the Swiss expelled him, saying they would not
harbor anyone convicted of crimes against humanity. He was handed
over to French police officers who were ready with a helicopter to
take him to a prison outside Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Papon was supposed to have reported to the prison on Wednesday.
Instead, he disappeared. In a defiant statement to the press, he
said he had chosen ``exile'' rather than spend his last days in
jail.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials said he had spent most of the last 10 days
living quietly in various small hotels in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Arrogant and combative, Papon has always refused to take any
blame for the roundup of Jews for deportation during World War II,
despite his signature on numerous transportation orders when he was
an official of the collaborationist Vichy government.
</P>
<P>
   In choosing to flee France, he said he was making an
``honorable'' choice, one made ``by some of the most noted men in
history.''
</P>
<P>
   But his efforts to disappear into Switzerland collapsed on
Thursday after a French appeals court upheld his conviction of last
year and the authorities were able to issue an international
warrant for his arrest at 7 p.m. that evening.
</P>
<P>
   Three hours later, Swiss police officials went to the Post Hotel
in the resort of Gstaad, tipped off to Papon's presence by the
French government.
</P>
<P>
   Hotel employees said police had asked to see the guest register
and spotted Papon's alias _ Robert Roche-Foucauld _ listed for Room
115. The name is familiar to French speakers through the widely
known maxims of the 17th-century author La Rochefoucauld and so was
likely to be noticed.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel manager, Ruedi Widner, said the officers were
concerned that Papon might try to commit suicide and asked how best
to get into the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided to call and tell him that there was a fax for him
and that we would be bringing it up,'' Widner said. When the
officers entered the room, he added, Papon looked stricken and
complained of chest pains but was later able to walk out of the
hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials said Papon was carrying about $6,000 in French,
Swiss and American money. He also had three passports, two with his
own name and one for Robert Roche-Foucauld. He also had various
driver's licenses with still other names, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Papon's dramatic efforts to escape punishment transfixed the
French. His trial, more than 45 years after the events took place,
forced the nation to relive a part of France's history that many
would rather have forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   More than 74,000 Jews were transported from France to Nazi death
camps, though until Papon was tried, no high-ranking official of
the Vichy government had been held accountable for aiding in their
deportation.
</P>
<P>
   Papon's ability to stay out of jail and then disappear even
after he was convicted was particularly shocking for his victims
and their families, many of whom questioned the government's
commitment to punishing the former collaborator, who after the war
rose in the ranks of the government to become budget minister.
</P>
<P>
   French officials tried to explain that Papon benefited from a
loophole in the law once the courts set him free during his trial
for health reasons. Once he was out of jail, there was no mechanism
to take away his passport until the appeals process began, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   But after suffering days of criticism on the subject, French
government officials were clearly relieved that Papon had been
apprehended quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, we were not impotent,'' said Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin. `'We acted swiftly. I'm naturally profoundly satisfied by
this. But I have to say I am not surprised.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Those who had tried for years to put Papon in jail also
expressed their relief. ``This thing has been going on now for 18
years,'' said Serge Klarsfeld, who did much of the research that
was used to convict Papon. ``There is an enormous satisfaction in
thinking that soon we will see it end.''
</P>
<P>
   Juliette Benzazon, 69, who lost her immediate family in a round
up ordered by Papon, said that now that he was in jail she could
finally mourn properly for her parents. ``I guess this means that
maybe in the end you do have to pay for what you do.''
</P>
<P>
   Swiss officials said that Papon remained calm once he was
arrested and slept in the ambulance most of the way between Gstaad
and Bern. Swiss officials said they found him in satisfactory
health.
</P>
<P>
   Papon apparently hoped that Switzerland would take him in
because it does not recognize crimes against humanity. But Swiss
officials, already subject to criticism that they did little to
return Jewish assets after the war, were quick to say they would
have nothing to do with such thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision is meant to signal that we do not want people
like him in Switzerland,'' Swiss Justice Minister Ruth Metzler said
Friday afternoon at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   During his trial, Papon was confronted with numerous examples of
his signature on deportation orders. But he steadfastly maintained
that he had worked to undermine German efforts and helped the
French resistance though no such evidence was ever presented.
</P>
<P>
   In making his appeal, lawyers planned to argue that Papon could
not defend himself properly because witnesses were dead. In
addition, they said he had been questioned about convoys of Jews
that were not part of the charges against him and cited other
violations of judicial procedure.
</P>
<P>
   However, Papon's appeal was automatically rejected on Thursday
because he failed to report to prison. Under French law, he was
required to report for at least one night before the appeals
process could begin.

BEHIND THE BANKING BILL, YEARS OF INTENSE LOBBYING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Conn., Texas, La., Iowa)  (With BANKS-CONGRESS and related stories.) 
(mk) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ed Yingling, the chief lobbyist for the American
Bankers Association, was weary Friday evening as he reflected on
the agreement to overhaul the nation's financial system and the
many years of lobbying behind it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know. I can't quantify it,'' he said. ``But if I had
to guess, I would say it's probably the most heavily lobbied, most
expensive issue'' to come before Congress in a generation.''
</P>
<P>
   That should not be surprising, given that banking deregulation
has been vigorously lobbied and debated for 20 years by three of
the nation's wealthiest industries: banking, insurance and
securities.
</P>
<P>
   During 1997 and 1998 alone, these three industries gave $58
million to federal political candidates, according to compilations
by the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research
group. They donated $87 million in soft money to the political
parties, and they reported spending $163 million in additional
lobbying expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Some other issues generate larger donations and expenses over
limited periods of time. Health care lobbyists on both sides of the
managed-care debate, for example, reported $230 million in lobbying
expenses in 1997 and 1998. But that issue has been lobbied for a
comparatively short time. So, over two decades of lobbying, the
insurance and financial services industries have certainly spent
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tremendous amount of money has been spent just because it
has gone on for such a long, long time,'' said Wright Andrews, a
longtime Washington lobbyist who over the years has represented
companies on several sides of the debate.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not every dollar donated by every bank and insurance
office was dedicated to this subject. But Gary Hughes, a senior
vice president with the American Council of Life Insurance, noted:
``The lion's share of our resources has been devoted to this. We
viewed this is as critical to the long-term viability of our
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Yingling of the bankers association added: ``The way we saw it,
if we didn't get this legislation we were going to disappear. This
was our top issue for a long, long time. The resources devoted to
it were huge, and we fought it tooth and nail.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, when former Rep. Charles Schumer, for example, was
running for the Senate from New York last year, he was probably
aware when he spoke with securities industry lobbyists about
deregulation that the industry had donated $1.28 million to his
campaigns over the previous five years _ even if not all those
donations were motivated by concern about this subject.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer was on the House Banking Committee and is now on the
Senate Banking Committee. He has long been regarded as the
securities industry's strongest ally. Of course, most brokerage and
financial services companies are based in New York City, parts of
which Schumer represented in the House. He received more money from
the securities industry in 1997 and 1998 than anyone else now in
the Senate, almost certainly because he was running for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., is regarded as one of the
strongest allies of the insurance industry. Hartford, Conn., is the
nation's insurance capital. Between 1993 and 1998, Dodd received
$325,124 from insurance companies _ not a great deal less than the
Republican chairman of the banking committee, Sen. Phil Gramm of
Texas, the man who determined whether banking bills ever came up
for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance industry gave Gramm $496,610. He also received
$760,404 from the securities industry and $407,956 from the banking
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The picture in the House is similar, though the numbers are
smaller because there are so many more representatives. Members of
the banking committee received large donations, and all three
industries were especially generous to members from New York. John
J. LaFalce, a Democrat from Buffalo, is the ranking minority member
of the banking committee and received $174,398 from the bankers in
1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Baker, R-La., who is also on the committee, received the
largest amount of money from bankers: $209,353.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, though, the lists show that Jim Leach, R-Iowa, who is
chairman of the House Banking Committee and has the power to bring
bills up for votes or bury them, received meager amounts from the
three industries in 1997 and 1998: $8,570 from the bankers, $10,483
from the securities industry and just $3,000 from the insurance
companies.
</P>
<P>
   An office spokesman explained: ``Mr. Leach doesn't take money
from PACs. He never has.'' Much of the industry money has been
donated to members of Congress through political action committees.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, according to another compilation by the Center
for Responsive Politics, the banking, securities and insurance
industries have donated $9.5 million to members of the Senate and
the House, through political action committees and individual
donations. These donations have broken down more or less as the
earlier donations did. Members of the banking committees got the
largest share.
</P>
<P>
   It has been an axiom for years that members of the banking
committees would be primary targets of lobbyists' persuasion _ and
donations. Some of the lobbyists said Friday that they wondered if
members of Congress would still covet assignments to the banking
committees.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, some lobbyists are wondering what they will do
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scores of us have been retained by many companies for so many
years,'' Andrews said. He started in the lobbying business 24 years
ago, ``and this has been the longest lobbying issue I have ever
been involved in. When this is over, there's going to be less work
around here for a while.''

SERBS PLAY DOWN POSSIBILITY OF CONFLICT WITH MONTENEGRO  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Yugoslav officials on Friday played down the possibility
of armed confrontation between Serbia and Montenegro, saying the
Montenegrins would themselves decide whether to remain within
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   A Yugoslav deputy prime minister said there was little chance
that Serbia would use force against its sister republic. Serbia and
Montenegro are the last two component republics of Yugoslavia, and
Montenegro has been moving slowly toward independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll never resolve the problems that exist between Montenegro
and Yugoslavia with force,'' the official, Tomislav Nikolic, a
member of the ultranationalist Radical Party, told a private
Serbian television station.
</P>
<P>
   President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia made similar
conciliatory comments 11 days ago in a major speech in the southern
Serbian city of Leskovac.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the people of Montenegro, may they decide their fate by
themselves without casting even the shred of a doubt on the
continuity of the Slav perception of goodness, the Montenegrin
feeling for chivalry and the European feeling for civilization,''
Milosevic said.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday, the president of Montenegro, Milo Djukanovic,
dismissed Milosevic's comments as manipulative and insincere.
Speaking in Prague at a new conference with President Vaclav Havel
of the Czech Republic, Djukanovic said: ``I'm afraid it's just
another attempt to manipulate the public. For Milosevic and
Yugoslavia, it's just another attempt to gain more time and to
prolong his days in power.''
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic, who broke with Milosevic two years ago, said it was
self-evident that the Montenegrins would decide their own fate. The
issues for him were ``democracy and decentralization,'' he said,
and whether they were possible for Montenegro in a Yugoslav
Federation run by the autocratic Milosevic. In 1992, Montenegro
chose to remain inside Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats believe that neither Milosevic nor Djukanovic
want a confrontation now, but they fear that the situation in
Montenegro is unstable and potentially explosive. Djukanovic has
spoken recently of creating a separate Montenegrin currency within
days of any formal Yugoslav devaluation of the dinar.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Milosevic's party spokesman, Ivica Dacic, said: ``The
Serbian people certainly will never be an obstacle for the
Montenegrins to have their own country.''
</P>
<P>
   But at least 40 percent of Montenegro's population of 650,000
people support Milosevic and his allies and are sharply opposed to
any break in ties with Serbia. Western diplomats believe that a
declaration of independence could provoke civil war in Montenegro,
with or without Milosevic's meddling.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav military has about 12,000 men stationed in
Montenegro, while Djukanovic has built up a militarized police
force that is roughly the same size.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 5, Djukanovic made proposals to Belgrade for a sharply
restructured Yugoslavia that would become a more equal
confederation, with Montenegro responsible for its own currency and
army. After a long silence from Belgrade, Milosevic proposed
party-to-party talks on the future scheduled to begin on Oct. 26.
</P>
<P>
   If the talks do not succeed, Djukanovic has spoken of a
referendum on independence, which his officials now say could take
place as soon as February.

 &HT;    Baptists criticized for Hindu brochure
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A Hindu from Kashmir, Subash Razdan says he's not
living in hopeless darkness _ no matter what the Southern Baptist
Convention insists.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the nation's largest protestant group will publish
its latest ``prayer guide,'' offered as a reference for Southern
Baptists. From it, members can learn the shortcomings of Hinduism
then pray for its adherents.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are they trying to do, start a Holy War?'' asked Razdan.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta resident chairs the board of trustees for the
National Federation of India-American Associations, representing
nearly 300 groups and 1.3 million Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Razdan leafed through the 16-page booklet in disbelief Friday.
It's similar to earlier Baptist publications that recommended
prayer for Jews and Muslims. Coming this spring: a prayer guide for
Buddhists. ``You can make Christianity look good, but don't make
any other religion look bad,'' Razdan said.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly outlandish to Razdan and others is the Baptist
claim that ``Hindus do not have a concept of sin or of personal
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's patently false,'' said Paul Courtright, an expert on
Hinduism and director of Asian Studies at Emory University.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a sense,'' Courtright said, ``it's equal opportunity
misrepresentation of all forms of non-Christian traditions. I
suppose they'll probably go after Catholics next. I find it
loathsome.''
</P>
<P>
   The pocket-sized guides _ available from the Southern Baptist
Convention's International Mission Board in Richmond, Va. _
coincide with Divali, the major Hindu festival of lights.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was planned,'' said Wendy Norvelle, spokeswoman for the
International Mission Board. ``It's an optimum time to seek things
of spiritual truth.''
</P>
<P>
   The booklets ``incorporate our interpretation of what they
believe,'' Norvelle said. ``It's read through the light of what we
believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Louis Moore, who edited the Hindu prayer guide, said earlier
booklets were unfairly represented as evangelical conversion
manuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not encouraging people to go out on the streets and
buttonhole every Hindu they see,'' Moore said. ``But it would be
wonderful if the opportunity arises.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how many Christian conversions resulted from previous
guides, Moore said, ``No records are being kept. The records are in
heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   The missionary movement in India began in the early 1800s,
Courtright said. One effort was to convert Hindus to Christianity,
the other was to provide social services. What lingers is a fuzzy
understanding of the religion, say critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The representation of Hinduism as steeped in idolatry,
superstition and strangeness is one of the enduring themes of
Western perception of India,'' Courtright said.
</P>
<P>
   The Baptist brochure portrays Divali in a mystical darkness and
suggests Christian prayer for the faithful so ``that the power of
Satan will be broken.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's baloney,'' Razdan said. ``Hindus have the reincarnation
of seven lives. That's based on how good your deeds are in the
past. ... All religions talk about the same love.''

INVESTING WITH JAMES B. RUBIN: RESURGENCE ASSET MANAGEMENT 
</HEADLINE>

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 24)  
 (af)  
 By HILARY ROSENBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it comes to James B. Rubin's line of work, it's fine to be
a control freak. As chief investment officer and co-chairman of
Resurgence Asset Management, a $1 billion manager of hedge funds
and other investments in White Plains, N.Y., Rubin often strives to
influence the fates of companies in which he has invested.
</P>
<P>
   And these are not just any companies. As a so-called vulture
investor, Rubin, 45, specializes in distressed companies that are
likely to go bankrupt. In 10 years, he has found that the more say
he has in how a company is reorganized _ that is, how the creditors
are paid under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code _
the greater the returns for the funds he manages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hate buying things that are popular,'' Rubin said. ``We'd
rather look at things that nobody is looking at and, in fact, that
everybody hates. The more complicated, messy and involved, the
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider his $250 million Re/Enterprise funds. Since their start
in August 1989, the offshore and domestic versions of this hedge
fund have returned 25 percent before fees, annualized, through
Sept. 30. After fees, that number is 20 percent. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index returned 16.6 percent, annualized, over the
same period.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1997, Rubin started the $500 million Resurgence funds,
which function basically as private equity pools. They tend to
invest in companies requiring longer holding periods than other
investments.
</P>
<P>
   Although they hold 40 percent in cash, the funds, through Sept.
30, have returned 50 percent, annualized, since their inception,
after fees, on their investments that have been completed and sold.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin got his start in the business in 1982, when his employer
at the time, the Atlantic Metal Hose Co., an industrial pipe maker,
filed for Chapter 11. As a vice president, he stayed on after the
company was bought and renamed Atlantic Johnson, but it was
liquidated in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   After working with R.D. Smith &AMP; Co., a brokerage firm
specializing in distressed companies, he teamed with M.D. Sass
Investors Services, a diversified investment firm, to start the
hedge funds in 1989. M.D. Sass markets the funds, and its chairman,
Martin D. Sass, is co-chairman of Resurgence.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin makes two kinds of investments. One is ``control
positions,'' in which he owns a large chunk of a company's bonds or
other debt and then takes an active role in the company's
reorganization. He generally holds his stakes for several years
before selling them.
</P>
<P>
   In Rubin's ``core strategic positions,'' which are smaller and
shorter term, he is usually a passive investor.
</P>
<P>
   Resurgence holds stakes in 15 companies; six are control
positions. Re/Enterprise holds stakes in 20 companies; eight are
control positions.
</P>
<P>
   In evaluating a company's finances, Rubin's staff creates a
spreadsheet to estimate long-term returns. The firm's typical goal
for each investment is a 50 percent annual rate of return before
fees, he said, but it is willing to accept annualized gains as
little as 25 percent, if the risks are fairly low.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin's analytical process is rigorous. First, Resurgence
evaluates the asset values of a company, piece by piece, to
determine what it is worth as a continuing business and what it
would be worth if it were closed and sold off piecemeal.
</P>
<P>
   The staff reads through bond indentures, and Rubin tries to
decide how best to reorganize the company out of bankruptcy _ for
example, whether it should have any debt at all and, if so, how
much.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like going into a situation that gives every appearance of
being a train wreck, disassembling it, analyzing every microbe and
then putting it back together like it's a puzzle and seeing if, in
doing so, we can create value,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In January 1992, Rubin started acquiring what would be a
controlling position in the secured bank debt of the Seaman
Furniture Co., a retailer based in Woodbury, N.Y., that had
recently declared bankruptcy. In the October reorganization, the
bank creditors he led acquired a controlling equity stake in the
company in exchange for its debt. Rubin then led the effort to
rebuild the business, hiring new management.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of 1997, Rubin, along with Carl Marks &AMP; Co. and the
T. Rowe Price Recovery fund, took the company private in a
leveraged buyout, paying $25 a share _ up from about $4 at the time
of the reorganization. They have now paid back most of the debt
they took on. And management has improved operations, in part by
introducing a more focused merchandising strategy. It also more
than doubled the number of stores in the chain, to 47. The funds
have earned annualized returns just shy of 40 percent in the seven
and a half years they have been involved in Seaman.
</P>
<P>
   The story may not be over yet. Rubin's funds are the largest
creditors of Levitz Furniture, a retailer in Boca Raton, Fla., that
entered bankruptcy in September 1997. ``There's the possibility of
putting the two companies together,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But as a vulture investor, Rubin doesn't always build things.
After the Caldor Corp., the discount department store chain, filed
for bankruptcy in September 1995, Rubin decided not to buy the bank
debt, then selling at 90 cents on the dollar. But he continued his
research. To determine the value of the retailer's leases on its
145 stores, his group spoke with dozens of local real estate
brokers. He and his analysts then estimated that the value of
Caldor's stores _ about $150 million _ was more than double the
company's or bank's estimates, Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in the spring of 1998, he bought bank debt at an
average price of 58 cents on the dollar. By late summer, Rubin's
funds owned two-thirds of the debt and Robert T. Symington, a
senior vice president at Resurgence, was heading the bank
creditors' steering committee. In that position, Symington
pressured Caldor to allow the banks to see the actual store leases,
which proved to be twice as valuable as his estimate, Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   The bank committee convinced Caldor management to liquidate
rather than reorganize, a process that is now nearly complete.
Returns to Rubin's funds have been more than 100 percent,
annualized.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Rubin invested in Arch Communications Group, a paging
company based in Westborough, Mass. In May, he bought the bonds of
the Mobilemedia Corp., a bankrupt company in Fort Lee, N.J., that
Arch was about to buy. As part of the merger, which was completed
in June, his funds received rights to buy Arch stock, which they
exercised, and their Mobilemedia bonds were swapped for more Arch
shares. Resurgence now holds 19 percent of Arch stock.
</P>
<P>
   The firm's picks aren't always winners. In the early and
mid-1990s, it was forced to sell its positions in the Cadillac
Fairview Corp. and Envirodyne Industries when their reorganizations
did not work in Rubin's favor.

CANADA LEADS THE WAY WITH PRIVATIZED AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ An air traffic controller in the gleaming new tower
here tapped the tip of his rubber eraser at different spots on the
touch screen as if he were playing a xylophone, each touch making
data instantly pop into view, and read off arcane instructions for
a waiting Aeroflot plane. ``Atis is Golf,'' the controller,
Christopher P. Cole, said, touching one box on the screen, which
suddenly showed the letter ``G.'' ``S.I.D. Bulls,'' he said,
touching another, which filled with a ``B.''
</P>
<P>
   Barking acronyms into the microphone is standard procedure in
control towers. But entering crucial information by touch-screen
computer instead of using color-coded ballpoint pens on paper
strips is unique to this tower, and part of a bold new experiment
in air traffic control that is drawing increasing interest from the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The interest _ from officials at U.S. airlines, the American
controllers' union and the Federal Aviation Administration, among
others _ is not so much in the specific technology. It is mostly in
Cole's new employer, Nav Canada, the only private company in the
world to run a national air traffic control system, and in the new
techniques the company is using to bring computers and software
into service.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has repeatedly tried to tinker with
the structure of the FAA, and three years ago freed the agency from
many federal constraints on personnel and procurement policy. Last
year, the administration proposed making the FAA a
``performance-based organization'' like the Patent and Trademark
Office, which sets its own fees and controls its revenues, but
Congress did not agree. Members of Congress enjoy their leverage
over the FAA, bringing home bacon to their constituents in the form
of instrument landing systems, new runways and the like.
</P>
<P>
   Many critics say that as Congress has organized it, the agency
cannot cope with air traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Canada, by contrast, got radical. In 1996, Transport Canada, the
government agency that had run the air traffic system for decades,
sold it to a nonprofit company created by Parliament whose
directors represent airlines, general aviation, unionized workers
and the public.
</P>
<P>
   Most constituencies think the new arrangement is going well,
though controllers are having some second thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   When the idea was introduced, controllers, who had endured a
wage freeze for years, were eager to become employees of a private
company. Airlines, upset at delays and at the government's use of
taxes collected on air fares for nonaviation purposes, were also
ready for change. Transport Canada was running late and over budget
on its huge modernization project _ the Canadian Automated Air
Traffic System, or Caats _ which threatened to collapse, as a
similar system did in the United States in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good move,'' said J. Clifford Mackay, president and
chief executive of the Air Transport Association of Canada, the
airline trade group.
</P>
<P>
   The system is paid for by fees charged to planes, based mostly
on weight and distance flown. Rates have gone down because Nav
Canada cut the payroll to 5,200 people from 6,300, mostly by laying
off administrative workers. Controllers agreed to work an extra two
hours a week and give more flexibility in shift scheduling; in
exchange they got big pay increases, ranging from 17 percent to
nearly 40 percent, keyed to the difficulty of their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines say delays have been reduced. Managers who were in
the system when it was run by Transport Canada say it is now safer
because regulation, still done by Transport Canada, is now
independent of operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need look no further than Canada to see the benefits of
privatized air traffic control,'' said Robert A. Crandall, the
retired chairman of American Airlines, in a recent speech on the
problems of the American system. A private agency, he said, has the
``built-in incentive to spend the capital necessary to stay ahead
of the technological curve.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been missteps, including an overestimation of the
efficiencies that privatization would allow; the number of
controllers in training was cut, inducing a shortage. Mackay said
the company has show great agility in reversing the process with an
aggressive training and recruitment program.
</P>
<P>
   The controllers' union, the Canadian Air Traffic Controllers
Association, says it is reserving judgment on Nav Canada.
Controllers are happy with the pay increases but say that
management has become tougher. The union's president, Fazal Bhimji,
said the number of grievances in arbitration had jumped to 80 this
year from 14 in 1998, adding that controllers had hoped for a more
collaborative system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty-four percent voted in favor of privatization, but if we
had the vote today, I'm not sure it would go through,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But even Bhimji is impressed with the new technology. While the
Canadian Automated Air Traffic System is still not finished,
completion appears close.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's problems with new technology have close parallels with
America's. Both countries have found that extensive delays in
bringing in new computers have left them stuck with radar display
screens that are too old to keep running.
</P>
<P>
   But Nav Canada appears to have pulled a technological rabbit out
of a hat, developing a software patch so it can use new screens
with the old mainframe computers. The job was done by just five
programmers, in 16 months, allowing use of a screen with color,
better resolution and new features. Similar projects in the United
States involve scores or even hundreds of programmers, with less
impressive results. In fact, a parallel American project developed
a system that could not handle high traffic levels.
</P>
<P>
   Nav Canada, which can hire quickly and pay competitively, did
the job in house, something the FAA cannot do. Managers at the
company say they ignored government contracting procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't tell me you have to write a document 300 pages long and
put it in the record before you can do something,'' said Sidney
Koslow, Nav Canada's vice president for engineering. Koslow, who
worked for years for an FAA contractor, said Nav Canada's ``just
get it done'' philosophy made much more sense than the FAA's
approach.
</P>
<P>
   That attitude is also helping to finish Caats, he said. The
government wanted not only to implement a modern air traffic
control system for Canada, but also to nurture a software industry
that could make products for export. Nav Canada left that aside.
</P>
<P>
   Extricating air traffic control from politics has had other
benefits. The company cut overhead partly by compressing six
regional offices into two and eliminating duplicate functions. That
would have made sense under the old regime too, said John W.
Crichton, the president and chief executive, but never would have
happened.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Garvey, the administrator of the FAA, said she had
extensive discussions with Crichton, Bhimji and others in Canada,
as well as with officials in other countries that have established
their air traffic systems as quasi-independent government agencies.
She expressed interest in the cost-accounting system that allows
Nav Canada to charge by flight. The FAA had tried to charge foreign
airlines for flights over the United States, but a court blocked
the charges last year, ruling that the agency had no basis for
setting them.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Garvey said that such a predictable revenue stream and the
ability to pay competitively, two hallmarks of the Canadian system,
would be useful in the United States.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Nav Canada has another advantage, she said: the ability to pay
competitively and thus fully staff its executive suite. (Top
officials at Nav Canada are paid triple what top Canadian
government bureaucrats get; with boom times for airlines in recent
years, the FAA has had numerous vacancies.)
</P>
<P>
   Except at the top, the new Canadian system is staffed mostly
with the people who ran the old one, mostly in the same jobs. But,
managers say, the atmosphere is different than it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``A dollar saved by the airline is now considered a dollar saved
by Nav Canada,'' said Joel J. Morin, manager of Nav Canada's Air
Traffic Simulation Center, adjacent to the Ottawa airport. The
company, he said, sought to run the system for the benefit of the
users, instead of for the convenience of the government.
</P>
<P>
   He showed off a new computer system that was replaying a day's
traffic at Dorval Airport in Montreal at 200 times normal speed.
</P>
<P>
   The system helped reorganize the whole country's air traffic
routes to reduce congestion and the need for controller
instructions to planes. It is now being used to estimate how much
shorter certain plane routes would be if Nav Canada added several
radars in the Arctic and opened routes over the pole to flights
bound for Asia. Nav Canada is thus a rare bird, seeking more
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Transport Canada, where he worked for years, would never have
bothered doing such an analysis, Morin said, because there was no
obvious benefit to the government. Nav Canada did so in a
characteristic way: it bought the software from an Australian
vendor, thus saving the cost of developing it.
</P>
<P>
   Cole, the controller in the Toronto tower, reflected on the
technological changes as he went through his routine. He was
dealing with layers of automation, to keep crowded runways and
radio frequencies from bogging down. One layer was Atis, the
Automated Terminal Information System, a recorded announcement of
runway availability and weather conditions; announcing ``Atis is
Golf'' meant that the seventh version of that recording, version
``G,'' was the most recent.
</P>
<P>
   Once, a controller would have read the announcement over and
over. Now he simply said on the radio that version ``Golf'' was
being used, and by touching the screen he could also communicate
that information digitally to the cockpits of properly equipped
planes.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, ``S.I.D. Bulls'' meant the Standard Instrument
Departure, the three-dimensional route the plane was to follow, was
the one marked ``bulls'' in the instruction book for the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, Cole scrawled the data out by hand, put the paper in
a plastic case and sent it on to the runway controller in what he
called a ``guided fling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's simply different, another way to do the job,'' said Cole,
who has been an air traffic controller for 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Garvey of the FAA is looking for a new way to handle air
traffic. ``Our system, while I would not say it's broken, is
certainly showing signs of strain,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But she stressed that the decision was up to Congress, and
predicted that changes would come more gradually in the United
States than they did in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things happen here in a sort of iterative way,'' she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   KHARTOUM, Sudan _ There does not seem to be much here for an
artist the caliber of Rashid Diab. There is only one small gallery.
It is hard to find canvas or paint. No one has enough money to buy
Diab's paintings, abstractions that like Sudan itself are a
gorgeous mix of Arab and African influences. Even small works go
for $1,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
   But two months ago, Diab, 43, abandoned a good life in Madrid to
return to Sudan. He left as a promising art student two decades ago
and has now come back with his wife, two children and an ambition:
to create a culture of art inside Sudan, a nation that produces
many fine artists but cannot seem to keep hold of them.
</P>
<P>
   His dreams are big. He wants to make Sudan self-reliant
artistically by teaching young artists to mix their own paint, to
make their own materials for etching, to find local stone for
sculpture. Along the way he hopes to show a skeptical outside world
just how fine art from Africa, and in particular Sudan, can be.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the problems that we have is that in America or Europe,
many people doubt the existence of good African artists,'' Diab
said. ``There is some special consideration for us as something
surprising, something astonishing. If they expect us to keep
painting animals or masks _ this is really impossible now.''
</P>
<P>
   Sudan, a huge country on the Horn of Africa, may be known to the
outside world as a place of endless war and famine or as the place
where U.S. missiles struck after the bombings at the American
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   The United States said rightly that Sudan had once harbored
Osama bin Laden, accused of masterminding the bombings, but serious
questions remain about Washington's assertion that a pharmaceutical
plant in Khartoum that was attacked was making nerve gas.
</P>
<P>
   But Sudan is also a place of great and spare beauty, where the
African and Arab worlds meet, as do the two branches of Nile before
it flows north across the Sahara and into Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   For half a century, the nation has also been known for its
artists. Most of them were classically trained and favor painting
over sculpture, the continent's dominant art form. But even as
these artists tried to define the mixture of cultures and religions
that make up post-colonial Sudan, they have tended to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim al-Salahi and Osman Waqiallah, two pioneering artists
who created the so-called Khartoum School of painting in the 1950s
and 1960s _ semi-abstract works characterized by Arab calligraphy
and African themes _ live in England. Omer Khalil, an etcher, has
lived in New York for three decades. Mohamed Shadad, one of Sudan's
early abstractionists, lives in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   The problems 40 years ago were nearly the same as they are now:
no money, little access to the outside world and barely anywhere
for artists to show their work.
</P>
<P>
   For the last decade, life has gotten more complicated because of
a repressive Islamic government that cannot decide if it wants to
promote the artists as a national treasure or to harass them for
being bad Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation in Sudan financially is not good,'' complained
El Tayib Daw el Beat, 33, a painter and textile designer who left
Sudan several years ago to work in Kenya. ``The political situation
now _ there no space for artists.''
</P>
<P>
   With all Sudan's limitations, it may seem unlikely that it has
produced so many good artists. Diab, one of the leaders of the
second generation of prominent Sudanese artists, does not think so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sudan is a rich country, with all types of inspiration for
feeding an artist,'' he said. ``This mixture between Arabic and
African people in Sudan, you can touch it in the street. You can
see it in the colors of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   That is one reason he decided to come back: to rediscover the
country whose bright colors and open spaces have inspired his work
since he was a young man. In Madrid he owned a gallery and taught
art, and he intends to do both in Khartoum.
</P>
<P>
   He is turning his house _ still stacked with unpacked boxes that
his 5-year-old son, Yafiel, plows with a toy tractor _ into an
exhibition space for himself and other artists. Diab will run the
gallery _ named after his 11-year-old daughter, Dara _ with his
Spanish wife, Mercedes Carmona, also an artist and art historian.
</P>
<P>
   The one other gallery in town was opened several years ago by
Ahmad Shibrain, one of the few influential Sudanese artists who did
not leave the country.
</P>
<P>
   For teaching, Diab brought materials for etching and a kiln for
firing ceramics. But he said that ultimately the expense of
materials would force him to make supplies for himself and other
artists. He made his own paints when he was young, and he said
Sudan is filled with pigments that can be mixed with linseed oil to
make oil paint. The nation also has high-quality stone and
materials for etching, he said.
</P>
<P>
   If there are risks in his move, Diab plays them down. He said he
did not expect to feel the same isolation from the outside world
that he did when he was a young man who left Khartoum for Spain in
1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've really prepared myself for new period, a new life,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his friends worry that the government _ which has been
accused of harassing artists _ may make his life difficult. But
Diab said he did not expect trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not in a position to say what they think about me, because
you never know what they are thinking about,'' he said. ``I'm a
neutral person. I'm not a dangerous person. They know all my life I
have focused only on my painting.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was also a person who shared particular traits of
many Sudanese: a sort of pride and stubbornness. For years he
talked about going home and helping to rejuvenate art in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being Sudanese, it is very hard to keep talking about these
things,'' he said. ``I had to come back and do it.''

GORE ONE-UPS BRADLEY WITH POLITICAL LEAP FROG 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ So here is a little oddity from the campaign trail:
Former Sen. Bill Bradley discussed child poverty at a Baptist
church in New York City on Thursday. Vice President Al Gore,
Bradley's only rival for the Democratic presidential nomination,
gave a speech about child poverty at a Methodist church in
Washington on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidence? Not really.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign all but admits it is engaged in what can only
be called pre-emptive scheduling. In a field where two candidates
hold similar views on similar topics and even use similar language,
being first is one of the few ways for a candidate to try to
distinguish himself.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Gore campaign has been eyeing Bradley's
schedule and having Gore speak first on the same topic. Last month,
Bradley was planning to give a speech on health care when Gore
scheduled his own speech on the same topic a few days before.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore camp has lots of reasons for pre-emptive scheduling.
One is that Gore advisers see Bradley getting credit for and being
taken seriously on a range of issues that Gore has worked on for
years. And it's not just that. Bradley also appears to be
benefiting from press coverage of his speeches with a steady rise
in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to allow anyone, even if they just decided to
run for president, to jump onto an issue that we've been working on
for a long time,'' said Chris Lehane, a spokesman for Gore. ``This
campaign is not going to stand for officious intermeddlers when it
comes to an agenda that we've been working on for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Hauser, a spokesman for Bradley, says the Gore camp is
nervous because Bradley is more thoughtful and bolder than Gore.
``This is not a coincidence,'' he said of the scheduling. ``They
are seeing the appeal of what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said, Bradley worked on many of these issues,
including poverty, racial matters and gun control, while he was in
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the similarity in topics is unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to be talking about the same things because we
are talking to the same Democratic primary electorate,'' said
Elaine Kamarck, Gore's top domestic policy adviser.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, both candidates gave speeches on the environment this
week.
</P>
<P>
   But the Gore campaign takes serious pride in its scheduling
prowess. In September, Gore aides could not pick up the telephone
fast enough to tell reporters that the vice president was adding a
stop in Rhode Island to a trip the next day to New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because it wanted to draw attention to the fact that Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican front-runner, who had been
delayed by bad weather, had skipped seeing a group of Rhode Island
school children but managed to attend a fund-raising event.
</P>
<P>
   Gore swooped in to provide the forlorn wee ones with the
presidential-style campaign they had been promised.
</P>
<P>
   One purpose of such scheduling hijinks is to demonstrate a
campaign's flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a quick campaign, this is a nimble campaign,'' Lehane
asserted, acknowledging that being fleet of foot can help counter a
long-held impression that the Gore campaign is so clogged with
bureaucrats that it cannot react swiftly to changing events.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley campaign has almost reveled in the opposite
impression. Aides like to say they are proceeding at Bradley's own
inner pace and have their eye on the big picture. They take pride
in not reacting to daily blips on the screen, implying that the
Gore campaign is revealing its desperation with sudden reactive
tactics.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Gore advisers recognize that Bradley comes
across as more likable, relaxed, less rehearsed than Gore, but,
they say, Gore has a better command of issues and his ideas are
more workable. So to the extent the Gore campaign can use its
scheduling of speeches to prompt a comparison of the candidates'
views, the Gore camp believes it can benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you get both the press and the voters to focus on where
we stand and where he stands, we think we do well in that
comparison,'' Lehane said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Gore campaign has even carefully timed its
formulation of the vice president's views. Last month, The
Advocate, a gay magazine, ran an interview with Bradley in which he
said he opposed same-sex marriage. The Gore campaign put out a
statement later that day saying that Gore also opposed same-sex
marriage, a position Gore had been ``reviewing'' for some time.
</P>
<P>
   But the Gore campaign also used the opportunity to draw
attention to Bradley's support for changing the 1964 Civil Rights
law to include protection for gays. The Gore campaign says that
proposal has hurt Bradley among black voters, who worry that
reopening the civil rights law would give conservatives in Congress
a chance to restrict it.
</P>
<P>
   And the countermoves also encompass endorsements. Because
Bradley, a former basketball star, has such a natural following
among professional athletes, Gore has even reached into that world
for support. He recently won the endorsement of Shaquille O'Neal,
star player for the Los Angeles Lakers, whose coach, Phil Jackson,
is one of Bradley's best friends.

   21. 65. 23.
</P>
<P>
   No, that's not a lock combination, a partial lottery entry or a
quarterback's signals. Through Friday, those numbers are the gains,
in percentage points, that the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500, the NASDAQ
composite index and the Dow Jones industrial average have recorded
over the last 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   For those who own the so-called average stock, which has
declined over the last year, the performance of the market's major
indexes probably doesn't mean very much. Nor is it likely to matter
for those who worry about rising interest rates, inflation and Year
2000 issues. Still, with stocks bobbing as much as they have
recently, it is worth remembering where we were a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Smith, chief investment strategist at Prudential
Securities, talked last week about the crosscurrents pulling on
investors just now, and why he doesn't expect much from the market
for some time to come, even though he likes stocks. Here are
excerpts from the conversation: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Stocks have been range-bound for awhile now. What is the
market trying to sort out? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Essentially, we have come to an important crossroads.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand is the thought that the inflation cycle is
kicking in, and the Fed will have to fight it. In the process of
doing that, the central bank will ultimately wind up clobbering the
economy and push it into recession. If you think that is going on,
you see higher interest rates, lower stock multiples and eventually
lower earnings. That sounds a lot like a bear market.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative view is that while prices are rising, inflation
has to be higher than it was last year, because a year ago we were
looking at deflation.
</P>
<P>
   Could inflation come back to pre-financial-crisis levels of
around 2.5 percent, which is the level we were at before 1997? You
either believe that is normal, or that we are going to go through
that level to some cyclically ugly high number.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, uncertainty prevails about which view is right, and
that is not good for the stock market. We are in big trouble when
we waffle.
</P>
<P>
   We are probably going to need a couple of more quarters to sort
this out. Either the inflation trend will keep going up, or it will
flatten out. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Where does the Y2K issue fit into all of this? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Y2K is a bravado issue. No one admits to changing their
investment strategy because of Y2K. But underneath you have to
think it is another dose of uncertainty, another reason to be
nervous. No one is really nervous themselves, but they are all
nervous someone else will get nervous. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. So how will this all get sorted out? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I am persuaded by the pre-1997 case that we are merely going
back to levels of inflation and interest rates that existed before
the onset of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say that oil prices can't go up or some other act
of God can happen.
</P>
<P>
   If we are all battened down and worried and get into January and
see the world is working, I think there will be a relief rally that
could be quite substantial. Even so, I would not be surprised at
all if major market averages are within 5 percent to 10 percent of
where they are right now in six months. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. But based on your asset allocation model, you far prefer
stocks over anything else. Why? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Since July, the model has been 10 percent cash, 10 percent
bonds, 5 percent in real estate investment trusts and 75 percent in
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   I am optimistic about stocks. Even if the market stays in a
trading range, it will still be a market in which you can make
money. It is a market of stocks as opposed to being in the stock
market. It comes down to finding good earnings stories and keeping
your wits about you, particularly now. There are a number of
sectors that have been battered that next March will have stocks
that have come way up from the previous fall. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What sectors do you like most? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I think an opportunity has just been created in oil service
stocks, which have been absolutely hammered, from Nabors Industries
to Schlumberger.
</P>
<P>
   That is also true with some of the retailers, like Gap, which
have been knocked down a good bit on the theory that the Internet
and interest rates will kill them.
</P>
<P>
   Even in technology, there has been a lot of controversy about
Y2K creating a significant slowdown in software.
</P>
<P>
   This is a big story for next year, because as well as technology
has done, demand could actually accelerate next year. Everyone has
to have an Internet strategy, which means some infrastructure for
the Internet, not just here but globally.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks like Compuware and Oracle are selling at low multiples
comparable to their growth rates. This is an area where next March
you will be looking and will be sorry you didn't move into in late
October.

 (For release Sunday, Oct. 24, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is like a war but it is not a war. It has had its beginnings
but its end is not yet in sight. Eventually there will be an
Afterward. Governance will be changed in some as-yet unforeseeable
way.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden rise of the Internet amid the telecommunications
revolution in the 1990s is for the present generation what World
War I, World War II, and Vietnam were for three earlier generations
on six continents. By that I do not mean particularily the
experience of victory or defeat (though there will be plenty of
that.) I mean an unexpected shift of previously accepted horizons;
a sequence of far-off events accelerating, coming closer and closer
to home and daily life, entailing a series of life-altering choices
by a wide array of people, especially the young: in short, a
galvanizing event. That's what it means, after all, to define a
generation.
</P>
<P>
   And a generation-defining event is what the Internet/World Wide
Web/e-commerce/dot.com story is all about. How else to account for
the increasing hysteria of press coverage of the last couple of
years, especially in the business press? A fellow here in
Massachusetts suddenly found himself worth $2.3 billion on paper
when his company, Sycamore Networks, went public. That is pretty
interesting news, no doubt about it. But it does not mean it is
going to happen to you.
</P>
<P>
   Watching school-leavers wrestle with the possibilities,
overhearing the doubts and fears of the older generation, observing
middle-aged adults fondly looking back, it is easy enough to think
along these lines. But the feeling finally crystallized for me one
day earlier this month while reading Charles Ferguson's new book
``High Stakes, No Prisoners: A Winner's Tale of Greed and Glory in
the Internet Wars.'' How to characterize it? I wondered. Where does
it fit in?
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly my mind flashed back to an issue of Life magazine in
1965 or 1966, and a story about Pete Dawkins that I had read as a
young man. As an All-American football player at West Point in
1958, Dawkins had captured America's imagination. He had been
president of his class, captain of the cadet brigade, Rhodes
Scholar. And now he was in Vietnam, playing in the Big Stadium at
last.
</P>
<P>
   The war was tough, punishing work, Dawkins told his interviewer,
but he had asked for it. The tasks of nation-building were complex.
``When you are used to beef and potatos, and suddenly you're eating
pigs' intestines and pigeon beaks and fishheads _ well, anybody who
says that doesn't take some doing has a lot tougher stomach than I
do. Or else he's a bloody damn liar.'' ``Pete Dawkins Takes the
Field,'' headlined the magazine. ``He wins applause from Saigon
schoolgirls.''
</P>
<P>
   And it was all true, up to a point. But then that was the
build-up phase. There was so much more to the story of America in
Vietnam than that.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar way, Ferguson's account of how he gave up punditry
and in 1994 co-founded a company _ Vermeer Technologies _ has the
tenor of a 392-page war story. Sure enough, software to enable
individuals to create and manage Web sites was the right idea at
the right time. Twenty months later he sold the company to
Microsoft for $133 million, and its FrontPage came to be another
synonym for the Microsoft approach to the marketplace: bundled with
its Office suite, denounced by critics as an ``evil'' program for
its propensity to handcuff users and exclude competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson is a lively writer, a peripatetic guide to everything
from restaurants to painters. He provides a terrific inside account
of the journey from inspiration to start-up to IPO to takeover
target and life afterward in Berkeley and Silicon Valley. He is a
fascinating witness to the battle between Netscape and Microsoft in
the years between 1994 and 1997, the rough tactics employed, and
there are asides on nearly every business that touched his own,
including the administration of the Justice Department (though
current antitrust chief Joel Klein doesn't make the index.) For Net
buffs, the book is a fascinating read _ about as interesting as
Dawkins' story (today he is a top manager at Citigroup.)
</P>
<P>
   But the book is an account by a participant in a particular,
relatively early battle; it is so much more narrow than the war
itself. Nor does Ferguson go to the heart of what is important
about membership in his generation. You have to see a generation
unfolding in time. Historians are still trying to see whole the
sprawling action of World War II, for example.
</P>
<P>
   And Vietnam unfolded in Washington, New York, Paris, Moscow and
Beijing as well as Saigon and Hanoi, enfolding not just soldiers
like Dawkins, but resisters, politicians, diplomats, business
executives, newspeople and such _ not to mention the 50 million
Vietnamese at the center of the war.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a generation must have its makers. No less than soldiers do
entrepreneurs like to put themselves at the center of events.
Historian Robert Wohl, author of ``The Generation of 1914,'' has
written that a historical generation is not defined by
chronological time or borders alone. ``It is not a zone of dates;
nor is it an army of contemporaries making its way across a
territory of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is more like a magnetic field at the center of which lies
an experience or a series of experiences. It is a system of
references and identifications that gives priority to some kinds of
experiences and devalues others _ hence it is relatively
independent of age. The chronological center of this experiencial
field need not be stable; it may shift with time.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is essential to the formation of a generational
consciousness is some common frame of reference that provides a
sense of rupture with the past and that will later distinguish the
members of the generation from those who follow them in time.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the clearest formulation ever made of this
include-me-in/include-you-out principle is the wonderful speech
that Shakespeare put in the mouth of King Henry IV on the eve of
the battle of Agincourt in 1415. No anniversary of the battle would
ever pass, Harry told his troops:
</P>
<P>
   ``From this day to the ending of the world,
</P>
<P>
   But we in it shall be remembered;
</P>
<P>
   We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;
</P>
<P>
   For he that sheds his blood with me
</P>
<P>
   Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile
</P>
<P>
   This day shall gentle his condition;
</P>
<P>
   And gentlemen in England now a-bed
</P>
<P>
   Shall think themselves accursed they were not here,
</P>
<P>
   And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks
</P>
<P>
   That fought with us on Saint Crispin's day.''
</P>
<P>
   Wohl argues that such frames of references must derive from
great historical events _ wars, revolutions, plagues, famines and
economic crises. Only historical events can supply ``the markers
and signposts with which people impose order on their past and link
their individual fates with those of the communities in which they
live,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But what if there is no war? I have long thought of the years
around 1980 as one kind of a watershed (Paul Volcker, Margaret
Thatcher, Ronald Reagan, Deng Xiaoping, Lech Walesa, Pope John Paul
II); of 1989 (the fall of the Berlin Wall) as another: optimism and
pessimism about the possibilities of government and all that. But
more than either of those events, this Internet thing implies a
Before, During and After. A land rush, yes, but not just any land
rush. Probably not since voyages to the New World has there been
anything quite like this removal from one place to another.
</P>
<P>
   One sure thing: like a war, the current mania will end. I had a
friend years ago who worked for Newsweek magazine in Saigon. He
kept track of the war by framing the cover stories on which he
worked over 15 years. There must have been a couple dozen covers on
his wall before he died. There have been no more than another dozen
Vietnam cover stories in all the years since then. The last one was
a long time ago.

   WASHINGTON _ The World Bank said on Friday that it is beginning
an investigation ``as a matter of urgency'' into the actions of a
former member of Russia's delegation to the international lender
who is suspected of passing insider information to a major Russian
bank.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation, which is being aided by a Washington law
firm, will focus on whether the official, Leonid Grigoriev, was
secretly receiving payments from Inkombank, a Moscow bank that has
since had its license revoked, in return for information about the
World Bank's plans to aid the Russian economy.
</P>
<P>
   Grigoriev, who now directs a Moscow research group financed
largely by the World Bank, was placed on ``administrative leave''
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Grigoriev worked in Washington, where the World Bank has its
headquarters, between 1992 and 1997. At first he was the alternate
executive director for Russia, meaning that he was Russia's No. 2
representative to the World Bank's board. Later he was an adviser
to the executive director.
</P>
<P>
   In that post, World Bank officials say, he would have had
virtually no say over how its money was disbursed to Russia. But he
would have had extensive information about the bank's plans in
Russia, and the plans of its sister institution, the International
Monetary Fund, with headquarters across the street.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that in 1993 Grigoriev
sent a fax to Inkombank urging it to invest in debt securities
issued by the former Soviet Union. The debt had been sold at a
significant discount because of doubts over whether Russia would
honor it and make payments to those holding the debt. The World
Bank and the IMF have been at the center of continuing negotiations
over whether and how the debt would be paid, so information about
their plans could significantly affect the price of the securities.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict-of-interest rules in effect at the bank in 1993
were adopted soon after the World Bank's creation as the
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. They
required any executive director or alternate to notify the bank of
``any substantial direct or indirect personal interest in any
matter known by him to be under consideration by the bank.''
</P>
<P>
   The wording was strengthened two years ago to read that an
executive director ``shall not use information obtained in the
discharge of his/her duties which is not available to the general
public for the purpose of furthering his/her personal interest or
the personal interest of any other person or entity.''
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank said Friday that it had hired the firm of
Venable, Baetjer, Howard &AMP; Civiletti to aid in its investigation.
``The investigation is being conducted with the full cooperation of
the Office of the Russian Executive Director and the Russian
government,'' the bank said.
</P>
<P>
   So far little evidence has emerged that World Bank or IMF money
for Russia has been stolen, but several audits are still under way.
The issue has come up frequently in Congress, however, and James D.
Wolfensohn, the bank's president, is clearly worried that a steady
trickle of charges that it has been caught up in Russian corruption
could endanger its funding. Wolfensohn declined to comment Friday
on the pending investigation.

TROOPS IN CHECHNYA SENSE PERIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHELKOVSKOYE, Russia _ From his hastily dug trench, Russian
paratrooper Ruslan Tashbaltayev aimed his machine gun across a
pasture in northern Chechnya to guard against Islamic militants
attacking his unit from the north. In another trench 200 yards
away, Sergeant Mikhail Bulgakin watched warily for rebel fighters
who might sneak across the Terek River from the south.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military says it controls this part of Chechnya, but
from the point of view of these soldiers, the question is who is
surrounding whom.
</P>
<P>
   In the nearby town of Shelkovskoye, angry villagers described
the hardships that arrived along with Russian troops two weeks ago:
detentions, beatings, civilian deaths, tight restrictions on travel
out of town, and a sundown-to-sunrise curfew.
</P>
<P>
   Russian leaders say the people here were happy when Russian
troops ``liberated'' this and 33 other villages from Chechen
rebels. But as one Shelkovskoye resident put it, ``This is a
concentration camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian warplanes and artillery are battering rebel-controlled
territory in Chechnya's mountainous south with daily bombardments.
On Thursday, rockets slammed into the Chechen capital, Grozny,
killing at least 143 people at a central market, according to the
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The prarie land north of the Terek River is supposed to be the
success story. Moscow says it has restored order here, with the
hearty support of the local population.
</P>
<P>
   But on the ground in northern Chechnya on Wednesday, it did not
look that way. The campaign to restore Moscow's rule over the
region, autonomous since Russian troops withdrew after a disastrous
1994-1996 war, appeared to be stalled in a quagmire of violence and
mutual mistrust.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the problem is that the Russians, who say their
campaign is aimed at ``eliminating Islamic terrorists'' it blames
for a series of bomb attacks in Moscow and southern Russia, have
not figured out how to distinguish their enemies from peaceful
citizens, and often treat them the same.
</P>
<P>
   The Chechens, many of whom abhor the violent anarchy brought on
their homeland by rival warlords during three years of virtual
independence, have an even deeper hatred of the Russians for the
senseless brutality of the last war, in which tens of thousands of
civilians died in indiscrimate air and artillery attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, the Kremlin's
presidential hopeful whose popularity has skyrocketed over his
leadership of the Chechnya campaign, said Moscow has learned from
its mistakes. Putin, who travelled to the combat zone Wednesday,
repeated his pledge not to storm Grozny and promised to restore
schools, hospitals, gas, and pensions, services that many
communities have gone without for three years. Speaking to
reporters in a barracks at a heavily guarded Russian military base
after the visit, Putin declared the operation a success so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pleasantly surprised that the first thing they asked me
was, 'You won't leave us, will you?' '' Putin said after meeting
with Chechen villagers during a brief stop in the village of
Znamenskoye, 30 miles northwest of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   Putin did not take journalists with him. Instead, Russian army
Lieutenant General Gennady Troshev piled a group of Western
reporters, the first to travel to Russian-occupied Chechnya since
Russian forces invaded this month, into four military helicopters
and flew them at treetop-level to a well-guarded field near
Shelkovskoye, a town of 8,000 some 30 miles northeast of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will not hear one negative word about the federal
troops,'' Troshev said.
</P>
<P>
   But when the reporters appeared in Shelkovskoye, escorted by an
armored column and heavily armed troops, the villagers had nothing
positive to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moscow is full of pigs,'' said Nazhmuddin Mirzayev, a police
officer in Shelkovskoye, his words punctuated by the far-off rumble
of Russian artillery. ``The Russians do not say an honest word.
They bomb us, and no one answers for their tanks.''
</P>
<P>
   Mirzayev described a recent tank attack on a bus carrying
refugees from the bombardment in Grozny. He produced the driver,
Adam Madagov, who said 15 women and children had died.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the villagers said they wanted nothing to do with the
Islamic radicals, and some, partially confirming Putin's theory,
said they would accept Russian rule in return for a normal life.
</P>
<P>
   But no one found the current situation normal. The lights and
gas are not on yet. Villagers need a pass to travel out of town to
tend their garden plots. The Russians bring the villagers shipments
of humanitarian aid, but they also conduct constant searches for
terrorists that the villagers find oppressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sit at home all day as if we are in a cell, as if we are
animals,'' said Geberto Epserkhanov, who said his son was detained
and beaten by Russian paramilitary police because ``they didn't
like his face.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Much more of this and we will go over to the other side and
start fighting the Russians,'' said one man who refused to give his
name.
</P>
<P>
   Confronted with these comments, Troshev, evidently surprised to
see things going so badly, brusquely told a reporter to ``stop
making these things up.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian commanders said their forces would stay out of the
villages if the residents kept the rebels out. A Russian officer
said many of the villagers pretended to be peaceful citizens during
the day, only to launch hit-and-run attacks at night. He also said
Chechens had been terrorizing the 500 ethnic Russians living in the
village.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are all so peaceful, who is killing our soldiers on
patrol at night?,'' the officer said. ``Who is killing our people?
We are not foreigners here. This is our country, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian commanders have not acknowledged any losses in the town.
But they are also not taking any chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know where the enemy might attack from,'' said
Tashbaltayev, the paratrooper in the unit dug in outside of town.
``They are using the tactics of jackals, hiding and running around
in small groups.''
</P>
<P>
   The problems faced by this unit epitomize the dilemma posed by
the Russian strategy of setting up a defensive perimeter on the
Terek to prevent the militants from attacking Russian regions
outside of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they stay in defensive positions north of Grozny, they will
increasingly become targets of Chechen hit-and-run attacks,''
defense analyst Pavel Felgenhauer wrote in The Moscow Times this
week. ``If the Russian troops go further south, they will get
embroiled in bloody battles with resolute rebel forces.''
</P>
<P>
   To imagine what those would look like, all one needs to do is
travel to Novolakskoye, a mountain hamlet just over the border from
Chechnya in the Russian region of Dagestan, where Chechen-led
militants invaded last month. Federal troops drove them out, but
lost dozens of men and destroyed the village. Few homes are intact,
administration buildings are gutted, even the local cemetary was
ruined. With winter on the way, villagers wonder how they will
survive in the ruins of their houses. Promised federal aid has yet
to materialize.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one here was happy to see the (militants) come,'' said
Gadzhi, a a muscular local policeman toting a machine gun. ``But no
one is happy with the way we have been treated since the army
left.''
</P>
<P>
   Felgenhauer's solution is for Russia to find a face-saving way
to negotiate a peace deal with Chechnya's president, Aslan
Maskhadov, and retreat. Putin made it clear that he will not be
following that advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave Chechnya three years of virtual independence,'' Putin
said, ``and the president lost control of the situation within
three months.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops have closed in to between three and 10 miles of
Grozny, according to conflicting reports. Whatever the actual
distance, it is close enough for Russian forces to shell and pour
rockets into the city.
</P>
<P>
   Already, more than 170,000 people have fled the bombardments,
which the Chechens said are indiscriminately killing civilians.
Russian generals originally denied that claim, but faced with
reporters who have witnessed the damage, Russian cabinet ministers
Wednesday acknowledged civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what do you want us to do, warn them in advance, `Dear
citizens, we are going to bomb this area, please go away?' '' said
Russia's information minister, Mikhail Lesin. ``The Chechens did
not warn anyone before they blew up apartments in Moscow and killed
200 people? How can you question our attitude toward these
people?''
</P>
<P>
   But how do the Russians pick out suspected terrorists from among
the peaceful population? Said government spokesman Andrei Korotkov:
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no ready answer to this question.''

   An Old-Line Business Group Is Trying to Play Catch-Up &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 65-year-old Business Council, an exclusive club of 100
big-company chief executives like John F. Smith Jr. of General
Motors and John F. Welch Jr. of General Electric, has been showing
its age. Despite its reputation for legendary speakers and
deal-making opportunities at its thrice-yearly meetings, some
chiefs from the fastest-moving sectors of the economy, including
Bill Gates and Michael D. Eisner, have declined to join.
</P>
<P>
   But the Business Council is trying to catch up with the times,
as the two-day meeting beginning on Wednesday evening will show. On
the scene in Boca Raton, Fla. _ a switch from Colonial
Williamsburg, the site since 1992 _ will be two new-economy members
who have joined in the last year, Scott McNealy of Sun Microsystems
and John Chambers of Cisco Systems. Michael Dell became a member in
May but won't attend this week.
</P>
<P>
   The program includes old standbys like Alan Greenspan and Bill
Bradley, but with the Internet as the main focus, some speakers
will be decidedly younger. Four teen-agers will expound to their
elders on ``Growing Up Digital'' in a panel led by Don Tapscott,
who wrote a book by that name and is chairman of the Alliance for
Converging Technologies in Toronto. Mary Meeker, the Internet
analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, will moderate a discussion
among four E-commerce chief executives whose names, even now, would
never make the member list.
</P>
<P>
   There is buzz, too, among some members that the membership
committee may extend an invitation to Hewlett-Packard's Carleton S.
Fiorina, who during the summer became the first woman to be named
chief executive of a company in the Dow Jones industrials. If she
joins, she would be right behind Crandall Close Bowles, the chief
executive of Springs Industries, who became the group's first
female member a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Oh yeah, and Bill Gates will be there, too _ not as a member,
but as a Friday morning speaker.

   For Martha Stewart, even a stock certificate, issued for the
initial public offering last Wednesday of Martha Stewart Living
Omnimedia, must have just the right, homey touch. Known for what
some call attention to detail, and others call obsessive control,
she had the stock certificate designed in-house.
</P>

   She also served 3,000 breakfasts, including brioches filled with

</P>
<P>
   If Timothy C. Draper's efforts to ingratiate himself in New York
last week offer any evidence, transplanting the Silicon Valley
ethos even to the financially fertile soil of Manhattan will yield
an uncertain harvest. To celebrate plans for his Draper Fisher
Jurvetson venture capital firm to open a New York branch, he got
the crowd at a New York Venture Group breakfast to sing along with
the words he handed out to ``New York, New York.'' His last two
verses:
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll build a new brand
</P>
<P>
   Some Web-based hot app
</P>
<P>
   Throw in some viral marketing
</P>
<P>
   And it's a wrap.
</P>
<P>
   If we can leave no doubt
</P>
<P>
   IPO take it out
</P>
<P>
   We'll all get rich!
</P>
<P>
   The In-ter-net.''
</P>
<P>
   When his quavering off-key croaking was done, the critics
pounced. ``We hope you didn't come to New York for a Broadway
career,'' one questioner said.
</P>
<P>
   Draper, having said that New York's legal, financial and media
businesses were headed for extinction, and that the Internet was a
better long-term growth play than any other organized religion, for
once turned modest. ``I'll keep my day job,'' he answered.

MOSCOW FLIP-FLIPS ON MISSILE ATTACK AS TOLL RISES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ So much for the streamlined new propaganda machine
Russia created to tell its side of the campaign against Islamic
rebels in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   As the death toll Friday climbed to 143 from the powerful
explosions that rocked a crowded market in Chechnya's capital,
Grozny, Russian officials repeatedly contradicted themselves over
whether their forces were responsible.
</P>
<P>
   In a sequence that would have been comical if not for the tragic
context, Russian officials first denied involvement in the attack,
the worst in Grozny since fighting erupted three weeks ago. Then,
as incontrovertible evidence mounted, they admitted it.
</P>
<P>
   Then they blamed the bombing on rival Chechen gangs.
</P>
<P>
   The string of confirmations and denials strained Russia's
already dubious credibility about its operation in the Caucasus at
a most inopportune time.
</P>
<P>
   Friday in Helsinki, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin tried
to assuage Western leaders' concerns about reports of
indiscriminate violence in what Moscow calls a campaign to wipe out
Islamic militants based in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Russia blames the militants for two attacks on a southern
Russian region and for a series of blasts this summer that killed
nearly 300 people. The militants deny involvement in the bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Chechnya's separatist government and journalists in
Grozny said up to 10 missiles slammed into the market and other
parts of the war-devastated capital, killing 143, according to the
Chechen Health Ministry. Some 300 were wounded, and thousands more,
fearing new attacks, fled, joining 184,000 refugees from three
weeks of Russian airstrikes and artillery attacks on Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Video footage from Grozny showed the shattered stalls of the
wrecked marketplace, splinters of wood, twisted metal, and dried
pools of blood. Chechens displayed chunks of metal etched with
military-style serial numbers, supporting their claim that the
projectiles were surface-to-surface missiles fired by Russian
forces advancing on Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that this was a surface-to-surface rocket,''
independent defense analyst Pavel Felgenhauer said Friday. He said
the missiles were probably launched from a radio-controlled system
that can be accurate from as far as 40 miles away. Russian forces
have advanced to within 3 to 10 miles of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military immediately denied that claim soon after
the attack, which occured some time after 5 p.m. Thursday. But
Friday, Russian military spokesman Alexander Veklich said the
attack was a ``special operation'' to destroy an arms bazaar
Russian intelligence had discovered at the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Civilians don't walk at nighttime in a place where arms are
sold to bandits and terrorists, they sit at home,'' Veklich added
in remarks shown on Russian NTV television. ``Those hit in the
attack were arms peddlers supplying bandits.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, weapons, which most Chechen men own, were sold at one
part of the market. But vendors there mostly sell food, clothing,
and household items.
</P>
<P>
   News agencies reported dozens of civilian victims, including
many women and children, at the marketplace and in Grozny
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials changed their story again. Domestic
intelligence chief Nikolai Patrushev described the blast as an
inadvertent explosion of munitions hidden at the market by the
militants. Patrushev is hardly credible in Russia; the last time he
appeared in public, it was to explain that his agents had faked a
bomb scare in a Russian city to see how citizens would react. They
were terrified.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Mikhailov, codirector of the Russian agency set up to
avoid this kind of confusion over Moscow's official line on
Chechnya, said he was ``70 percent certain'' that the blast was
caused by rebels who wanted to stir up Chechens and attract more
fighters for their cause.
</P>
<P>
   Putin seemed to agree with Mikhailov, suggesting rival Chechen
gangs may have caused the Grozny explosions. He also denied any
Russian involvement.
</P>
<P>
   The key to the maze of denials may be in the military's initial
denial that airstrikes were carried out against Grozny on Thursday.
Felgenhauer noted that the generals did not deny launching a
missile attack.

NEW LEADERS FACE TALL TASK  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA _ ``Merdeka'' means freedom in Indonesian, and it is
arguably the most emotionally powerful word in the language,
chanted by crowds with raised fists and sang in patriotic anthems.
</P>
<P>
   It was long a touchstone of the battle against Dutch colonialism
in 1945, but for most of the population too young to remember that,
it now stands for the end of 32 years of corrupt, autocratic rule _
a new ``merdeka'' that began Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Just a year and a half ago, Indonesia was ruled by an entrenched
former general who brooked no dissent, and it seemed inconceivable
that three leaders of the largely impotent opposition could ever
ascend to power. But this week they did, and now they face the task
of transforming this wounded and fractious nation of 210 million
people into a working democracy _ the world's third largest.
</P>
<P>
   Many Indonesians were still pinching themselves Friday, giddy
with disbelief that they finally got what they wanted: Moderate
Muslim cleric Abdurrahman Wahid and nationalist Megawati
Sukarnoputri are president and vice president. Muslim leader Amien
Rais, a firebrand who whipped up student protesters last year, is
speaker of the assembly, the third-highest post.
</P>
<P>
   None of this guarantees peace and quiet or a stable future. The
current honeymoon period will end, but the basic needs of the
nation will need to be addressed: an administration cleansed of
corruption; a restructured and equitable economy; civilian
political control over the military; ethnic, religious, and
regional harmony; and national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   How well old friends Wahid and Megawati work together and whom
they include in their cabinet will be major determinants of
Indonesia's delicate transition to democracy. They won election
after the candidates of the long-ruling Golkar party and the
military withdrew, and the new government will be expected to repay
that gesture by giving members of the old regime key cabinet
positions, which they could use to slow reform.
</P>
<P>
   It also remains to be seen how patient their supporters will be.
The ouster of former president Suharto could never have happened
without pressure from students and urban masses who crippled the
nation with desperate street protests. And it was the violent
demonstrations after Megawati lost the top job to Wahid that helped
pressure the national assembly to award her the vice presidency as
a consolation prize.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, it was the masses who set the pace for Indonesia's
convulsive transition out of authoritarian rule, and they are
likely to rise up again if they are unhappy with the result. The
first democratically elected parliament in four decades fast
discovered this week that it cannot ignore the ``parliament of the
streets.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People were very disappointed _ you saw the trouble when
Megawati didn't win the presidency,'' said police Sergeant Hadi
Wahono, 22, who was standing guard at an intersection where riots
had broken out. Like the other half-million members of the armed
forces and police, Wahono was prohibited by law from voting in
parliamentary elections last June, but he said ``the military and
police want a vice president and president that are good for the
people. So if everyone likes her, we like her.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Indonesians don't like the military in politics anymore,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Such words from a uniformed officer would have been unimaginable
when Suharto, a former military man, ruled with an iron fist.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where the military has long wielded unquestioned
power, it was equally unexpected when armed forces chief General
Wiranto suddenly withdrew from the race for vice president. One
Western diplomat with sources in the military said Wiranto's move
was less a matter of grace than of pressure by political parties
who vowed to hand him a humiliating loss if he tried to claim a top
civilian post for the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to know what to expect from Wahid, a Muslim cleric,
or Megawati, a former housewife whose popularity derives from her
father, Indonesia's founding president Sukarno. Neither has held
elected office before. And neither has offered a plan for
addressing the monetary crisis, separatist violence, or the loss of
confidence in government that underlies the tension.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid has said he wants reconciliation, and though he said in an
interview four months ago that he would form a committee to decide
how to deal with the widespread corruption under ousted president
Suharto, he added tellingly, ``We have to repent and forgive him. I
think the people will listen to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Wahid is a moral signpost for at least 35 million
Muslims in his religious organization, a forgive-and-forget
approach is unlikely to satisfy the majority of Indonesians who
resent the Suharto clan enriching itself at the public trough while
millions survived on a few hundred dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
   Another unknown is how the two leaders will deal with the former
ruling part ,and the newly potent Islamic bloc.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia is 88 percent Muslim, but Wahid has said religion
should be separate from the state. That has eased concerns among
Christians, Hindus and secular Muslims, but he will have to fight
to bring along Islamic conservatives in parliament, many of whom
voted against Megawati because she is a woman.
</P>
<P>
   Omar Dari, the armed forces chief under Sukarno who was
imprisoned for 29 years under Suharto, said the Wahid/Megawati
combination will be a potent one, because both are resonant moral
symbols for different segments of society _ religious Muslims on
one hand and populist, secular nationalists on the other. Moral
force may be exactly what Indonesians are looking for after decades
of rampant corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Dari said he told Megawati that the ``problem for Indonesia is
trust. We have an economic crisis and a crisis of confidence. For
the economic crisis, you have so many PhD's who can solve it. But
for the confidence crisis, it is personal. And you are the one who
has the trust of the people.''

REPUBLICANS ANNOUNCE PLAN TO CUT SPENDING; VETO EXPECTED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Ohio)  (mk) 
 By DAVID ROSENBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican leaders in Congress announced a plan
Friday to reduce government spending across the board by 1.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts, a total of $4.5 billion below the amounts Congress has
already specified for federal departments and agencies in the
current fiscal year, would apply to every government program for
which the lawmakers control the annual financing _ from farm
subsidies to highway construction to the purchase of warplanes _
although not to benefit programs like Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican leaders said the plan, which is sure to draw a
presidential veto, would allow them to approve a budget without tax
increases and without dipping into Social Security reserves. At a
rally on the Capitol lawn, they said all the cuts would come from
what they called ``waste, fraud and abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in good budgets, there is still some wasteful spending,''
said Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the House Republican whip. ``If the
president doesn't like this plan, maybe he ought to show us his.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Lew, President Clinton's budget director, said that the
president's plan was the budget he sent Congress in January and
that the Republican plan was irresponsible.
</P>
<P>
   ``An across-the-board cut makes no sense at all,'' Lew said in
an interview. ``It would take every priority and reduce it equally
_ important public health programs, education, public safety,
critical defense needs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to make choices,'' Lew added. ``That's what governing
is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the new Republican plan was announced only by leaders
of the House of Representatives, Senate leaders have accepted it,
said John Czwartacki, the spokesman for the Senate majority leader,
Trent Lott, R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans said they would attach the omnibus spending cut
to the final spending bill to go through Congress, the measure to
provide financing for the Departments of Labor, Education, and
Health and Human Services, and for the District of Columbia. They
said the House would approve the bill and send it to the president
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is considered certain to veto the bill not just because
he opposes the spending cuts but also because it does not include
money he requested for 100,000 new teachers in public schools
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He also plans to veto two spending bills Congress sent him this
week, one for the Interior Department and cultural agencies, the
other for the Departments of Commerce, State and Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Lew was at the Capitol Friday to meet with the top lawmakers of
the committees that deal with spending measures. Both sides said
later that the meetings had been cordial but that no tangible
progress had been made in resolving the many differences. The
meetings are to resume on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Under the Republican plan, each department and agency would be
responsible for deciding how to apply the spending cut. At the
Defense Department, where the budget is about $260 billion, a 1.4
percent cut would amount to $3.6 billion. At the National
Institutes of Health, with a budget of about $15 billion, the cut
would be about $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's Office of Management and Budget calculated that if the
cuts were applied equally within departments as well as among them,
the effects would include a lack of a full complement of
immunizations among 4,700 children and a loss of 154 agents at the
FBI and 164 agents at the Border Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said those kinds of calculations were preposterous.
Some agencies might decide to lay off workers, they said, while
others might decide to trim purchases or limit travel.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, chairman of the House Budget
Committee, said the departments and agencies would be subjected to
the kind of budgetary discipline that every successful business
applies.
</P>
<P>
   One item that will not be affected is the $4,600 congressional
pay increase that Congress approved in July, raising senators' and
representatives' salaries by 3.4 percent, to $141,300. In budget
terminology, this falls into the category of mandatory and not
discretionary spending.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   All in all, this was not a day on which the hot political
oratory over the budget showed any sign of abating.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrats continue to fight us all the way, because they
want to increase spending,'' DeLay declared.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Joe Lockhart, the president's press
secretary, questioned whether DeLay was ``speaking for himself, or
whether the strategy of bringing the Democrats to their knees is
the strategy of the Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   If it is ``the overall guiding principle of the Republicans,''
Lockhart said, ``this is going to be a long, tough battle.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Democrats took issue with the Republicans' contention that their
plan would not tap into Social Security reserves. The numbers came
out that way, Democrats said, only because Republicans jury-rigged
the books so that billions of dollars in spending would be shifted
into the next fiscal year, and because they used an accounting
device that ordered the Congressional Budget Office to use its own
spending and revenue estimates in some cases, and Office of
Management and Budget estimates in other cases.
</P>
<P>
   The accounting device, called directed scorekeeping, allowed
Republicans to show $18 billion less in spending than they would
have otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   But after years of taking beatings from Democrats on Social
Security, Republicans say they have managed at least to neutralize
the issue with their recently adopted principle that none of the
money raised in Social Security taxes should be used for other
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The opinion polls show that Republicans may have gained slightly
with respect to the issue. In a national poll last week, the Gallup
Organization asked people whether they had more faith in Clinton or
in Republicans in Congress ``to act responsibly with the government
funds set aside for Social Security benefits.'' Fifty percent said
they trusted the president more, and 41 percent answered
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In August, in answer to a slightly different question before
Republicans began their current offensive, 52 percent said they had
more confidence in the president to handle Social Security, and 35
percent sided with the Republicans.

TROUNCING THOSE HATEFUL YANKEES WITH POLITENESS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Even within Atlanta's gauzy fantasy of itself as the
chivalrous competitor, far too polite to pour beer on an enemy fan,
there is room for a dream of serial slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the possibility of vanquishing not just one but two
New York baseball teams in a single October, including one with the
name that represents everything Atlanta seems to recall hating, the
city is becoming almost bloodthirsty as the World Series nears its
opening here on Saturday night. In an entirely genteel and courtly
way, of course.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Journal-Constitution is offering its readers a
series of posters showing a Braves tomahawk firmly embedded in a
New York apple. There is no apple juice luridly dripping from the
wound, however, and the poster slogans are a bit less than
incendiary: ``N.Y., N.Y., One to Go,'' ``Kiss Our Grits,'' and the
inevitable ``Yankees, Go Home.''
</P>
<P>
   The local sports radio station has urged listeners to call in
and unburden themselves of their bitterness toward New York City.
There were complaints about the unimaginable rudeness of New York
fans in the recent Mets playoff, and a few bad memories of Jim
Leyritz's home run in Game 4 of the 1996 World Series that sparked
an eventual Yankee victory over the Braves. But the most vociferous
listener called in to rail against Billy Joel.
</P>
<P>
   This World Series has brought out a peculiar and often
conflicting set of emotions in Atlanta. There is, without question,
a deep-rooted resentment here against New York and the Yankees and
the cultural domination for which they stand, and a thirst to
finally crush the century's leading baseball club.
</P>
<P>
   A few extremists, including Gov. Roy Barnes and Mayor Bill
Campbell, have even invoked the Civil War, challenging their
counterparts in New York to put a Braves hat and jersey on the
statue of Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman in Grand Army Plaza for
every series game the Braves win. (Their concessionary offer hardly
seems equivalent, however: Yankees garb on the statue of former
President Jimmy Carter at the State Capitol.) Late Friday, Gov.
George E. Pataki rejected the offer as disrespectful.
</P>
<P>
   But Atlanta seems reluctant to let loose its long-buried primal
scream of frustration against New York, to admit that it is
annoying to hear Don Imus describe Atlantans as a bunch of
``redneck goobers,'' as he did on his radio program Friday morning.
Fans would rather trill their Indian doom chant and wave their red
tomahawks than boo or curse or discuss the genealogy of New York
players. Doing so would lower Atlanta to the raw, unwashed level of
a Yankee bleacher creature, which is one of the primary reasons for
hating New York in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a fairly passive sports town,'' said Stephen Shapiro,
known to all as ``Steak,'' who as president and afternoon host of
the Sportstalk 790 AM radio station here has taken daily abuse from
Imus in a staged bit of North-South shtick. ``People don't get as
emotional about baseball, because they see it as entertainment. You
go to Yankee Stadium and it is really hard-core. You go to Turner
Field and it's this family-friendly Southern entertainment. It's
not a jungle.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta is not a traditional Southern city, of course, though it
can legitimately claim to be the capital of the South. There is
nothing sleepy or slow-paced about it, and its individual residents
are no more or less friendly than people in St. Louis or Denver or
Cleveland. But as a group, people in the region seem more relaxed
about their entertainment than in the North, more aware that even
college football _ a far more dominant local pastime _ is basically
just a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to be those kinds of fans,'' said Thomas Cook, a
local defense lawyer with Braves season tickets. ``You can come
here and wear a Mets or Yankees cap and not worry about getting
soaked with beer. I mean, those guys up north will boo their own
team if they get mad at something. Down here, that would never
happen. We would just sit still.''
</P>
<P>
   That does not imply a lack of support for the team. Both the
Braves and the Yankees had among the best attendance figures in
Major League Baseball this year, with the Yankees, in third place
in attendance at 3,292,343, barely edging the Braves, in fourth
place at 3,284,897. But that easygoing relationship with the team,
combined with a record so successful during the decade that winning
seems routine, has led to a few anomalies, like the large blocks of
empty seats at Turner Field during the early games of the
post-season.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people just aren't going to inconvenience themselves
for a 4 p.m. playoff game, because we've had so many,'' said Rick
Beard, a Braves fan who is executive director of the Atlanta
History Center. ``If they have to drive back into traffic after
work on a Tuesday night, they might not do it if they can watch on
TV. I don't want to say they're fair-weather fans, but if the
Braves ever stop being successful, it will be interesting to see
what happens to their fan base.''
</P>
<P>
   In unguarded moments, a few fans will admit they actually hold
the Yankees in a kind of secret awe, as the original template for
the year-after-year success the Braves have had this decade.
Beating the Cleveland Indians in the 1995 World Series was
pleasant, but the matchup did not hold the power of these two
teams. A few Braves players may have infuriated Mets fans with
derisive comments during the National League championship, but
there has been no such disrespect in the leadup to the World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Yankees are what baseball is all about,'' said Manuel
Maloof, a well-known retired politician who owns Manuel's Tavern,
for years the saloon of choice for many elected officials,
journalists and police officers. ``Anytime you play them, anytime
you have a chance to beat them, well, that's the biggest thing
there is.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people remember with some fondness that Joe Torre's
brother, Frank, played first base for the old Triple-A Atlanta
Crackers and that Joe Torre played for and managed the Braves many
years before he took over the Yankees. Many other people are still
a bit shell-shocked when they recall how the Yankees lost the first
two games of the 1996 Series to Atlanta, and then went on to win
the next four.
</P>
<P>
   Robert McDuffie, the concert violinist, who is such a fervent
Braves enthusiast that former Gov. Zell Miller gave him Bobby Cox's
old warmup jacket, said Atlanta was grasping for a moment of
national validation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta has its set of insecurities, and it very much wants to
be taken seriously,'' said McDuffie, a Macon native who now lives
on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. ``People are tired of those
jokes about how the best restaurant in Atlanta is Hooters. To beat
the Yankees, finally, would be the ultimate act of
one-upsmanship.'' &QL;

CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF CONFLICT ON MEDICAL MARIJUANA

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ By now, vomiting is second nature to Peter
McWilliams. He has no shame about it. Sometimes he even sees the
humor in it.
</P>
<P>
   McWilliams, 50, still laughs about the time he leaned over a
trash can at a political convention, lost his lunch in front of
strangers, then casually wiped his mouth with a cocktail napkin
before continuing the conversation. The other day, at his home high
in the Hollywood Hills, he simply shrugged when he returned from
retching in the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get used to vomiting,'' he said. ``You get used to
anything, I suppose. But it's insane that anyone has to go through
this.''
</P>
<P>
   McWilliams, who has AIDS and cancer that is in remission, said
he and his doctor know the solution to his suffering: medical
marijuana. He said he knows from experience that it helps him keep
down the powerful drugs he needs to survive and the food he needs
to keep up his strength. Without it, the book publisher and
best-selling author fears he will die.
</P>
<P>
   But for more than a year, McWilliams has been barred from
smoking marijuana while he awaits trial on a variety of
marijuana-related charges. He says he was growing it for his own
consumption, and had not used it for more than 20 years until he
became ill. Federal prosecutors charge he was conspiring to sell it
along with his codefendants, all of them users of medical
marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, McWilliams's situation underscores the ongoing
conflict between the state and federal governments over the use of
marijuana by AIDS, cancer, and other patients in chronic pain _
despite some medical studies and much anecdotal evidence showing
its palliative benefits.
</P>
<P>
   California voters became the first to approve medical marijuana
for patients with a doctor's approval in November 1996 _ the same
year McWilliams discovered a lump in his neck and learned he had
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and AIDS. Washington followed last fall, and
several states are considering similar measures. But the federal
government maintains that the sale or distribution of marijuana
remains illegal under all circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``The laws against medical marijuana are crazy in the first
place,'' said state Senator John Vasconcellos, a Democrat who has
led the charge to legalize medical marijuana and keep it legal in
California. ``But to say that people who are dying of cancer and
AIDS can't relieve their pain is awful. By denying Peter McWilliams
the right to smoke marijuana while he's out on ($250,000) bail,
they're denying him life.''
</P>
<P>
   McWilliams's trial is still a month away. For now, he is mostly
confined to his home, relying on friends to bring him the milk he
gulps by the glassful and the honey roasted peanuts he eats by the
fistful because they do not make him nauseous.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to work, McWilliams finds his Prelude Press bordering on
bankruptcy. Unable to walk even short distances, he requires a
wheelchair for court appearances. The other day, his face dripping
sweat, he nodded off in the hallway while inside the courtroom his
hearing was being postponed.
</P>
<P>
   Of the first time he smoked marijuana after chemotherapy,
McWilliams said, ``I had this epiphany: Oh my god, this stuff
really works. Then I got mad, furious, thinking about all the
millions of cancer patients who this could be helping.''
</P>
<P>
   Repeatedly turned down by a federal judge who says he cannot
authorize someone to break the law, McWilliams now hopes a federal
appellate court, which recently ruled that seriously ill people
should be allowed to use medical marijuana, will give him access to
the only that drug he has found to keep his nausea under control.
Other defendants in federal marijuana cases are expected to mount
similar appeals based on the US 9th Circuit Court of Appeals
decision.
</P>
<P>
   To federal prosecutors, however, McWilliams's case has nothing
to do with medical marijuana and everything to do with a drug ring,
regardless of why the defendants were growing the plants or who was
using them. McWilliams is accused of masterminding the plot, in
part because of the $120,000 that McWilliams says he paid
codefendant Todd McCormick, a medical marijuana patient and
researcher, to write two books on the subject. If convicted, they
could face life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all admit to what we've done,'' said McWilliams, who
previously bought marijuana on the black market or at the cannabis
clubs that had sprung up around California after the passage of the
law known as Proposition 215.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all grew marijuana; we all used marijuana,'' he continued.
``The 300 plants I had were my own personal stash. Todd was
studying which strains work best for which types of illnesses. I
mean all his plants were labeled.''
</P>
<P>
   But federal prosecutors say that is no defense. In fact, they do
not want the defendants to be able to introduce a medical-necessity
defense, discuss the benefits of marijuana, or even mention
Proposition 215 to jurors. Both sides are scheduled to argue their
positions next week before US District Court Judge George King.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way that I characterize this case is that it involves a
conspiracy to conduct a commercial marijuana-growing operation
involving more than 6,000 plants at four separate growing sites,''
said Thom Mrozek, spokesman for the US Attorney's Office in Los
Angeles, which is handling the case. ``It doesn't matter where they
were going to sell it. It doesn't matter if they say, `I'm doing
this to save my life.' It's illegal to manufacture of cultivate
marijuana under federal law.''
</P>
<P>
   If prosecutors succeed in keeping those issues out of court,
McWilliams's attorney, Thomas Bollanco, said the defendants may as
well head straight to prison. Without medical necessity, they have
no case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be left unable to answer to the charges because
we can only answer with what's true, and what's true is that these
guys were motivated by their medical needs and Prop 215,'' said
Bollanco, who recently lost a federal jury trial in Sacramento in
which the judge refused to allow a medical necessity defense.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even on a state level, the answer to the medical marijuana
debate remains murky. Lacking clear-cut guidelines, law enforcement
officials in some jurisdictions actively pursue arrests, others
tend to look the other way. Last year, a task force including
advocates and opponents worked to craft a compromise. This year,
the resulting bill was tabled. Faced with federal opposition,
California Governor Gray Davis has resisted giving it his approval.
</P>
<P>
   But California Attorney General Bill Lockyer, unlike his
predecessor, appears to favor the voters' decision to allow the use
of medical marijuana, although he has called Prop 215 poorly
written and open to too much interpretation. This month, he urged
US Attorney General Janet Reno to let the appellate court ruling
stand.
</P>
<P>
   Possibly turned off by the number of marijuana plants involved _
or by McWilliams' admitted eccentricities _ few have rallied around
his case and some have turned against him. He insisted he is hurt
but not angry or surprised by his isolation. After his arrest,
McWilliams spent almost a month in jail until he could raise the
money to post bail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the representative of all the sick people and what they
are doing to me is only the worst case right now, but there will be
others,'' McWilliams said. ``I am living on borrowed time anyway. I
owe this part of my life to luck and modern medical science. But I
can't imagine what the rest of it will be like if they won't let me
use medical marijuana.''

SELLING FASHION MODELS' EGGS ONLINE RAISES ETHICS ISSUES  
(HLW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ To the horror and disgust of mainstream
infertility groups, a longtime fashion photographer has begun
offering up models as egg donors to the highest bidders, auctioning
their ova via the Internet to would-be parents willing to pay up to
$150,000 in hopes of having a beautiful child.
</P>
<P>
   ``It screams of unethical behavior,'' Sean Tipton, spokesman for
the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, said of the Web
site, www.ronsangels.com, which was already up on the Web on Friday
and is to be officially premiered on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Infertility specialists deplored the website as exactly the kind
of ``commodification'' of human egg donation that they hope to
avoid. Just this spring, signs of movement in that direction came
when a couple advertised that they would pay $50,000 for an egg
from a tall, athletic, top-college student with high Scholastic
Aptitude Test scores.
</P>
<P>
   The photographer, Ron Harris, justifies the egg auction as a
natural outgrowth of the urge humans have to mate with genetically
superior people and produce babies with evolutionary advantages.
Particularly, he says, in a society like this one whose ``celebrity
culture'' worships beauty.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you could increase the chance of reproducing beautiful
children, and thus giving them an advantage in society, would
you?'' he asks on the site. In a telephone interview on Friday, he
described the objections to egg auctions as politically correct.
Since not all women are the same, he argued, what they are paid for
their eggs ``should be a price that floats based on perceived
value.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris' melding of Darwin-based eugenics, Playboy-style
sensibilities and eBay-type commerce struck some longtime
infertility specialists as the most worrying sign yet of where the
partly unregulated field of ``assisted reproduction'' may be going.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frightening and horrible,'' said Shelley Smith, director
of the Egg Donor Program, a center in Los Angeles, ``and the worst
part for me is to think there might be something worse still beyond
our imagination. It seems to escalate, and ever since the Internet,
it seems to snowball more rapidly, this depersonalization of people
and selling of eggs.''
</P>
<P>
   She and others said that as far as they knew, Harris' site was
legal. Federal law expressly forbids trafficking in human organs
but not in sperm and eggs, they said. Research by Harris' lawyers
reached the same conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   The site has already received a serious bid of $42,000 from a
couple who found it through a search engine, said Harris, 66. The
models receive the full bid price, and Rons Angels takes a
commission of an additional 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The bid price includes no medical costs, the site specifies,
also saying that it takes on no medical functions. But it does list
scores of specialists who might possibly be willing to perform the
procedure once an agreement is reached. Confidentiality is strongly
guarded in such cases and could make the ads the only visible sign
of the activity. That is the case with the ad seeking a college
student with the brokers declining to say what happened to protect
confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said the models could not be interviewed on Friday
because of an exclusive agreement with another newspaper until the
site is launched on Monday. But each of the eight displayed
luminously on the Website offered their reasons in print for
selling their eggs: They ranged from ``to not be dependent on a
man'' to ``to support her four-year-old son'' to ``I want to help
others.'' Several were from other countries, and one said her goal
was ``to move to the USA.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris is probably best known as the creator of Aerobicise, a
best-selling 1980s exercise video featuring fit models in leotards,
and ``The 20 Minute Workout,'' a television show with similar
appeal. He has been a fashion photographer for 40 years, he said,
and has also done some television directing for Playboy.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The use of donor eggs by infertile couples remains relatively
uncommon. According to Resolve, the National Infertility
Association, about 1,700 babies were born from procedures involving
egg donation in 1996. Those numbers have been growing only slightly
since then, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   But the compensation for egg donors is a burning issue these
days, one under discussion from the ethics panel of the American
Society for Reproductive Medicine to the meeting here this week of
Resolve, which brings together patients and practitioners to
support and educate infertile people. Members of both bodies said
they had recently discussed Harris' website, which has been posted
in various evolving forms for about two months, as an example of
the kind of thing that needs to be stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things like this need immediate attention _ the thing is,
where is the appropriate avenue?'' asked Diane Aronson, the
executive director of Resolve.
</P>
<P>
   It is routine for egg donation centers to offer would-be parents
an extensive profile of the egg donor, including photographs and
descriptions of their talents and personalities. Several post donor
catalogues online, and West Coast centers report a surfeit of
donors, though they say there is a shortage in the East,
particularly in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   But mainstream infertility groups deem it acceptable only to
choose an egg donor based on her traits and then compensate her _
usually between $2,500 and $5,000 _ for her time, inconvenience and
discomfort. (Donors receive hormone shots to hyper-stimulate their
ovaries and have a dozen or so eggs removed with a needle.) The
groups tend to frown on anything that seems like actually trying to
buy extra-nice genes _ though the line does seem blurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically what it comes down to is we're selling human tissue
and somewhere along the line we've got to bring ethics into it,''
said Karen Synesiou, director of Egg Donation, a private company in
Beverly Hills. ``I don't know where the line is because I want to
balance the needs of the infertile community versus society at
large, but I think a bidding game crosses the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris responded that it was ``very unfair to put a limit on a
girl's ability to make money.'' And seeking to pay all women the
same, he said, ``is like saying all women are the same, which is
not the case.''
</P>
<P>
   While trafficking in eggs is not illegal, it is distasteful
enough that eBay, the giant auction website, specifically bans
offering eggs for sale, as well as the auctioning of sperm and
other human body parts (though hair is allowed.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Synesiou and others pointed out that in addition to other
concerns, mating with a model might bring tremendous disappointment
to some couples if the genetic dice fell against them and their
child turned out unattractive. Not to mention how hard it would be
for the child who failed such expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same as couples who go to the genius sperm banks,''
she said. ``How will the child feel when the child's no genius?''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Etcoff, author of ``Survival of the Prettiest: the Science
of Beauty,'' (Doubleday, 1999) also pointed out that acquired
characteristics like dyed blond hair and lips made plump by
collagen are not inherited.
</P>
<P>
   Parents' quest for beautiful genes resonates powerfully with a
growing body of academic research into the possible evolutionary
reasons why certain physical characteristics from hip-to-waist
ratio to symmetrical faces are considered desirable and beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, Dr. Etcoff noted, seemed to ``put his own spin'' on such
evolutionary research.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in an editorial on the site, he quotes a study that
looked at personal ads to determine the ``market value'' of mate
choice, and found that men wanted youth, beauty and social skills,
while women who had those qualities demanded men who were rich,
good-looking and young.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' wrote Harris, ``is Darwin's natural selection at its
very best. The highest bidder gets youth and beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   A bit later, he wrote: ``It is not my intention to suggest we
make a super society of only beautiful people. This site simply
mirrors our current society, in that beauty always goes to the
highest bidder.''

PUBLISHER DECIDES TO DESTROY BIOGRAPHY OF GOVERNOR BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: A longer version of this story will move as a 1STLD by 9:45
p.m. ET.)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ St. Martin's Press, the publisher of a controversial
biography of George W. Bush, took the ultimate step to kill the
disputed book Friday, issuing an alert to the nation's booksellers
to return thousands of copies for destruction by shredding or
burning because they no longer trust the author.
</P>
<P>
   Executives of the publishing house announced the recall of the
books just hours after receiving the results of a company inquiry
and a private detective's report that it said matched photographs
of the book's author, J.H. Hatfield, with a criminal mug shot of a
felon convicted of hiring a hit man 11 years ago to murder his
boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're heat, furnace fodder,'' Sally Richardson, the
president and publisher of St. Martin's trade division, said of the
books. The publishing house this month had shipped out more than
70,000 copies of Hatfield's ``Fortunate Son: George W. Bush and the
Making of an American President.''
</P>
<P>
   Such recalls are rare in the publishing industry, but this one
came in a season when other companies were forced to pull books
because of shattered trust _ from an author accused of making up a
Holocaust identity to a biographer who simply plagiarized the words
of other books. The incidents have raised questions about the
industry's ability to serve as a literary gatekeeper in screening
out unsavory or dishonest authors.
</P>
<P>
   Hatfield's 368-page book included claims from anonymous sources
that Bush _ the Texas governor and leading contender for the
Republican presidential nomination _ was arrested in 1972 on
cocaine possession charges that were later expunged from the record
by a judge as a favor to Bush's father.
</P>
<P>
   In statements Friday, St. Martin's executives did not take issue
specifically with the disclosures, which have been denied by the
Bush family, but instead said they no longer consider the author
reliable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't be sure what else he lied to us about or to the
attorney who did the legal review of the book,'' said David Kaye,
the general counsel for St. Martin's Press. ``Therefore we can't
continue to trust what he told us.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Martin's Press, housed in the Flatiron Building, is a
publisher of popular books, and is a division of Verlagsgruppe
Georg von Holtzbrinck, which also owns the literary publishing
houses of Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux and Henry Holt. Earlier this
year, St. Martin's published Monica Lewinsky's tale of broken
presidential romance after other top publishers had publicly
scorned the title.

COMMENTARY: SEND IN MORE CLOWNS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By FRANK RICH    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's no faster way for a politician to offend PC
sensibilities on the left than to attack gun control and
affirmative action. There's no faster way to offend PC
sensibilities on the right than to defend flag-burning and gays in
the military. What major politician would dare offend the left and
right? As far as I can determine there's just one, Jesse Ventura,
who in his notorious interview in Playboy not only took all these
positions but further riled the entire political spectrum by
dismissing Tailhook as ``much ado about nothing'' and religion as
``a crutch for weak-minded people.'' Then he mocked the single
largest bipartisan constituency in the country _ the overweight.
The only way he could have topped that would have been to call for
the mandatory spaying of household pets.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Minnesota governor has been declared dead by the same
seers who failed to predict his election in the first place (and
who also failed to notice that most of his bombshells were public
well before the Playboy interview, in his best seller, ``I Ain't
Got Time to Bleed.'') It was duly noted that the governor's
approval rating dropped 19 points after the feeding frenzy (though
no one added that, at 54 percent, his number is indistinguishable
from Bill Bradley's or Al Gore's). ``His national star has dimmed
considerably,'' concluded Newsweek this week, in reporting that
Ventura had promised (none too convincingly) to muzzle himself.
``He's a joke,'' said Eleanor Clift on CNN. ``He sounds like a
wacko,'' echoed Steve Roberts of U.S. News &AMP; World Report. And so
slams down the iron curtain of Washington's conventional wisdom:
The Ventura fracas is just another diversion in 1999's celebrity
circus of politics, another manifestation of what ``Nightline''
calls the ``silly season'' and a Wall Street Journal headline
upbraids as ``defining politics down.''
</P>
<P>
   But silly may be in the eye of the beholder. Yes, the brawl
shaping up between Pat Buchanan and Donald Trump over the Reform
Party's presidential ticket (and its $12.6 million in federal
campaign funds) is a sideshow likely to relegate its Pyrrhic victor
to the political fringe. And yes, Ventura's own political future,
which will be tied to his still-embryonic (and so far mixed) record
as governor, is far from certain. Yet for some of us there's a
lift, even hope, in watching Ventura function as a bull in the
china shop of a stultifying campaign culture. The silly season we
should really worry about as we head into 2000 is not that of the
governor's effronteries, or of the Reform Party melee, or of Warren
Beatty's pleas for the down-and-out from a ballroom in Beverly
Hills, or of barely rumored candidacies that the media miraculously
inflate into 48-hour talkfests (Cybill Shepherd, Arnold
Schwarzenegger, Jerry Springer, Oprah). The real silly season is
the one to which the supposedly grown-up, professional politicians
are subjecting us day after day.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to find a major candidate in either party who will
risk offending anyone by uttering an unscripted remark, countering
an ideological orthodoxy or choosing a wardrobe that might not sit
well with a pollster or focus group. Seventy-five years after the
Scopes trial, even evolution is too hot an issue for most of them
to handle. The apotheosis of this cautious vacuousness _ the
ultimate un-Ventura _ was Elizabeth Dole, who mercifully dropped
out of the Republican race this week. In running what she kept
describing as a campaign of ``substance,'' she took no-holds-barred
stands in favor of ``promoting integrity in government'' and
against illegal drugs. Her one fledgling attempt to challenge her
party's pieties, a call for modest gun control, was followed by a
headlong retreat into I Am Woman, I Won't Roar. Even after she
withdrew on Wednesday, blaming George W. Bush's daunting lead in
the money race for her demise, she couldn't muster a strong (or
even coherent) stand on campaign finance reform when invited to do
so by Larry King.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Bush is any gutsier. ``Compassionate conservatism'' is
a slogan that, simply translated, means: I'm in favor of charity,
and I'm not Newt Gingrich. But who is Bush? He couldn't bring
himself to help usher the isolationist and Jew-baiting Pat Buchanan
out of the G.O.P. When Bush gave a speech that seemed to stand up
bravely to his party's hard right by spanking Robert Bork, it
turned out that what many saw as a damning reference to Bork's
best-selling screed, ``Slouching Towards Gomorrah,'' was
inadvertent. (``He may not even have realized he was referring to a
book,'' cracked Bork of Bush.)

NORRIS STANDS UP TO TYSON BLUSTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Mike Tyson says he knows why he's at the MGM Grand
Garden Arena Saturday night,
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm bringing the pain, baby,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Orlin Norris knows why he's at the MGM Grand Garden, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they thought I was a good, safe opponent for Mike, but
I'm not,'' the former WBA cruiserweight champion said of Saturday
night's ``Late Night With Mike Show'' on Showtime. ``I'm a good
fighter, a thinking fighter, a smart fighter who isn't afraid of
Mike Tyson or anyone else. I'm nobody's pushover. He said he's
going to bring the pain. So what? I fought a lot of guys who said
that and a lot of guys who never said that and I always felt pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had 55 fights. I don't know of too many times when I
didn't feel the pain. It's part of the game, you know?''
</P>
<P>
   It is indeed, especially when Tyson is involved. Frans Botha
learned that in January when he got cocky after easily winning the
first four-plus rounds of their fight. Botha was on the edge of the
kind of upset that could have finished Tyson as the compelling
figure in a division his presence (or absence) has dominated for
nearly 15 years. But he never got to see that moment because he
made one mistake.
</P>
<P>
   One mistake and Botha felt the pain . . . but only after
somebody woke him up.
</P>
<P>
   By the time they did, more than five minutes had passed since
he'd visited the dark room where punchers like Tyson can send you.
One right hand to the face when Botha made the mistake of standing
in front of his opponent, instead of moving to his left, and he saw
the black lights.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Tyson is being paid $10 million on an evening when
tickets are being sold to MGM employees for the 4 percent sales tax
to try and wallpaper the house. The broadcast is being given away
by Showtime in an effort to rekindle interest in a fading star who
still fascinates the public, but no longer automatically commands
their dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he follows the plan, it's a two-round fight,'' said Tyson's
head trainer, Tommy Brooks. ``If he doesn't, it's a four-round
fight.''
</P>
<P>
   When the 34-year-old Norris hears this he's not happy about it,
although he concedes there are reasons he's a 12-1 underdog. The
most obvious is his lack of size and punching power. Most boxing
experts believe that will preclude Norris from doing what Botha did
in the first four rounds of his fight with Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   Botha was big enough to wrestle with Tyson inside and tie him
up, negating his power in close. He was also able to land with
enough stinging power to stop him short, not truly hurting him but
preventing Tyson from getting into position to throw the crushing
body shot, short uppercut, or booming right that have long been his
trademarks.
</P>
<P>
   Even at that, Botha eventually made a mistake and paid dearly
for it, a mistake Norris insists he can avoid regardless of what
the experts think.
</P>
<P>
   ``You push Mike back, bully him a little bit, and it changes the
whole perspective of the fight,'' said Norris (50-5, 26 KOs).
``He's so used to doing it to other guys, he doesn't like it when
somebody does it to him. He didn't like it when (Evander) Holyfield
did it. He didn't like it when (Buster) Douglas did it. He didn't
like it when Botha did it. The way I look at it, if Holyfield can
do it, I can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference is Holyfield was a proven warrior, a fearless
fighter with an obsession for bringing a little pain himself. Bring
it he did the two nights he was in the ring with Tyson. Can a
journeyman like Norris do the same?
</P>
<P>
   ``Orlin Norris is a good fighter but I don't care how well he's
prepared,'' said Tyson (46-3, 40 KOs). ``I'm prepared to knock him
cold. My timing and speed are much better. I'm throwing sharper
punches.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was younger, I was more of a loose cannon. I thought I
could conquer the world. I didn't think a guy with a gun could beat
me. Now I still feel I can conquer the world, but I know it takes a
lot of hard work and sacrifice. I've done the work. I've made the
sacrifices. I still have a way to go, but just like night follows
day I'm going to be heavyweight champion again.''
</P>
<P>
   To do that, Tyson first has to turn light into night for Norris
after they climb into the well-lit center of the Grand Garden
Arena. If he can, it doesn't mean he's back, but it does mean he
will have brought what he said he was bringing to this job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm bringing the pain, baby,'' Tyson has promised. If he is,
Norris may feel pain like he's never known. If he isn't though,
Orlin Norris could turn into a pain for Mike Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   ``People expect me to box Tyson and take him into the later
rounds and that's what I'll do,'' Norris said. ``The longer the
fight goes, the larger the advantage is for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to have to back him up. If I back him up, I can
fight him on the inside. When he's coming forward, I want to stay
back and defend myself with punches. Tyson's going to hit me and
I'm going to hit him. I'm not afraid of that. When he hits me, I'm
just going to hit him back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see where he's changed much, stylewise, since I beat
him (when both were amateurs 18 years ago). He was easily
frustrated then and he still gets easily frustrated. He's like a
car that has no reverse, but when you're hitting someone in the
face there's nowhere to go but back.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless you get hit in the face yourself like Frans Botha did.
Then there's nowhere to go but to sleep.

 UNDATED: of Bush.)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Those who look down their noses at a former wrestler widely
admire the former Texas Rangers owner for his prowess at raising
money and genial personality. But where's the beef? Everyone's so
exhausted from looking for the cocaine that Bush still need not
offer any other substance. While the Minnesota governor was dourly
cross-examined by George Will on ABC for his Playboy gag about
hoping for reincarnation as a ``38-double-D bra,'' the Texas
governor has been able to finesse his opposition to the test ban
treaty with a three-sentence press release.
</P>
<P>
   Gore does have beef _ detailed policy positions that do not
challenge administration boilerplate so much as tinker around the
edges. He is as timid on the subject of Bill Clinton as Bush is on
Pat Buchanan; he'll no sooner take on a labor union than his
opponent will the NRA. Though Ventura is always condescended to
about the feather boas and Mylar tights he wore in the wrestling
ring, at least he limited his appearances in contrived costumes to
his stints as a paid entertainer; as governor he usually wears
street clothes. By contrast, Gore is now adopting various costumes
while vice president, trying to buff his image by throwing off drab
Washington duds for snazzier suits (if sans Mylar) as well as
chinos and polo shirts. In his search for an ``authentic'' identity
_ a journey ``from wooden to plastic,'' in the words of a New York
Post headline _ the man has morphed into a male model out of a
Dockers or Home Depot ad.
</P>
<P>
   The antidote to Bush's vacuity and Gore's playacting is not
necessarily mere authenticity; Trump, after all, is nothing if not
authentic _ authentically fatuous _ and Ventura can turn
authenticity into shtick, at which point it becomes authentic
boorishness. What's actually needed is leadership, and leadership
sometimes involves telling people what they don't want to hear,
even at the price of crossing pollsters, the triangulating
consultant of the moment or voters.
</P>
<P>
   This week the theoretically insurgent Democratic alternative to
Gore, Bill Bradley, delivered a speech on child poverty in America
full of idealism but scant on outside-the-liberal-box thinking or
calls for real sacrifice from America's haves on behalf of the
have-nots. (If the policy differences between the two Democrats
remain as incremental as they are, their scheduled seven debates
may prove six too many.) At least John McCain, on the Republican
side, is willing to tilt at his own party's orthodoxy on some
issues, like Kosovo and campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Why not go further? In his 1998 race, with a push from
Minnesota's same-day registration law, Ventura drew young,
turned-off voters who are increasingly no-shows in elections, even
after telling state university students that he opposed increasing
tax subsidies to their education. Bill Hillsman, the Minneapolis ad
man who was instrumental in the Ventura campaign, points out that
such twentysomethings are ripe for recruitment into the political
system because, far from being slackers, they're actively involved
in their communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The levels of volunteerism throughout the country among young
people are skyrocketing,'' Hillsman says, and the statistics bear
him out dramatically. While only about 20 percent of Americans
between 18 and 24 voted in the past two elections, nearly 46
percent of that same age bracket volunteered for groups like
Habitat for Humanity in 1998, up from 38 percent in 1995, according
to figures soon to be released by Independent Sector, a coalition
of volunteer organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that so few civic-minded Americans vote is damning _
not of the no-show voters, but of the so-called ``serious''
politicians whose homogenized, flattering platitudes fail to engage
them. At a time when most Americans, not merely the young, take a
pass on Election Day, there may well be an untapped hunger for a
candidate of any stripe, with or without a boa, who instead of
pandering to America will kick it in the pants.

DESPITE 28 TACKLES, THOMAS IS NOT HAPPY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The statistics tell us that Henry Thomas,
the Patriots' right defensive tackle, has 28 tackles, with 13
coming on the first hit. But that doesn't delight the 13-year
veteran out of Louisiana State.
</P>
<P>
   No statistic can please him. The 6-foot-2-inch, 277-pounder from
Houston is like that. Nothing can ever get him to feel that he's
holding his own in the middle of the defensive line, even though
Thomas is, indeed, playing well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm playing below average,'' said Thomas, who is now in his
third year with the team. ``You can't ask me that, though, I'm not
the guy to ask. I'm never happy. I never feel I'm doing great. I'm
never happy. There's always something more I can do.''
</P>
<P>
   What especially gets on Thomas's nerves are his sacks. He has
none, zip, zero. One was taken away from him during the opening
game against the Jets. A half-sack for a 3-yard loss was withdrawn
from next to his name after last week's game against the Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to improve my pass rush. I don't have any sacks. I've
got to get (Denver's Brian Griese) to the ground. That's my whole
plan. I've got to get this quarterback down,'' Thomas said about
his goal for Sunday when the Broncos come to town.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The statistics people) said other people (reached the
quarterback) before me. I'm not even going to argue about it, it
just gets me madder. I've been getting back there, getting some
decent rushes, but I do have to improve a lot on my pass rush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking about getting past my man, so it kind of makes me
slow down, and miss some sacks, and not be in position I should be
in. That's what I've been working on for the past two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas is playing despite a broken left baby toe. He's not sure
exactly how it happened, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an occupation hazard,'' he said. ``After Sunday's game,
it was a little sore, so we X-rayed it and it was broken.''
</P>
<P>
   He's still practicing while wearing a special shoe that will
keep the toe from being smashed again. ``There's not a whole lot
you can do with it, but just put ice on it,'' Thomas said. ``It
hurts, but 13 years of doing this, some of the pain is different
than others. I just tape the little toe to another toe and it's
OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas sprained his ankle in the seventh game last season. ``It
was where the ligaments get stretched out really bad,'' he said.
``When I played with that, I had to walk on crutches for two days
and there were some days I couldn't get up. I couldn't put any
weight on it, it was that bad, so when it came to going to
practice, it was forget about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's game should be interesting. The Patriots have a 4-2
record, having lost their last two outings, and the Broncos have a
2-4 record and have mustered wins in their last two games,
including last week's 31-10 decision over visiting Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Griese completed 19 of 31 passes for 363 yards with two
touchdowns and an interception against the Packers. Tailback
Olandis Gary, stepping in for the injured Terrell Davis, ran for
124 yards on 37 carries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week, (Griese) played great, he had a good command, a
good feel for the game,'' said Thomas. ``He made the checks and he
didn't make a lot of mistakes. It's been a gradual improvement.
I've seen him getting better each week. The last game gave him
confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Griese has completed 56.8 percent of his passes (100 of 176)
with seven touchdowns and seven interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Patriots won't have to worry about Davis, Thomas
knows their problems are far from over. ``Gary runs the ball in the
same style (as Davis), the same pound-you-to-the-ground-type
runner. He's going to get to the point where he sees those backside
cuts and he'll be gone,'' Thomas said. ``He's gaining confidence.
He's just starting out, but it will take a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone's in the hole, though, they'll both pop you, so you
have to bring them down.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Parcells likes to say, ``You are what you are.'' And Arthur
Pappas will tell you in a hurry that Pedro Martinez and Nomar
Garciaparra are special.
</P>
<P>
   ``They gave us some extraordinary performances,'' said Pappas,
the Red Sox' team doctor who helped negotiate the two star players
through injury and into the lineup when both could have easily
decided to stay on the bench rather than risk further injury. ``I
don't know of any other pitcher who could have done what Pedro did
in the playoffs,'' Pappas said Friday, referring to Martinez
pitching with a strained back muscle. ``He is one of these rare
human beings who can have his brain control his muscles. If he
couldn't, there is no way he could have gone on and did what he
did. He changed his whole way of throwing after the injury, and
still went out and pitched all of those (17) scoreless innings. It
was remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nomar had a very badly bruised and swollen (right) wrist. If
he swung and missed the ball, it really hurt him. And the
difficulty he had in the field throwing the ball can probably be
attributed to the injury. When he went to his right to field a
ground ball and then had to jump and throw the ball across his body
to first, it really hurt. The motion where he had to roll his wrist
toward his little finger caused him a lot of pain. Both of them
deserve a lot of credit for what they did.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra was hit on the right wrist Sept. 25. ``He damaged
the tendon and the nerve in the wrist,'' Pappas said. ``He had five
days rest before he played again. We injected the area, but when he
first came back it started to hurt more. It became more sensitive.
But he didn't want to sit out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pedro strained the muscle under his right shoulder blade. It's
a very important muscle for the throwing motion. He could not raise
his arm to throw with the same motion he used during the season. He
adapted his entire body to be able to pitch. Before he went in to
relieve in the (fifth and final) game in Cleveland, I told him I
thought he could go two to three innings. He went six scoreless.
Then he pitched seven scoreless against the Yankees last Saturday,
with a changed motion. He couldn't throw as hard, but he adapted to
what his body would allow him to do with the injury.''
</P>
<P>
   Pappas spoke to Martinez Friday before the pitcher left for his
Dominican home. ``I gave him a set of exercises. He will be back
here to be checked in either late November or early December,'' he
said. ``I think with rest and the right exercise, he will be fine.
No surgery. I think it will be the same with Nomar. That wrist just
needs some rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'm very pleased with progress of Ramon Martinez. He has
really done well. He, too, has a set of exercises, different than
Pedro, because his involves the rotator cuff. Both Pedro and Ramon
always stay in great shape and work hard, so you know they will do
everything to be ready.''

   Worse players. Better games. That's the way it is in the
National Football League this season, where the running game has
virtually vanished. Don't think the Patriots are the only ones who
can't run the football. There are only a handful of teams that can.
At this point in the season, would you believe that 41 percent of
the games have been decided by 3 points or fewer? Just a year ago,
it was only 27 percent. And how about 63 percent of the games,
nearly two out of every three, decided by 8 points or fewer?
</P>
<P>
   ``We love it out here,'' said Robert Walker, who works with the
sports book at the Mirage in Las Vegas. ``The underdogs have been
winning (on the point) spread more than ever, and the heavy hitters
(big gamblers) like to bet the favorites, so it's been going great
so far.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL is suffering from a trickle-down effect. There are not
enough good quarterbacks to support 31 teams. And you can count the
number of quarterbacks anyone would put the label ``great'' on with
one hand. Steve Young is nearly finished in San Francisco. Dan
Marino is hurting in Miami, and not the Dan of old. John Elway has
retired. Randall Cunningham, last year's star, has been benched.
Vinny Testaverde, Pro Bowler of a year ago, is out for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Just take a look at the AFC West. Here are the five starters:
Jon Kitna (Seattle), Brian Griese (Denver), Elvis Grbac (Kansas
City), Erik Kramer (San Diego), and Rich Gannon (Oakland). How
about AFC Central: Stoney Case (Baltimore), Tim Couch (Cleveland),
Jeff Blake (Cincinnati), Neil O'Donnell (Tennessee), Kordell
Stewart (Pittsburgh), and a hurting (bad ribs) Mark Brunell
(Jacksonville), who has three touchdown passes to date.
</P>
<P>
   Only two teams are averaging better than 30 points, both in the
NFC, Washington with Brad Johnson and St. Louis with Kurt Warner.
Only one team in the AFC is even averaging 25 points per game,
Miami (28.0), and it will be going with Damon Huard at quarterback
for the immediate future. The trickle-down comes with opposing
defensive coordinators disregarding any respect they have for the
running game, and forcing teams to throw. No one can run anymore. A
year ago this time, in the sixth week of '98, there were 124
rushing touchdowns scored in 81 games. This year, there were just
109 scored in 86 games. Teams are not hesitating to bring a safety,
usually held back to defend the pass, up to play the run. Just
watch Lawyer Milloy, the best in the league at what he does, flying
around the field for the Patriots. He's leading the team in tackles
from the safety position.
</P>
<P>
   The league tried to make it harder for kickers this year,
forcing them to use new footballs every game. New balls are
supposedly harder to kick than old ones. Wrong. There are 262 field
goals already this year (in fewer games) compared to 229 a year
ago. Get used to it. There's a greater lack of quality quarterbacks
than ever. Between free agency and the salary cap, this is the NFL
game of the future. The rosters are thin. The talent too spread
out. There will be fewer beatings and closer games. The better
quarterbacks get beat up over time with everyone rushing the
passer. Brett Favre's Packers are averaging 20.4 points per game;
Doug Flutie's Bills, 19.7 per game; and Jake Plummer's Arizona
Cardinals, 13.7 per game.
</P>
<P>
   Jake Plummer? Wasn't he the ``next coming'' in the preseason
magazines? Before you get too tough on Drew Bledsoe, you better
take a good look around and see who everyone else has to play with.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Here is the latest on Byron Dafoe from Harry Sinden: ``At the
request of an outside source, and I'm not going to say who that is,
I called Dafoe up and gave him this offer, after saying I wouldn't
do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would raise our initial offer of $3 million a year, to
$3,150,000 a year, and would throw in another $150,000 if he just
did what he did a year ago _ win one playoff round. The $3,150,000
was guaranteed, and if he won the playoff round, he would get $3.3
million. I told him, `Take this offer,' and I gave him 24 hours to
do it. He came back in with another proposal, which, if we accepted
it, and he did what he did last year, win one playoff round, would
have averaged out to $4,996,000 a year. I told him to forget it.
Our offer was non-negotiable. Our offer has gone back to $3 million
a year. The other one was pulled off the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden thinks the assertion that the Bruins are winless over
their first nine games because the present players are lamenting
Dafoe and Dimitri Khristich is laughable. ``Players are interested
in themselves. It has always been that way,'' Sinden said. ``The
first thing that they are interested in is their own well-being. We
have a lot of guys coming up for new contracts next year. You don't
think they are trying to bust a gut to score every goal and get
every point they can? How do you come in and talk about wanting
more money when you have nothing to show for it?''

   Robin Ventura may not have been happy when his jubiliant
teammates wouldn't let him round the bases on what should have been
a game-winning grand slam last Sunday, but thousands of gamblers
were thrilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never seen anything like it,'' said Walker of the
Mirage. ``The over/under on the game was 7 1/2 runs. Almost all of
the action was on the under. When the score ended, 4-3, Mets, the
people who had the under won. And almost everyone bet on the under.
I'd say that it cost us $200,000 at least here in Vegas, and the
rest of the country and the Caribbean would add up to millions. The
bettors came away happy.''
</P>
<P>
   With the score tied at 3 and the bases loaded in the bottom of
the 15th inning against the Braves, Ventura hit the ball out of the
park. Home run, almost always. That should have made the score 7-3,
New York, and a total of 10 runs, which would have made the over
bettors the winners. Instead, they became losers when Ventura was
stopped by his teammates between first and second base and never
went any farther. ``We held up paying off the bet for 30 minutes,
making sure the official score was going to be 4-3. It was,'' said
Walker. ``If he had just gone to second base and touched it, it
would have been 5-3, and we (the book) would have made the money.''

   Matt Damon is a classy guy. The movie superstar, who was part of
the celebrity home run hitting contest during the All-Star Game
weekend in Fenway Park in July, is sending groundskeeper Joe Mooney
to the Boston College-Notre Dame game in South Bend, Ind., next
month. Mooney has been a big Notre Dame fan his whole life. Damon,
a Cambridge native, was given the run of the park by Mooney that
week and wanted to respond to Mooney's kindness. A friend mentioned
Mooney's love for Notre Dame, so Damon is sending him on the trip,

former Boston College basketball coach, now at Ohio State, recently
agreed to an eight-year extension, which a Columbus, Ohio, paper
pegs at $833,000 per year. That comes to $6.64 million if he
collects all of it. Obie gets $175,000 in base pay; $200,000 for a
TV show; $233,333 from Nike; and $75,000 for radio.

   It is not unheard of for marketing consultants, whose mission is
searching tirelessly for creative ways to stand out from the crowd,
to go, shall it be said, a wee bit over the top.
</P>
<P>
   A case in point: a square gray envelope that appeared in the
mail last week, adorned with cryptic doodlings and a crimson circle
in the dead center containing the address. On the flap was a single
word, Play, in a loose freehand.
</P>
<P>
   That, it transpires, is the new name of a Richmond consulting
firm formerly called Opus Marketing. The change ``gives clarity to
the company's business approach,'' the announcement explains
helpfully. The company's founder, Andy Stefanovich, whose official
title apparently is ``In Charge of What's Next,'' is quoted as
saying, ``Play is not simply a name, but a brand and business
philosophy that evolved from our creative development process.''
</P>
<P>
   It gets better. ``Play is not simply a company brand,'' the
announcement elaborates. ``Play is a practice, an ideology, a
vision, a movement. Play is flexible and organic in its application
and theory.''
</P>
<P>
   The headline on the announcement mentions a ``unique IPO to
launch a new era.'' But no, the company isn't going public. ``Play
is so much more than a name change,'' Stefanovich is further quoted
as saying, that ``we felt it required as momentous an announcement
as a traditional IPO, emulating its size and scope.''
</P>
<P>
   So the company is doing, yes, an ``Initial Play Offering.'' An
unlimited number of ``shares'' of the company's creativity are
offered at $0 a share to those who register on the company's Web
site. Those who sign up are actually joining an electronic mailing
list to receive ``valuable e-mail updates on creativity in
business'' from the company.
</P>
<P>
   The company describes its new logo as an image of a red
playground ball (``Smell the rubber. Hear the bounce.'') followed
by a line. For their business cards and stationery, employees are
supposed to write the company's name on the line in their own hand.
(``Play your way.'')
</P>
<P>
   The significance of the company's Web address,
www.lookatmorestuff.com, is left unexplained.

GEORGE HILL III, AD AGENCY CO-FOUNDER, DIES AT 67 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   George (Jay) Hill III, one of the leading figures in New England
advertising and a co-founder of Boston ad agency Hill Holliday
Connors Cosmopulos, died Friday of cancer. He was 67.
</P>
<P>
   A self-described ``tongue-tied Yankee,'' Mr. Hill often let his
work do his talking, creating ads for everything from Vermont
condominiums to Kansas politicians and luxury cars.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, ad campaigns he helped create received some of
the highest honors the advertising trade bestows. In an industry
with New York at its epicenter, Mr. Hill often forced Madison
Avenue to take notice and pay attention to Boston, said Adweek New
England editor Judy Warner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jay Hill was one of the first people to bring New England
advertising to a national level,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Warner, Mr. Hill pioneered some of the ad world's
present-day vocabulary, his ideas then turned into cliches by a
subsequent generation of copycat admirers.
</P>
<P>
   About a decade ago, a creative team under Mr. Hill's command
developed a campaign called ``Real life, real answers'' for John
Hancock Financial Services.
</P>
<P>
   The realism and intimacy of that campaign was regarded as a
breakthrough by the industry, and the ad was honored with a Grand
Prix award from the prestigious Cannes Festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jay Hill was, among other things, a great writer,'' agency
cofounder Jack Connors recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The community has lost the greatest ad copywriter I've ever
seen,'' added Steve Cosmopulos, another agency cofounder.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, Mr. Hill helped develop a 1978 Super Bowl ad for Wang
Laboratories; it was believed to have been the first time a
high-tech company advertised during the big game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wang ads changed the way that high-tech companies did their
advertising, and John Hancock ads did the same for financial
services companies,'' Warner said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, it was not readily apparent that Mr. Hill was destined
for advertising greatness. In that year, he threw in $1,500, along
with three other men to open a new Boston ad agency.
</P>
<P>
   The agency was called Hill Holliday Connors Cosmopulos, and its
small office kept a bucket full of dimes handy so if its telephone
line was tied up, business could be conducted on the pay phones on
Newbury Street.
</P>
<P>
   If Connors was the salesman who could make the successful pitch,
Mr. Hill was ``the guy who did the ads,'' his wife, Virginia Graham
Drew Hill, recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Among the early clients for whom Mr. Hill did ads were such
politicians as former Boston Mayor Kevin H. White and former US
Senator Bob Dole, a Kansas Republican.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has come a long way. Thirty years after that bucket
of dimes, and three years after Mr. Hill retired as chairman, Hill
Holliday was sold to New York communications conglomerate, the
Interpublic Group of Cos.
</P>
<P>
   The price tag for that transaction was estimated at more than
$100 million. By the time of the sale in 1998, Hill Holliday was
the second largest ad agency in New England, with $707 million in
capitalized billings for that year.
</P>
<P>
   Today the agency creates ads for such clients as Dunkin' Donuts
Inc., Fleet Boston Corp., Fidelity Investments, as well as John
Hancock.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising is nothing if not a collaborative art, and Connors
recalled that Mr. Hill had a personal comfort level that allowed
him to surround himself with extraordinary talent.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Hill may have been quiet and confident but he also had a sly
wit about him. In its early years, the agency was trying to create
an ad campaign for a developer of Vermont condominiums at a time
when few people knew what a condominium was.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Hill's ad for the condos read: ``All the advantages of
upcountry life but none of the horse manure.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Hill was born in Cambridge and grew up in Brookline. He was
a graduate of Harvard University and served in the Army. When not
creating ads, he often devoted much of his spare time to the
Massachusetts Horticultural Society.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife, Mr. Hill leaves three sons, David of Berkeley,
Calif., John of Bluemont, Va., and Peter of New York City. He also
leaves two sisters, Stacie Barta of South Hampton, N.Y., and
Elizabeth Pitney of Durham, N.C., and three grandchildren.

NEWLY MINTED STOCK DROPS $85, BUT STILL ENDS DAY UP 386 PERCENT

<TEXT>
<P>
   It is not often that a stock can drop $85 in an afternoon and
still be a spectacular success, but it happened Friday to Sycamore
Networks Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Sycamore's highly anticipated initial public offering was priced
at $38 but began trading at $270.875. The shares closed at $184.75,
an increase of 386 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Sycamore ended the day with a market value of $14.4 billion, far
more than the $9.5 billion value of 3Com Corp., a larger and older
maker of communications equipment.
</P>
<P>
   But Sycamore, based in Chelmsford, Mass., is considered the
leader among a new breed of small companies that are developing
equipment to enhance the efficiency and functionality of optical
communications networks, which transmit bits of data using pulses
of light rather than electricity. Sycamore was also the first of
the group to offer stock to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The offering was underwritten by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter,
Lehman Brothers, J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. and Dain Rauscher Wessels. At
$38, the offering price could be considered aggressive, especially
for a company that did not exist two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the stock opened at 12:45 p.m. amid what one person
close to the deal described as a ``feeding frenzy.'' Within 15
minutes, the stock rose to about $200, where it remained for most
of the afternoon. About 7.5 million shares were sold in the
offering, or about 10 percent of the company, and 9.9 million
shares traded hands Friday. It appeared that most of the
institutional investors who had been able to buy at the offering
price sold quickly to those who had been shut out.
</P>
<P>
   The day's explosive trading could raise questions about whether
the deal's underwriters left money on the table that went to the
initial institutional buyers of the stock rather than to Sycamore.
</P>
<P>
   From Sycamore's perspective, however, more than $280 million was
raised, and the primary purpose of the offering was to create a
publicly traded currency. That currency can set a floor for
negotiations should Sycamore agree to be acquired and could allow
Sycamore to pursue acquisitions of its own more easily.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the value of their holdings, Sycamore's top executives
could even pursue corporate acquisitions on a personal basis. Desh
Deshpande, the company's chairman, holds about 16.3 million shares
_ about 21 percent of the company _ now worth about $3 billion.
Daniel E. Smith, the chief executive, holds about 14.7 million
shares, worth roughly $2.7 billion.

APPEALS COURT SAYS KLAN CANNOT WEAR MASKS AT RALLY

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal appeals court blocked a lower court
decision on Friday and barred the Ku Klux Klan from rallying in
lower Manhattan on Saturday with their faces shielded by masks. The
decision was a victory for the Giuliani administration.
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
rejected the Klan's arguments that a state law that bars the
wearing of masks during most rallies violated its members' First
Amendment rights.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the Klan group, the Church of the American Knights
of the Ku Klux Klan, had argued that if its members were forced to
unmask themselves, they faced retaliation because of their
unpopular views.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York
Civil Liberties Union, which is representing the group, said his
clients were considering an emergency appeal to Justice Ruth Bader
Ginsburg of the U.S. Supreme Court in the hope that she might
overturn the appeals court order.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel also said that the American Knights plan to proceed with
their demonstration from 2 to 4 p.m. Saturday outside the State
Supreme Court at 60 Centre St., although he refused to say whether
the group would abide by the law and remove masks. The two Klan
members who are organizing the rally and who testified in a court
hearing on Thursday were in Siegel's offices Friday night, but
would not grant interviews, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who was in Indianapolis on a political
visit on Friday, praised the ruling. ``I can't imagine a better
victory for decency and common sense,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court of appeals has upheld the wisdom of the police
department saying this is an organization that wore masks in order
to kill people,'' he said. ``The police department has a public
safety reason that's very, very sound in saying that you should not
be able to do that in hiding, anonymously.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani also repeated his criticism of the lower court ruling
on Thursday night, when two U.S. District Court judges, sitting
together, ordered the city to allow the Klan to wear masks in the
rally, and elicited a promise from a top city lawyer that no
arrests would be made, despite the state law.
</P>
<P>
   In the court of appeals Friday, Siegel argued that the mask law
violated the Constitution because the Supreme Court has held that
there is a right to anonymous free expression.
</P>
<P>
   But the judges, signaling that they saw the case as a close one,
sided with the Giuliani administration, which had contended that
the law did not single out Klan members but was on the books to
make it more difficult for any demonstrator to engage in wrongdoing
or violence because he might have felt emboldened by anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are mindful that this case raises difficult questions of
law and perhaps questions not as simple as sometimes portrayed,''
said Judge Jose A. Cabranes, who announced the ruling from the
bench in the name of the full panel, which also included Judges
Amalya L. Kearse and Roger J. Miner.
</P>
<P>
   Cabranes indicated that the panel found no error or abuse in
discretion by the lower court when it found that the enforcement of
the mask law by the police had not been based on the content of the
Klan members' speech, which would be impermissible under the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   But Cabranes said that the panel had concluded that the Klan
case was not the same as others in which the Supreme Court had
found certain activity, such as anonymous pamphleteering, to be
protected under the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We conclude that this case is distinguishable,'' he said,
``from those cases in which the Supreme Court has protected the
anonymity of organizations and individuals seeking to exercise
their First Amendment right to association and speech.''

(DW)
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   In a rare and embarrassing reversal, a federal health advisory
panel Friday withdrew its recommendation that all infants be
immunized against the virus that causes a severe form of diarrhea
after the vaccine was linked to a painful and potentially fatal
bowel obstruction.
</P>
<P>
   The action comes a year after the government licensed the
rotavirus vaccine, and three months after it abruptly suspended its
use because of reports that some babies who took it were coming
down with the bowel condition. A week ago the manufacturer,
American Home Products of Madison, N.J., withdrew the vaccine from
the market.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
said new scientific studies showed that the vaccine, Rotashield,
appeared to cause the bowel obstruction in about 1 in 5,000
recipients.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the suspension in July, the advisory panel's formal
position until Friday had been that all infants in the United
States should receive three doses of the vaccine, at 2, 4 and 6
months of age. Rotashield is the world's first and only licensed
vaccine against rotavirus, though it is not being used in other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's action was taken by a committee appointed by the
secretary of health and human services and known as the Advisory
Committee on Immunization Practices to the CDC. It is led by Dr.
John F. Modlin of Dartmouth Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   Of the panel's 12 members, only 4 voted, all for the
recommendation; others were absent because of emergencies or
abstained because of ties to the manufacturer or other conflicts of
interest, a centers spokeswoman said. Three representatives of
government health agencies who were present also endorsed the
recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Livengood, an official with the disease centers'
immunizatiram, said in an interview that the panel's vote
reflected a stepped-up review of scientific evidence ``from a
variety of sources, all of which showed a strong causal
association'' between the rotavirus vaccine and the bowel
condition, intussusception.
</P>
<P>
   The condition, rare in the United States, results when a section
of bowel slides inward, like a telescope, into another section. The
new studies found that intussusception usually began three to seven
days after vaccination with Rotashield.
</P>
<P>
   The disease centers received reports of 102 confirmed or
strongly suggestive cases of intussusception. There was a strong
increase in such cases within three to seven days after the first
or second dose, Livengood said; vaccinated babies were 25 times as
likely to develop intussusception in the three to seven days after
the first dose as those who did not receive it. The risk was not
increased after the third dose.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's action applies only to the United States, and
Rotashield may yet be used in other countries. Around the world,
rotavirus is the most common cause of severe gastroenteritis in
infants and young children, and it is said to be the biggest killer
of children, causing 600,000 to 800,000 deaths a year.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, by contrast, it causes just 20 deaths a
year, although it is also responsible for 50,000 hospitalizations
and 500,000 visits to a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   In the panel discussions Friday, there was concern that the
decision not be seen as closing the door on use of Rotashield in
third world countries, where rotavirus diarrhea is more severe,
Livengood said.
</P>
<P>
   The World Health Organization, an agency of the United Nations
in Geneva, is expected to convene a panel of experts in January to
help third world countries assess the risks and benefits of
rotavirus disease and vaccine complications in developing their own
strategies on the use of Rotashield.
</P>
<P>
   The federal panel also did not want to discourage research to
develop another rotavirus vaccine. Eight such vaccines are in
various stages of development, said another federal agency, the
National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. One is
being tested in infants in Finland.
</P>
<P>
   The developments surrounding Rotashield are highly embarrassing
to federal health officials, in part because the vaccine was 23
years in development and much of the work was done at the National
Institutes of Health. The vaccine is derived from a rotavirus that
causes diarrhea in monkeys but is thought to be harmless to humans.
</P>
<P>
   Livengood estimated that four to five years would be the soonest
that another rotavirus vaccine could be approved for marketing. The
problem with Rotashield indicates that ``other vaccines might be
subject to more scrutiny as they come along,'' he said, ``and that
would require an even longer review process and more data
pre-licensure to check for this adverse event.''
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control advised those seeking
information on how to prevent rotavirus diarrhea to consult its Web
site, www.cdc.gov.

   CHICAGO _ When the lights went out in this city last summer, the
only roar more ferocious than Mayor Richard M. Daley's was John W.
Rowe's. And he is chairman and chief executive of Commonwealth
Edison, the company responsible.
</P>
<P>
   ``This level of service under these conditions is a disgrace to
us,'' he told the press, outdoing even the mayor. ``It's a personal
disgrace to me. I will not tolerate it, and you will not tolerate
it, and you will not have to.''
</P>
<P>
   In an industry known for colorless chief executives, Rowe has
made himself visible by wielding a blunt stick and an even blunter
tongue.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very candid,'' says Frank Clark, a senior vice president.
``At first, we thought he was just putting us on, but then he kept
on doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   With a passion for ancient art and history, Rowe is inspired by
pharaohs, emperors and kings. ``I'm not arrogant enough to think
about what Caesar would do, but I might think of Ptolemy,'' he
said, referring to the Egyptian leader.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office a year ago, he has campaigned to remake his
own domain, a utility with a history of regulatory and reliability
woes. ``If everything had been nice and tidy at Com Ed I wouldn't
have gotten the job,'' says Rowe, who is 54.
</P>
<P>
   Rowe did not create the problems at Com Ed, nor has he resolved
them all. But in the past year, he has won praise for helping
rejuvenate a costly, inefficient fleet of nuclear plants. He has
also sold off six coal-fired generating plants for $4.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   His biggest move came a month ago, when Unicom, the Com Ed
parent company that he also leads, agreed to a $16 billion merger
with Peco Energy of Philadelphia, nearly doubling Unicom's size to
five million customers. Rowe will be co-chief executive, then have
the job to himself in a few years when his counterpart retires.
</P>
<P>
   Rowe says he is trying to create a new kind of utility, one that
will emerge out of an era of sweeping deregulation and
restructuring to sell and distribute power across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're designed to go national,'' he said. ``Everyone's for
sale, and the question is: How do you get enough scale to be a
survivor in the energy and distribution business?''
</P>
<P>
   The most vexing problem may be reliability. The blackouts in
Chicago last summer provoked lawsuits. Rowe says he's received more
than a few complaints from big customers like the Chicago Board of
Trade. ``It was the most miserable time for me,'' he said over
lunch. ``It was humiliating because we made ourselves a standard of
incompetence.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, Rowe has fired top executives, and fired off
articles to the company's newsletter, under headlines like
``Confidence Shaken, Credibility Shattered.''
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, he agreed to visit a housing project for the
elderly on the north side of Chicago, only to discover that the
news media had found out and showed up with cameras whirring.
</P>
<P>
   Before Rowe stepped out of his Jeep Cherokee, his press aide
asked if he wanted to dodge the frenzy, but he brushed off the
suggestion and walked right into a media pit, only to find a frail
old lady looking up at him wearing a T-shirt that read: ``Chicago
Housing Tenant Patrol.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowe smiled and introduced himself, and the woman said, ``We are
the ones who run up and down the stairs when the lights go out.''
</P>
<P>
   After consoling the woman, Rowe told a gathering of about 40
senior citizens that he was looking into getting them a portable
generator as a backup. ``It isn't something I can just go around
promising, but we'd like to do something to help you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His own roots are in the Midwest. He was born on a small farm in
southwestern Wisconsin, and went to a one-room schoolhouse. There,
in the fifth grade, he fell in love with the ancient world after
reading a history of the Taj Mahal.
</P>
<P>
   His office is now decked with ancient artifacts, including an
Egyptian mummy sarcophagus, 2,600 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got that to reward myself for getting the job here,'' says
Rowe, who also wears a large ring that bears the likeness of
Athena, the Greek goddess. He is in his third marriage.
</P>
<P>
   In his early years, he thought about becoming a physicist but
ended up studying law at the University of Wisconsin. After
graduation, he went to work in Chicago at Isham, Lincoln &AMP; Beale
(the law firm of Robert Todd Lincoln), and found himself working on
regulatory and bankruptcy matters.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, he helped to pull a big Milwaukee-based railroad
out of bankruptcy. In 1980, he became general counsel at Conrail.
Four years later, at 38, he became chief executive at the Central
Maine Power Co. when that utility was in upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, he left to become chief of the New England Electric
System, which he calls the only company he has taken over that was
not in crisis.
</P>
<P>
   At Com Ed, he is trying to solve problems and restore
confidence. Com Ed recently released a self-critical 850-page study
of its foul-ups. At an executive meeting earlier this month, he
talked of the need for a ``cultural revolution'' in the company's
electric distribution, to avoid blackouts.
</P>
<P>
   There was also a proposal to acquire a company, code-named
Constantinople for confidentiality. Rowe asked whether the Com Ed
executives were trying to curry favor by finding a name that played
to his historical and managerial outlook. ``It does appeal to your
interest in Byzantine empires,'' one executive joked.
</P>
<P>
   Rowe then smiled and said, ``If your next acquisition is named
Delos, I'm going to realize this was not accidental.'' &QL;

GILLETTE SHARES DROP 5% ON PROFIT FEARS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Shares in Gillette Co. fell 5 percent Friday in heavy trading
after the Boston-based maker of razors, batteries, and small
appliances said Thursday it would be hit with an unexpected drop in
fourth-quarter earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette insists that it will rebound to its customary
impressive form some time next year, but the company's fourth
warning about profits since the spring prompted many Wall Street
analyst to lower their earnings forecasts for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   According to First Call Corp., nearly all the analysts who
follow Gillette lowered their full-year earnings estimates for 2000
Friday. The consensus estimate had been $1.41 per share; after the
revisions, many analysts now expect Gillette to earn about $1.29 a
share for 2000, First Call said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a significant downward revision for a company in the
consumer staple business,'' said Charles L. Hill, First Call's
director of research.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Gillette said it would not meet expectations for
the fourth quarter, in part, because of a plan to cut razor-blade
shipments as a result of new inventory management techniques
adopted by many European retailers.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, Gillette has been buffeted by economic
turmoil in some of its overseas markets and by unfavorable currency
exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
   While its razor, oral care, and Duracell battery businesses have
been generally strong, Gillette's Braun appliance division and its
stationery business have been a drag on the company.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette also said Thursday it would consider selling or
discontinuing its stationery lines and some of its Braun appliance
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Eric Kraus said that with Gillette taking appropriate
corrective measures to address its challenges, ``things bode very
well for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward Jones analyst Tony Vento suggested that Gillette was
attempting to contain all its problems to 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want a clean slate for 2000,'' said Vento, adding, ``No
question, investors are growing increasingly impatient.''
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, Gillette shares closed at 36,
down 1 7/8. That was an improvement over the low point shares hit
in after-hours trading following Gillette's warning Thursday. At
one point, shares traded at 33 1/2 on Instinet.

 &HT;    La. governor eases through campaign
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ He's surely one of the calmest incumbents on
record.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana Gov. Mike Foster was so sure he would be re-elected to
a second term today that he has refused all invitations to debate
his challengers. He has spent little time touring the state to drum
up support. And he hasn't come close to exhausting his $3 million
war chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows what he stands for,'' said Trey Williams,
Foster's campaign manager. ``He doesn't want to waste his time in a
debate with opponents beating on him for an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Several challengers have accused Foster of being afraid to
debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He cannot stand toe to toe with William Jefferson,'' said John
LaPlace, campaign manager for U.S. Rep. William Jefferson (D-New
Orleans), who is Foster's main challenger.
</P>
<P>
   Another Democratic candidate, Phil Preis, has sent a mascot
dressed as a duck around the state to make his point that Foster
has been ``ducking'' debate opportunities. The mascot mockingly
plays off Foster's love of duck hunting. Preis even sent the duck
to the governor's mansion in Baton Rouge on Wednesday. Foster
invited the duck inside for coffee and cookies.
</P>
<P>
   Pundits agree Foster's campaign slogan could have been, ``I'd
rather be duck hunting.'' While his challengers campaigned, the
governor spent Friday shopping for a motorcycle for his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Election officials predicted a light turnout in an election that
includes statewide offices _ including two held by indicted
incumbents _ and 10 proposed constitutional amendments.
</P>
<P>
   Several polls indicated Foster would win in today's election,
which pits all 12 candidates against each other, regardless of
political party. If no candidate gets more than 50 percent, there
will be a Nov. 20 runoff. If Foster wins as predicted, then he'll
be free to pick up his gun and head for the swamps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Foster will be in the blinds when the season opens
rather than sweating out the final week of a runoff campaign,''
predicted Jack Wardlaw, a columnist for the New Orleans
Times-Picayune.
</P>
<P>
   Foster, a pro-business, pro-gun, anti-abortion Republican, has
the good fortune of serving Louisiana during a time of prosperity.
The state is doing better economically than it has in 30 years. And
he is credited with creating more jobs, reducing sales taxes and
renewing interest in improving the state's dismal record on
education.
</P>
<P>
   If not for the good economic times, a strong Democratic
challenger might have had a chance against Foster. But Jefferson's
lackluster campaign has not threatened Foster's wide lead in the
polls. Observers say it's because he is a black candidate in a
state that has never had a black governor, and because he is from
New Orleans. The rest of the state tends to view the Big Easy as
too liberal. In polls, Jefferson gets roughly 20 percent of the
vote.
</P>
<P>
   But La Place said polls usually underestimate black votes and
that Jefferson's support is broader than it seems.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time since 1975 that we've had an incumbent
who is popular and an economy that's going well,'' said Wayne
Parent, a political science professor at Louisiana State
University. ``Everyone is asking, where are the fireworks?''

AS AN ERA ENDS, FINANCE INDUSTRY ENTERS UNKNOWN TERRITORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (With BANKS-CONGRESS and related stories.) 
(mk) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   During the careers of every living executive in the finance
industry, bankers have made loans, brokers have sold stocks,
insurers have underwritten policies to protect against disasters,
and, with exceptions that sometimes made headlines, they rarely
trespassed on one another's turf.
</P>
<P>
   This gentlemanly division of labor was designed to make sure
that a catastrophic failure in one part of the finance industry did
not invade every other part _ or, more precisely, that a stock
market crash would not undermine the entire financial system as its
did in 1929. It worked, and it has more or less endured: Even
today, after a decade that has witnessed unprecedented
consolidation and diversification in finance, it is not inaccurate
to think of Chase Manhattan as a lender, Merrill Lynch as a broker
and Prudential as an insurer, though they all do other things as
well.
</P>
<P>
   But with Congress about to consign the rules that underlie that
tripartite division of financial services to history, industry
executives and analysts say it's only a matter of time before
changes already under way mean that the largest financial companies
will offer many ways of saving, investing, borrowing and protecting
money under one roof. The Europeans call this a universal bank, and
many believe American firms are moving headlong in that direction.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in bank, insurance and securities companies soared Friday
on merger speculation. The biggest winners were life insurance
companies, which some saw as prime targets of banks hoping to offer
insurance policies to their customers. Investors see banks and Wall
Street firms as effectively in play as well, though industry
executives said that change may come slower than Friday's market
reaction suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers stand to gain from the convenience of finding every
financial product they need in one place, often for less money than
they are accustomed to pay. But consumer groups have already begun
to raise red flags about privacy in a world in which the same
company insures a customer for both sickness and early death, or
tracks how much debt a client is incurring through mortgages,
credit cars and margin loans. The financial provider as big brother
might theoretically discriminate against providing life insurance
for people with shaky medical histories, or inundate those who owe
lots of money with high-cost loans.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of one-stop shopping, of course, is not a new one.
American Express, the credit card company, already lets clients
trade stocks. Merrill Lynch already provides home mortgages and
business loans. And Citigroup, an agglomeration of a bank, a
securities firm and an insurance company, is the antithesis of what
lawmakers sought to achieve in the 1930s, when legislation to
divide the industry into heavily regulated fiefdoms was first
enacted.
</P>
<P>
   But while counter-examples abound, the practical difficulties of
cross-selling and merging across industry lines have kept American
financial companies from selling the broad range of products their
European counterparts do. In particular, the repeal of
Glass-Steagall will make it far easier for banks, insurers and
brokerage firms to introduce new lines of business without going
through legal loopholes like setting up Bermudan subsidiaries to
underwrite insurance polices, or buying thrift companies in order
to sell banklike products through the back door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over time, as firms fully understand the implications of this
change, it will stimulate consolidation,'' said David Komansky,
chairman and chief executive of Merrill Lynch. ``For us and the
other major securities firms, it clearly opens a range of strategic
alternatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Few expect the financial landscape to change overnight.
Consumers tend to remain loyal to their local bank or family stock
broker longer than economic models predict. Moreover, some banks
may not want to sell health insurance anymore than the Gap wants to
sell television sets.
</P>
<P>
   But the catch phrase in the banking industry is ``deepening
share of wallet.'' When a bank is already paying rent for a branch
office and a brokerage firm paying the salary of a broker, they
welcome the chance to pump more goods through existing channels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will start to see the emergence of the universal bank _ all
financial services under one corporation,'' said Bert Ely, a
banking industry consultant. He said the new legislation provides
fertile soil for combinations involving bankers and insurers. ``I
think it's highly likely that you would see a wave of mergers
there.''
</P>
<P>
   AIG, Metropolitan and Prudential, three of America's biggest
insurance companies, might be among the biggest targets for banks,
Ely and other analysts said. Or, they might look for banks to
acquire themselves. What seems certain is that the splendid
isolation insurance companies have enjoyed even more than banks and
securities companies is nearing an end.
</P>
<P>
   One model for the future is AXA Financial, known until recently
as Equitable Cos. The company includes the Equitable, one of the
largest life insurers and sellers of annuities, and Donaldson,
Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, an investment banking firm. Edward Miller, AXA's
chief executive, said his company long ago began looking for
synergies between different kinds of financial services.
</P>
<P>
   Though insurers have been barred from banking, many have begun
encroaching on that industry by purchasing thrifts that they hope
to convert into full commercial banks, said Allen Freedman,
chairman and chief executive of Fortis Inc., a midsize life and
health insurer. Fortis Inc. is the American subsidiary of Fortis
Group, the big Dutch and Belgian financial services company.
</P>
<P>
   ``This legislation confirms the market reality,'' he said. ``A
lot of little bits and pieces are being filled in.''

GEORGE HILL III, AD AGENCY CO-FOUNDER, DIES AT 67 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   George (Jay) Hill III, one of the leading figures in New England
advertising and a co-founder of Boston ad agency Hill Holliday
Connors Cosmopulos, died Friday of cancer. He was 67.
</P>
<P>
   A self-described ``tongue-tied Yankee,'' Mr. Hill often let his
work do his talking, creating ads for everything from Vermont
condominiums to Kansas politicians and luxury cars.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, ad campaigns he helped create received some of
the highest honors the advertising trade bestows. In an industry
with New York at its epicenter, Mr. Hill often forced Madison
Avenue to take notice and pay attention to Boston, said Adweek New
England editor Judy Warner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jay Hill was one of the first people to bring New England
advertising to a national level,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Warner, Mr. Hill pioneered some of the ad world's
present-day vocabulary, his ideas then turned into cliches by a
subsequent generation of copycat admirers.
</P>
<P>
   About a decade ago, a creative team under Mr. Hill's command
developed a campaign called ``Real life, real answers'' for John
Hancock Financial Services.
</P>
<P>
   The realism and intimacy of that campaign was regarded as a
breakthrough by the industry, and the ad was honored with a Grand
Prix award from the prestigious Cannes Festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jay Hill was, among other things, a great writer,'' agency
cofounder Jack Connors recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The community has lost the greatest ad copywriter I've ever
seen,'' added Steve Cosmopulos, another agency cofounder.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, Mr. Hill helped develop a 1978 Super Bowl ad for Wang
Laboratories; it was believed to have been the first time a
high-tech company advertised during the big game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wang ads changed the way that high-tech companies did their
advertising, and John Hancock ads did the same for financial
services companies,'' Warner said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, it was not readily apparent that Mr. Hill was destined
for advertising greatness. In that year, he threw in $1,500, along
with three other men to open a new Boston ad agency.
</P>
<P>
   The agency was called Hill Holliday Connors Cosmopulos, and its
small office kept a bucket full of dimes handy so if its telephone
line was tied up, business could be conducted on the pay phones on
Newbury Street.
</P>
<P>
   If Connors was the salesman who could make the successful pitch,
Mr. Hill was ``the guy who did the ads,'' his wife, Virginia Graham
Drew Hill, recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Among the early clients for whom Mr. Hill did ads were such
politicians as former Boston Mayor Kevin H. White and former US
Senator Bob Dole, a Kansas Republican.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has come a long way. Thirty years after that bucket
of dimes, and three years after Mr. Hill retired as chairman, Hill
Holliday was sold to New York communications conglomerate, the
Interpublic Group of Cos.
</P>
<P>
   The price tag for that transaction was estimated at more than
$100 million. By the time of the sale in 1998, Hill Holliday was
the second largest ad agency in New England, with $707 million in
capitalized billings for that year.
</P>
<P>
   Today the agency creates ads for such clients as Dunkin' Donuts
Inc., Fleet Boston Corp., Fidelity Investments, as well as John
Hancock.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising is nothing if not a collaborative art, and Connors
recalled that Mr. Hill had a personal comfort level that allowed
him to surround himself with extraordinary talent.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Hill may have been quiet and confident but he also had a sly
wit about him. In its early years, the agency was trying to create
an ad campaign for a developer of Vermont condominiums at a time
when few people knew what a condominium was.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Hill's ad for the condos read: ``All the advantages of
upcountry life but none of the horse manure.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Hill was born in Cambridge and grew up in Brookline. He was
a graduate of Harvard University and served in the Army. When not
creating ads, he often devoted much of his spare time to the
Massachusetts Horticultural Society.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife, Mr. Hill leaves three sons, David of Berkeley,
Calif., John of Bluemont, Va., and Peter of New York City. He also
leaves two sisters, Stacie Barta of South Hampton, N.Y., and
Elizabeth Pitney of Durham, N.C., and three grandchildren.

 UNDATED: filled in.''

   One big piece is Citigroup, a company that has symbolized the
imminent decline of Glass-Steagall even before the demise was
assured. Citigroup was the result of a $72 billion merger that
brought Travelers insurance and the Salomon Smith Barney investment
bank together with Citibank last year. The merger passed muster
with regulators, though only with the proviso that the company
would make adjustments _ most likely including the spinoff of its
insurance underwriting business _ if Glass-Steagall was not
repealed within two years.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, Citigroup provides a glimpse of the kind of
cross-selling that financial companies say is possible when the old
walls are torn down. For example, brokers working for Citigroup's
Salomon Smith Barney have sold $420 million in Citibank mortgages
to their clients in recent months, the company says. It has also
begun pilot programs in 29 states in which property and casualty
insurance are sold to Citibank credit card customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``By liberating our financial companies from an antiquated
regulatory structure, this legislation will unleash the creativity
of our industry and ensure our global competitiveness. As a result,
all Americans _ investors, savers, insureds _ will be better
served,'' Sanford Weill and John Reed, Citigroup's co-chairmen and
co-chief executives, said in a statement Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The new legislation eliminates what some executives viewed as a
playing field tilted in favor of traditional commercial banks.
Under administrative changes in recent years, commercial banks like
Chase Manhattan and Bank of America have been able to purchase
securities firms. Just a few weeks ago, Chase bought San
Francisco-based Hambrecht &AMP; Quist to give it a bigger investment
banking presence. But until now, the securities firms have not had
the reciprocal right to buy commercial banks, which have been
heavily protected because they hold government-guaranteed deposits.
</P>
<P>
   Some Wall Street firms covet trust and custody businesses, a
commercial banking preserve. They see those businesses as fitting
together well with their existing asset management and brokerage
businesses because they house the wealth of affluent individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are elements of commercial banking business that are
attractive to us,'' said Komansky of Merrill Lynch. ``For example,
we have our own trust business. This would enable us to accelerate
growth if we choose to acquire a trust business. The global custody
business is another niche that we could be interested in.''
</P>
<P>
   Northern Trust, U.S. Trust, State Street Bank and other
commercial banks with large trust and custody services are among
those that might be attractive to investment banks, several
analysts said. Komansky did not specify companies that Merrill
would consider acquiring.
</P>
<P>
   For consumers, the good news is that when financial companies
rush to sell each other's products, prices tend to fall, even
collapse. Take stock trading. Some Internet brokerage firms now
eagerly offer the service for one-fifteenth the price traditional
vendors typically charged just two years ago. Today, some banks and
brokerage firms offer free checking in accounts that pay
money-market interest rates. A few years ago, many such bank
accounts earned no interest at all and had a fee subtracted for
every check cashed.
</P>
<P>
   But consumer groups see a down side. Glass-Steagall, if only as
a by-product of the division of financial services, afforded
individuals a measure of privacy because companies selling
different kinds of financial services had no incentive to share
data. Now, with cross-selling and mergers expected to produce more
unified providers, the concern is that companies will mine data to
blitz consumers with marketing. Or, if a bank discovers that a
customer has a deadly disease, it might use that information to
keep the person from taking out a 30-year mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, a prime proponent of the repeal of
Glass-Steagall, and the American Banking Association claim that the
financial overhaul offers consumers more privacy protections than
current law. But consumer and privacy advocates called the
provisions a sham.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, financial institutions would be required in most
circumstances to notify their customers if they sell personal
information to third parties. Customers then would have the right
to demand that their private data be deleted from those sales. But
customers would have no say in how their private data was shared
between the affiliated companies of the financial conglomerates
that are expected to be created.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Torres, legislative director for Consumers Union in
Washington, said the bill actually weakens consumer privacy
protections. ``They legalized the fact that banks can share this
information,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Uncertainty about privacy shows how the end of the
Glass-Steagall era throws the financial industry into uncharted
waters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The theories of what might happen remain to be tested,'' said
Ely, the banking industry consultant. ``Either by the market, or in
court.''

WHEN ASKED WHY HE IS SO RARELY IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, BUSH GETS TESTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See related story, BUSH-BOOK) 
(th) 
 By MELINDA HENNEBERGER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   KEENE, N.H. _ On his first campaign swing through New Hampshire
since early September, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas tried Friday to
turn questions about why he is not spending more time here into an
attack on his priorities as a family man.
</P>
<P>
   His voice got louder and his tone sharper as he told reporters
that he would not be attending a forum along with other Republican
presidential candidates at Dartmouth College next Thursday because
he will be with his wife, Laura, who is being honored by her alma
mater, Southern Methodist University, in Dallas that evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family is my priority,'' he said, ``and if it costs me
votes for honoring my wife, then so be it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he would not be attending another candidates' forum in
Durham, N.H., Friday night, either, because he had promised last
July to attend a state party dinner in Sugarbush, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a man who keeps my word,'' he said after an appearance at
a fire station in Newport on Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   While front-runners like Bush are typically less enthusiastic
about appearing alongside the competition, some Republicans here
have questioned Bush's relatively rare appearances in the state,
which holds the nation's first presidential primary next February.
Those Republicans wonder if Bush has concluded that he has the
nomination sewn up and can afford to take New Hampshire for
granted.
</P>
<P>
   David Currier, the vice chairman of the Republican Party in
Belknap and Merrimack counties, said party members expected to see
candidates more often than they had seen Bush, whose visit to the
state was his fourth this year. Currier allowed that he guessed
Bush had simply been too busy tending to his duties as governor.
</P>
<P>
   Still, voters ``are going to be looking for him, and there may
be some disappointment that he's not there,'' Currier added. ``It
behooves any candidate to be here as much as he can. Between now
and the primary, he needs to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   John Dowd, the Rockingham County party chairman, said he
believed that ``it's a little bit of a problem'' for Bush, and
added: ``He still has time to correct it and show his face more. If
he kept it up, it would hurt him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush was last in New Hampshire on Sept. 7 and 8; he canceled a
scheduled trip on Sept. 19 after a shooting in a church in Fort
Worth, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Asked repeatedly Friday about why he had not been around more,
Bush at one point interrupted a reporter's question to say, ``The
important question is, How many hands have I shaked?''
</P>
<P>
   And Friday, certainly, the answer was lots. After his talk at
the fire station in Newport, he stayed for about an hour to greet a
couple of hundred people who heard a cranked-up tape of country
songs like ``Boot Scootin' Boogie'' and ``This Ain't No Thinkin'
Thing,'' while they waited to meet him.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Bush said: ``This is a state that requires one-on-one
campaigning. I just got a chance to do a lot of it. I'm taking
nothing for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   All the other major candidates have been in New Hampshire at
least twice as often as Bush. Vice President Al Gore has visited
the state 14 times this year, and his Democratic challenger, former
Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, has made 11 trips. Among the
Republican candidates, Steve Forbes has made 18 trips to New
Hampshire, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, 17, and Gary L. Bauer, 10.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Bush's Republican opponents have been calling him a
``stealth candidate.'' He has, though, agreed to participate in a
forum sponsored by WMUR-TV on Dec. 2. And a spokeswoman for the New
Hampshire Republican Party said Bush had committed to spending part
of every week here for the next month.
</P>
<P>
   Bush began his campaign day at the Country Kitchen, a diner on
the outskirts of Newport, where he poured coffee and kidded with
the breakfast crowd. Asked whether he was a regular or a decaf
drinker, he said, ``I'm not taking a position.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, in Newport, when he was asked about potential running
mates, he said, ``I'm not going to tell you her name.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, as he always does, that it would be premature to start
kicking around names at this point.

MORE FUN WITH TED AND JANE? YAWN ...

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta, Atlanta, Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Ouch. Just typing the word makes me a little queasy. Couldn't
the World Series start someplace else? For the fifth time in this
decade, we're going to be subjected to Ted and Jane, the moronic
Tomahawk Chop, protests from American Indian groups, and the
virtues of Tom Glavine and John Smoltz.
</P>
<P>
   Truthfully, is anyone in your neighborhood talking about this
World Series? Any kids in the back yard pretending to be Chipper
Jones? Wouldn't all of us have rather seen Yankees-Mets? Or Red
Sox-Mets?
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta in the World Series is boring. The Braves always get
here, but they never win (OK, they won in 1995, but that was
against a Mike Hargrove-managed Cleveland team).
</P>
<P>
   Braves-Yankees is like Pepsi-Coke. It's big, fat, and
predictable. What we really could have used this year was a little
Dr Pepper in the mix.
</P>
<P>
   For Bostonians, the best part of this World Series is going to
be watching Roger Clemens try to salvage his reputation in Game 4
Wednesday night in New York. It'll be his first World Series
appearance since Game 6 in 1986 when he either took himself out, or
was yanked by a cowardly John McNamara. Clemens got himself traded
to New York from Toronto so he'd have this opportunity, though he
didn't think he'd be playing the Al Nipper role for the Bronx
Bombers.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rocket is only going to start once and the rest of the
time we'll be bored by the Braves, the winningest team of the
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta has won eight straight division titles in the '90s. The
only years in this decade in which the Braves did not make the
playoffs were 1990 (when they finished last), and 1994 (when a
strike killed October). But in seven post-1990 baseball
tournaments, the Braves have gone home losers six times. They've
earned their reputation as the Buffalo Bills of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   It's wildly unfair, of course. What the Braves have done in this
decade is astounding. They've won and won and won. But they've had
too many chances to win it all, and we are tired of watching them
fall in the Fall Classic. Admit it, wouldn't this Series be more
fun if camera-hog Bobby Valentine were calling the shots from the
NL dugout?
</P>
<P>
   Unless Pete Rose wrestles Bud Selig to the ground, the best bet
to enliven the 1999 World Series is John Rocker, the country boy
reliever who runs to the mound the same way Wendell Kim takes his
position in the third base coach's box. Rocker infuriated New
Yorkers when he insulted Mets fans during the National League
Championship Series, then invited more abuse by yelling at them
after beating their team. He also totaled his car while driving on
a Georgia freeway the day before the Braves-Mets finale. He is to
the 1999 Braves what Oil Can Boyd was to the '86 Red Sox. He is
guaranteed to be the most quoted Braves player in this series.
</P>
<P>
   But there are not enough Rockers in the Atlanta clubhouse. Can
you really stand anymore stories about Glavine's family coming in
from Billerica and the psychologist who sits behind home plate
wearing a red shirt whenever Smoltz pitches?
</P>
<P>
   The city of Atlanta simply doesn't deserve baseball's showcase,
just as it didn't deserve the 1996 Olympics. This forever will be a
football town where folks care about Georgia, Georgia Tech, and the
Falcons. The Braves failed to sell out their first four postseason
games against the Astros and Mets. The World Series will probably
sell out, but only because it draws ``event'' people. ``What do you
think coach Cox will do here, Rhett?''
</P>
<P>
   Eight consecutive postseason appearances is a lofty achievement
and speaks highly of the work done by general manager John
Schuerholz and president Stan Kasten. Bobby Cox is a terrific
manager and Atlanta players have overcome tremendous obstacles to
get back here. They won 103 games, most in the major leagues. And
they badly want to win this World Series so they can officially
claim to be the team of the decade. It's pretty tough to be the
team of the dedade if you win only as many World Series as were won
by the Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's routine brilliance has become boring and the Braves
play in a city that has no appreciation for what they've done. How
about Yankees in five, just so we don't have to come back here?

 &HT;    Davidian lawsuit set for trial May 15
 &HT;    By Mark England
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ The civil lawsuit by surviving Branch Davidians
and others against the federal government will go to trial on May
15, 2000, according to an order issued Friday by U.S. District
Judge Walter S. Smith Jr. of Waco.
</P>
<P>
   Jury selection for the lawsuit against FBI sharpshooter Lon
Horiuchi will be the court's first proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   Horiuchi is the lone defendant remaining in the Davidians'
lawsuit. Horiuchi, who was in a sniper position at Mount Carmel, is
accused of firing at the Davidians on the day of the fire that led
to the death of David Koresh and 75 followers. That claim is based
on a report filed by FBI Special Agent Charles Riley, who stated he
heard gunfire coming from the direction of the sniper position
where Horiuchi was stationed.
</P>
<P>
   After the jury case against Horiuchi concludes, the three
remaining nonjury claims against the United States will commence,
Smith ordered.
</P>
<P>
   Those issues are whether the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms used excessive force during the Feb. 28, 1993 raid on
Mount Carmel, during which there was a shoot-out that killed five
Davidians and four ATF agents; whether the FBI used excessive force
on the day of the fire, specifically the allegation that FBI agents
fired shots into the Davidians' residence and possibly kept them
from fleeing; and whether the FBI was negligent regarding the start
of the fire as well as extinguishing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a fair schedule to both sides,'' said Mike
Caddell, the lead attorney for the plaintiffs. ``It should give us
a reasonable opportunity to examine the evidence and get ready for
trial, assuming the government gets off its duff and starts turning
things over. Judge Smith issued his ruling to turn over the
evidence on Aug. 9. Here it is two months later and most of the
important evidence is still not in Waco. That's not the judge's
fault, however. If we feel the government is not being cooperative,
we will raise that issue at the appropriate time.''
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department spokesman responded briefly to Smith's
order.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand a date has been set, and we'll be there,''
spokesman Myron Marlin said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was set for trial Oct. 18. However, Smith pushed
back the trial's start because of the government's problems in
responding to his order to produce evidence and the request by
Special Counsel John Danforth that he be allowed time to get his
office up to speed before both sides started discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery in the lawsuit will begin immediately, Smith ordered,
and conclude by March 31, 2000. However, discovery regarding the
reports and testimony of experts will continue until April 15,
2000.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs have until Feb. 1, 2000, to make an application
to reconsider the dismissal of any defendant from the case,
according to Smith's order. His ruling in July removed many
plaintiffs from the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Although noting that the government is complying with his order
to transfer all original documents and evidence in the case to the
court's jurisdiction, Smith gave the government 30 days to provide
inventories that explain what is contained within the ``mountains
of sealed boxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith also ordered the issues of liability and damages to be
bifurcated, meaning they will be tried separately.
</P>
<P>
   As he has stated before, Caddell said Friday that he was not
opposed to splitting up the arguments for liability and damages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told the judge that would be fine,'' Caddell said. ``Is
there any doubt in anyone's mind that there are damages in this
case? It's not whether the plaintiffs were damaged, it's who is
responsible? It's a whodunit. That's what this case is all about.''

   WASHINGTON _ To save its expensive F-22 fighter from
congressional budget-cutters, the Air Force is willing to sacrifice
another, less-costly new fighter _ to the consternation of the Navy
and the Marines who also want to use the cheaper aircraft, a senior
Air Force official said.
</P>
<P>
   The less-expensive plane, the Joint Strike Fighter, is unusual
in that it was being developed for the Air Force as well as the
Navy and the Marines. But a senior Air Force official, speaking on
the condition that he not be identified, said this week, ``It may
not be cost-effective to continue with the Joint Strike Fighter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have alternatives for the Joint Strike Fighter _ but not
for the F-22,'' the official said. ``We have to have the F-22.''
</P>
<P>
   By raising the prospect that it would pull out of the program to
develop the Joint Strike Fighter, the Air Force was starting a
battle within the Pentagon and was signaling Congress that it could
not tolerate the loss of the F-22. The strategy indicated a
willingness to barter away the Joint Strike Fighter so Congress
would not kill financing for the F-22, which would be the most
expensive jet in history at a projected cost of at least $125
million a plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a solution to not funding the Joint Strike Fighter:
upgrades of old systems,'' the senior Air Force official said.
``It's easier to imagine using older systems instead of the Joint
Strike Fighter for the Air Force. It's possible but not ideal.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides angering the Navy and the Marines, the Air Force
strategy would probably be opposed by Secretary of Defense William
Cohen, who has been adamant that all three services support the
Joint Strike Fighter, which was to become the workhorse for the
military.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Air Force can't make a decision on the JSF because it is
being built for several services,'' said Kenneth Bacon, a Pentagon
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   But after the NATO air war over Kosovo, which U.S. pilots,
aircraft and weaponry took credit for winning, the Air Force has
had a loud voice both in the Pentagon and in Congress _ and that
has the Navy and the Marines worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an example of a service willing to eat their second-
and third-born children to keep the first-born child alive,'' said
a senior Pentagon official opposed to the Air Force position on the
jet. ``It's an example of their fascination with fighter jets and
their willingness to do anything to keep the F-22 alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor was it clear that all members of Congress would be impressed
with the Air Force argument about abandoning the Joint Strike
Fighter.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jerry Lewis, the California Republican whose Appropriations
subcommittee originally recommended against financing the F-22,
said it was unimaginable ``that anyone at the Pentagon would be
seriously thinking about that.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Pentagon has pursued its fighter modernization program,
Lewis and other senior congressional leaders have questioned
whether the United States can afford $350 billion over the next
decade to develop three fighter jets: the F-22, the Joint Strike
Fighter, and the Navy's Super Hornet.
</P>
<P>
   Congress indicated a willingness earlier in this year's budget
battle to kill financing for the F-22, but relented and preserved
$2.5 billion for research and development. The Air Force has made
the F-22 a priority because it would be the next generation
air-to-air combat fighter with stealth capabilities and advanced
computer and radar systems.
</P>
<P>
   Canceling one of the programs would save up to $3.8 billion a
year, according to a study by the Center for Strategic and
Budgetary Assessments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The JSF is the most vulnerable because it's not even in
production,'' said Steven M. Kosiak, author of the study. ``The
idea of deferring the Joint Strike Fighter makes a lot of sense
because, through modifications and upgrades, you can use the F-16
as an alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   At an average cost of $30 million a plane, the Joint Strike
Fighter is considered inexpensive, although the project could cost
$223 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Boeing
and Lockheed Martin are competing for that contract, the largest in
military history.
</P>
<P>
   The project was intended to show that the Pentagon could build a
plane with cutting-edge technology at a low cost for three
services. But that would require the Air Force to buy 1,763 planes,
or more than half of the 2,752 Joint Strike Fighters scheduled to
be produced. The Marines would buy 609 of their model, which can
take off and land without a runway; the Navy would buy 380 planes
that would be modified to operate off aircraft carriers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if the Air Force were to drop the Joint Strike Fighter,
it would not change our needs,'' said Capt. Aisha M. Bakkar-Poe, a
Marine spokeswoman.``We need it. We need it on time, and we are
very confident that some means will be found where we would be able
to field that aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   Top Pentagon officials agreed, and say they believed the Air
Force might be overreacting to the battle they faced in Congress
this year.

HOW TO PLAY THE INTERNET, WITH APPLE

<P>
   Maybe it's time to look at Apple Computer Inc. in a different
light: as an Internet stock. As Apple points out in advertising for
new versions of its popular iMac computer, 90 percent of iMac
owners are connected to the Internet _ an astonishingly high share
_ and most of them got wired the first day they owned the machine.
So maybe Apple is an Internet platform company.
</P>
<P>
   Consider also that the latest versions of the Macintosh
operating system contain a metasearch tool called Sherlock that
links to powerful Web engines, like Alta Vista, Infoseek, Lycos and
Hotbot, and prioritizes their results.
</P>
<P>
   In MAC OS 9, Apple's latest version of the operating system,
which shipped last week, the improved Sherlock 2 channels make
searching easier and more powerful by grouping similar sources
together and returning more relevant results. It also adds a
shopping channel. So maybe Apple is an Internet portal company.
</P>
<P>
   Add the vast number of sites running video using Apple's
Quicktime technology, or created on Macintoshes running
Web-designing tools like Adobe's InDesign and you have a liberal
sprinkling of Internet pixie dust.
</P>
<P>
   But even with the 80.6 percent run-up in Apple shares this year,
to $73.9375 on Friday, they still trade at a discount to those of
other personal computer manufacturers like Dell Computer or
Gateway, let alone to a pure Internet play like Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   Apple has a price-to-earnings ratio of 23.2, versus 53.9 for
Dell and 45.1 for Gateway. (Yahoo's market capitalization is over
100 times trailing 12-month revenues; its P/E ratio is not
considered meaningful, because its net income is so small.)
</P>
<P>
   With numbers like these, some analysts say there is still strong
potential for an increase in Apple's stock price.
</P>
<P>
   Apple has been on a roll since its co-founder, Steven P. Jobs,
returned in 1997 as interim chief executive. The successful launch
of the iMac a little over a year ago was followed by splashy
rollouts of the G3 desktop machines, new G3 Powerbooks and the
iMac's portable cousin, the iBook.
</P>
<P>
   Just when it seemed that Jobs and company could walk on water,
they stumbled in the third quarter, announcing a shortfall in
earnings early because of inadequate chip supplies for the new G4
desktops and flat-panel displays for the iBook.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to get the fastest versions of the G4 microprocessor in
time, Apple cut the speed rating of the new G4 machines by 50
megahertz without cutting prices. Then, in a move that surely
tested even devoted Mac loyalists, the company canceled existing
orders, only to reinstate them later for anyone who ordered before
Oct. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Apple managed to beat analysts' revised estimates, as well as
its own predictions, by 6 cents a share for the fourth fiscal
quarter and predicted a strong December quarter. Of 20 analysts
polled by First Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks company
earnings, six rated Apple as a strong buy, six as a buy, seven as a
hold and one as a weak sell.
</P>
<P>
   Lou Mazzucchelli of Gerard Klauer Mattison in New York is among
those calling it a strong buy, with a 12-month price target of $90.
``There's more growth to come,'' Mazzucchelli said, ``and if you
look at how much negative perception there is still in the market,
that shows you the potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple's prospects as an Internet play are an added bonus for
what is already a robust growth story, said Mazzucchelli, noting
that the company received orders for 150,000 iMacs in the three
months after its introduction, but booked 250,000 orders for the
new models in just one week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apple's not talking about it,'' he said, ``but should they
find a way to leverage their immense Internet installed base, which
is growing at a huge rate, you can make a case for at least part of
the business to be valued as an Internet company.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple executives have been coy about possible Internet service
offerings, saying only that they have nothing to say now.
</P>
<P>
   But other experts are bullish on Apple's Internet prospects. ``I
don't think Apple can reinvent itself, but I do think it can
rejuvenate itself via the Web,'' said Geoffrey Moore, president of
the Chasm Group, a Silicon Valley consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moreover, as the market migrates from product to service,
Microsoft isn't getting it. Steve might get it,'' he said,
referring to Jobs and adding that a truly distinctive Apple
Internet service could prove a winner if it attracts enough Mac
users.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much money would Mac loyalists part with? I think quite a
lot, if the experience were truly Mac-like,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Apple is busy adding loyalists through the iMac. The
company is establishing the iMac as the slickest platform for
surfing the Web, much as the original Macintosh was the clear
choice for desktop publishing or today's Wintel machines are the
standard for running Microsoft Office.
</P>
<P>
   Apple has established its Internet status ``in very subtle
ways,'' said Daniel Kunstler, an analyst with J.P. Morgan, who also
has a 12-month target of $90 on the stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't beat you over the head saying `we're an Internet
company,''' he said. ``They've done it with their platform, and,
suddenly, with the launch of the new iMacs, it dawns on everybody.
Their claims are not overstated and they're really starting to pan
out.''

EX-CHIEF EXECUTIVE AT CENTER OF DISPUTE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 24) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ELIZABETH OLSEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ It was a formula that worked for decades: arcane
technical expertise plus family control plus Swiss security and
stability. And it made Societe Generale de Surveillance the world
leader in the obscure but vital field of cargo inspection and
verification.
</P>
<P>
   After 80 years in business, so many buyers, sellers and customs
officials around the globe had come to depend on SGS to inspect and
certify goods being imported or exported and to curb customs fraud
that the company amassed a commanding market share _ estimated at
70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Then the wheels came off. In late 1997, Swiss authorities
accused the company of having made payments to Pakistani political
leaders, including former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and her
husband, to secure a major contract with the government of
Pakistan. Though apparently no Swiss laws were broken, the scandal
cost SGS the contract and threw the company into tumult.
</P>
<P>
   Squirming in an unaccustomed spotlight of harsh publicity, SGS
has since replaced its management, restructured itself and embarked
on a new business strategy. But its ability to climb out of its
steep downturn has been hampered by public squabbling among its
directors and awkward questions about Swiss-style corporate
governance.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the turbulence is Elisabeth Salina Amorini, 44,
a lawyer and the granddaughter of a founder of SGS. Mrs. Salina, as
she is known, joined the company's board in her 20s and went on to
serve as chairwoman and chief executive, a very rare role for a
woman in Swiss business circles.
</P>
<P>
   At odds with her is another SGS director, the Munich-based
financier August von Finck, sometimes called ``the silent baron''
for his reclusiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Salina resigned as chief executive in August 1998 and as
chairwoman last October after SGS reported that its profits were
collapsing, driven down by the cancellation of contracts with
Pakistan and Indonesia and by the sharp contraction in Asian trade
caused by the region's financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   She was succeeded in the chairman's post by Max Amstutz, an
associate of von Finck. A long-time company executive, Antony
Czura, became chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   For all of 1998, SGS reported a loss of about $210 million on
revenues of $2.29 billion, after years of steady profits. During
the year, the company's stock plummeted to 230.5 Swiss francs a
share from 3,565 francs in 1997; it has rebounded and slumped again
several times since and closed on Friday at 1,700 Swiss francs, or
about $1,150.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mrs. Salina has been able to retain the backing of an
important group of shareholders and to keep her seat on the
company's board, where she remains a controversial figure. Her
critics blame her for the company's troubles and say she is
domineering and tries to cling to authority, derisively referring
to her as ``Queen Elisabeth.'' Supporters say she has championed
shareholders' rights and served the company loyally, if
imperfectly.
</P>
<P>
   The tensions in SGS's board room burst into the headlines here
in May with an extraordinary snub of Mrs. Salina. Swiss law makes
directors liable for their corporate actions unless the company's
board approves an annual release, as most companies routinely do.
But SGS's board voted not to release Mrs. Salina for 1998, exposing
her to legal action for five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's outrageous!'' Mrs. Salina fumed during an interview at
her home in an elegant Geneva neighborhood. ``I was treated like a
criminal.'' She accused Amstutz of orchestrating the move to punish
her for refusing to resign from the board.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The board met in emergency session an hour before the scheduled
annual meeting and voted to nullify the voting rights of nearly
half the company's shares. Those shares, held in a pool, mainly
belonged to the families of Jacques Salmanowitz, Mrs. Salina's
grandfather, and the other founders of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Shares belonging to von Finck, Deutsche Bank and Swiss Life were
also part of the pool. Since then the pool has splintered. The
family shareholders, who hold 27 percent of the company, are
contesting the board's action in court, while von Finck and Swiss
Life have withdrawn from the pool and increased their stakes a bit,
to 13.6 percent and 7 percent. Deutsche Bank. with 3 percent,
remains in the pool.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Amstutz accused Mrs. Salina of ``not doing a
proper job'' and neglecting the commercial side of the business in
favor of government contracts, which generated almost 88 percent of
SGS's net income in 1997. Amstutz, 70, a veteran of Holderbank, the
huge cement concern, denied that Mrs. Salina had been singled out
unfairly, though she was the only director not given a release.
</P>
<P>
   Conceding that the move was ``highly unusual,'' Amstutz said,
``This is a clear signal that the board is not satisfied, and that
we can go to court against her.''
</P>
<P>
   But experts say a suit against her would be unlikely to succeed
because of the difficulty of proving a direct link between the
actions of one executive or director and movements in the company's
stock price.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Mrs. Salina said that while she was in charge she
acted only in concert with other directors and executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made mistakes, but the biggest one was not insisting after
two years that we find another CEO,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She is holding fast to her board seat. ``Unless they vote me
out,'' she said, referring to stockholders, ``I will serve.''
</P>
<P>
   The board-room drama has called into question not only SGS's
reputation for integrity and stability, which is crucial to its
business, but also the adequacy of shareholder protection in
Switzerland. The censure of Mrs. Salina was approved by only 14
percent of the outstanding shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an alibi to move her out, and it violates basic tenets
of corporate governance,'' said Andre Baladi, a Geneva financier
and a minor SGS shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   Some shareholders worry that von Finck is trying to force Mrs.
Salina and the other 56 founding family members to sell out,
enabling him to acquire SGS without paying a takeover premium.
Company representatives said von Finck would not respond to
requests for comment.
</P>
<P>
   SGS has signed five new government contracts so far this year,
but it remains stung by its difficulties in navigating what can be
a murky line between legitimate commissions and illegal bribes. It
has adopted a new code of ethics barring any payments to secure
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt about it _ the Pakistan incident and the
other problems have damaged SGS on all fronts,'' said Czura, the
chief executive. ``It made everybody realize that we had to change
or the brand would be irrevocably damaged.'' Czura was interviewed
in the company's temporary offices because its historic
headquarters building is being expensively refurbished _ another of
Mrs. Salina's decisions that has drawn criticism.
</P>
<P>
   To repair its bottom line, SGS has sold off insurance, health
care and biotechnology subsidiaries to concentrate on agricultural,
mineral and oil inspection services, consumer product verification,
international certification and government services. It is aiming
to reduce its payroll from 40,000 last year to 32,000 by next June.
</P>
<P>
   Czura said he expected the company's turnaround to take three
years. The losses have stopped, and SGS forecasts a profit of $66
million for 1999. But Pierre Tissot, an analyst at Lombard Odier
here, wants to wait and see.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they've done so far is only a first step,'' Tissot said.
``They have a long way to go.''

   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ The hits just keep on coming for the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   Center Jason Allison left practice early Friday because of a
sore left wrist. That's not to be confused with his ailing right
forearm and wrist that have hampered Allison since the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Allison injured his left wrist during practice Tuesday in
Phoenix prior to the club's departure for Los Angeles when he
collided with teammate Hal Gill. It felt better the next day and he
was able to play against the Kings, but he said it was made worse.
</P>
<P>
   Allison said if the wrist feels Saturday like it did Friday, he
won't be able to suit up for Saturday night's game against the San
Jose Sharks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to the net and I turned and I didn't see him,''
said Allison, who jammed the wrist into Gill's chest. ``It hurt,
but then it went away and felt better. Then after the game, I did
it a couple of times again and aggravated it.''
</P>
<P>
   The wrist was very swollen Friday, and Allison wasn't able to do
much during the team's workout at the Ice Centre.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a coincidence, bad luck,'' said Allison. ``I don't
even want to talk to (trainer Don Del Negro) about it because
enough is enough with this kind of thing. I just tried to go out
and ignore it.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Allison, the wrist wouldn't allow him to
ignore it. He said he didn't know what was wrong with it, but
didn't think anything was broken. He said he thinks it could be a
sprain.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it feels like it did (Friday), I wouldn't be able to
play,'' he said. ``I couldn't even make a hard pass. But that could
be the swelling, too. I haven't taken any anti-inflammatories yet.
It's pretty sore.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison said his right forearm and wrist were actually improving
to the point where he could take faceoffs. But in the game against
the Kings, Allison, who won four draws and lost just one, had to
stop taking them because his arm was acting up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was starting to feel it again,'' he said. ``I took a couple
of big draws, one in our own end. I started feeling it again so I
said I couldn't take any more. I might have taken one if it was on
the right side at the end of the game. It's something I have to
feel out. If it starts to get a little sore, I have to lay off
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison is also still hampered by a sprained ankle he suffered
just prior to the start of training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even want to talk about that,'' he said, a healthy
dose of frustration in his voice. ``It's not really bothering me in
games. But I've felt it a couple of times lately; it might just be
tired maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Goaltender Rob Tallas won't be able to play Saturday night.
Tallas took a shot off the right ankle during warmups Wednesday in
Los Angeles, but was still outstanding in the tie with Kings. John
Grahame will get the start, but it's possible Tallas will be in the
pipes for the trip finale in Anaheim Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really sore still,'' said Tallas, who made 38 saves
against the Kings. ``I felt fine out there (Friday), but as
practice wore on, you could feel it getting sorer and sorer.''
</P>
<P>
   Tallas has been consulting with Bruins goalie coach Gerry
Cheevers by phone. Tallas said Cheevers has encouraged him to be
more aggressive against shooters. Tallas thinks it has made a
difference.
</P>
<P>
   Tallas met up with former Bruins therapist Tim Trahant, who is
living out West and going to acupuncture school. Tallas said
Trahant treated him with acupuncture the day before the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really enjoyed it,'' he said. ``It's different. It's more of
a difference in your mind at first. I didn't know if I believed in
it or not, but it was a fun thing to do and it was a good
experience.''
</P>
<P>

   Right wing Rob DiMaio, who injured his hip and missed the game
in Los Angeles, skated Friday. ``It feels pretty good,'' said
DiMaio. ``It's up to (coach Pat Burns), but I'll tell him I think
I'm OK.'' . . . Burns put Landon Wilson on the right wing with
center Joe Thornton and left wing Sergei Samsonov. ``We'll try
it,'' said Burns. ``We'll see what happens.'' Wilson played a
strong game against the Kings . . . Assistant coach Jacques
Laperriere was on the injured list Friday. He twisted his knee
earlier in the trip, and had to stay off skates because of the
swelling.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEMPHIS, Tenn. _ Fourteen years ago, Dean Jernigan, son of a
carpenter and a department store clerk, sensed the stirrings of a
trend. ``I saw major consumption,'' he said, ``a society that likes
to collect things.'' Too many things for attics and storerooms.
</P>
<P>
   So Jernigan built some you-rent-it garages on Summer Avenue, the
street where an entrepreneur opened the nation's first Holiday Inn
in 1952. Jernigan turned out to have been similarly prescient.
Society's itch to consume and collect became an engine of the
nation's most prosperous, most acquisitive decade in at least a
century. More than 300,000 customers are now paying Jernigan's
Storage USA from $60 to $200 a month to park the jetsam of their
affluence in 34 million square feet of garages in 31 states at 500
sites, including 30 in Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   His good fortune is contributing to a rebirth of Memphis'
downtown. Ravaged since the 1970s by white flight to the eastern
reaches of the city and the Shelby County suburbs beyond, the city
center is now abloom with hard hats and cranes.
</P>
<P>
   With several big projects under way among the boarded-over
buildings and check-cashing shops, downtown Memphis is savoring the
bounty of prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   It is the kind of prosperity filtering through hundreds of
communities these days. Previously whipsawed by three- or four-year
spurts of growth that crashed in recessions, most cities are
reaping unaccustomed benefits from the nearly nine years of
uninterrupted economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of many cities like Dallas, Nashville and Atlanta has
been orchestrated by coteries of business and political leaders.
But there is less such cohesion in Memphis. Instead, this city has
sprung open to the fantasies of businessmen who with more freedom
than those of many other cities can go off and build something big.
</P>
<P>
   ``Memphis is not an establishment-driven city,'' Henry M.
Turley, a leading downtown developer, said. ``It is an
entrepreneurial city.''
</P>
<P>
   In Memphis, prosperity has broken out in all directions.
Jernigan is building the city's first downtown baseball park, a
$75-million, five-story, 14,000-seat home for the Redbirds, a minor
league team of the St. Louis Cardinals. Jernigan, 53, and his wife
and partner in philanthropy, Kristi, 36, bought the team and
brought it to Memphis. They are renovating the abandoned William R.
Moore Building, adjacent to the ball park, for a new home for
Storage USA, including an apartment for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Directly east, out Poplar Avenue beyond midtown, toward the
suburbs of Germantown and Collierville, cheek-by-jowl neo-Colonial
mansions and upscale malls are replacing older, midscale, mostly
closer-in malls built in the 1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Contemporary art galleries, new for Memphis, have opened. At the
four-year-old Ledbetter Lusk Gallery on Poplar Avenue, David Lusk,
an owner, points to a large surreal painting by Colin McLain,
formerly of Memphis, now of New York and Provincetown, Mass. It
depicts faceless men in black and white striped prison suits. The
suits have vests and white collars. They might be swindlers and
frauds, or they might be the workaholic slaves of prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Colin McLain could not have sold here 10 years ago, even for
$1,000,'' Lusk said. ``That one is $4,500. Our average price now is
probably $5,000, $6,000.''
</P>
<P>
   A little south of the upscale mall housing the gallery is the
big Mall of Memphis, once a citywide center of shopping, now
catering mostly to black Memphians. At least six shops sell
jewelry, mostly watches priced below $1,000 and gold bracelets and
chains for men and women.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south is a wholly different kind of commerce. Running
mile upon mile along Shelby Drive, past the airport and runways of
Federal Express and the new sorting plant of United Parcel Service,
are the low-lying blocks of mostly gray, largely windowless
buildings with the gaping square holes of loading docks, a mark of
the city's emergence as the leading jet-age cargo hub.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the general cargo warehousing business,'' said W.
Neely Mallory, who has moved onto Shelby Drive, far beyond the
cotton warehouses downtown that built the family fortune. ``We're
in everything from rolls of paper to bubble gum to Nintendo
games.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The speed with which all those goods come and go sharpens
Memphis' edge in today's economy, Mallory said. At midcontinent
intersections of road, river and air traffic, Memphis has
positioned itself to exploit modern industry's demand for
just-in-time delivery of goods at the instant that factories,
stores and consumers need them and not a day before.
</P>
<P>
   It is downtown, however, where prosperity is blinding.
Employment in construction, most of it downtown and at the airport,
has jumped nearly 60 percent in seven years. Besides the new
stadium, developers are rebuilding Beale Street, the railroad
station and the convention center. New office buildings, movie
theaters, condominiums and stores are opening in century-old
shells.
</P>
<P>
   W.J. Michael Cody, 63, former U.S. attorney for the Western
District of Tennessee, works for a 91-year-old law firm downtown,
housed in an exotic Romanesque three-story building that was once
the home of the now-defunct Tennessee Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting ready to spend $4 million for a new four-story
building to tie into this one,'' Cody said. ``The prosperity has
been translated into our confidence to spend that kind of money and
make a commitment to downtown Memphis. We wouldn't have done it in
a less prosperous time.''
</P>
<P>
   Downtown development has been spurred, too, by the Shelby County
mayor, Jim Rout, and by the Memphis mayor, Willie Herenton, who
recently won re-election to a third four-year term. They have
provided generous tax breaks and regulatory relief to give
developers incentives to build.
</P>
<P>
   One agent of the downtown's rebirth is Joseph R. Hyde III, 56,
who founded Autozone, a nationwide chain of 2,700 car-repair shops
that he started in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Hyde, known by the nickname Pitt, put his corporate
headquarters on the site of an abandoned cotton warehouse, the
first company to build downtown in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have done it if Pitt Hyde hadn't done it,''
Jernigan said of his own decision to move into the Moore Building.
Hyde is paying $3.75 million for 25-year rights to name the ball
field Autozone Park, and he is now leading the fund-raising to
expand the National Civil Rights Museum, site of the assassination
of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and a top tourist
attraction.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   An earlier agent of downtown revival was Jack Belz, 71.
Twenty-four years ago, Belz paid $675,000 for the opulent old
Peabody Hotel, which was then shuttered, and said he had poured $45
million into restoring it.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, in partnership with Turley, Belz has expanded
into developing close-in and stylish, high- and middle-income
houses on the South Bluffs of the Mississippi riverfront and on Mud
Island, a sandbar in the Mississippi separated from downtown by the
narrow Wolf River.
</P>
<P>
   Turley has built his home in South Bluffs, one with a goldfish
pond in the vestibule, buttons he flicks like light switches to
fill the house with the blues and jazz, and soaring glass walls
overlooking his black-bottom pool, the wide Mississippi and the
forest beyond.
</P>
<P>
   With his tie loose and seat belt unfastened, he takes the wheel
of his silver BMW convertible sports car and rolls out his
cobblestone driveway for a tour of the more than $200 million in
projects he has developed in and around downtown.
</P>
<P>
   He passes Cordelia's, the grocery store he built and named for
his mother, and the two riverfront warehouses where he is building
loft apartments. He passes his and Belz's 132-acre Harbor Town
development on Mud Island and crosses the Wolf River back to the
mainland and the north side of town. He comes to the bleak, partly
boarded-over Hurt Village and Lauderdale Courts, two public housing
projects filled with crime and poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Belz and Turley have agreed to forgo their customary profit to
manage the rehabilitation of the 1,000 living units there for
mixed-income, public and private housing.
</P>
<P>
   Flush with his new prosperity, Turley said: ``You got a big old
wad of money in your pocket. The rich economy gives you economic
resources, and it gives you psychic resources.'' Whether for good
or for evil, he said, ``it enables you to do more of what you want
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   In Memphis, the building is a spontaneous eruption. Local
government has helped fuel it with financial incentives. But
Memphis, unlike Dallas or Atlanta or Pittsburgh, lacks a boss or a
large and coherent coterie of business leaders to join the
government in steering development.
</P>
<P>
   A century ago, a blue-blood class of cotton, lumber and
warehousing merchants ruled Memphis. Through the most of the first
half of this century, the Tammany-like boss Edward H. Crump was in
charge, but he leaned on the merchant clans to get things done.
</P>
<P>
   These days, however, such an absence of coherent leadership can
be a problem. Herman C. Ewing, president and chief executive of the
Memphis Urban League, said: ``We have difficulty getting consensus
on items that warrant answers, like tax policy and development. We
live in a city where the merit of an idea takes second place to who
endorses it.''

   AGREEMENT TO OVERHAUL NATION'S FINANCIAL SYSTEM
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration and top Republican lawmakers agreed
to overhaul the nation's financial system, repealing Depression-era
laws that have restricted the banking, securities and insurance
industries from expanding into one another's businesses. The
agreement, reached after a compromise over lending rules for the
disadvantaged, concludes decades of attempts to rewrite the
nation's banking laws and catch up with a marketplace that has
already seen broad consolidations. ``It's probably the most heavily
lobbied, most expensive issue to come before Congress in a
generation,'' said Ed Yingling, the American Bankers Association's
chief lobbyist.

<P>
   Stocks powered ahead as traders saw the banking bill paving the
way for big financial mergers. The Dow Jones industrial average
gained 172.56 points, to end at 10,470.25. For the week, the Dow
was up 450.54 points, its best weekly gain since July. The Nasdaq

ROWERS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD CONVERGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ The scullers sat around a couple of tables at
the Cambridge Boat Club Friday afternoon, catching up on what
they've been up to since August and St. Catharines. There was Jamie
Koven and Leslie Burns Rawley, Luka Spik and Rumiana Neikova, Juri
Jaanson and Marnie McBean and another half dozen of the global
elite, talking shop on the eve of the world's largest two-day
rowing regatta.
</P>
<P>
   The Head of the Charles, which will take over the river for the
35th time Saturday and Sunday, is more than a monster boat race.
It's the autumnal gathering of the clan, the last chance to
converse and compete before the ice sets in.
</P>
<P>
   The Head is 6,500 rowers from more than two dozen countries
competing in 40 races. It's faxes and e-mails zipping across
oceans, Cambridge phones ringing on Slovenian time, tents rigged
along Memorial Drive from Harvard down to Boston University,
borrowed shells and oars, oarsmen from Bulgaria sleeping on futons
in Watertown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have nothing like this at home,'' says Georgina Douglas,
Australia's top female sculler. ``We have the Head of the Yarra,
with maybe 100 crews.''
</P>
<P>
   There'll be 156 crews in Saturday afternoon's club eights alone.
When the first event was held in 1965 (patterned after the
traditional Head of the River races in England) only two boats had
entered by the deadline, forcing organizers to work the phones to
get the list up to a respectable 90.
</P>
<P>
   This year, more than 10,000 rowers wanted in. The Head has long
since become the aquatic Woodstock. What the Boston Marathon is to
road racing, the Head of the Charles is to rowing. If you pull an
oar anywhere from New Zealand to Croatia, you want to dip it in the
Rivah, just once.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an opportunity you can't miss,'' says Douglas, who flew
from Melbourne via Auckland and Los Angeles on Tuesday to race here
and will head Down Under again on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   It's more than the class reunion aspect that attracts. The Head
offers a unique challenge _ 3 miles upstream on a river that can be
placid or roiling, with winds blowing heads here, tails there,
racing single file against the clock under half a dozen bridges
with 300,000 people watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to race flat out and look around at the same
time,'' said Koven, who'll be chasing his third straight men's
singles crown Sunday. ``It's tough not to know how you're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   In a Head race, the guy who's overtaking you might be a mile
downstream. When Koven won two years ago, he didn't know he had
until they told him. ``I had absolutely no idea,'' he said. ``I
started in the middle of the pack. I knew I had a good race, but. .
.''
</P>
<P>
   At the championship level where the world medalists are, a good
race is the minimum required these days. Now that race officials
have made a point of bringing in top international talent, Sunday's
marquee events are nearing World Cup level.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the charm of the Head is its universality and its
informality. A boatload of urban high school girls from O'Bryant in
Boston's Roxbury section can line up in the same race with the
Radcliffe novices. The US men's crew, which won the world title a
dozen years ago, can take on the U.S. crew that did it two months
ago.
</P>
<P>
   A sweep oarsman can switch to sculling and challenge a gold
medalist just for fun. A sculler can step into an eight and race
against the Germans. Halloween is but a week away. Why not change
your identity on the water?
</P>
<P>
   The Head is rowing's masked ball. Crew names can be obscure,
misleading. The Princeton Training Center is the US men's eight.
The Alte Achter Boat Club is the 1972 US Olympic crew, silver
medals still untarnished.
</P>
<P>
   But what is the Black Sheep Rowing Club? The Rude &AMP; Smooth BC?
The Fat Cat RC? Do the Arsenal Diner Chow Hounds eat on the paddle?
Do their own mothers recognize the Wide Load Boat Club?
</P>
<P>
   No matter. If they know port from starboard, can row 3 miles and
can meet the entry requirements, they are welcome to go bow to bow
with Olympians at the gathering of the clan.

AMAZON SUES BIG BOOKSELLER OVER SYSTEM FOR SHOPPING 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By LESLIE KAUFMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amazon.com has filed suit against its rival Internet book and
music seller Barnesandnoble.com, accusing it of illegally copying
Amazon's patented checkout system and demanding an immediate end to
its use.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed on Thursday night in U.S. District Court in
Seattle, is the latest chapter in a storied and sometimes litigious
rivalry. But if Amazon.com is successful in the suit, it could have
broad ramifications for the development of e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers that use variations of the popular ``one click''
checkout method, which allows customers to make repeat purchases
with one click of the mouse instead of having to fill out credit
card and billing information with each shopping trip, could be
forced to desist or pay a licensing fee to Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon stopped short of saying that was its goal, but the
possibility was not lost on it. ``This litigation just goes to
Barnesandnoble.com,'' said an Amazon spokesman, Bill Curry. ``But
we clearly have a patent, and this is a sign we want to protect our
intellectual property.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon started using one-click technology in September 1997, but
did not receive a patent for it until Sept. 28 this year.
Barnesandnoble has offered Express Lane, its one-click checkout,
since early 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one-click feature is one of Amazon.com's signature
strategies for differentiating itself from the competition and
building loyalty among its customers,'' Amazon wrote in its
complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Customer loyalty is especially important to Amazon now, as the
company is expanding well beyond its original book format to
electronics and toys and all manner of items in hopes of becoming
the Internet shopper's primary destination. Arguing that the
infringement is causing irreparable harm, Amazon is seeking
monetary damages and an immediate injunction preventing
Barnesandnoble.com from using Express Lane.
</P>
<P>
   Barnesandnoble.com called the lawsuit an attempt to retaliate
for its growing popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the allegations to be completely without merit, and
we will vigorously defend our position,'' said a spokesman, Gus
Carlson. ``Traffic to our Web site was up substantially today
because of the publicity. We thank our competitor for the
incremental sales.''
</P>
<P>
   The two mammoths of book-selling have a colorful history of
feuding that includes both threatened and actual litigation. In
1997, Barnes &AMP; Noble Inc., the parent company of
barnesandnoble.com, filed suit against Amazon claiming that its
slogan, World's Largest Bookstore, was false advertising. The suit
was settled out of court with neither side paying damages.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, Amazon made threatening noises when Barnes &AMP; Noble
tried to acquire the distributor Ingram Book Group. The deal was
canceled, and litigation was never initiated.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers and patent experts differ on the strength of Amazon's
case, but agree that the effect could be far reaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this patent did hold up, it could put a damper on Internet
growth,'' said Ken Cassar, a digital commerce analyst at Jupiter
Communications, an Internet research firm. He estimates that half
the retail sites on the Web have an ``automated wallet'' _ a
process that stores billing and address data for repeat customers.
</P>
<P>
   E-commerce companies are increasingly turning to patents to
protect their business interests. Last week, Priceline.com filed a
patent infringement lawsuit against Microsoft saying that the
software giant's Expedia.com site had copied its model of allowing
customers to bid for plane tickets and hotel rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the first of what will be a bloody round of
patent wars on the Web,'' predicted David Kline, author of
``Rembrandts in the Attic: Unlocking the Hidden Value of Patents,''
to be published by Harvard Business School Press in January.
</P>
<P>
   Patents covering software or programming related to Web sites
are the fastest-growing sector at the U.S. Patent Office, said
Robert Greene Sterne, of the Washington-based intellectual property
law firm of Sterne, Kessler, Goldstein &AMP; Fox. He said the suits
might over the long term give a real advantage to Web companies
that were the first to build technological applications that
everyone else wants.

FSU'S WARRICK REINSTATED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEMSON, S.C. _ In the middle of the hoopla surrounding the
Bowden family reunion for Saturday night's game between Clemson and
Florida State, another element was added Friday _ the return of
All-American and once-Heisman Trophy frontrunner Peter Warrick.
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles' senior wide receiver was reinstated to the team
Friday and is expected to play after school president Sandy
D'Alemberte agreed to let Warrick plead guilty to a lesser charge
of misdemeanor petty theft rather than the felony charge Warrick
originally faced after he and a teammate received more than $400
dollars of designer clothes at more than a 90 percent discount at a
Tallahassee department store earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   A new university law prohibits any athlete convicted of a felony
charge from participating in intercollegiate athletics.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick still must serve 30 days on a work program, pay $295 in
court costs, and $579 in restitution to the Tallahassee store. He
is also on one-year's probation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciate the support shown me through this,'' Warrick said
in an apologetic statement released by the school. ``I am glad to
get the chance to play again.''
</P>
<P>
   Warrick, arguably the best receiver in college football and a
prime contender for the Heisman Trophy, missed two games during the
investigation, essentially dropping him from the Heisman race.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement was reached after 48 hours of heavy negotiations
in which Warrick's lawyers argued against any jail time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It worked out for the best,'' said Seminoles coach Bobby
Bowden, ``but it was a screwed up mess.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He has paid the consequences for his mistake and then some,''
Florida State athletic director Dave Hart Jr. said. ``It's time to
move past it.''
</P>
<P>
   Warricks' lawyer, John Kenny, called the settlement fair for his
client, the state, the school, and fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not wearing stripes, he's not in jail, and that's a
significant determining factor for the university,'' he said.

EXPERTS SAY LAPSES LED TO JAPAN'S A-PLANT FAILURE 
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON _ The Japanese nuclear accident three weeks ago
occurred largely because managers counted on workers to follow
rules but never explained why the rules were important, three
Energy Department experts said Friday after touring the plant this
week.
</P>
<P>
   The experts said at a news conference here that managers should
have concentrated on providing equipment designed to make such
accidents impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese officials had performed a safety evaluation of the
plant at Tokaimura, which processes nuclear fuel, and had concluded
that an accidental reaction was impossible. Based on that, the
plant had no emergency plan, said one of the experts, Frank McCoy,
deputy manager of the Energy Department's Savannah River Operations
Office.
</P>
<P>
   McCoy said the technicians were trying to carry out a task using
incorrect equipment. ``Using the system in the right way was more
difficult than anyone would have desired,'' he said. McCoy and his
colleagues gave a description that made the job sound like trying
to bake a cake in a frying pan.
</P>
<P>
   The experts, an official delegation invited by the Japanese
government, gave a detailed explanation of the accident, on Sept.
30, in which technicians brought too much uranium together in one
spot and created an unintended chain reaction that continued for 17
hours. They were dissolving a powdered form of uranium with an acid
and had planned to ship it to another plant for baking into solid
fuel.
</P>
<P>
   The workers should have stored the material in a tall
column-shaped cylinder, a shape that would have prevented a
critical mass from forming, said Leroy Lewis, a chemist at the
Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory. But, he
added, the spigot to draw liquids out of that container was about 4
inches off the ground, suitable for filling a low, flat pan, which
is used in the process for which the tank is normally used. In this
case, the workers wanted to fill a taller container.
</P>
<P>
   So the workers put the dissolved uranium in a second vessel,
intended for another purpose entirely, the experts said. It had a
spigot that was easier to use. But the vessel was circular, a shape
that encourages a chain reaction. Worse, it was surrounded with a
shell filled with cooling water, and the water functioned as a
reflector, bouncing neutrons from the uranium back into the tank,
improving the conditions for a reaction.
</P>
<P>
   The workers did not understand the reason behind the rules that
limit the sizes of batches and containers, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency workers stopped the reaction by smashing a pipe
connected to the water shell, letting the water drain.
</P>
<P>
   The American approach would be to assure that there were no
containers present in which material could form a critical mass,
the experts said. The size and shape of such a container would vary
according to the material being handled.
</P>
<P>
   For the uranium that the Japanese were processing, the
containers would have to be smaller or would have to be flat or
columnlike.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman at the Japanese Embassy said officials were trying
to obtain a transcript of the experts' remarks and would not
comment until then. News reports in Japan suggest that the workers
routinely took dangerous shortcuts that violated the rules.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department experts said that although the Tokaimura
accident let out a huge shower of radiation in the form of gamma
rays and neutrons, those emissions ended when the reaction stopped.
In other accidents, including Chernobyl, the problem after the
reaction ends has been the dispersal of radioactive materials _
unstable atoms, mostly from splitting uranium or plutonium, that
emit rays or subatomic particles for days or years.
</P>
<P>
   In Tokaimura, the experts said, the radioactive materials were
almost entirely contained in the vessel where the reaction
occurred.

   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration and top Republican
lawmakers said early Friday that they had reached an agreement to
overhaul the nation's financial system, repealing Depression-era
laws that have restricted the banking, securities and insurance
industries from expanding into one another's businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was announced at about 2 a.m. after a compromise
was reached over the measure's effect on lending rules for the
disadvantaged, the source of months of partisan bickering between
the White House and Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, who heads the banking
committee.
</P>
<P>
   It concludes decades of attempts to rewrite the nation's banking
laws to catch up with a marketplace that has already seen broad
consolidations and the rise of financial conglomerates that offer
consumers bank and brokerage accounts as well as insurance.
</P>
<P>
   While these conglomerates have found ways around the old rules,
those rules had made it expensive and at times impossible to expand
into new lines of financial services.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the nation's largest financial services company,
Citigroup, would have been forced to sell some of its insurance
operations as part of the $72 billion merger last year between
Citibank and Travelers Group without either the legislation or a
waiver from regulators. With such situations in mind, the banking,
insurance and securities industries spent more than $300 million in
1997 and 1998 alone on a combination of donations to political
candidates, soft money contributions to political parties and
lobbying.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation will more easily enable financial companies to
offer corporate clients a full range of services, from traditional
loans to investment banking services like public stock offerings.
And for consumers, it paves the way for financial supermarkets,
which will be able to offer one-stop shopping for an array of
services, all under one roof. The measure is also expected to clear
a path for a new and bigger wave of corporate deal-making as more
companies consolidate.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials withheld final approval of the agreement
until aides could see the measure's language. But the officials
indicated Friday night that, with broad support from Democrats in
Congress, the measure is all but certain to be signed by President
Clinton. As such, it will be one of the most significant pieces of
legislation to be written by the White House and the 106th
Congress, which began its term considering whether to remove
Clinton and has had a bitter relationship with him ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``When this potentially historic agreement is finalized,''
Clinton said in a statement, ``it will strengthen the economy and
help consumers, communities and businesses across America.''
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said in an interview, ``At
the end of the 20th century, we will at last be replacing an
archaic set of restrictions with a legislative foundation for a
21st century financial system.'' The measure, he added, ``would
provide significant benefits to the national economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Gramm said the measure ``is the most important banking
legislation in 60 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Gramm's counterpart in the House, Rep. James Leach, R- Iowa,
said that he expected a final bill to be brought to the House and
Senate floors this month.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation repeals the Glass-Steagall Act, or, as it is
formally known, the Banking Act of 1933, which broke up the
powerful House of Morgan and divided Wall Street between investment
banks and commercial banks. It also makes significant changes to
the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, which had restricted what
banks could do in the insurance business.

PIZZA AND POLITICS FOR FIRST LADY LOOK-ALIKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The first ``campaign'' ad in the New York Senate race
will air Saturday in a peculiar form _ as a Pizza Hut commercial
during the opening game of the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-second spot features a woman who looks more than a bit
like Hillary Rodham Clinton, praising the company's Big New Yorker
pizza, then exclaiming, in a southern drawl, ``How do I know so
much about New York pizza? 'Cause, New York, I wanna be your next
senator!''
</P>
<P>
   The camera then flashes to two police officers, one of whom
says, in an exaggerated New York accent, ``$9.99! What do they
think this is? Arkansas?''
</P>
<P>
   The real-life Clinton (who doesn't have a drawl), is the
all-but-declared Democratic candidate for Daniel Patrick Moynihan's
U.S. Senate seat. The Pizza Hut commercial clearly plays on the
most common criticism against her _ that she's a ``carpetbagger''
who has never lived in New York.
</P>
<P>
   New York 1, the city's all-news cable channel, revealed another
angle that has raised Democrats' eyebrows. Pizza Hut's parent
company, Tricon Global Restaurants, has contributed $2,500 to the
campaign of Clinton's likely Republican opponent, Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani. And a Tricon board member, financier Kenneth Langone, is
co-chairman of Giuliani's fund-raising committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite a set of coincidences,'' observed Howard Wolfson,
Clinton's campaign spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Allison, a spokesman for Pizza Hut, laughed off the concern.
``We're not coming down on any one side,'' he said. ``It's all
meant to be very lighthearted. We're in the business of selling
pizza, not making political statements.''
</P>
<P>
   However, asked if Pizza Hut had plans to make commercials that
parody Giuliani, Allison replied, ``No. Not yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Langone, too, denied any association with the commercial. ``The
first I heard of this ad was a phone call from a reporter asking me
for a comment,'' he said. ``I had no idea it was even created. . .
. I've never talked to a member of any ad agency.'' The mayor's
campaign office also denied any connection to the ad.
</P>
<P>
   The string of denials hasn't stopped the political parties from
making hay of the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Jordan of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee in
Washington said, ``I suspect that eventually, lawyers will look
into whether this constitutes an illegal contribution to the
mayor's campaign,'' though, he added, no lawyers are on the case
yet.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Law, director of the National Republican Senatorial
Committee, issued a news release Friday telling the Democrats to
stop ``whining'' and saying, ``Hillary needs to lighten up.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, to hammer home the point, Law noted that other Pizza Hut
commercials have featured ``impersonations of Donald Trump and
Spike Lee. So what these ads are meant to highlight are famous New
Yorkers _ and wannabe New Yorkers.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, previous ads for the ``Big New Yorker'' pizza featured
the real Trump and Lee, not impersonators.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Garfield, columnist for Ad Age magazine, said, ``A
frightening, substantial number of American television viewers will
think this is Hillary Clinton doing a Pizza Hut commercial.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House has long had a policy of objecting to companies
using likenesses of the president and his family to endorse
commercial products. ``I'd think,'' Garfield said, ``this is waving
a big red flag in front of the White House for a cease-and-desist
order.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady's spokeswoman, Marsha Berry, had no comment on
the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Garfield also said he thought it unlikely that the ad was
intended to have an anti-Hillary side effect. ``I would be stunned
if there were any political motivation to this commercial,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the company's own public relations machine has
unashamedly played up the politics. A Pizza Hut news release
heralding the commercial is headlined: ``Who Will Be the Next US
Senator from New York? Major National Advertiser Capitalizes on
Hotly Contested New York Senate Race.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Mandelker, a Manhattan election lawyer, said the Federal
Election Commission probably would not consider the ad a violation
of its regulations. However, he added, because ``it sort of says
she's a carpetbagger'' _ an argument that has emerged as a campaign
issue _ ``it comes closer to a violation than a lot of other things
I've heard of.''

AN INDIAN BECOMES A SCHOLAR AND HELPS WRITE THE FIRST ZAPOTEC
DICTIONARY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mexico, Calif.)   By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The first thing you should know about Felipe
Lopez, who immigrated from Oaxaca 21 years ago in the trunk of a
smuggler's car, is that his name is not really Felipe Lopez, and
that he does not really consider himself Mexican.
</P>
<P>
   True, Felipe Lopez is the name on his legal documents, but in
his native Indian language, and his home, his real name, he
insists, is Lieb. Mexico, he says, is a society that renders
Indians like himself all but invisible, pressuring them to
assimilate in the dominant Spanish culture. So Mexico feels less
like his true homeland, he says, than his newly adopted one, which
gave him the opportunity to sweat in hot kitchens for years earning
low wages.
</P>
<P>
   But all that, remarkably, is in the past. For the great triumph
in the life of this quietly intense man is that he has turned a
corner by finally coming to a point, after years of strife, where
he can now define himself by what he is rather than by what he is
not.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Lopez, 37, is proud to call himself a Zapotec Indian and
a scholar, a man whose native language, never before written down,
now has its own two-volume dictionary. Lopez, who barely got
through the sixth grade in his home village but is a doctoral
candidate here, helped write the volumes, a Zapotec-English-Spanish
dictionary that has charted new ground in the study of Mexico's
indigenous languages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I think it's a dream, is this real,'' said Lopez,
sitting in his office at the University of California at Los
Angeles. ``I was taught to feel ashamed of being an Indian. I was
taught that someone like me could not think of doing this. I had to
show them.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``them'' he had to show were both the many Mexicans who, he
said, look down on Indians as well as Americans who expect little
from illegal Mexican immigrants beyond cheap labor. What was
particularly striking about his achievement, several experts said,
was that it would have been difficult in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a language that would probably never have been
described if this had not been done here,'' said Pamela Munro,
Lopez's co-author and a linguist who has prepared dictionaries for
several American Indian languages. ``I don't know why there aren't
more dictionaries like this being done in Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopez's native language is spoken by 1,000 to 2,000 people in
his home village, San Luis Quiavini, in central Oaxaca state. It is
related to several dozen other languages generally referred to as
Zapotec, but which are distinct. The group of languages is spoken
in geographic pockets in Oaxaca by perhaps 400,000 people, Ms.
Munro said.
</P>
<P>
   But with the spread of popular culture and Spanish language
schools, she said, Zapotec and a number of other indigenous
languages in Mexico are slowly dying.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez ponders such facts with resentment. He said that he was
taught to regard Zapotec as a liability and that it was a subject
of humiliation in his contacts with the world outside his village.
</P>
<P>
   The stain of those early impressions so colored his perceptions,
he recalled, that when he first began to discuss the idea of a
dictionary with Ms. Munro six years ago, he told her that it would
be a simple project because the primitive language had a vocabulary
of perhaps 100 words. The final volumes contain more than 9,000
entries; Ms. Munro said the language, which uses a complex system
of tones, is one of the most maddeningly difficult she had
encountered.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez said that he grew up speaking no Spanish until he went to
school, and that this left him feeling marginalized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids made fun of me,'' he said, ``but I didn't even understand
what they were saying.''
</P>
<P>
   He left school after the sixth grade to work on his family's
farm, and when he was 16, he began the great adventure of his life.
He took buses north and eventually slipped across the border by
paying a smuggler.
</P>
<P>
   He ended up in Los Angeles with some relatives, working as a
dishwasher in a Chinese restaurant. By then, he spoke a smattering
of Spanish, but virtually no English, leaving him feeling awed by
the new country but almost completely isolated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told myself, `Either I will become what they say I am, or I
will better myself,''' Lopez said. ``That was what motivated me.''
</P>
<P>
   So he worked his way through various restaurant jobs and
eventually became a cook, all the while slowly improving his
English and Spanish. He said he finally realized he could earn even
more if he could learn enough English to communicate with all the
waiters and the staff. So he decided to attend an adult education
course, an experience that lasted exactly one class.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez said he was taken by surprise when the teacher asked him
to point out the parts of a sentence on the chalkboard. He said he
stood there paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what a verb was,'' he said. ``I realized I was
illiterate.''
</P>
<P>
   The bell rang, ending the painful moment, but the episode sent
him with a new found zeal on his great odyssey. He never went back
to the class, he said, but he began to teach himself the answer to
that first question: what is a verb?
</P>
<P>
   Lopez threw himself into his studies and progressed through a
series of programs after work. In 1984 he received his high school
equivalency diploma. Shortly afterward he began taking courses at
Santa Monica College, a two-year institution.
</P>
<P>
   Even after earning the two-year degree, he was reluctant to
consider going for his bachelor's degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not for me,'' Lopez said he told a friend who encouraged
him to go on. ``No one in my town has even been to college. I don't
have what it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   He decided, though, that he had nothing to lose, and he applied
to UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was almost praying I wouldn't be accepted,'' Lopez said.
``If I was turned down, I thought all my problems would be solved.
I wouldn't have to face all those issues.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was accepted, and began taking classes in the fall of
1991. He received his undergraduate degree in Latin American
studies in 1994, and his master's degree two years later. He then
entered the doctorate program in urban planning, a degree he hopes
to use to help villages like San Lucas Quiavini find ways of
developing that will not stamp out the native language and culture.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez, now married with two children, became a legal U.S.
resident under the Immigration and Reform Control Act of 1986,
which allowed Mexicans and other immigrants living illegally in
this country to obtain legal citizenship. He became a citizen in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Guillermo E. Hernandez, the director of the Chicano Studies
Research Center at UCLA and the publisher of the Zapotec
dictionary, said the project was a milestone not just for Lopez but
also for the university by making it clear that the study of Indian
cultures would be encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   ``This speaks loudly to our colleagues now that this kind of
thing will be a part of the center,'' Hernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez takes some satisfaction in that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of times I thought, `If it's not me, who will do it?'''
he said. ``Why did I go through all these hardships?''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Throughout much of the 1980s, George Steinbrenner
boasted of the Yankees' won-lost record, the best in the decade, he
proudly and pointedly claimed, but Major League Baseball wasn't
giving out trophies for the best cumulative record, so the owner's
claim of superiority fell on deaf ears.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a decade later, a variation on the Steinbrenner theme has
arisen and, legitimate or not, it will be played out as the Yankees
and the Atlanta Braves play the final World Series of the 1900s.
They will meet, beginning at Turner Field on Saturday night,
against the backdrop of a questionable controversy:
</P>
<P>
   If the Yankees win their third World Series in the last four
years, will they be the team of the decade? Or will it be the
Braves based on their having by far the best won-lost record and
eight consecutive division championships?
</P>
<P>
   Most of the people on both teams who addressed the issue Friday
questioned the legitimacy of the designation, saying their primary
goal was to win this World Series. But David Cone acknowledged that
it made for an interesting debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not first and foremost in players' minds,'' said Cone,
the Yankees' Game 2 pitcher. ``It's not added pressure. It's nice
to be part of that debate, though.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves finished the '90s with 925 victories and 629 defeats.
The Yankees had an 851-702 record, finishing 73{ games behind the
Braves. The Yankees' record in the 80's was 854-708. This is the
Braves' fifth World Series in the '90s, but they have won only one
of the previous four. The Yankees have won the World Series twice
in the past three years, matching the pair the Toronto Blue Jays
won in 1992 and '93.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're definitely the team of the last five years,'' Cone said.
``You want to go 8 years, 10 years, 12? Make it what you want. Team
of the decade? OK, whatever. In the '90s, the Braves are the best
in the regular season. No one could touch them. As far as World
Series championships, if we get three, nobody else has three.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves could have avoided the entire debate had they won the
World Series another time or two, in 1991, for example, when they
lost the seventh game to Minnesota, 1-0, in 10 innings; or in 1996,
when they won the first two games against the Yankees and had a 6-0
lead in Game 4. But they didn't _ thus, the talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never heard a decade talked about as much,'' said John
Smoltz, one of the two players who has been with the Braves the
entire decade (the other is Tom Glavine). ``I never remember anyone
talking about the '80s, or the '70s. I've never seen anyone come up
with a formula to dictate who is the team. I think we get a little
carried away in the scheme of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz lamented the way others in baseball and out have
diminished the Braves' accomplishments just because they have not
won more World Series. ``I think what we've done,'' he said,
referring to the division titles, ``has caused a major dilemma
because nobody's ever done this.''
</P>
<P>
   But members of the Yankees did not belittle what the Braves had
done. Nor did they leap into the ``team of the decade'' debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could care less,'' catcher Joe Girardi said. ``We're worried
about one World Series _ 1999. How many players were here the whole
10 years? For the organization it might be important, and for the
fans to talk about it might be important. But for the players,
you're lucky if you get to play in the big leagues for five years,
let alone play for one team for a decade.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Maddux, the Braves' second-game starting pitcher, said the
World Series was big enough and did not need the additional hype of
a longer view of the teams competing for the championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want another World Series ring,'' he said. ``I want that
more than I want to be labeled the team of the '90s. They don't
really give you a ring for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Hirdt is an objective but knowledgeable observer of the
relative achievements of the Braves and the Yankees. He is
executive vice president of the Elias Sports Bureau, baseball's
official statistician.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Yankees win this year, I hope the focus will be on
their winning the World Series and on this team,'' he said. But if
the focus is on team of the decade, he added, ``are they going to
have Kevin Maas and Alvaro Espinzoa come in for a celebration of
the 1990s?''
</P>
<P>
   Hirdt saluted the Braves as a ``tremendously consistent team''
but said: ``The artificiality of the decade doesn't add any luster.
It wasn't as if they were waiting for the '90s to start so they
could start winning division championships.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Melvin, general manager of the Texas Rangers, put the
question in perspective from the point of view of an official of a
club that is not a contender for the designation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes back to that old philosophy,'' Melvin said. ``What
would you rather do, win one World Series and be in the Marlins'
situation or be like Cleveland and be a team that's there every
year but hasn't won the World Series? I ask people that question
and get various answers. Personally you'd like to win the World
Series, but you can't do it if you're not going to be a consistent
ball club and win every year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have won the division championship every year (except
the no-championship strike season of 1994) that John Schuerholz has
been their general manager. He said there was no more fitting end
to the 1900s than having the teams with the best records of the
last decade playing in the final World Series.
</P>
<P>
   On the matter of team of the '90s, though, he said: ``I don't
know about that. I don't do titles or designations. We just try to
win games.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet a few days earlier, Schuerholz did take credit for the
Braves' accomplishments in the '90s. ``With respect to winning
world championships, they're tied for the best in this decade,'' he
said, referring to the two World Series the Yankees and the Blue
Jays have each won. ``From that perspective, I tip my cap to them.
For continuity of success, more games won, highest winning
percentage, divisions won, league championships appeared in,
winning 100 games three years in a row, I tip my hat to our
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   As he tipped his imaginary hat, though, he flashed a ring that
had engraved on the side the words ``Team of the '90s.'' When he
was asked about that phrase Friday while talking to a group of
reporters, Schuerholz did not duck the question or quickly bury his
hand in his pocket. ``Yeah,'' he said, ``but someone was kind
enough to write that, and we stole it from one of you guys, so we
can't take credit for that.''

FOUR CHILDREN REPORT ILLNESS FROM COKE PRODUCTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (pr) 
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Four schoolchildren in Belgium said Friday that they experienced
nausea, headaches and rashes after drinking Coca-Cola products
bought from a vending machine near their school. But a spokesman
for Coca-Cola Co. in Atlanta said the soft drinks were not the
cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the Coca-Cola is perfectly normal and of high
quality,'' said the spokesman, Randall W. Donaldson.
</P>
<P>
   One of the children, all of whom are 12 and live in Tienen, said
she felt ill after finishing off a half-liter bottle of Coke. The
other three reported similar symptoms after drinking
orange-flavored Fanta, also from a half-liter bottle. The remaining
Fanta has been sent for testing to the University of Leuven, and
results are expected today or tomorrow, Donaldson said.
</P>
<P>
   The cola came from a plant in East Kilbride, England, owned by
Coca-Cola Enterprises, Coke's biggest bottler, Donaldson said. The
Fanta was bottled at a Coca-Cola Enterprises plant in Antwerp.
</P>
<P>
   The Antwerp plant was shut for 10 days in June by the Belgian
authorities after hundreds of people reported feeling ill after
drinking Coke products in various parts of Belgium. Some of the
products were traced to Antwerp, while others came from a plant in
Dunkirk, France.
</P>
<P>
   The complaints prompted the largest recall of Coke beverages in
company history, and about 17 million cases were destroyed after
being removed from store shelves and people's homes.
</P>
<P>
   The Belgian police sealed off the vending machine used by the
children, in Tienen, in the eastern part of the country. Coca-Cola
executives have tested bottles from the same batch and found
nothing wrong, Donaldson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the experience of last time, they need to be very
upfront and proactive in communicating to the public about this,''
said Bill Pecoriello, a beverage analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein.
``They need to cut off any concern before it snowballs.''

LAWMAKERS REACH ACCORD TO LIFT BANKING BARRIERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lawmakers exulted Friday that finally, after more
than two decades of work, they had agreed on a bill to tear down
the Depression-era firewalls that generally keep banks, insurance
companies, and stock brokerages from buying each other or offering
each other's products.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a long time, but we have finally brought our financial
services industry into the modern world,'' said Representative
Marge Roukema, Republican of New Jersey, after four days of
intensive talks between lawmakers and the White House ended with a
deal at 2 a.m. Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But in truth, it is the industry that brought Congress into the
modern world.
</P>
<P>
   By winning lawsuits and ad hoc victories before regulators,
financial service companies already have eroded many of the walls
between banks, brokerages, and insurance companies. And that is why
a bill that entailed years of work and millions of lobbying dollars
may not produce noticeable changes for consumers, at least not in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business community was way ahead of the public sector on
this,'' said Senator John Kerry Friday. ``What's happening is more
a codification of what has already been going on, so that you have
a single standard that applies to the whole country.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, the current laws, which were enacted after the
financial meltdown of the late 1920s and 1930s, bar banks from the
insurance business. But under a 1996 Supreme Court decision, banks
won the right to sell insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance companies, in turn, were barred from banking. But they
routinely offer savings products once associated only with banks,
such as CDs and investment vehicles that include checking accounts.
So have brokerages, which are barred from buying banks but still
offer a range of cash-management accounts that include checking.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new law, most of the remaining barriers between the
various sectors of the financial services industry would be
removed. A local insurance agent, for example, would now be able to
sell banking products, such as loans and mutual funds. Banks also
would be able to underwrite insurance, in addition to selling
policies.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone in the industry sees the bill as a victory. Small
banks, for example, argue that creating more super-sized financial
firms might harm consumers, though they acknowledged that mergers
would take place with or without the new law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every study that's been done shows that the larger the
institution, the higher the rate the consumer pays on loans and the
lower the rate they get on their savings,'' said Ron Ence of the
Independent Community Bankers of America.
</P>
<P>
   All this assumes the bill will become law, which is likely. The
House and Senate passed the financial services bill earlier this
year, and Friday they ironed out the differences that existed among
themselves and with the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``The White House is very pleased with the results of Friday's
negotiations,'' said Joe Lockhart, spokesman for President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But the deal is not final until formal legislative language is
drafted, and some lawmakers held out hope that they could persuade
the White House to reverse course and demand changes to two
provisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not settled,'' said Representative Edward Markey,
Democrat of Malden. He said black and Hispanic groups, as well as
advocates for privacy rights and the poor, might be able to
persuade the White House to withdraw its support and reopen
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   One dispute involves the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977,
which requires banks to make loans in the communities where they
draw deposits. The law is credited with pushing banks to offer
credit in poor and minority communities.
</P>
<P>
   Legislative aides said that the deal reached Friday would
require federal regulators to audit banks for CRA compliance
whenever the bank asks to enter a new, nonbank line of business.
Currently, banks are supposed to be reviewed every 18 months to two
years, though in practice reviews often come every three years.
</P>
<P>
   If regulators find that the bank is not complying with the
lending law, then they can reject the bank's application to enter
new businesses.
</P>
<P>
   However, some lawmakers were angered that the final bill drops a
House provision requiring banks to maintain a satisfactory CRA
rating even after they enter new businesses. If a bank's CRA rating
flags, the House had said, then regulators could demand that it
divest of its new businesses.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the new law would allow small banks to submit to
CRA reviews every four years or five years. The definition of
``small banks'' includes 80 percent of US banks, said Josh Silver
of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, which lobbies for
a stronger CRA and fair lending laws. ``This severely limits the
application of the CRA to small banks,'' he said. ``It is a step
backward.''
</P>
<P>
   The new law would allow a company with banking, insurance, or
securities arms to swap personal information about consumers among
its various units. Companies said that will help them offer better
services to consumers, but privacy advocates, including Markey,
said people would find their sensitive credit card and tax
information given to telemarketers and stockbrokers.
</P>
<P>
   A company can also disclose personal information to other firms
with which it does business, but customers have to be notified and
can block the data sharing.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also prevents nonfinancial companies from moving into
the banking business.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, commercial firms are barred from owning banks but can
buy a single savings and loan under a limited charter called a
unitary thrift. This law threatened small, rural banks, which said
that a company like Wal-Mart might set up branches in each of its
stores.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, said Ence of the community bankers' group, ``If you
mix commerce and banking, you jeopardize the impartial allocation
of credit. Credit may be allocated on internal business decisions,
rather than on merit, and that's dangerous.''

NO SMALL CHANGE AS PENSION PLANS ARE CONVERTED

NYT graphic clients. Non-subscribers can make individual purchase
by calling (888) 603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.)  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 24)  
 (af)  
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hundreds of companies have switched to cash-balance pension
plans. But outraged employees who have seen the value of their
pensions shrivel have spurred lawmakers to investigate and have
pressured some companies, including IBM, to reverse themselves.
Here are some common questions about the plans: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How do cash-balance plans differ from traditional pensions? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. With old-fashioned pensions, employees earn most of their
retirement benefits toward the end of their careers, because
benefits are calculated using factors including years of service
and final pay. Under cash-balance plans, workers accrue benefits
evenly over their careers. Their employer deposits a percentage of
their pay in their accounts every year and guarantees they will
grow by a certain percentage annually. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Who wins and who loses if a company converts to a
cash-balance plan? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. That depends. Some companies let employees stay with the old
plan. But at others, employees must switch, and some have seen the
value of future benefits drop 20 percent to 50 percent. Generally,
younger employees, especially job hoppers, can do better under
cash-balance plans because they will accrue benefits faster. But
middle-aged and older workers often do worse because conversions
come just as they reach the age when the old formula begins to
sharply bolster the value of pension payouts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What does a company get out of switching to a cash-balance
plan? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Plenty. For starters, many see savings right off the bat.
Before it backed down, IBM said the switch would save $200 million
annually.
</P>
<P>
   But there's more. Companies love predictability, but they don't
have much with old-fashioned pensions. Since they invest pension
reserves in stocks and bonds, which have been in a bull market,
many now have overfunded pensions. But not long ago, many had
underfunded pensions. A drop in the markets could put them back
there.
</P>
<P>
   With cash-balance plans, companies are responsible only for
paying out the annual percentage of the employee's pay plus the
yearly promised increase in the account. That growth rate is
typically linked to Treasury bond rates. Thus, the company is more
certain about what it will owe. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are switches to cash-balance plans legal? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. That depends on whom you ask. Conversions cannot cause a
current or retired employee to lose retirement benefits, nor can
they discriminate illegally against older workers. Federal law is
also clear that pension plans are voluntary, so any employer can
terminate or alter a plan, as long as it doesn't take away benefits
already earned or violate age-discrimination rules. Companies may
also be limited by union contracts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are government officials looking at the issue of conversions
to cash-balance plans? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes. The Internal Revenue Service and Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission are investigating whether the plans
discriminate illegally. Proposals have been made in Congress to
widen disclosure about conversions or scale back companies' ability
to switch plans in ways that hurt older workers.

 &HT;    Crew chief accepts fine for profanity
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKINGHAM, N.C. _ Todd Parrott, crew chief for Winston Cup
points leader Dale Jarrett, doesn't have any dirty words to say
about NASCAR's penalty against him.
</P>
<P>
   Parrott was fined $5,000 by the sport's governing body for using
profanity during ESPN's telecast of the Talladega race last
weekend. Parrott, Jarrett and team owner Robert Yates agreed to
wear microphones, but Parrott said he was assured that there would
be a delay in broadcasting the conversations over the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I'm not really upset with the fine,'' Parrott, who issued
a public letter of apology.
</P>
<P>
   ``NASCAR has got a job to do, just like I do. They've got to
control the sport. Something got out on television that should have
never got out on television and it got out on television again that
night (in the replay). NASCAR had a right and they had to do
something. I understand totally.''
</P>
<P>
   Team members of the Ford No. 88 say Parrott was truly
embarrassed by the incident. And it never was a laughing matter
with Parrott, even though others in the racing community have been
teasing him. Yates joked that he thought about requiring Parrott to
wear a bar of soap around his neck this weekend at North Carolina
Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Seriously), Todd doesn't have a dirty mouth,'' Yates said.
``He doesn't need to use four-letter words to get his point across.
When you get into a heated battle and you've had it on all day
long, and the car runs terrible, you just forget about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember back with Davey Allison, we knew were miked and we
knew we were live. The car ran out of gas on the backstretch at
Pocono and he said some bad things, like, 'Where's the wrecker?'
and he emphasized it like 'I want the (expletive) wrecker' and
that's not the right thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly want to keep this sport clean. I've always been
proud to go around and tell people that watch our sport that it's
night and day different than some of the TV shows you see at
night.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett, who qualified third for Sunday's Pop Secret 400, has
been masterful at avoiding controversy this season as his team
chases after the Winston Cup championship. Jarrett, however, could
not bite his lip when asked about the disciplinary action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a few words I could put with (my opinion), but I don't
have the money to pay the fines,'' Jarrett said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just trying to enhance the sport (by wearing the
microphones). We were told one thing by the people who aired the
race. Unfortunately, that didn't happen. I think it would be a
really good idea for ESPN to pay the fine for Todd because it was
their fault.''

 &HT;    Rebuilt Avalanche still solid contender
 &HT;    By Guy Curtright
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Colorado acquired Theo Fleury late last season,
many people favored the Avalanche to win its second Stanley Cup in
four years. But the Dallas Stars rallied from a 3-2 series deficit
to beat Colorado in the Western Conference Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Fleury is in New York, the beneficiary of the Rangers'
free-agent spending spree that also snared Valeri Kamensky and
Sylvain Lefebvre.
</P>
<P>
   So, what has Colorado done? Just turned to Generation Next and
made itself a slightly cheaper but no less talented contender for
the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the additional absence of Peter Forsberg until at least
late November because of offseason shoulder surgery, Colorado still
is one of the NHL's top teams. Atlantans will get a chance to see
for themselves tonight, as the Avalanche and budding standouts
Chris Drury, Milan Hejduk and Alex Tanguay play the Thrashers in
Philips Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta, 1-3-2 and coming off a five-day layoff, is looking for
its first home win. Colorado, 4-3-2 and tied for first in the
Northwest Division despite only two home games, isn't the kind of
team against which a victory comes easily _ anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colorado is very, very good,'' Thrashers coach Curt Fraser
said. ``The Avalanche _ all that skill and speed, like Detroit.
They're always on the go, trading scoring chances. They count on
Patrick Roy to stop the other team and he usually does.''
</P>
<P>
   Roy, fourth all-time among NHL goalies in victories, has been
his usual stellar self in goal, while captain Joe Sakic had at
least one point in Colorado's first eight games. But the Avalanche
also is counting heavily on second-year standouts Drury and Hejduk
and promising 19-year-old rookies Tanguay and defenseman Martin
Skoula.
</P>
<P>
   Left wing Drury, a one-time Little League World Series hero from
Trumbull, Conn., won the Calder Trophy last season as the NHL's top
rookie, while right wing Hejduk finished third in the voting.
Hejduk, 23, has a team-high six goals and his eight points rank
second to Sakic's 11. Drury, 23, has seven points, tied with
Tanguay _ the leading candidate for the rookie award this season.
Playing left wing on a line centered by Sakic, Tanguay has three
goals and four assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we're missing some key guys, but I think the young
guys (are) filling the holes real well,'' Sakic said. ``I like what
we have here. I like our chances this year. We're going to get
better. We're going to have a shot at (the Cup.)''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Hartley, in his second season as coach, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have high expectations,'' Hartley said. ``We managed to
keep the core players on this team and we feel real good about the
young prospects. You look at every dynasty team. They always make
moves with older players at the end. You have some growing pains,
but that's part of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always talk about experience in this business, but new
blood is always a sign of new life. I think it's rubbing off on
everyone. There's fresh air in the dressing room. We're in a good
situation. We just have to let the kids get adjusted to the NHL
level, and I'm sure that they're going to have good seasons.''
</P>
<P>
   General manager Pierre Lacroix, who still has the NHL's
third-highest payroll at $42 million, also feels good about his
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are blessed with great depth in this organization,''
Lacroix said before the start of the season. ``We're excited about
what some of our young kids bring to us. I guess you could say
we're at a crossroads, but both roads are nicely paved for us to
choose.''

ANOTHER SETBACK FOR BP AMOCO IN ITS INVESTMENT IN RUSSIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By NEELA BANERJEE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ BP Amoco has suffered what may be the harshest setback
yet in its struggle to preserve a $571 million investment in
Sidanko, a bankrupt Russian oil conglomerate that once symbolized
opportunity for foreigners in Russia's petroleum industry.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Tyumen Oil Co., a Sidanko rival that has emerged as
a big problem for BP Amoco, acquired Kondpetroleum, a bankrupt oil
producing subsidiary of Sidanko. Tyumen paid only $52 million, a
sharp markdown from the asking price of $145 million.
</P>
<P>
   Despite assurances from the Russian government that BP Amoco's
10 percent investment would be protected, BP Amoco has watched
valuable Sidanko subsidiaries gradually slip away over the last
year and end up under the ownership, or at least the influence, of
Tyumen Oil.
</P>
<P>
   The Kondpetroleum sale to Tyumen may be the most decisive blow
yet: if the deal goes forward, it is likely that similar methods
will be used to sell Sidanko's core oil producer, Chernogorneft,
later this year. Most analysts predict that Tyumen Oil, which has
long sought to buy Chernogorneft, will get it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a good chance that Cherno will go, too, at this
rate,'' said Peter Boone, director of research for the Moscow
brokerage firm of Brunswick Warburg. ``The fight has been going on
for a long time, and BP Amoco seems to be losing every little
battle.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kondpetroleum sale is the latest in a series of disputes
that have further tarnished Russia's poor image with investors. Two
weeks ago, a St. Petersburg court reversed the privatization of the
Lomonosov porcelain factory, annulling a majority stake held in the
company by several executives from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the
$440 million U.S.-Russia Investment Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Days later, police in Vyborg, north of St. Petersburg, clashed
with workers at a cellulose plant who refused to obey a court
decision handing over the factory to a Britain-based owner. Last
Friday, Russia's chief securities regulator resigned over what he
called Russia's intractable hostility toward outside investors.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Sidanko, BP Amoco and many industry analysts say
that Tyumen Oil has used the bankruptcy process to strip away
Sidanko assets like Kondpetroleum at exceedingly low prices. Tyumen
Oil has rejected such accusations. It has said BP Amoco is
frustrated by the British company's own poor decision to invest in
Sidanko.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, BP Amoco two years ago picked a concern that was more a
collection of scattered assets rather than a functioning company.
By late last year, minor creditors had begun bankruptcy proceedings
against three Sidanko units, including Kondpetroleum and
Chernogorneft, and early this year Sidanko itself was pushed into
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Sidanko is the largest creditor of Chernogorneft and
Kondpetroleum, but since the bankruptcies began, Russian courts,
especially in the Tyumen region where the companies are based, have
handed down rulings contradicting creditors' wishes.
</P>
<P>
   BP Amoco and others accuse Tyumen Oil of unduly influencing the
local courts, particularly because the head of Tyumen Oil's board,
Leonid Roketsky, is also the region's governor. Tyumen Oil denies
such accusations.
</P>
<P>
   The courts have installed external managers at Chernogorneft and
Kondpetroleum who have refused to register debts Sidanko is owed by
the units. That, in turn, reduces or voids Sidanko's role on the
creditors' committees, which decide how to deal with the companies'
bankruptcies. In both cases, the external managers, contrary to
Sidanko's wishes, have decided to sell the production units
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where business and politics are inextricable,
high-level influence may ultimately decide the fate of Sidanko's
units. BP Amoco has successfully lobbied Congress to delay $500
million in Export-Import Bank loan guarantees to Tyumen Oil.
</P>
<P>
   But in Russia, BP Amoco is clearly less influential than Tyumen
Oil, which is owned by the powerful Alfa Group, whose top
executives include former government ministers and Kremlin
insiders. Said one Moscow oil analyst, ``Domestically, Alfa has
enough power, enough good connections with the current regime, to
be able to go all the way on this.''

 &HT;    Yankees or Braves: '90s debate renewed
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Before he ever saw it, Tom Glavine had heard about it.
</P>
<P>
   And even when he got possession of his 1995 World Series
championship ring and read ``Team of the Decade'' that ran around
the side, the notion seemed innocuous enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just another thing on a ring,'' Glavine said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the proclamation was made with a half a decade to run.
Even if there has not been another World Championship to follow it.
Even if the New York Yankees will be seated in the dugout the next
few nights.
</P>
<P>
   The team of the what?
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming off a championship and the success we'd had, maybe it
wasn't so far-fetched,'' Glavine said. ``But, obviously, the last
few years, the Yankees have had a little to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   This World Series already is unique, in that for the first time
in history, the teams with the best records over the decade are
meeting in the final game of that decade. That distinction alone
would be enough to fill out a marquee _ if not for this Team of the
Decade issue, which has been whipped to shreds by the media this
week.
</P>
<P>
   As Yankees reliever Jeff Nelson asked, ``Was there a team of the
'80s?''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly.
</P>
<P>
   But then again, was there a team that wore such a designation so
eagerly and so early?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's purely a subjective thing, but the Braves, for me, are
the team of the decade, regardless of who wins this World Series,''
Houston Astros general manager Gary Hunsicker said. ``Yes, getting
to the World Series is the goal of every team, but consistency is
more important.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the No. 1 criteria for evaluating a franchise,''
Hunsicker said. ``It's not by a landslide vote, believe me. But I
do feel the Braves are clearly the team of the decade.''
</P>
<P>
   Their victory total in the 1990s (925 games) not only far
outstrips the Yankees' (851) but represents the second-highest
total in the past 40 years, behind the 1970s Cincinnati Reds, who
won 953. Not since the Yankees of the 1950s made the World Series
eight times has a franchise appeared as regularly as the Braves,
who have made five trips in the 1990s. And unlike Casey Stengel's
Yankees, the Braves have had two and then three rounds of
postseason play to maneuver through.
</P>
<P>
   The eight consecutive divisional championships, saluted on
Turner Field's left-field upper deck, are an unprecedented
achievement. Perhaps more remarkably, the Braves have faced seven
different franchises in their eight visits to the NLCS. The Braves
remain.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was easy, some of these (other) teams would have done
it,'' Braves general manager John Schuerholz said.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, winning can be graded by degrees. While the addition
of a third postseason round has thrown another kink into October's
road, no one has changed the grail. Winning a World Series remains
the standard, even if harder to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you judge the team of the decade?'' Texas Rangers first
baseman Rafael Palmeiro asked this month. ``Is it on championships
alone or on postseason appearances? How do you do it?''
</P>
<P>
   Easy for the Yankees. They'll take the big trophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, let's admit it,'' manager Joe Torre said. ``When you
work for George Steinbrenner, just getting to the postseason is not
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Aren't we the team of the century?'' Yankees general manager
Brian Cashman asked. ``World championships, that's the goal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have 24. Even with that history, to win a third
World Series in four years, as they can in the next eight days,
would set this era apart. No Yankees club has won it all so
frequently since the run of five in a row from 1949-53.
</P>
<P>
   Then how to explain away the early '90s? While the Braves were
appearing in _ and losing _ the 1991 and '92 Series, the Yankees
were not competitive, fielding second-division teams from 1990 to
1992. Those clubs finished an aggregate 62 games out of first.
</P>
<P>
   With the end of the '94 season and all of the postseason wiped
out by the strike, it was not until 1996 that the Yankees actually
won the AL East. That same year, the Braves took their fifth
division championship in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm talking about team of the decade, I was saying the
Braves, Braves, Braves,'' Torre said. ``They're there every single
year, going to postseason play. To me, that's emblematic of a very
successful franchise.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with its years of excellence, however, the Braves still
have questions to answer. They still have their 1-3 showing in the
World Series and three failures in the NLCS.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will say if (the Braves) hadn't won the NLCS, they wouldn't
be looked at in the same light,'' said Ozzie Smith, whose St. Louis
teams won just one of three World Series in the 1980s. ``They still
won't be put on a higher pedestal until they win another World
Series. Because I think (having the chance) to go to eight World
Series and you only come away with one world championship, that's
not what people expect from a team that finishes first every
year.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Schuerholz says the team-of-the-decade business
came not from the organization but from the media, when it was
tossed about in the afterglow of the 1995 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stole this from either the press or the media. We thought
it sounded good,'' Schuerholz said. ``We didn't designate outselves
that. Hopefully, it will be validated.''
</P>
<P>
   They have only one way to do that, which further elevates the
game's premiere event as the 1990s come to a close. So, it's not
just baseball anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of playing for one year,'' New York's David Cone said,
``we're playing for 10.''

 &HT;    Braves `confident' in rare underdog role
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Color the Braves nostalgic.
</P>
<P>
   They're back in the World Series for first time in three years
and fifth time this decade. They're surrounded again by the masses
of reporters, well-wishers, ticket-seekers and baseballs to be
signed.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not exactly what had this team doing a little
reminiscing heading into tonight's Game 1 of the World Series at
Turner Field. These Braves, who've been hanging around for eight
consecutive postseasons now, are getting a new perspective. They
may actually be looking up.
</P>
<P>
   According to newspaper columnists around the country and
oddsmakers in Las Vegas, the Braves are something they never are
anymore: underdogs. And that's quite all right with the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody expects us to win, so it takes a little of the pressure
off,'' Chipper Jones said. ``Everybody can play free and easy and
play hard and take some chances here and there. We feel confident.
We know we can play with them. There shouldn't be any doubt in
anybody's mind. We've just got to go out and prove it at the right
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves may be gunning for ``Team of the '90s'' recognition,
which would be solidified with a second World Series title this
decade. But the Yankees are going for ``Team of the Century'' title
and a 25th World Series championship.
</P>
<P>
   And the Yankees, going for a third World Series championship in
four years, are the ones fighting their shadows. Last year,
including the postseason, the Yankees won 125 games to set a
major-league record, including a World Series cakewalk over the
Padres in a four-game sweep. This Yankees team still won 98 games
in the regular season, but the 16-game drop-off was the biggest in
the American League.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have a bigger payroll, pushing $90 million compared
with the Braves' $62 million, and a bigger market. More media
pressure. More hype. More jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got the ring,'' Jones said. ``We're trying to take it
from them. Winning 125 games last year and they've got pretty much
the same personnel. We've been doing it with smoke and mirrors,
ham-n-egging them, and they're just killing them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves got 31 of their 103 wins this regular season in their
final at-bat. They arrived in October short of the power they're
used to _ minus Andres Galarraga and Javy Lopez _ but with the
added dimension of speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this year our Braves team ... the feeling is we'll
find a way to win,'' John Smoltz said. ``We don't rely so much on
the home run and pitching, same old formula.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees also play a lot more National League-like that most
American League teams, which makes this an intriguing matchup.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves finished first in the major leagues with a 3.63 ERA.
The Yankees are sixth with a 4.13, but throw in the American
League's use of the designated hitter, that's right on par with the
Braves. The Braves hit 197 homers to the Yankees' 193. The Braves
had more stolen bases (148-104), but the Yankees counter with the
highest on-base percentage in baseball at .366 and one of the
highest batting averages (.282).
</P>
<P>
   ``You probably have to give them the advantage man-for-man,''
Jones said. ``We do have pitching and we are capable of playing
good baseball. Hopefully we have that caliber of play in us at the
right time.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the Yankees and Braves met in the 1996 Series, the Fall
Classic has featured an upstart _ the wild-card Marlins in 1997 or
the from-outta-nowhere Padres in 1998. Not this time.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves may be considered underdogs, but then again that has
to be measured in degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the injuries they had this season, the Braves still
felt some serious heat when they got up 3-0 on the Mets and lost
two in a row to face the prospect of becoming the first
major-league baseball team to blow a 3-0 lead in a best-of-seven
series.
</P>
<P>
   They also know what lurks behind their image as ``Team of the
'90s'' _ the old Buffalo Bills reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Smoltz nor Tom Glavine nor Greg Maddux, the pitching
trio that underscores this decade-long run, seemed to feel like
much of an underdog on Friday afternoon, shrugging upon being asked
the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are the odds?'' asked the Las Vegas transplant Maddux,
who then added: ``I don't care. I'm not bettin' ... It really
doesn't matter. It's not like you look and see you're a 14-to-5
favorite and say `Oh, I don't have to work as hard today.' You just
want to go out and play the game right, as good as you possibly
can, and take your chances.''

 &HT;    Tide-Vols again SEC benchmark
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUSCALOOSA, Ala. _ Gen. Robert R. Neyland, Tennessee's Hall of
Fame coach, had a stock answer when anyone asked how good his team
would be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Neyland would say. ``Ask me again after the
third Saturday in October.''
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-one times in this century, most often on the third
Saturday in October, Tennessee and Alabama have met on the football
field. Until the emergence of Florida in the 1990s, the game always
was the benchmark by which the two programs measured themselves.
Invariably, the winner knew it had the inside track to the SEC
championship.
</P>
<P>
   More history will be made today when Tennessee returns to the
Alabama campus for just the fourth time. Alabama previously had
chosen to play its home games with Tennessee at Birmingham's Legion
Field.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams are ranked in the top 10, national television will be
here, and the Crimson Tide faithful will be ready to have the Big
Orange in Bryant-Denny Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be neat to see Tennessee's players walking in
here,'' said Alabama running back Shaun Alexander. ``It's going to
be an athletic, big-time football game.''
</P>
<P>
   The game isn't always on the third Saturday in October anymore.
But it is no less meaningful.
</P>
<P>
   This week's picks: SEC
</P>
<P>
   _ Kentucky (5-2) at Georgia (5-1), 12:30 p.m., WXIA. This game
is very dangerous for the Bulldogs. Hal Mumme is licking his chops
about going against a defense that gives up a lot of yards. Georgia
again finds a way to win, but it won't be easy. Georgia, 31-28.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tennessee (4-1) at Alabama (5-1), 3:30 p.m., CBS. The Vols
will keep Alabama running back Shaun Alexander under control, but
will they be able to handle the rest of the Tide's wide-open
attack? Look for Tennessee, which had a week off, to exploit a
young Alabama secondary. Tennessee, 24-20.
</P>
<P>
   _ LSU (2-4) at Mississippi State (6-0), 6 p.m., ESPN2. LSU has
won seven in a row over the Bulldogs, but the Tigers have virtually
no confidence after four consecutive losses. Mississippi State has
had a week off to rest and will play like it. Mississippi State,
24-7.
</P>
<P>
   _ Vanderbilt (4-3) at South Carolina (0-7), 7 p.m. The
Gamecocks' 17-game losing streak has to end sometime. Why not
against the Commodores? This week's Upset Special. South Carolina,
14-13.
</P>
<P>
   ACC
</P>
<P>
   _ Florida State (7-0) at Clemson (3-3), 7 p.m., ESPN. FSU's
Bobby Bowden goes for career win No. 300 against son Tommy. Despite
the warm and fuzzy talk about the father-son angle, the old man, as
he is affectionately called in Tallahassee, wants another national
championship. The boy has to pay. Florida State, 42-14.
</P>
<P>
   _ N.C. State (4-3) at Duke (1-5), noon, Fox Sports Net South.
N.C. State still has bowl aspirations, so this is a game the
Wolfpack needs to win. The Dookies have beaten Virginia and pushed
Georgia Tech to the limit the past two weeks. N.C. State, 24-14.
</P>
<P>
   _ North Carolina (1-5) at Maryland (4-2), 3:30 p.m., ABC. UNC
coach Carl Torbush is under fire because the Tar Heels not only are
losing but are looking ugly doing it. Maryland is pushing for a
bowl and is looking for payback after losing eight of nine games to
UNC this decade. Maryland, 24-21.
</P>
<P>
   _ Alabama-Birmingham (3-3) at Wake Forest (3-3), 3:30 p.m. UAB
is coming off a 24-21 overtime win over Cincinnati, which beat
Wisconsin earlier this season. Wake Forest won't believe the
Blazers are that good and it will cost them. Alabama-Birmingham 31,
Wake Forest 24.
</P>
<P>
   Top 25
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 2 Penn State (7-0) at No. 16 Purdue (5-2), 3:30 p.m.
Purdue knocked off Michigan State last week but won't be able to
play giant-killer two weeks in a row. Look for defensive
coordinator Jerry Sandusky to turn All-American linebacker LaVar
Arrington loose on Purdue quarterback Drew Brees. Penn State 28,
Purdue 17.
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 3 Nebraska (6-0) at No. 18 Texas (5-2), 3:30 p.m. If Texas
can get its running game going, quarterback Major Applewhite will
have a chance. The Longhorns, however, will have trouble stopping
the Cornhuskers and quarterback Eric Crouch. Nebraska, 24-17.
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 7 Kansas State (6-0) at Oklahoma State (3-2), 12:30 p.m.
Kansas State has won 18 Big 12 games in a row but will not have an
easy afternoon in Stillwater. Look for this to be a tight one.
Kansas State, 17-13.
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 11 Michigan State (6-1) at No. 17 Wisconsin (5-2), noon,
ESPN2. After losing to Purdue last week, Michigan State needs a win
to keep its Rose Bowl hopes alive. Wisconsin's Ron Dayne will test
an MSU defense that gives up 40 yards rushing per game. Michigan
State 21, Wisconson 13.
</P>
<P>
   _ The rest: Michigan 34, Illinois 6; Texas A&AMP;M 24, Oklahoma 14;
Marshall 51, Buffalo 7; BYU 28, UNLV 13; East Carolina 31, Tulane
20; Southern Miss 21, Cincinnati 17; Ohio State 17, Minnesota 10;
Miami 24, Boston College 21.

 Airline's Cost-Cutting Vexes Bay Area Travel Agents  &HT;     By David Lazarus 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Bay Area travel agents are seeing red after United Airlines led
other major carriers in slashing commissions for ticket bookings
from 8 percent to 5 percent.
<P>
   Some agents are now refusing to book flights on United, the
world's largest carrier. Others are deliberately steering clients
to other airlines. And some who cannot avoid a United booking are
charging customers an extra $20 ``service fee'' to make up the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   United handles about 65 percent of flights into and out of the
Bay Area, and many travelers insist on flying the airline because
of its frequent-flyer programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all ticked off _ insulted,'' said Susan Campos, vice
president of Pacific Heights Travel Service in San Francisco. ``If
the airlines didn't have us, there would be huge lines at the
airport. It would be a disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   About 80 percent of airline tickets are sold through travel
agencies, according to the American Society of Travel Agents.
</P>
<P>
   Internet chat groups frequented by travel industry professionals
have been buzzing since United's decision was announced two weeks
ago. E-mail has also circulated among travel agents trying to build
a consensus for a coordinated response.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of this grassroots movement, travel agents
throughout the country have said they will take countermeasures
against United.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the ruckus, United did not budge from having once again
led the way in reducing commissions paid to travel agents. In 1997,
it was the first to cut commissions to 8 percent from 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, all other major U.S. airlines quickly followed
suit.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; No Comment From United
</P>
<P>
   A United spokeswoman declined to discuss the latest commission
cut and subsequent outcry from travel agents.
</P>
<P>
   She pointed instead to an October 7 statement from United chief
executive Jim Goodwin, who described the move as ``part of our
continuing efforts to examine all facets of our cost structure.''
</P>
<P>
   Delta Air Lines was the first to act in 1995 when it lowered
commissions to 10 percent and capped payments to travel agents at
$50.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines are doing this in part to cut out the middleman by
encouraging passengers to purchase tickets directly from each
carrier via the Internet. However, many travelers still prefer the
old-fashioned way.
</P>
<P>
   According to Preview Travel, a leading Internet travel agency,
online air bookings totaled $777 million in 1997, while travel
agencies did about $126 billion in business that same year.
</P>
<P>
   But with lower commissions, Campos is now tacking a $20 service
fee onto all her United bookings. ``It would be ridiculous for me
not to do that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Sherry, a spokeswoman for the watchdog group Consumer
Action, said she was not surprised that some travel agents are
passing their costs along to customers. ``If the airlines don't pay
it, who do they think will?'' she asked. ``The consumer,
obviously.''
</P>
<P>
   But smaller, less well-heeled agencies are finding that their
customers will not tolerate the idea of making up for the airlines'
cutbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I did that, my clients would not come here,'' said Maria
Kucharszky, owner of Pegasus Travel in Daly City. ``They are
looking for the lowest possible fare.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other small-agency operators, she said she was barely
breaking even with 8 percent commissions. At 5 percent, Kucharszky
said she may have to close her business.
</P>
<P>
   ``What else can you do?'' she said. ``Hotels are not paying as
much, car-rental companies are not paying as much. I don't know
what I am going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Ruden, the travel agent group's senior vice president for
legal and industry affairs, shrugged off the travel agents'
discontent as ``expressions of anger from people who feel
disempowered and helpless.''
</P>
<P>
   He also stressed that the travel agent's group is in no way
encouraging its 11,000 member agencies to boycott United or any
other airline, pointing out that such a move could violate
antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't organize boycotts,'' Ruden said. ``We don't condone
boycotts, and we don't know of any.''
</P>
<P>
   He may want to get into contact with Lincoln Chu, owner of
All-Ways Travel in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm definitely leaning against booking United now,'' he said.
``Whichever airline helps us, we're going to help them. Whichever
dings us, we're going to retaliate.''
</P>
<P>
   The way Chu figures it, the average ticket booking is $250. So
if each of the roughly 40,000 travel agencies nationwide denied
United just one booking a week, the airline would be out more than
$500 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Travel agencies and airlines should be partners,'' Chu said.
``If you arbitrarily cut commissions down, what kind of partnership
is that? It's getting to the point where we can't make a decent
living.''
</P>
<P>
   United is estimating that the lower commissions will result in
savings to the airline of about $150 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Those savings may grow if, as many travel agents fear,
commissions are subsequently lowered again to 3 percent and then
ultimately eliminated altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``The handwriting is on the wall,'' said Richard Birchard, head
of Fog City Travel in the Financial District.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that many agencies are trying to adjust by shifting
their focus away from ticket sales and more toward vacation
packages, where profit margins are higher.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Clark, manager of San Francisco's Dirt Cheap Travel, said
travel agencies will keep operating until ticket commissions
finally reach zero, ``and then everyone will go out of business.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, she said she does not see much value in a
boycott of United. ``But if someone calls seeking a ticket, I'll
book the best connection, and it just might not be United. Know
what I mean?''

 Crew Cuts Line, Irks Callers in Downtown S.F.  &HT;     By Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
A construction crew building an office and apartment complex on
Third Street in San Francisco sliced into a Pacific Bell cable late
Thursday, cutting phone service to some downtown customers.
<P>
   Most of those affected were tenants in the Hearst Corp.
Building, which houses about 71 businesses. About 80 percent of the
building lost phone service around 5 p.m. Thursday, and many were
still without a dial tone late yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The outage also affected some pay phones and a few residences in
the area, according to the phone company.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell officials said about two-thirds of the customers had
their service restored by yesterday morning and the rest would be
back on line by 8 a.m. Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty inconvenient,'' said Robert LaVine, an attorney
who works in the Hearst Building. ``Of all the days, I left my cell
phone home today.''
</P>
<P>
   Some offices had a single line working, while others were
completely silent.
</P>
<P>
   Evelyn Cassidy, a spokeswoman for Pac Bell, said the outage
occurred when a construction company, trying to anchor a new
building to the ground, bore into the street at a 45-degree angle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The contractor inadvertently damaged the cabling while trying
to anchor the building,'' Cassidy said.
</P>
<P>
   The company was a subcontractor for Pankow Cos., which is
building a 44-story highrise with apartments and offices at Third
and Jessie streets.
</P>
<P>
   Cassidy said the phone cables are clearly marked so that
accidents like this don't occur. She said she was unsure why the
cut happened.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with Pankow Cos. did not return calls.
</P>
<P>
   Built in 1909, the Hearst Building houses law firms, technology
companies and even the western branch of the U.S. Olympic
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Novie, an architect with Aaron Green and Associates, said
the outage was making it difficult for the firm to stay in contact
with employees and customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We normally have seven lines going. Now we only have one,''
Novie said.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Green, the firm's owner, said he thought the company that
caused the outage should refund money to the affected businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time is money and we're losing time on our projects. It's a
big inconvenience,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But downstairs at Arca Technologies, it was business as usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our phones are working,'' said Darren Castles, CEO of Arca.
</P>
<P>
   Was it divine intervention? Hardly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have Winstar as our phone company. We don't have Pac Bell,
so we're not affected,'' Castles said.

<HEADLINE>
AFTER EARLY STRUGGLES, GLAVINE REGAINS OLD FORM  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The changeup had deserted him and the strike zone had
shrunk and then the doubt crept in on Tom Glavine. The defending Cy
Young award winner, who will start Game 1 of the World Series for
the Atlanta Braves on Saturday night, had such an
uncharacteristically poor beginning to this season that opponents,
for at least a few months, could believe that one of the most
reliable pitchers of the decade was perhaps wearing down, befuddled
by a newly consistent strike zone that seemed to take away the
outside corner on which he thrived.
</P>
<P>
   He began the season 0-3, then dropped to 3-7, and all the while
he stood on the mound _ getting hammered by teams like the Florida
Marlins _ and produced a string of adjustments that amounted to
almost no progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to go through when you're constantly going out
there, not quite sure what you're going to bring out there, what's
going to be working or what's not,'' Glavine said. ``There were
very few times this year that I walked out to the mound and felt,
`OK, I'm going to pitch a good game.' I didn't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he does. In Glavine (14-11), the Yankees will face a
pitcher renewed. Although he led the league in hits allowed (259),
and struggled in the early innings _ 60 of the 115 runs he allowed
this season came in the first three innings _ Glavine won 11 of his
last 15 starts.
</P>
<P>
   In his last five starts, dating from mid-September and including
the division series and the National League Championship Series, he
is 4-0 and has allowed just seven earned runs in 35 innings. His
post-season earned run average is 1.38 and he was masterly against
the Mets in Game 3 of their championship series, shutting them out
on seven hits for seven innings to win, 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   Although he pitched well against the Yankees in his one
interleague start against them _ he gave up two runs on six hits in
six and two-thirds innings to open the second half of the season _
Glavine did not truly regain his form until a start against the
Mets on Sept. 28, when he allowed two runs in seven innings. Six
days later, he allowed the Mets just one run in seven innings, a
performance that catcher Eddie Perez said was his best of the year.
Glavine used his fastball to set hitters up before getting them out
with a changeup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like the whole first half of the year, every time I
went out to pitch, I was making some kind of adjustment,'' Glavine
said. ``Then the second half of the year, it seemed like I pitched
a couple good games, then something would go wrong, I'd make an
adjustment, pitch a couple good games. I pitched the game against
Montreal in late August and I had made a couple of adjustments the
game before. I thought, `OK, this is where I want to be.' And I
went out and probably pitched my worst game of the year and reached
my lowest point frustration-wise. From that point on, the only
thing I tried to do was be as natural as I could. That's pretty
much been it for me since then.''
</P>
<P>
   Glavine, along with John Smoltz, has been one of the few
constants on a Braves team that has employed a remarkable bit of
re-engineering year after year yet remained dominant in the
National League throughout the 1990s. Glavine won Game 6 of the
1995 World Series to secure the Braves' only championship in four
previous tries during the decade, with a magnificent performance
that held Cleveland to one hit in eight innings for a 1-0 victory.
Glavine would have pitched Game 7 of the 1996 World Series and,
although he lost Game 3 to David Cone, he pitched well, allowing
four hits and two runs in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've meant everything,'' Manager Bobby Cox said of Glavine
and Smoltz, the Game 4 starter. ``Without them, we wouldn't be here
today. Tommy, I think, is on top of his game right now.''
</P>
<P>
   In seven World Series starts, Glavine is 4-3 with a 1.75 e.r.a.,
and Cox configured his rotation so that Glavine, who was the third
starter in the rotation behind Greg Maddux and Kevin Millwood in
the division series and league championships series, could start
Game 1 and then be available to pitch Game 5 in Yankee Stadium to
take advantage of whatever edge left-handers are supposed to have
in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine has undoubtedly had an edge over the two Yankees who
will bat left-handed against him: Paul O'Neill and Tino Martinez
are a combined 7 of 38 (.184) in their careers facing Glavine.
</P>
<P>
   With the incessant tinkering that marked the first half of his
season now over, the Yankees will see the familiar Glavine. He is
reluctant to blame the edict that umpires call a more consistent
strike and instead blames himself. ``I struggled because of the
strike zone because I was throwing too many balls in the heart of
it,'' Glavine said. ``I don't have the stuff to get away with that.
I cannot be throwing the ball down the middle of the plate, and too
many times during the first eight weeks of the year, I was doing
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a matter of making some mechanical adjustments.
You've got to look in the mirror and figure out where the problem
was, and the problem was me.'' &QL;

 Cupertino Nursery Thrives  &HT;     By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
``Fusarium leaf spot,'' pronounced Pam Leong, a horticulturist at
Yamagami's Nursery in Cupertino, as she examined a green draceana
leaf marred by brown blots.
<P>
   ``It's a fungus spread by splashing water,'' Leong informed a
customer, reading from a 3-inch-thick guide book. ``It's not
usually harmful.''
</P>
<P>
   Working beside Leong in Yamagami's ``Info Center,'' a shed lined
with reference books in the middle of the spacious nursery, Carolyn
Villa-Scott clucked over a rotted dahlia. The owner confessed she
had left the droopy plant in a bucket of water. ``That's a no-no,''
said Villa-Scott. ``But we'll replace it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yamagami's has been serving up advice and greenery to South Bay
gardeners since the area was known as Santa Clara Valley, rather
than Silicon Valley, and Cupertino was famous for apricots, not
Macintoshes.
</P>
<P>
   Taro Yamagami, a second-generation Japanese American, bought the
nursery's De Anza Boulevard property in 1948, shortly after
returning from service in World War II. Yamagami had grown up in
the Central Valley and helped liberate Italy as part of the famous
Japanese-American 442nd Regimental Combat Team, the most highly
decorated unit in the war.
</P>
<P>
   The young businessman's first venture was a fruit stand in the
midst of the apricot orchards. De Anza Boulevard then was a
two-lane road known as Highway 9, and Yamagami's customers were
mostly weekend beachgoers on their way to Santa Cruz.
</P>
<P>
   As the valley began to develop, Yamagami started stocking
flowers and other plants to sell to new residents. In a few years,
the business was transformed into a full-fledged nursery.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Yamagami's is run by Preston Oka, 53, a third-generation
Japanese American. Oka's father, Mas Oka, was Yamagami's first
general manager; Mas Oka and his wife, Betty, bought the business
in 1963, when Taro Yamagami decided to focus on landscaping.
</P>
<P>
   Yamagami's has flourished under Preston Oka, who took over from
his father in 1985. At Yamagami's 50th anniversary party last year,
Oka noted that the business now racks up $500,000 in sales some
months. That's more than an entire year's sales in 1974, when Oka
started working at Yamagami's full time.
</P>
<P>
   The booming South Bay economy _ and a January freeze that hurt
many South Bay gardens _ has certainly helped Yamagami's, which
expects a 25 percent sales increase of  &LR; this year despite
competition from superstores and gardening Web sites. But much of
Yamagami's success can be chalked up to careful thought and
planning by Oka and his staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Preston is an aggressive, innovative and creative''
businessman, said Elaine Thompson, executive director of the
California Association of Nurserymen. ``He is always looking at how
to market, how to bring the best to his customers, and that sets
him apart. His whole plan has really worked because the nursery has
grown tremendously.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Source of Information
</P>
<P>
   Oka, whose business sits across the street from a Woolworth's,
decided years ago that he couldn't compete on price. Instead, he
made Yamagami's a leading local resource for information and
advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to feel like, `my God, the big chains are robbing
me,''' said the affable Oka. ``But now I look at them with respect.
In some ways, they make my business stand out. If they're offering
(the lowest) price, it would be foolish for us to play that game.''
</P>
<P>
   While other nurseries may employ a handful of certified
horticulturists, Yamagami's has 10. To attract the most qualified
people, Oka offers health insurance, profit-sharing bonuses and
even a 401(k) investment plan for full-time staff.
</P>
<P>
   One of Yamagami's most popular features are signs displayed
around the nursery that detail plants' traits and preferred growing
conditions. The information comes from a database of 11,000 plants
that Oka and staffers have assembled over 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Some signs are written in Mandarin to accommodate the nursery's
growing Chinese clientele. Yamagami's also employs a Mandarin
speaker and a Cantonese speaker to assist Chinese shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Atherton, a Saratoga Sarasota  &LR; landscaper, said she sends
clients to Yamagami's to learn about plants and choose what they
want in their gardens. Then she buys the plants more cheaply
through a wholesaler.
</P>
<P>
   ``We install whole yards and we can't afford to buy all of our
plants from Yamagami's,'' said Atherton. ``But a lot of times I'll
look for extraordinary things there and so do my clients. They
often have new (varieties) and colors before anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Oka is well aware that many people use Yamagami's as an
educational resource but do much of their buying elsewhere. ``It's
a service we provide,'' he said drolly. ``But really we don't mind.
That customer is going to buy from us sometime in the future. It's
like free advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   Atherton said she enjoys visiting Yamagami's because it is
arranged so nicely. ''Right now there are these beautiful
arrangements of pumpkins and hay. Sometimes when I'm sick and tired
of my customers and my business, I go down there and remember why I
love it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yamagami's pleasant environment is no accident _ it's the result
of more strategic decisions by Oka.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Yamagami's was quite crowded, with 20 percent of
the floor space devoted to aisle and 80 percent to displays.
</P>
<P>
   After reading studies showing that wider aisles might boost
sales, Oka designed a 50-50 floor plan and bought more shopping
carts. Although the amount of items product  &LR; on the floor was
dramatically reduced, there has been a healthy rise in sales.
</P>
<P>
   Another experiment that paid off was a decision to offer fewer
varieties of plants. A central table displaying pink, white and
purple cyclamen used to contain four varieties of plants, requiring
frequent restocking and tricky inventory management, Oka said.
</P>
<P>
   By featuring just one type of plant, stocking is easier and the
presentation is more dramatic, Oka said. Sales at that table have
risen nearly 50 percent since the switch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to do a few things well, as opposed to doing many
things average,'' says Oka.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Kanemoto, Yamagami's general manager, points to other small
changes that he believes have helped boost Yamagami's business over
the years.
</P>
<P>
   Rose bushes were recently moved to the back of the nursery,
forcing rose seekers to walk past rows of other tempting items.
``It's the same principle as locating milk at the back of a
convenience store,'' said Kanemoto.
</P>
<P>
   Yamagami's also offers noontime seminars on topics like planter
arranging that attract more than 25 people per day. The seminars
are free, but many attendees stay and shop afterward.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Dry Place to Shop
</P>
<P>
   One innovation that provided a dramatic payoff for Yamagami was
the installation of a fabric canopy over the nursery in the early
1990s. During the heavy rains of 1997, ``we were high and dry while
our competitors were drowning,'' said Kanemoto. ``For the year, our
sales were up 8 percent while other nurseries were down 25 to 50
percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite its healthy sales and strategizing, Yamagami's future is
somewhat uncertain. It is currently  &LR; negotiating its lease with a
trust that represents Toya Yamagami, Taro's daughter and heir. Taro
died in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Oka hopes the lease will be extended. ``Seventeen families are
depending on it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If the business continues, Oka will encourage his 12-year-old
daughter, Brittany, to one day take over. But he said he will
handle the generational transfer the way his parents did, without
overt pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents were very smart,'' Oka said. ``They told me, `You
can do whatever you want, but the door is always open.' At the same
time, they taught me how to tend the plants, how to do the buying.
They sucked me in with kindness.''

 Pac Bell Price Hike Rebuked  &HT;     By Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
A state regulator is recommending that Pacific Bell only be allowed
to raise prices for directory assistance calls to 35 cents, not the
50 cents the phone company requested.
<P>
   In a proposal released this week, Public Utilities Commissioner
Carl Wood also recommended that Pac Bell's request to cut the
number of free 411 calls from five per month to three be denied.
</P>
<P>
   Wood's proposal differs significantly from what Pac Bell asked
for and from what an administrative law judge recommended in
August. The judge, Michael Galvin, said Pac Bell should be allowed
to raise its directory assistance rates from 25 cents per call to
46 cents each. He also said the company should be given permission
to lower the number of free 411 calls per month.
</P>
<P>
   The two proposals are on the PUC's agenda for November 4. It's
unclear how the full commission will vote.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell had asked the PUC for permission to raise 411 rates to
$1.10, although it said it only planned to charge 50 cents per
call.
</P>
<P>
   The request drew the ire of consumers, who deluged the PUC with
phone calls, letters and e-mails protesting the increase. The PUC
said it received more than 41,000 contacts from consumers, almost
all opposing the rate increase.
</P>
<P>
   Wood said the customer outcry, combined with a lack of
competition in the marketplace, should preclude Pac Bell from
getting a large increase. He said Pac Bell should not be allowed to
charge more than 35 cents for 411 calls, because customers don't
have any real alternatives for directory assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though local DA  &LR; (directory assistance) is classified as
a partially competitive service, Pacific Bell retains an effective
monopoly'' over the service, Wood wrote in his proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Charging 35 cents is reasonable, he said, because Pac Bell says
claims  &LR; its cost for providing directory assistance is about 33
cents per call. Wood said the company should not be able to recoup
much more than its costs.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the onslaught of new area codes makes it necessary
for people to call 411 more frequently for phone numbers, since
they won't have access to telephone books for every region.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned that any increase ... could be a substantial
hardship on those customers who, for various reasons, are dependent
on affordable local DA service,'' Wood wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But Pac Bell officials said the recommendation is unfair because
it wrongly assumes that there's no competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious to anybody following the marketplace there is
competition in 411,'' said John Britton, a spokesman for Pac Bell.
``And the competition is charging from 95 cents to $1.40 for the
same information.''
</P>
<P>
   Long-distance carriers such as MCI WorldCom and AT&AMP;T offer both
local and national directory assistance to customers for a fee.
Consumers can also get directory assistance for free off the
Internet at sites such as 555.1212.com and Infospace.com.
</P>
<P>
   Britton said Pac Bell needs an increase to cover costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pac Bell is losing money on this service. We need to cover
costs and at the same time give the consumer the best bargain,''
Britton said.
</P>
<P>
   But consumer advocates said Wood's proposal is a fair
alternative to Pac Bell's request and takes into account the
enormous consumer interest in the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Commissioner Wood's proposal is fair to consumers and it's
also fair to Pac Bell,'' said Paul Stein, an attorney with The
Utility Reform Network. ``There's no competition for local
directory assistance and the public has overwhelmingly opposed a
rate increase. We still believe that Pac Bell hasn't justified any
rate increase.''

TINY COMPANY'S PUBLIC OFFERING SETS OFF STOCK FRENZY

<TEXT>
<P>
   Sycamore Networks Inc., a tiny Chelmsford, Mass., company with
just two customers, set Wall Street on fire Friday with its initial
public offering of stock, as its share price exploded fivefold,
from an opening price of 38 to a close of 184 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   That makes Sycamore, a manufacturer of fiber-optic network
products for carrying Internet traffic, worth $14 billion, setting
a record for the highest market value achieved by an Internet
company in its first day of trading.
</P>
<P>
   It also makes Sycamore, a company with little more than $11
million in revenue since May when it shipped its first product,
Massachusetts' fourth-highest-valued company, dwarfing Staples
Inc., Raytheon Co., and TJX Cos., the operator of TJ Maxx clothing
stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are buying the hell out of this stock,'' said Steven
Tuen, director of research for IPO Value Monitor in New York.
``It's just amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sycamore stock frenzy was driven mostly by individual
investors, eager to get in on a company that is expected to develop
the next generation of communications equipment. Much of the
trading Friday was in smaller blocks of 100 to 200 shares, Tuen
noted, an indication that large institutional investors weren't the
only buyers. Individual investors ``don't want to miss out on the
opportunity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, small investors did miss out on most of the profit. The
only people allowed to buy into the 7.5 million shares offered at
38 a share were large customers of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, the
offering's underwriter. Those who sold immediately after trading
opened at 12:30 were able to fetch 270 7/8. Throughout the day,
Sycamore's stock drifted back down somewhat, dropping by more than
86 1/8.
</P>
<P>
   The market exuberance over Sycamore is just the latest in a
string of record-setting initial public offerings, or IPOs, of
Internet-related companies, demonstrating an almost insatiable
demand for a relatively limited supply of such stock.
</P>
<P>
   It also highlights a hot new area in high-tech: Internet
infrastructure, the physical building blocks that allow
unprecedented numbers of people to pipe into the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Companies similar to Sycamore also have logged impressive IPOs
in recent months, including Juniper Networks Inc., in California,
which started at 34 a share in June and closed Friday at 261 1/4.
California-based Redback Networks Inc., which began at 23 a share
in May ended trading Friday 120 1/16, while Foundry Networks Inc.,
also in California, went public at 25 a share and closed Friday at
162 13/16.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like 20 years ago when the economy was driven by oil, the
economy for the next 25 years will be driven by the networked
economy,'' said Desh Deshpande, who founded Sycamore with Daniel E.
Smith just 18 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Deshpande and Smith are now billionaires, at least on paper.
Deshpande, who owns 16.3 million Sycamore shares, is worth just
under $3 billion, while Smith's 14.7 million shares are worth about
$2.7 billion. The two, however, cannot cash in on their stock for
at least six months, when a ``lock-up period'' expires.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, Deshpande and Smith are not likely to sell their
shares en masse, said Stephen Lacey, managing editor of IPO
Reporter, a newsletter in New York. ``You don't want to sell it all
at once,'' Lacey said. ``You want to do it in a controlled
environment through a secondary offering.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Deshpande and Smith can claim to have launched one of
the most successful IPOs in history. Its 386 percent gain is the
fourth highest in the first day of trading for an IPO, according to
Jay Ritter, professor of finance at the University of Florida. On
an absolute dollar basis, Sycamore's increase of 146 3/4 is the
largest ever first-day gain, Ritter said. Its market capitalization
_ $14 billion _ is also the highest realized by a company on its
stock market debut.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Yahoo Inc., a popular Internet portal based in
Santa Clara, Calif., was worth $850 million at the end of its first
day on the stock market in April 1996, according to Ritter.
</P>
<P>
   Few are predicting whether there will be a hangover next week
from the Sycamore IPO, mostly because there are few precedents to
help set a course.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry itself is so new that it's difficult to find
anything comparable to this,'' said Lacey of the IPO Reporter.
``It's just pretty crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, many high-tech observers are bullish on Sycamore's
future as a company. Some are taking their cues from Cisco Systems
Inc., a well-heeled California rival to Sycamore that in August
paid $7 billion for Cerent Corp., a maker of fiber-optic products.
Others are noting that Deshpande and Smith are proven entrepreneurs
and managers, having built Cascade Communications in Westford into
a telecommunications powerhouse that was sold for $3.7 billion in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of what makes Sycamore so hot is that Cisco has declared
the area to be hot'' with its purchase of Cerent, said Joseph P.
Lassiter, professor of management at the Harvard Business School.
``But it's also because Dan and Desh have proven they know how to
run a company, not just build a prototype and sell it off. The
market is now saying it loves them, and that's huge.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, are more skeptical about Sycamore's $14 billion
valuation, larger than the $9.9 billion market capitalization of
Raytheon Co., a defense contractor in Lexington that has $20
billion in annual revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter noted that Sycamore has a great deal of competition, not
only from well established companies such as Cisco, Nortel Networks
Corp., Lucent Technologies Inc., and Ciena Corp., but also from
newer firms such as Redback, Juniper, and Foundry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Competition will make it difficult for any one of these
companies to make really big profits,'' Ritter said. ``If one of
them had a monopoly, it would be easier to justify these
valuations.''

 WASHINGTON: insurance business.   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Glass-Steagall Act was enacted after the stock market crash
of 1929 and the ensuing banking crisis and Great Depression. On the
day it was signed, along with the National Industrial Recovery Act
and other measures, President Franklin D. Roosevelt called the
package ``the most important and far-reaching legislation ever
enacted by the American Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind Glass-Steagall, named for the two lawmakers who
wrote it, was that confidence in America's financial house could
best be restored if bankers and brokers stayed in separate rooms.
Such a separation, it was thought, achieved two purposes.
</P>
<P>
   First, it would reduce the potential conflicts of interest
between investment banking and commercial banking that were thought
to have contributed to the speculative frenzy in the stock markets.
Under the 1933 Banking Act, commercial banks could receive no more
than 10 percent of their income from the securities markets, a
limit so restrictive that most simply abandoned business on Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   Second, it would provide a safe harbor for the money of ordinary
Americans by enabling them to put their money in accounts that were
protected by deposit insurance and insulated from more speculative
investments like stocks. (The 1933 act also established Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp., which now insures bank deposits up to
$100,000.)
</P>
<P>
   Over time, federal judges and regulators chipped away at the
Glass-Steagall Act and other restrictions on cross-ownership of
banks, insurance companies and securities firms, enabling, for
instance, Citibank to merge with Travelers Group last year to form
Citigroup, the world's largest financial services company. But
large hurdles remained that have discouraged the expansion by banks
into new businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The breakthrough in Friday's legislation came in a backroom
meeting at the Capitol soon after midnight, when a group of
moderate Democrats from the Senate _ led by Christopher Dodd of
Connecticut and Charles Schumer of New York _ forced a compromise
between Gramm and the White House over the legislation's effect on
the Community Reinvestment Act, a 1977 anti-discrimination law
intended to encourage lending to minorities and others historically
denied access to credit.
</P>
<P>
   Dodd, whose state is home to the nation's largest insurance
companies, and Schumer, with strong ties to Wall Street, have long
sought legislation to repeal the Glass-Steagall Act. Both men said
in interviews Friday that they moved to strike a compromise after
it became apparent that the legislation might be killed, as it was
last year by Gramm, over the debate about the Community
Reinvestment Act.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm had maintained that he did not want anything in the bill
that would expand the application of the Community Reinvestment Act
because it is unnecessarily burdensome to banks. He had sought a
provision that would exempt thousands of smaller banks from the
law. He also wanted a provision that would expose what he has
described as the ``extortion'' committed by community groups
against banks by requiring the groups to disclose any special
financial deals that the groups extract from the banks.
</P>
<P>
   But the White House found that provision unacceptable and had
its own ideas about community lending. It wanted the legislation to
prevent any bank with an unsatisfactory record of making loans to
the disadvantaged from expanding into new areas of business, like
insurance or securities.
</P>
<P>
   The White House had insisted that the president would veto any
legislation that would scale back minority-lending requirements.
Four days of intense negotiations between Summers, Gene Sperling,
the president's top economic policy adviser, and Gramm, while
moving the two sides closer, failed to resolve the differences.

 WASHINGTON: the differences. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Such was the state of play Thursday evening when Gramm decided
to force the issue by having the House-Senate conference committee
vote on his proposed compromise, which the White House had already
rejected for failing to block banks with bad lending records from
expanding to new businesses.
</P>
<P>
   When Gramm's measure was defeated by one vote, it quickly became
clear that there would be no law unless Gramm could get some
Democrats to break from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But administration officials had spent all day making sure that
the Democrats remained solidly against the measure until their
concerns about the Community Reinvestment Act could be worked out.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving calls from executives of some of the nation's
leading financial companies, Dodd and Schumer began trying work a
compromise. An agreement was quickly reached on the issue of banks
and expanded powers _ no institution would be allowed to move into
any new lines of business without a satisfactory lending record.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers bogged down on Gramm's insistence that all
community organizations disclose to the regulators what benefits
they get from banks. Some Democrats expressed the fear that Gramm's
proposal would require the Boy Scouts to file reports with the
regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the following agreement was reached that both the
White House and Gramm said they could accept:
</P>
<P>
   _ Banks will not be able to move into new lines of business
unless they have satisfactory lending records.
</P>
<P>
   _ Community groups will have to make disclosures to regulators
about certain kinds of financial deals with banks that they have
pressed to make loans under the Community Reinvestment Act.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wholesale financial institutions, a new kind of business that
takes large uninsured bank deposits, cannot be affiliated with
commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
   _ Small banks with satisfactory or excellent track records of
making loans to the underserved would be reviewed less frequently
under the Community Reinvestment Act. As a practical matter smaller
banks are reviewed on average about every three years. The deal
struck Friday allows banks with less than $250 million in assets
and all rural banks to undergo examination once every five years if
their last exam resulted in an ``outstanding'' grade and every four
years if they last scored ``satisfactory.''
</P>
<P>
   For more than 20 years, Congress has tried unsuccessfully to
rewrite the nation's financial services laws and repeal
Glass-Steagall, particularly as many other industrial nations had
no similar restrictions on their banks. But until recently, the
three main industries affected by the legislation _ banks,
securities companies and insurers _ had competing interests and
were able to lobby any legislation to a standstill.
</P>
<P>
   That all changed in recent years as the lines between the
industries began to blur and there became a broad recognition that
a deregulation of financial services could be beneficial to
insurers, bankers and securities firms alike. Once the three
industries rallied around the legislation, they became a formidable
political force, raising millions of dollars for lawmakers and
pressing both Republican leaders in Congress and the White House
for new legislation.

TYSON REACHING BACK TO JUMP-START CAREER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS, Nev. _ Mike Tyson started this year against Francois
Botha on Jan. 16, a bout that was supposed to kick off an ambitious
schedule of four fights designed to help Tyson regain respect and
viability in the heavyweight division. He was coming off an
18-month layoff resulting from the revocation of his boxing license
in Nevada for biting Evander Holyfield's ears during a June 29,
1997, bout.
</P>
<P>
   As with most things in Tyson's boxing career, the plan did not
go as scripted. He went to jail in Maryland and served three and a
half months of a one-year sentence on two assault charges, and when
he got out he weighed 280 pounds and was in no shape to fight.
Shelly Finkel, his adviser, Dan Goossen of America Presents, his
promoter, and Jay Larkin, the senior vice president of programming
at Showtime, haggled over Tyson's next opponent. They settled on
Orlin Norris, a former cruiserweight champion who has fought one
round in 14 months.
</P>
<P>
   Nine months after an uneven performance against Botha, Tyson, a
former two-time world heavyweight champion, steps into the ring
Saturday night against Norris (50-5) to restart his boxing career
for the fourth time in four years in a scheduled 10-round bout at
the MGM Grand Arena here. The bout will be televised by Showtime on
a broadcast that starts at 11 p.m. If he wins, Tyson plans to be in
the ring again next Feb. 26, possibly in New York at Madison Square
Garden.
</P>
<P>
   As was the case against Botha, Tyson (46-3) will be under a
microscope. Everyone associated with him wants to see whether he
has completely chipped away the rust from his 18-month layoff
before he fought Botha. Tyson swung wildly for the fences and
missed for four rounds until Botha walked into a big right hand and
was knocked out in the fifth. At times Tyson looked like a novice
boxer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm rusty, I'm rusty,'' Tyson said. ``But I'm still
sensational.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson is trying to reach back for some of the tools that helped
him club his way to his first heavyweight title 10 years ago. He
rehired Jay Bright as an assistant trainer to work with Tommy
Brooks, who first worked with Tyson for the Botha fight. Bright is
a disciple of Cus D'Amato, Tyson's first trainer, who helped guide
the boxer to a world championship at age 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike, over the course of being away and inactive, got loose in
the style that Cus had taught him,'' Bright said. ``I'm here to
tighten him up.''
</P>
<P>
   Bright said he had been reminding Tyson of the key points of
D'Amato's training: keep his hands up peek-a-boo style and his head
moving side-to-side, move forward and stay in position to punch,
and target the chin, temple and liver. Tyson, 33, who weighed in at
223 pounds (the same as against Botha), looks fit and trim and even
dropped two sparring partners with punches in the gym this week.
But no one knows what will happen when he climbs into the ring.
</P>
<P>
   Norris, 34, who will earn $800,000 to Tyson's $10 million, will
try to frustrate Tyson by staying away from him. Norris, who
weighed in at 218, does not have the power to knock Tyson out, but
can frustrate him. Tyson warned Norris at a news conference earlier
this week that he was ``bringing the pain, baby.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect it,'' Norris said. ``I've never had a fight where the
next day I didn't feel some kind of pain. This is part of boxing.
I'm not afraid of him. I know he's going to hit me and I'm going to
hit him. I don't want to get hit with a clean shot. If he hits me,
I want to be at the end of his punches.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks and Bright have been telling Tyson not to go looking for
the quick knockout. They have told Tyson to keep doing what he
needs to do and a knockout will come, because Norris will make a
mistake and leave an opening. Tyson just needs to be in the right
position when Norris makes his error.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Tyson can maintain his head during a frustrating fight
is another matter. He built his career on being a knockout artist.
A waltz to a decision would not serve Tyson's purpose of advancing
his career into the contender status.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson is also in a position to add a jolt of excitement to the
sport, dismissing Oscar De La Hoya and Felix Trinidad. ``I don't
put those guys in my category,'' Tyson said. ``I'm in two different
orbits than those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   If he wants to be in orbit with the winner of the
Holyfield-Lennox Lewis heavyweight unification rematch scheduled
for Nov. 13 in Las Vegas, then he has to look better than he did
against Botha to prevent his career from idling.  &QL;

A&AMP;E'S `VANITY FAIR' KEEPS SATIRE INTACT 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The latest production of William Makepeace Thackeray's ``Vanity
Fair'' begins with an artist's model picking her nose.
</P>
<P>
   Its first hour ends with a pig grunting in front of the
colorless expanse of Queen's Crawley, home of the baronet Sir Pitt
Crawley.
</P>
<P>
   A viewer needs no additional notice that Thackeray's satire
hasn't been prettied up. If anything, this six-hour version,
showing Sunday and Monday on the A&AMP;E cable channel, is scrappier
than the BBC's two past productions of ``Vanity Fair.''
</P>
<P>
   And Becky is as Sharp as ever.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Davies, who previously adapted ``Pride and Prejudice''
and ``Emma,'' is at pains to separate Thackeray's world from the
lush certitudes of Jane Austen, and director Marc Munden is his
lively accomplice.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers who have come to expect the lovely greens, blushing
blooms and stately pace of the Austen shows will find a different
vision here.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Vanity Fair'' lighting tends either toward harsh or
deliberately muted. Its depiction of England is so frothy that it's
practically French, and Munden loves to zero in on his characters'
more unsavory physical attributes.
</P>
<P>
   Teeth are a sort of a specialty.
</P>
<P>
   Against the backdrop of the Napoleonic Wars, we follow the
orphaned and penniless Becky Sharp up and down the social ladder.
She can be admired for her pluck, but it's amazing she'd want to
mix with the vile upper classes on display here. The makers of this
miniseries broaden Thackeray's smirk into a derisive chortle.
</P>
<P>
   Thackeray serialized ``Vanity Fair'' in 1847 and 1848, and
subtitled it ``A Novel Without a Hero.'' Davies' script holds truer
to that than earlier screen treatments. Played flirtatiously by
Natasha Little, Becky is, as she's described in the final hour, a
heartless mother and a faithless wife. To say nothing of insincere,
selfish and shallow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope you get what you deserve,'' Becky says to her sappy
friend Amelia Sedley (Frances Grey), and then adds as a comment to
herself, ``and I hope that I don't.''
</P>
<P>
   It's one of Becky's few moments of introspection. Mostly she's
good at picking herself off the canvas _ she's surely Scarlett
O'Hara's prototype _ and resuming her ardent pursuit of
respectability.
</P>
<P>
   Too often, Little's Becky is more coquettish than interesting.
But Little succeeds a lot in creating an anti-heroine who's
consistently ahead of the men in her life. Like, about 150 years.
</P>
<P>
   The man she marries is Rawdon Crawley, sympathetically played by
Nathaniel Parker. Rawdon is a dashing dragoon and hero of Waterloo,
a doting father, a dissolute gambler and a too-trusting husband.
Except for Rawdon's inability to secure a fortune, the depiction
calls to mind another ``Gone With the Wind'' parallel, Rhett
Butler.
</P>
<P>
   The knaves in Becky's life are the show's most vivid
inhabitants. Jeremy Swift is much like a young Peter Ustinov as Jos
Sedley, Amelia's cowardly, self-serving brother. His trip to a spa
on the second night is a laugh-out-loud scene.
</P>
<P>
   Munden's tooth studies center on Gerald Murphy as the brutish
aristocrat Lord Steyne and David Bradley as the coarse, lecherous
old Sir Pitt Crawley, who hires Becky as a governess.
</P>
<P>
   Becky's sojourn at the Crawley estate spans Sunday's second
hour, and it is a wickedly delightful patch of pure loathsomeness.
The pig is part of what Becky jokingly calls the ``arcadian
simplicity'' of the place.
</P>
<P>
   It's there that another of the show's colorful supporting
characters materializes. She's Sir Pitt's immensely wealthy and
just plain huge sister (Miriam Margolyes). Watch her carriage sag
when she's gruntingly heaved into it.
</P>
<P>
   Balancing all the depravity in the novel, and the miniseries, is
the virtuous Capt. William Dobbin (Philip Glenister), who loves
Amelia but holds his silence for years because she has married his
best friend and fellow cavalry officer, George Osborne (Tom Ward).
</P>
<P>
   Dobbin is no ladies' man, but he is wise, generous and
unassuming. When this noble specimen makes his grand entrance into
the miniseries, and into Amelia's life, his military helmet
collides with a chandelier and is knocked unceremonious- ly from
his head.
</P>
<P>
   From a distance of a century and a half, you might hear
Thackeray cackle.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 24)  
 (af)  
 By AGIS SALPUKAS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The price of crude oil has doubled since early last year. Higher
prices for gasoline, heating oil and other products are hitting
every consumer's pocketbook.
</P>
<P>
   Is OPEC flexing its muscles again? Not exactly. There's a new
oil cartel in town, and after a shaky start two years ago, its
members have achieved _ for now, at least _ the unity necessary to
hold to their production quotas. And that means higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, this cartel is simply the 11 members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries plus two _ Mexico and
Norway. But the world's oil-producing and exporting nations are
wielding power this time around mainly because of a shove not from
the Middle East but rather from Mexico _ and especially from its
persistent energy minister, Luis K. Tellez, a novice in the world
of oil.
</P>
<P>
   When Tellez began his mission, he was worried about the
devastating impact that falling oil prices were having on the
economy in Mexico, which in 1997 relied on oil for 38 percent of
its revenues. But his leadership has been felt the world over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Tellez, this coalition would not have been possible,''
said Dr. Gary Ross, chief executive of PIRA Energy Group, a
consulting firm based in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition has shown such cohesion that some analysts predict
that crude oil could rise to an extraordinary level _ $30 a barrel
_ by the end of the year, a price not seen since January 1991,
during the Persian Gulf war. Already, the price of crude oil has
more than doubled, to $23.45 a barrel from $11 early this year.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the coalition is home free. Prices hit $24 a barrel
last month, but slipped back when traders thought they saw hints of
cracks in the cartel's solidarity. After all, if one country breaks
ranks, the cartel's tenuous grip on the world market could crumble.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, though, there seems little easing in the
cartel's united front or in rising oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the bullish global economy strengthens the
group's grip. World oil inventories have been declining, but in the
past year demand has been rising sharply. Most Western economies
are in high gear, and as Asian economies have recovered from their
turmoil last year, their need for oil has grown, too.
</P>
<P>
   World demand, now about 76 million barrels a day, could outrun
supply by about three million barrels a day as early as this
quarter, said Frederick Leuffer, an oil analyst at Bear Stearns.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the oil exporters stay with their cuts, inventories of oil
will run down hard and push the price up to close to $30,'' Leuffer
said, echoing a view shared by many oil experts. ``Everyone is on
the edge of their seat about when the discipline will break or when
the first increase will be made in the production quotas.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything was different in the early months of 1998, when the
coalition was forged. With oil prices at $15 to $16 a barrel, oil
producers were hurting. Mexico was in particularly dire straits,
forced to make a series of painful cuts in government spending that
hit its people where it hurt most: in health, education and other
basic services.
</P>
<P>
   Tellez, an economist who had no previous experience in the oil
industry, decided to try to steer the world's oil-producing nations
in a new direction. When he became energy minister in 1997, the
soft-spoken Tellez knew neither his colleagues nor much about the
arcane world of oil politics.
</P>
<P>
   But he jumped headlong into the oil patch, and within a year he
was able to persuade a few key oil ministers and officials from
Saudi Arabia and Venezuela to form a new coalition of oil-producing
nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly demonstrates a new configuration,'' said Daniel
Yergin, the chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a
consulting group based in Cambridge, Mass. ``Mexico's role has
become central, whereas before it was more peripheral.''
</P>
<P>
   Unknown in the industry just two years ago, Tellez has become a
force. ``Tellez is now a significant player in the world of oil,''
Yergin said. How long he remains one depends upon Mexico itself,
for he made no promises about Mexico's participation in the group
beyond the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Tellez seems an unlikely world-shaker. A short,
slight 41-year-old with receding dark hair, he was trained as an
economist specializing in international finance, and his experience
in government had been largely with a contentious project that gave
tenant farmers title to the land they farmed.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview in the lobby of the Four Seasons Hotel in
Manhattan, where he spoke at a meeting of oil industry experts,
Tellez reminisced about his plunge into the murky waters of oil
diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   After getting his doctorate in economics at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology in 1986, Tellez, who runs and plays tennis
to remain trim, taught economics at his alma mater in Mexico for a
time.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, he joined the Finance Ministry, and two years later
helped to put together a plan, led by Treasury Secretary Nicholas
F. Brady, that reduced Mexico's foreign debt. In 1990, he moved to
the Agriculture Ministry, and in 1994 was made chief of staff to
President Ernesto Zedillo, whom he had known since his early days
as an economist.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was on to the Energy Ministry, where the last months of
1997 were particularly bleak, he recalled, with oil prices falling
to $17 a barrel in December.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, ``we sold a shipment of oil for $7 a barrel,'' he
said. ``Such a price has not been seen since the Great
Depression.'' As revenues plunged, Mexico had to cut its budget
twice.
</P>
<P>
   Oil producers seemed unable to change the disastrous policies
that led to the price spiral. But Tellez managed to break through
this wall of paralysis, mainly with what he called ``gentlemen's
agreements'' among Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1998, he began his effort to break the logjam by
consulting with Zedillo, who gave him his full support. He then
contacted Erwin Arrieta, oil minister of Venezuela, a founding
member of OPEC. Arrieta agreed on the need for action, and the two
men met in Miami, discussing, among other things, the possibility
of Mexico forging a coalition with Norway, another major non-OPEC
producer.
</P>
<P>
   It was an unusual initiative, one that could be politically
touchy back in Mexico, which as a big oil exporter _ particularly
to the United States _ had long kept its distance from OPEC. Any
sign of change would raise concerns that Mexico was giving up its
carefully guarded independence.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with the support of Arrieta, and using various oil
experts as intermediaries, he tried to find out whether Ali Naimi,
the Saudi oil minister, would be willing to talk to him. Word came
back that he would.
</P>
<P>
   The Saudis, who as the world's largest exporters play a leading
role in OPEC, had helped set off the latest crisis in oil prices by
pushing through a higher production ceiling for OPEC late in 1997.
Naimi's support would thus be crucial in any attempt to halt the
slide.
</P>
<P>
   When Tellez called him at his office in Riyadh in February 1998,
he found that they had similar concerns. Their countries' budgets
were being torn to shreds by falling oil revenue, and no one seemed
to be taking any action to limit production.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was simple,'' Tellez said. ``It was important to do
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Naimi invited him and Arrieta for secret talks _ the first time
a Mexican oil minister had been granted such a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   On the way, Tellez made a stop in Norway, also a big oil
exporter, to see what position that country would take. The
Norwegian energy minister, Anne Enger Lahnstein, and other
Norwegian officials listened to him, he said, but did not commit
themselves. Only later did Norway, which also had a tradition of
not cooperating with OPEC, go along with production cuts.
</P>
<P>
   With only one assistant in tow, Tellez flew to Riyadh, where he
and Arrieta, who arrived with a full staff on a private jet, sat
down with Naimi in a luxurious official guest house in March 1998.
</P>
<P>
   With oil prices still languishing around $14 a barrel, the three
wasted little time, taking only one day to agree to cut the
coalition's production by 1.6 million to 2 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   Naimi had the formidable, and delicate, task of getting other
major OPEC producers to agree. Through an intense day of telephone
calls, he lined up the often fractious group to support a cut of
1.6 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   Because their talks had been secret _ and because Mexico had
never before cooperated with OPEC at such a level _ the
announcement of the deal on March 22 came as a surprise to experts
and analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Despite skepticism that the new group would be able to stick
together, oil prices began to recover quickly, from $14.65 a barrel
in March to $17 a month later.
</P>
<P>
   The recovery, though, was short-lived. With most Asian economies
going into a severe downturn and demand falling from big oil
importers like Japan and South Korea, the glut of oil started to
build again.
</P>
<P>
   Especially remarkable in the story of this ad hoc group has been
its members' willingness to abide by the cuts through thick and
thin _ even when prices kept falling last year because of the
decline of the Asian economies.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics were even more stunned when the group agreed on an
additional series of production cuts this year _ totaling about 5.3
million barrels a day _ after its initial cuts last year.
</P>
<P>
   According to Yergin, the author of ``The Prize,'' a history of
the oil industry (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1991), it was the ``specter of
$5-a-barrel oil'' _ a price so low that it would devastate the
economies of many oil-exporting nations _ that inspired the group's
cohesion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The source of the discipline is dire necessity and trauma that
these countries went through because of the collapse in prices,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   And Ross, of PIRA, said: ``What these countries found is that
they have a common interest. The low oil prices were extremely
painful to them since it cut their revenue.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason, he said, has been the willingness of political
leaders of the three nations that lead the coalition _ Saudi
Arabia, Venezuela and Mexico _ to back up their top oil officials.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone thought OPEC was declining and losing members,'' he
added, particularly after 1997, when the organization seemed to
lack the will to break the disastrous pattern of pumping more oil,
even as prices were plunging.
</P>
<P>
   But now, again, a single coalition accounts for more than half
of world oil production, a share that OPEC itself had not held
since the 1970s. And this cartel could be around for a while. Many
longtime observers of OPEC and the oil industry say that the new
coalition will remain potent and that it could well be a
stabilizing influence on world oil prices over the long term.
</P>
<P>
   One vital component of this stability is Tellez's effort: by
bringing Mexico and Norway together with OPEC, he has eliminated a
big reason that past productions cuts have often been ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, Mexico and Norway often acted as a thorn in the
side of OPEC. When the cartel tried to cut production, they pumped
all the oil they could. Sure enough, OPEC members would follow suit
to protect their markets, and OPEC's resolve to keep prices stable
would crumble.
</P>
<P>
   This coalition also has a different look. Even after two years,
the group remains informal. While OPEC has a large staff and an
elaborate headquarters in Vienna, the new group has no name or
offices. It subsists largely on the growing trust among the sharply
different personalities of the coalition's energy officials.
</P>
<P>
   They communicate mainly by telephone, e-mail and periodic
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting to know each other,'' Tellez said. ``Building up
trust is very important.'' And he saw no reason to change this
informal approach.
</P>
<P>
   Trust will be vital if the cartel is to last. Tellez said that
current prices were not too high and that he saw no reason for the
group to increase production. He said that there were no plans to
discuss such a step at a meeting to be held on Nov. 17 in Riyadh
with Saudi and Venezuelan officials.
</P>
<P>
   Oil traders clearly thought differently. When word of the
meeting leaked out, crude oil, which had been trading in the $24
range, slid to $22.
</P>
<P>
   Leuffer said the market's reaction might have strengthened the
group's resolve not to raise production, since it proved what could
happen if it showed the least sign that it might do so.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, of course, looks on from a different angle,
because it imports 56 percent of its oil, making its economy
vulnerable if prices soar. For now, though, higher energy prices
have not had a large-enough effect to fuel inflation, said Patrick
Jackman, an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which puts
together the Consumer Price Index.
</P>
<P>
   Average prices for regular gasoline have risen from 95 cents a
gallon last winter to about $1.29, and heating oil this winter will
cost about $1.04 a gallon, up from 80 cents last winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing bad has happened yet, but it is something you have to
keep your eye on,'' said William Dudley, the chief United States
economist for Goldman, Sachs, adding that the core inflation rate
was running at 2 percent so far the year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if the price of crude oil keeps rising, the impact on the
American economy will be substantial, Jackman said, because oil is
used in so many consumer products.
</P>
<P>
   The full impact is yet to be felt in Mexico, either. Higher
crude oil prices have helped the government begin to recover from a
huge drop in revenues in 1998, when spending cuts caused widespread
hardship. Mexico's oil revenues totaled $9.7 billion in 1997,
plunged to $6.4 billion in 1998 and are estimated to recover to
$8.5 billion this year.
</P>
<P>
   But Tellez _ who can claim a great deal of credit for that
recovery _ is not being hailed as a hero. That is because the money
is going mainly to shore up the battered peso, not to restore
services.
</P>
<P>
   None of this has been easy for Tellez, who for most of his
career was rarely in the limelight. When oil prices were still
falling in 1998, even after Mexico and others had made cuts, he
bore the brunt of increasing criticism in the press and among some
oil experts in Mexico that his initiative had only added to the
misery. Mexico had cut its production but now, with plunging
prices, it was getting even less revenue, the argument went.
</P>
<P>
   Tellez recalled that at one point even his mentor, Zedillo, had
second thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time you get together with your friends the price goes
down,'' he recalled the president telling him once in jest. ``So be
careful.''

 &HT;    Family pushes for Fla. lake to be closed after recent death
 &HT;    By Sanjay Bhatt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A 19-year-old Boca Raton man who swam in
Lake Ida with a friend recently has died from what doctors suspect
is a rare form of meningitis seen in fewer than 100 Americans in
the last 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Dominic Rosenthal was operating a personal watercraft in
the Delray Beach lake Oct. 6 when he fell into the water _ which
health officials discourage people from swimming in _ and scratched
his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   He went to Boca Raton Community Hospital's emergency room later
that day to get a booster tetanus shot, his mother Cathy Ford said,
and went home.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal returned to the hospital six days later with a bad
headache, vomiting, low-grade fever and neck stiffness, Ford said.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, in spite of the strongest antibiotics,
Rosenthal died at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami from massive
brain swelling.
</P>
<P>
   He was buried Wednesday in Boca Raton.
</P>
<P>
   The death of the otherwise healthy freshman at Palm Beach
Community College has shaken his family.
</P>
<P>
   They are critical of health and park officials for not warning
water skiers about the parasite that may have killed their son and
they want the park closed.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's doctor, however, says such deaths are so rare that
there is no need to close freshwater lakes like Lake Ida to
thousands of swimmers who enjoy them regularly.
</P>
<P>
   ``He died from a severe kind of meningitis,'' said Dr. Lorraine
Dowdy, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Miami.
Tests of spinal fluid detected no bacteria, nor does Dowdy suspect
it was viral. ``My suspicion is it was due to some type of
amoeba.''
</P>
<P>
   The amoeba parasite is found in soil, water and air.
</P>
<P>
   Human infections are rare but almost always fatal, according to
the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The parasite usually enters humans through the nose, such as
during swimming, and moves into the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors don't know why only a few humans succumb to it, Dowdy
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not something you would close a lake for or post
warning signs about,'' she said. ``More people get struck by
lightning in Florida than get infected from this disease every
year.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not what Rosenthal's family wants to hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``This park should be shut down,'' said Richard Ford, his
stepfather. ``The health department has a small sign saying this
lake could be hazardous. Hazardous in what way? They don't tell you
that there's something in there that could kill you.''
</P>
<P>
   The health department does not test water quality in Lake Ida
because it says the water is already deemed unsafe for swimming.
</P>
<P>
   Runoff from surrounding neighborhoods and canals flows into the
lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``The water quality can change from day to day so rapidly,
particularly after a storm,'' said Umesh Asrani, assistant director
of the department's division of environmental health and
engineering. ``To us it's no different from a canal or the
Intracoastal.''
</P>
<P>
   Dowdy said she tried to explain to Rosenthal's family how
sporadic and unpreventable the disease is.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult for people to accept that things happen and we
don't understand why they happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami-Dade County's medical examiner is conducting an autopsy.
It could be six weeks before doctors know whether the parasite was
present in Rosenthal's brain tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Dowdy suspects one of two types of amoeba-caused
meningitis _ primary amoebic meningoencephalitis or granulomatious
amoebic encephalitis.
</P>
<P>
   PAM generally occurs in healthy persons and the parasite kills
within a week if left untreated; there were four reported cases in
the United States in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   GAE tends to occur in people with weak immune systems and can
take several weeks to a year after symptoms appear for the parasite
to kill, according to the CDC.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few people have survived PAM when treated promptly with
certain antibiotic combinations.
</P>
<P>
   The amoebae also can cause eye infections that result in
blindness, the CDC said.
</P>
<P>
   In nearly all reported cases, several other people were swimming
with the infected person and did not fall ill.

manufacturers for the cost of removing lead paint from buildings

   Two New York Times News Service articles sent on Monday, Oct. 18
and Wednesday, Oct. 20, about Republican opposition to President
Clinton's nomination of Carol Moseley-Braun as Ambassador to New
Zealand referred incorrectly to a Confederate flag that was at
issue in 1993 when Ms. Moseley-Braun, as Senator from Illinois,
persuaded the Senate to reject a renewed patent for an emblem for
the United Daughters of the Confederacy. (A similar error occurred
in an earlier article, on July 23, 1993.) The emblem included the
Stars and Bars, the first national flag of the Confederacy _ not
the later Confederate battle flag.

CITING DISTRUST OF AUTHOR, PUBLISHER WITHDRAWS BOOK ON BUSH 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ St. Martin's Press, the publisher of a controversial
biography of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, took the unusual step of
recalling the disputed book Friday, issuing an alert to booksellers
around the country to return thousands of copies for shredding or
burning because company executives no longer trusted the author.
</P>
<P>
   Executives of the publishing house announced the recall shortly
after getting confirmation that photographs of the book's author,
J.H. Hatfield, matched police photographs of a felon convicted of
hiring a hit man 11 years ago in an unsuccessful attempt to murder
his boss using a car bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're heat, furnace fodder,'' Sally Richardson, the
president and publisher of St. Martin's trade division, said of the
books. The publishing house this month had shipped more than 70,000
copies of Hatfield's ``Fortunate Son: George W. Bush and the Making
of an American President.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatfield did not return phone calls seeking comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Such recalls are rare, but this one comes in a season when other
companies have been forced to pull books because of shattered trust
_ from an author accused of making up a Holocaust identity to a
biographer who simply plagiarized the words of other books. The
incidents have raised questions about the industry's ability to
screen authors.
</P>
<P>
   Hatfield's book included claims from anonymous sources that Bush
_ the leading contender for the Republican presidential nomination
_ was arrested in 1972 on cocaine possession charges that were
later expunged by a judge as a favor to Bush's father.
</P>
<P>
   In statements Friday, St. Martin's executives did not take issue
specifically with the disclosures, which have been denied by the
Bush family, but instead said they no longer considered the author
reliable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't be sure what else he lied to us about or to the
attorney who did the legal review of the book,'' said David Kaye,
the general counsel for St. Martin's Press. ``Therefore we can't
continue to trust what he told us.''
</P>
<P>
   The recall came a day after The Dallas Morning News reported
that Hatfield had been convicted of felony. Executives at St.
Martin's said earlier that Hatfield had called it a case of
mistaken identity.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush biography first surfaced as a proposal more than a year
ago and St. Martin's paid a modest advance of five figures. It
accepted the book on the strength of a recommendation by a
Manhattan literary agency, Richard Curtis Associates, and what it
considered Hatfield's solid resume as a Texas journalist and the
author of the unauthorized biography of actor Patrick Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   In its promotional material, St. Martin's described Hatfield as
the winner of the ``prestigious Isaac Asimov Foundation Literary
Award for Outstanding Biography in 1996.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Science Fiction Writers of American and Asimov's widow,
Janet, said that they have never heard of such an award dedicated
to Asimov, who was not known for his biographies.
</P>
<P>
   Criminal records indicated that a James H. Hatfield was
convicted of plotting to kill his bosses at a Dallas real estate
investment firm in a February 1987 car bombing. The plan failed.
The bomb apparently malfunctioned when the two executives turned
the ignition of their car inside a downtown parking garage
</P>
<P>
   In June 1992, according to court records, Hatfield pleaded
guilty to a federal charge of making false statements. He was
accused of falsifying his signature to cash checks from Housing and
Urban Development programs that totaled more than $22,000.
</P>
<P>
   The biography did face a legal review by a Washington law firm,
said Kaye, who noted that lawyers initially vetted the entire book
and later a final chapter, which was added in late sumer and
contained the sensitive information about Bush's supposed arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Kaye said Hatfield's background was not part of the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something that in my experience is not a part of the
legal process unless something comes up in the course of it that
would raise a question that would be more specific,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kaye said the company was now faced with the issue of how it can
protect itself from dishonest authors.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at St. Martin's insisted that the book was not
affected by time pressures, even though the publication date of the
book was moved to October from January to compete with other
biographies of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But in general, the cycle for publishing has been compressed to
as little as four months from what used to be about nine months,
leaving little time for reviews.
</P>
<P>
   One executive familiar with the company said St. Martin's latest
travails reflect broader problems in American publishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the more corporate publishers become the more
pressures they face and they start to distance themselves from
rigorous investigations of the books they publish,'' the executive
said.
</P>
<P>
   St. Martin's Press is a publisher of popular books, and is a
division of Verlagsgruppe Georg von Holtzbrinck, which also owns
the literary publishing houses of Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux and Henry
Holt.
</P>
<P>
   This September, Morgan Entrekin, the president and publisher of
Atlantic Press, halted publication of a disputed biography by a
Scottish author, James Mackay, after acknowledging that he had not
inquired into the writer's history of plagiarism.
</P>
<P>
   And in October, several international publishers _ including
Random House Inc.'s imprint Schocken Books _ were forced to
consider whether to halt publication of a memoir after the original
German publisher disclosed preliminary results of a historian's
report about the author, Binjamim Wilkomirski.
</P>
<P>
   The report concluded that the author had lied about his identity
as a child survivor of Holocaust camps. A year earlier, his
American editor and translator had insisted that it was not the
role of a publisher ``to vet every manuscript and every author on
an adversarial basis.''

Barkley to announce retirement Sunday
<TEXT>
<P>
   By MICHAEL MURPHY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets' Charles Barkley, one of the most popular players in
NBA history, will announce his retirement Sunday, effective at the
end of the 1999-2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley, 36, will make the announcement in Birmingham, Ala., at
halftime of Sunday's preseason game against the Detroit Pistons.
Birmingham is less than a 20-minute drive from Barkley's hometown
of Leeds, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he has threatened to retire several times over the
past few years, Barkley insists this season will be it for him.
This will be his 16th NBA season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just time,'' said Barkley, who has been upgraded to
questionable for Sunday's game after missing the last four
preseason games with tendinitis in his right elbow. ``It's time.
That's it. I'm not going to answer any more questions about it.
It's just time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I'm going to do (after he retires). I might
just take some time off. But I'm making it official Sunday. I'm
announcing it there (in Birmingham) because that's my hometown, and
I'll have a lot of family and friends there. This is my last year,
period. I don't care how well I'm playing _ this is it. I want to
get it over with, and that's it. I'm looking forward to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The NBA has to feel otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley has long been one of the league's top draws, especially
internationally. He was on the original Dream Team, playing with
Michael Jordan, Larry Bird and Magic Johnson on the juggernaut that
won the gold medal at the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Barkley, then with the Phoenix Suns, teamed with
current Rockets teammate Hakeem Olajuwon on the Olympic basketball
team that won a gold medal in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Charles has decided that this is his last season, then we
should all relish one more chance to be entertained by one of the
most spectacular players in NBA history,'' NBA deputy commissioner
Russ Granik said. ``Charles is certainly a one-of-a-kind
personality, but first and foremost, he is a truly great talent on
the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockets owner Leslie Alexander agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's one of the greatest who ever played the game,''
Alexander said. ``He is a great player, but he also made the game
fun. People love to be around Charles, and an attitude like that is
rare in any sport. His routine will be missed.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially his routine on the court.
</P>
<P>
   A 6-6 power forward, Barkley averaged less than 10 rebounds only
once, when he averaged 8.6 as a rookie with the Philadelphia 76ers
in the 1984-85 season. Entering this season, Barkley has scored
23,468 points (13th on the all-time scoring list) and pulled down
12,337 rebounds, once leading the league (14.6 in 1986-87) and
hauling in a career-high 33 in his first game as a Rocket.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley averaged 12.3 rebounds last season, second in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a guy who's had a tremendous career and has done some
unbelievable things for his height,'' said Rockets coach Rudy
Tomjanovich. ``He's dominated the game at times _ at whatever his
true height is _ at the power forward position.''
</P>
<P>
   Taken out of Auburn by Philadelphia with the fifth pick in the
1984 draft, Barkley spent eight seasons with the 76ers before being
traded to Phoenix before the 1992-93 season. He was named the
league's Most Valuable Player in 1993 and has been selected
first-team All-NBA five times and second-team five times. He was
named to the NBA's 50 Greatest Players List.
</P>
<P>
   The one knock against Barkley has been he has not won an NBA
championship. Contemporaries such as Jordan, Bird, Johnson and
Olajuwon have won multiple titles; Barkley has made it to the NBA
Finals just once, in 1993, when the Suns lost to the Bulls in six
games, despite Barkley's averages of 27.3 points, 13 rebounds and
5.5 assists.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley was traded to the Rockets prior to the 1996-97 season
for Sam Cassell, Robert Horry, Mark Bryant and Chucky Brown. The
Rockets advanced to the Western Conference finals that season,
losing to the Utah Jazz in six games.
</P>
<P>
   Though he has no championship rings, Tomjanovich said Barkley's
legacy should not be that of a loser.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of guys in the league who have not won
championships,'' Tomjanovich said. ``But I'll bet that if you look
at the teams he's been on, their winning percentage is very high.
And there's a lot of great players who haven't won (a title).
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two in Utah (John Stockton and Karl Malone) who have
been around and have been all-pros, and there's one in New York
(Patrick Ewing) who comes to mind. And (the Lakers') Shaquille
(O'Neal), too. I think that (labeling Barkley a loser) is unfair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he came here and showed that he wants to win. He
really showed that in his actions _ the sacrifice he made to get
Scottie (Pippen) here (signing to play for the minimum so the
Rockets could take on Pippen's $67 million contract). I don't know
how many guys would do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, who said he was not surprised by the decision, is
happy to have Barkley play his last game as a Rocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely,'' Alexander said. ``It's nice to have a great one
retire in your uniform. And he's one of the greatest of all time.''

STRONG NOTES OF DISCORD MAR THE YANKEES' CHAMPIONSHIP TENOR  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The uncertainty of his future with the Yankees and the
questions about his shoulder gnawed at David Cone. But after the
Yankees defeated Texas in the first round of the playoffs, Cone
spoke with his teammate Chili Davis and they agreed: this is not
the time to worry about such matters, not when the Yankees are
pursuing another championship.
</P>
<P>
   Cone and his Yankee teammates plan to ignore the many underlying
difficulties and tensions in the organization when they begin the
95th World Series here Saturday against the Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   It is an ideal match-up for the final baseball championship of
this century. Like the Braves, the Yankees won more games than any
other team in their league during the regular season. Both teams
are loaded with established stars: Derek Jeter, Roger Clemens and
Bernie Williams for the Yankees, and Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine and
Chipper Jones for the Braves. There are at least two scheduled
pitching matchups that will pit former Cy Young Award winners
against each other. Both teams are commonly viewed as hard-working,
hustling teams that possess general toughness and class.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Hernandez will pitch Game 1 on Saturday for the Yankees,
against the Braves' Tom Glavine. But before then, the Yankees will
have a difficult roster situation to determine. The father of Luis
Sojo, the veteran utility infielder, died on Thursday, and the
Yankee is expected to be unavailable for the immediate future. The
Yankees were trying to determine this evening whether he would be
able to play in any game. Major League Baseball has rejected the
Yankees' request to temporarily replace him on the World Series
roster.
</P>
<P>
   Sojo is just one of a number of Yankees players who has coped
with the illness or death of a parent this season. Scott Brosius'
father died, and the fathers of Paul O'Neill and Andy Pettitte have
had heart trouble for much of this year _ difficult situations that
have made a tough year even more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the Yankees played with exuberance and near perfect
harmony and won a record 125 games.
</P>
<P>
   But after the blockbuster trade of David Wells and two others
for Clemens on the first day of spring training, the rapture
eroded, under the unyielding pressure on the Yankees to repeat
their incredible performance. Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager, was
told he had prostrate cancer in spring training. The dugout coach,
Don Zimmer, Torre's longtime friend, stepped in for Torre, but
within three weeks he was sparring with the principal owner George
Steinbrenner over the handling of pitcher Hideki Irabu.
</P>
<P>
   A number of players slumped, the Yankees played inconsistently
in early May before Torre came back and restored calm, and the
Yankees ground out another strong year. But along the way, the
tension that strained relations between the front office members
located in Tampa, Fla., and the major league staff in New York _
which had been smooth last year _ manifested itself again this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   There was disagreement over how to best use some players,
catcher Jorge Posada, in particular; some of the officials involved
in player development have wanted Torre to play Posada more, while
Torre has used Joe Girardi in about 40 percent of the games. That
debate has flared recently, since Girardi began receiving the bulk
of the playing time in the post-season.
</P>
<P>
   Some player moves were done in spite of the wishes of the major
league staff. When the Yankees lost the first two games of the
series against the Mets in July, pitcher Ed Yarnall was sent to the
majors, despite the fact that Torre and others didn't know what
role he might play.
</P>
<P>
   In September, pitcher Jeff Juden was promoted to the majors _
again, the major league staff in New York was at a loss to
understand why. Executives involved in development, who work more
closely with Steinbrenner on a daily basis, want the major league
staff to be more cognizant of using younger players, while the
staff has been resentful of what they believe is some
second-guessing. ``We've been winning,'' one person working at
Yankee Stadium said recently. ``Two titles in three years. So why
don't they leave us alone? Everything is coming out of Tampa.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Chambliss, the hitting coach, may be fired after the
season, regardless of whether the Yankees win the World Series. The
Yankees have waited to decide whether to pick up Paul O'Neill's
option for next season. Girardi likely will leave and may sign with
the Chicago Cubs, near his hometown. Davis is expected to retire.
Other players, such as Brosius and Pettitte, may be traded in the
effort to contain the budget, and the uncertainty sometimes has
made the season difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Success in 1996 was a renewed experience for the Yankees.
Winning in 1998 was history-making. Winning in 1999, with all the
expectations, has been burdensome.
</P>
<P>
   But as he spoke to Davis that day earlier this month, Cone _ who
could pitch his last game for the Yankees in the World Series _
agreed this was no time to worry about that. ``It doesn't really
matter right now,'' Cone said Friday afternoon as he stepped onto
Turner Field, underneath perfect fall sunshine. ``All that matters
now is winning another World Series and adding to the legacy of
this group of players.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have gotten used to doing this, Torre was saying
Friday, playing effectively through turmoil and concerns, putting
aside problems and focusing on the task at hand. The Braves mirror
the Yankees in many ways: they have an accomplished pitching staff
and a roster of players deep in post-season experience.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta won the World Series in 1995, and the Braves and Yankees
met in the 1996 World Series, the Yankees dropping the first two
games before winning the next four. The Braves have been the
favorite to win the World Series in most years of this decade,
while the Yankees recently have been regarded as one of the best
teams ever.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves are steeped with experienced pitchers, the Yankees
with savvy hitters. ``I don't know that they're smarter than other
teams,'' Glavine said. ``I think they have a better ability to
stick to their approach better than other teams do. They're good at
going up there and having a game plan and sticking to their game
plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Davis: ``You've got all their Cy Young Award pitchers, and
we've got Clemens and David Cone with five. It's going to take good
pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   Girardi laughed when asked how the Yankees felt about being
overconfident. ``There's no overconfidence in here,'' he said.
``The people in here don't care if we're favored or we are
underdogs. We've got to win four games against a good team.'' &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The first thing you should know about Felipe
Lopez, who immigrated from Oaxaca 21 years ago in the trunk of a
smuggler's car, is that his name is not really Felipe Lopez, and
that he does not really consider himself Mexican.
</P>
<P>
   True, Felipe Lopez is the name on his legal documents, but in
his native Indian language, and his home, his real name, he
insists, is Lieb. Mexico, he says, is a society that renders
Indians like himself all but invisible, pressuring them to
assimilate in the dominant Spanish culture. So Mexico feels less
like his true homeland, he says, than his newly adopted one, which
gave him the opportunity to sweat in hot kitchens for years earning
low wages.
</P>
<P>
   But all that, remarkably, is in the past. For the great triumph
in the life of this quietly intense man is that he has turned a
corner by finally coming to a point, after years of strife, where
he can now define himself by what he is rather than by what he is
not.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Lopez, 37, is proud to call himself a Zapotec Indian and
a scholar, a man whose native language, never before written down,
now has its own two-volume dictionary. Lopez, who barely got
through the sixth grade in his home village but is a doctoral
candidate here, helped write the volumes, a Zapotec-English-Spanish
dictionary that has charted new ground in the study of Mexico's
indigenous languages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I think it's a dream, is this real,'' said Lopez,
sitting in his office at the University of California at Los
Angeles. ``I was taught to feel ashamed of being an Indian. I was
taught that someone like me could not think of doing this. I had to
show them.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``them'' he had to show were both the many Mexicans who, he
said, look down on Indians as well as Americans who expect little
from illegal Mexican immigrants beyond cheap labor. What was
particularly striking about his achievement, several experts said,
was that it would have been difficult in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a language that would probably never have been
described if this had not been done here,'' said Pamela Munro,
Lopez's co-author and a linguist who has prepared dictionaries for
several American Indian languages. ``I don't know why there aren't
more dictionaries like this being done in Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopez's native language is spoken by 1,000 to 2,000 people in
his home village, San Luis Quiavini, in central Oaxaca state. It is
related to several dozen other languages generally referred to as
Zapotec, but which are distinct. The group of languages is spoken
in geographic pockets in Oaxaca by perhaps 400,000 people, Ms.
Munro said.
</P>
<P>
   But with the spread of popular culture and Spanish language
schools, she said, Zapotec and a number of other indigenous
languages in Mexico are slowly dying.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez ponders such facts with resentment. He said that he was
taught to regard Zapotec as a liability and that it was a subject
of humiliation in his contacts with the world outside his village.
</P>
<P>
   The stain of those early impressions so colored his perceptions,
he recalled, that when he first began to discuss the idea of a
dictionary with Ms. Munro six years ago, he told her that it would
be a simple project because the primitive language had a vocabulary
of perhaps 100 words. The final volumes contain more than 9,000
entries; Ms. Munro said the language, which uses a complex system
of tones, is one of the most maddeningly difficult she had
encountered.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez said that he grew up speaking no Spanish until he went to
school, and that this left him feeling marginalized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids made fun of me,'' he said, ``but I didn't even understand
what they were saying.''
</P>
<P>
   He left school after the sixth grade to work on his family's
farm, and when he was 16, he began the great adventure of his life.
He took buses north and eventually slipped across the border by
paying a smuggler.
</P>
<P>
   He ended up in Los Angeles with some relatives, working as a
dishwasher in a Chinese restaurant. By then, he spoke a smattering
of Spanish, but virtually no English, leaving him feeling awed by
the new country but almost completely isolated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told myself, `Either I will become what they say I am, or I
will better myself,''' Lopez said. ``That was what motivated me.''
</P>
<P>
   So he worked his way through various restaurant jobs and
eventually became a cook, all the while slowly improving his
English and Spanish. He said he finally realized he could earn even
more if he could learn enough English to communicate with all the
waiters and the staff. So he decided to attend an adult education
course, an experience that lasted exactly one class.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez said he was taken by surprise when the teacher asked him
to point out the parts of a sentence on the chalkboard. He said he
stood there paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what a verb was,'' he said. ``I realized I was
illiterate.''
</P>
<P>
   The bell rang, ending the painful moment, but the episode sent
him with a new found zeal on his great odyssey. He never went back
to the class, he said, but he began to teach himself the answer to
that first question: what is a verb?
</P>
<P>
   Lopez threw himself into his studies and progressed through a
series of programs after work. In 1984 he received his high school
equivalency diploma. Shortly afterward he began taking courses at
Santa Monica College, a two-year institution.
</P>
<P>
   Even after earning the two-year degree, he was reluctant to
consider going for his bachelor's degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not for me,'' Lopez said he told a friend who encouraged
him to go on. ``No one in my town has even been to college. I don't
have what it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   He decided, though, that he had nothing to lose, and he applied
to UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was almost praying I wouldn't be accepted,'' Lopez said.
``If I was turned down, I thought all my problems would be solved.
I wouldn't have to face all those issues.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was accepted, and began taking classes in the fall of
1991. He received his undergraduate degree in Latin American
studies in 1994, and his master's degree two years later. He then
entered the doctorate program in urban planning, a degree he hopes
to use to help villages like San Lucas Quiavini find ways of
developing that will not stamp out the native language and culture.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez, now married with two children, became a legal U.S.
resident under the Immigration and Reform Control Act of 1986,
which allowed Mexicans and other immigrants living illegally in
this country to obtain legal citizenship. He became a citizen in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Guillermo E. Hernandez, the director of the Chicano Studies
Research Center at UCLA and the publisher of the Zapotec
dictionary, said the project was a milestone not just for Lopez but
also for the university by making it clear that the study of Indian
cultures would be encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   ``This speaks loudly to our colleagues now that this kind of
thing will be a part of the center,'' Hernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez takes some satisfaction in that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of times I thought, `If it's not me, who will do it?'''
he said. ``Why did I go through all these hardships?''

TROJANS LOOKING FOR LEADER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC's maligned seniors had a sympathizer this
week, even as they were singled out by coach Paul Hackett for their
inconsistent play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm as old as the seniors,'' redshirt junior quarterback Mike
Van Raaphorst said. ``I take responsibility also, it's not just the
seniors.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Raaphorst has filled in admirably since Carson Palmer broke
his collarbone, and has the same number of interceptions (three) in
159 pass attempts as Palmer had in 53.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear a lot of criticism on how Mike is doing but I think
he's doing pretty well,'' wide receiver Windrell Hayes said.
</P>
<P>
   But no one is fooling themselves that the Trojans (3-3, 1-2)
wouldn't be a different team if they had had Palmer for all six
games _ if for no other reason than because Palmer was viewed as a
team leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if the team looks at any one player (now). Before
the season, the team was looking at Carson,'' Hayes said. ``When we
lost him, I guess everything just went up in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans are still searching for someone to fill that void.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to say a senior needs to do it, but somebody
needs to do it,'' Hayes said.
</P>
<P>
   Strong could play: Although he's practiced only three days at
safety, former tailback Frank Strong will be listed as a backup
today and could see significant action later in the season,
according to Hackett.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be interesting to see him progress,'' Hackett
said. ``I expect before the season is over, he will be a strong
contributor.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking for a position: Three years ago, Stanford's Randy Fasani
was the most highly recruited quarterback in the nation. But he's
never been able to get near the starting lineup, so last year
Fasani tried a few plays at tight end.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Fasani made another change and practiced at
linebacker, and there is a good chance he will play against USC.
</P>
<P>
   Fasani is the third-string quarterback, stuck behind starter
Todd Husak and Joe Borchard, just as he was last season, when he
was limited to just 16 pass attempts. This year, he has played in
five games but thrown only six passes.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Fasani went to coach Tyrone Willingham and asked if
he could play defense, and Willingham told him he already had been
pondering the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't want to waste another year of eligibility,''
said Fasani, who was named the No. 1 quarterback in the nation by
three major recruiting publications during his senior season (1996)
at Del Oro High near Sacramento. ``It was getting to the point
where I just couldn't stand being on the sideline, I wanted to play
real badly.''
</P>
<P>
   Fasani intends to return to quarterback for spring drills to
compete for next year's starting job.
</P>
<P>
   Good line: Stanford's offensive line has been marvelous
protecting the quarterback. The Cardinal have allowed just eight
sacks in six games, best in the Pacific-10 Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal defense is almost as good at getting to the
quarterback, with 28 sacks, which ties USC for second-best in the
conference.

BLASTS IN CHECHEN CAPITAL UNLEASH NEW WAVE OF REFUGEES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NOVY SHAROY, Russia _ A fresh flood of Chechen refugees swept
westward Friday down the main highway into Ingushetia, the
neighboring republic, propelled by fear of a widening war with
Russia after explosions killed scores in Grozny, Chechnya's
capital.
</P>
<P>
   A day after the blasts flattened a downtown market and destroyed
a car carrying five passengers, Ingush officials said 3,000 more
Chechens had arrived, which raised the count to about 185,000.
</P>
<P>
   But the disaster at the Grozny market also appeared to have
levied a political cost on Russia, whose depiction of the Chechen
war as a relatively low-level antiterrorist operation came under
sharp criticism.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin's standing was not enhanced by a series of verbal
backflips over its responsibility. Military officials first denied
any role in the explosions on Thursday, then declared Friday that
Russian special forces had destroyed the market to stop arms
trading.
</P>
<P>
   It was left to Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, in his debut
before European Union ministers in Helsinki, Finland, to contradict
the military, saying that ``reports of some kind of special
operation'' were not correct, and that Chechens themselves had
probably blown up the market.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On Friday at the Chechnya-Ingushetia border, a thin,
black-haired man who identified himself as Ruslan, 37, stood beside
a beat-up minivan with his wife, three children and belongings
packed inside, and said that was beyond belief.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine what they are saying?'' he asked. ``They are
saying that the terrorists did this. But it is the Russian forces
that were doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   In tears, his wife left her seat and joined him. ``What are they
doing to us?'' she shouted. ``What have we ever done to the Russian
people? They've taken our oil and they don't even leave us a piece
of bread.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The explosions in Grozny were a major topic at the European
Union session, where some officials were clearly disbelieving and
at times bluntly critical of the Russian explanations.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the European Parliament, Lord Russell-Johnston,
expressed shock at the death toll and accused the Russian
government of human rights violations and lawbreaking.
</P>
<P>
   The current president of the European Union, Prime Minister
Paavo Lipponen of Finland, said the group was ``deeply worried
about the deteriorating situation'' in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   By day's end, the Russian government was vigorously asserting
that civilian deaths in Grozny could not be compared to the
civilian deaths caused by NATO attacks last spring in Yugoslavia,
attacks that Moscow has denounced as criminal rights violations.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the White House expressed concern about the
situation in Chechnya. But officials voiced no direct criticism of
Russian conduct of the war, in which more than 2,000 civilians are
said to have died since the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's clear is that there's a tragic situation there with
terrible loss of life,'' the White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart,
said. But he added that there were ``conflicting reports and
statements'' about the marketplace blasts, noting, ``We are working
hard to find out what the facts are.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   What occurred, and precisely where, was still being sorted out
in Grozny Friday. With three dramatically opposing accounts,
Russian officials have not made the chain of events any clearer.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the explosions were reported Thursday evening and
attributed to Russian missiles or artillery, the Defense Ministry
denied that any aerial operations had been conducted over Grozny
that evening, and said it had played no role in the blasts.
</P>
<P>
   By early Friday, military officials had executed a partial
about-face. A spokesman for Russian forces in Chechnya, Aleksandr
Veklich, said unidentified special forces had in fact destroyed the
market after receiving ``reconnaissance data'' on Thursday
indicating that it was a storehouse for terrorist weapons and
explosives.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result of the special operation,'' he said, ``the market,
together with the weapons, ammunition and arms traders, was
destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Veklich repeated that no air attacks had been executed and that
no civilians were in the market area at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Civilians don't walk at nighttime in a place where arms are
sold to bandits and terrorists,'' he said. ``They sit at home.
Those hit in the attack were arms peddlers supplying bandits.''
</P>
<P>
   But within hours, Russia's internal security service had denied
that it blew up the market. And in Helsinki, Putin revised the
military's declaration to deny, more or less flatly, that Russian
forces had anything to do with the blasts. Rather, he said,
responsibility lay with Chechen terrorists or rival gangs.
</P>
<P>
   An air force spokesman, Anatoly Kornukov, said reports that the
market had been destroyed by rockets were ``disinformation.''
</P>
<P>
   But to journalists who were in Grozny at the time of the
explosions and who viewed the carnage Friday morning, the evidence
of some form of artillery or aerial attack seemed substantial.
</P>
<P>
   Initial reports Thursday night that missiles had struck a
hospital maternity ward and a mosque, killing nearly 40 people,
appeared by daylight Friday to be exaggerated or unfounded.
Reporters on the scene said that bodies had been stacked in one
mosque, and that a maternity center near the market had suffered
only indirect damage from an explosion.
</P>
<P>
   But some form of explosive did strike a car in the hospital
yard, The Associated Press reported Friday, killing all five of its
occupants. At the market Friday, Chechens displayed ragged shards
of metal with military-style markings, describing them as the
leavings of a Russian missile or missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists familiar with the market also disputed claims that
it was an arms bazaar. Many Chechen men carry guns, they noted, and
perhaps four or five dealers among the market's many stalls sold
weapons, but the explosions occurred in a section that sold
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Chechen health officials put the death toll at 143. The
International Committee of the Red Cross said its workers had
counted 245 wounded at three city hospitals. None of these
estimates could be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   The outlook for Chechnya is equally muddy. In Helsinki, Lipponen
told Putin it was time for ``immediate negotiations with
representatives of Chechnya,'' adding that the European Union's
members ``do not accept a military solution to the Chechen
conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin said he agreed, adding: ``Political issues can be resolved
via political means only. Chechnya's status will be determined by
political means. The problem is whom to talk to and who is
considered legitimate.''
</P>
<P>
   On the front, the Russian news service Interfax quoted Chechen
military leaders as saying Russian forces were moving troops and
armored equipment south through Chechnya, using pontoon bridges to
cross the Terek River. A spokesman for the Chechen president, Aslan
Maskhadov, said the northern suburbs of Grozny were under intensive
artillery bombardment.
</P>
<P>
   The intensity of the conflict was reflected in a statement from
the Islamic fundamentalist rebel who commands forces battling the
Russians, Shamil Basayev, who said: ``We are fighting to protect
our land and the religion of Allah. Our motto is: `Victory or
Paradise.'''

 &HT;    Reunion with baby ends Atlanta mother's anguish
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa and Jay Croft
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After a joyous reunion Friday, the family of an
8-month-old baby kidnapped and taken to Tennessee said they harbor
no ill will toward the teen-ager who police said snatched the
infant at gunpoint from his mother's arms near an Atlanta bus stop
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever happens to her is up to God, not us. We have nothing
against this woman,'' said the child's grandfather, Willie
Yarbrough, as he stood Friday afternoon at the door of the family
home in southwest Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Yarbrough, his wife, Elizabeth, and daughter, Natalie Evans,
mother of the kidnapped baby, had spent a sleepless Thursday night
praying for the safe return of Elijah, named for the prophet who
bypassed death and ascended directly to heaven in a chariot of
fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't talk to each other, we only talked to God, because
we knew God was the only one who could save Elijah,'' the
grandfather said.
</P>
<P>
   Their prayers were answered Friday morning, when they heard from
friends who saw it on television that a baby believed to be Elijah
had been recovered alive and well in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, the baby's mother arrived at the Decherd,
Tenn., police station, where the kidnap suspect was being held and
the infant cared for.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to say, thank you, Jesus Christ, for finding my
baby,'' Evans, 20, said. ``I would like to thank everybody who
helped me find my baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans left Decherd with Elijah 20 minutes after arriving in the
tiny hamlet. He had been examined at Southern Tennessee Medical
Center in nearby Winchester and found to be healthy and unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Beth Westbrook, 17, is accused of grabbing the infant from
Evans' arms Wednesday night as the mother walked toward her house
after getting off a MARTA bus.
</P>
<P>
   Evans told police a young woman appeared suddenly, pointed a gun
at her and wrested the child from her, disappearing into a thick
patch of woods.
</P>
<P>
   Early Friday morning, Atlanta police received a call from
someone who told detectives Westbrook had the baby and was headed
toward Franklin County, Tenn., where Westbrook has family, said
Atlanta police Deputy Chief C.B. Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The caller was anonymous, but the caller said they believed
the infant was with Westbrook and that they were headed to
Tennessee. We then called the Franklin County authorities with a
description and some other information, and they went to a house in
Decherd, where the baby was found unharmed,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested the teen-ager and charged her with kidnapping
and aggravated assault, Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not get a chance to talk to (Westbrook) in Tennessee,''
he said. ``She waived extradition to Atlanta, she is being brought
back, and we'll continue the investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said police are at a loss as to motive. ``That's
something that may come out later when we question her,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Decherd Police Chief Glenn Summers said Westbrook has been a
frequent
</P>
<P>
   runaway and fled state custody last June when police issued a
notice to arrest her. ``This kid's been running since she was 14
years old,'' the chief said. Summers said Westbrook apparently took
a bus from Atlanta to Tennessee on Thursday night. She then called
her boyfriend's aunt to pick her up, the chief said. When the aunt
asked the teen about the baby, ``She kept saying the baby was
hers,'' Summers said.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicious, the woman discovered Westbrook had been in Atlanta
and called police, Summers said.
</P>
<P>
   Westbrook was arrested at her boyfriend's home Friday morning.
Summers said the girl had been living in the Atlanta neighborhood
for about three months and was a ``casual acquaintance'' of Evans.
Summers would not identify the boyfriend or his family.
</P>
<P>
   No one else is expected to be implicated in the abduction, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Westbrook's mother was in Franklin County Juvenile Court and
``in shock'' Friday morning when the young woman waived extradition
to Georgia, Summers said. Robin Swindle, 35, was Westbrook's
softball coach when the girl was 14. ``She was a good kid back
then, just beginning to get wild,'' Swindle said. ``Typical
teen-ager, they all were. I got them for an hour away from their
parents, and you know how they are. She was the only girl on the
whole team who would come to practice in full makeup.''
</P>
<P>
   At Decherd City Hall, Elijah _ wearing a light blue jumper _ had
charmed the office staff, who fed him, gave him medicine for a
sinus infection, and remarked on what a sweet baby he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, we don't know if we want to let him go. He seems to
be teething, too. I can't see any teeth, bless his little heart,''
said JoAnne Van Hooser, an administrative assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Television news crews from Atlanta, Chattanooga, Huntsville and
Nashville, Tenn., set up their vans outside City Hall, and drivers
waved and gave the thumbs-up sign.
</P>
<P>
   With a population of about 2,500, Decherd is about 25 miles west
of Chattanooga. A stretch of U.S. 41 runs through town with
fast-food restaurants and small shops lining it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's excited everybody in town,'' said City Hall worker Rita
Isbell. ``People are calling and asking what has happened in
Decherd that we're getting so much attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Elijah's grandmother held the baby up. ``Hey, Granny's baby,''
she said, smiling at the infant. ``We prayed before we got here and
we're still praying.''
</P>
<P>
   Sue Lee, a city clerk, beamed: ``Oh, I'm so glad. That was so
good.''

 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the last three years Dr. Howard Derman, a Houston
neurologist, has been a travel agent on the side. But he has never
booked a cruise, a flight or even a hotel reservation for anyone
but himself. The same goes for Andrew W. Menachem, a stockbroker in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Neither is a travel agent at all, really _ except in name. But
thanks to Global Travel International, a travel agency in Maitland,
Fla., with which both affiliated four years ago, almost anyone can
be considered a travel agent and potentially gain access to the
discounts, deals and perquisites of travel that the title implies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's to say who's a travel agent and who isn't, when there
are no requirements for becoming one?'' asked Randy Warren, 31, the
co-founder and chairman of Global Travel. The company will give
travel agent credentials to anyone who is at least 18 years old and
antes up between $250 and $495 initially and $99 a year thereafter.
Since 1994, about 30,000 people have signed up, and 26,000 are
still members.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Global Travel's sales may exceed $120 million,
vaulting it within hailing distance of the top 50 travel agencies.
Its agents do business with many of the biggest names in travel,
from Club Med to Avis, from Holiday Inn to Walt Disney Travel. It
is also a member of the major trade organizations that oversee the
sale of airline tickets, cruises and various other travel packages.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've grown exponentially,'' said Pam Kressley, Carnival
Cruise Line's business development manager for central Florida.
``They're already one of my top accounts.''
</P>
<P>
   In large part, however, Global Travel's success is based on
getting the friends, family and acquaintances of its agents _
armies of them _ to think of Global Travel, too, in booking their
dream vacations and weekend getaways.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Global Travel's agents are relieved of having to do much of
the hard work of an agent; they make commissions simply by
referring their friends and relatives to Global's headquarters in
Florida, where in-house salaried employees and vacation specialists
search the computer and the Internet for the lowest fares and
rates. After making a referral, the agent can go fishing for more
prospects _ or just go fishing.
</P>
<P>
   Agents can make even more money if their friends and relatives
also decide to become agents themselves. In its manual, Global
Travel tells new agents that it will pay ``a referral fee each time
a friend, business associate or other client becomes an Independent
Travel Agent through GTI's agent program.'' The payout ranges from
$100 to $150 a person.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Global Travel's agents are like Derman and Menachem,
simply planning trips for themselves and enjoying the travel
discounts. When Menachem booked a ski trip to Park City, Utah, last
winter, ``I estimate that I saved at least 50 percent over the
published rates,'' he said, ``and at least 30 percent off the
package rate available from many travel agencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Global Travel's modus operandi challenges convention, but it has
so far overcome industry objections. Last year, the Federal Trade
Commission declined to take up a complaint from the American
Society of Travel Agents, known as ASTA, about the concept. And a
division of the Council of Better Business Bureaus found no
problems with Global Travel's ads.
</P>
<P>
   But the company's unorthodox ways do infuriate other travel
agents, whose business has already been hurt by the emergence of
Internet competition and the lowering of commissions paid by
airlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We consider companies that sell credentials to people who
aren't bona fide sellers of retail travel as `card mills,''' said
Paul M. Ruden, the senior vice president for legal and industry
affairs at the travel agents' society.
</P>
<P>
   Joel M. Abels, the co-editor and publisher of Travel Trade, an
industry publication in Manhattan, said, ``Outfits like that damage
the reputation of legitimate outside agents.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren is not fazed. ``Since we started, we've been attacked
from all sides,'' he said, adding, ``ASTA should be helping to make
its agencies more competitive for the future, instead of clinging
to the old way of doing things and trying to define who is or isn't
an agent.''
</P>
<P>
   And one way or another, travel agencies are changing: The
omnipresent Internet and the ubiquitous fax machine have made it
possible for large numbers of travel agents (and others) to work
from home.
</P>
<P>
   But the idea of signing up armies of travel agents, many of whom
will never set foot in a travel agency, is the brainchild of Warren
and his former roommate at American University, Michael Gross, also
31.
</P>
<P>
   In college, Warren majored in accounting and began using a
computer to find discount air fares and hotel rooms for personal
trips. As word got around among classmates, he found himself
selling bargain travel for students headed home for the holidays or
to spring break in Florida or the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   By booking the travel through a Boca Raton, Fla., agency that
his father used for business trips, Warren earned commissions. He
also learned his way around the arcana of the travel industry,
knowledge that proved invaluable three years later.
</P>
<P>
   After graduate school, Warren worked briefly for his father in
the steel business, but itched to become an entrepreneur. One day,
he called Gross, who had earned a law degree at American
University, and explained his idea of a travel agency with not just
a couple of independent agents sending them customers, but hundreds
or thousands of them. Gross came aboard.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   With a kitty of $8,000, raised by charging $4,000 each to their
credit cards, the new partners moved to Maitland, where the cost of
living is relatively low, and opened the business in a single small
room. Working the telephone themselves, they made cold calls and
fielded calls in response to ads they had placed in Florida
newspapers offering travel bargains and agents' credentials.
</P>
<P>
   They finished 1995, their first full year, with sales of $4
million. And they haven't looked back since.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our approach is to apply the 80-20 rule,'' Warren said. ``That
is, 20 percent of our people will account for 80 percent of the
business.'' As the company says in both its ads and its manual:
``You do the business. We do the work. You get paid.'' Almost as
often, it adds, ``But don't quit your day job.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Global Travel agents seem satisfied. None of them may be
close to selling the volume of travel that many traditional agents
sell. But collectively, they give Global the clout to forge the
travel business alliances _ ``preferred supplier relationships,''
in industry-speak _ that are enjoyed by the biggest agencies.
(After Hertz, the rental car giant, spurned an alliance with Global
Travel in the agency's early days, the company cried all the way to
the bank by making alliances with Avis and Dollar Rent a Car.)
</P>
<P>
   As a result of its alliances, Global's agents may pay as little
as $19 a night for a good hotel and $15 a day for a rental car with
unlimited mileage.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Heller, who owned a travel agency in Scranton, Pa., for 20
years before retiring to Scottsdale, Ariz., and becoming a Global
Travel agent, said the travel discounts that he and his clients
were offered routinely from Global were as good as the best deals
he used to get at his own agency.
</P>
<P>
   Derman, the Houston neurologist, said, ``I use my travel agent
card mostly for upgrades and discounts on hotels and rental cars,
and it works just fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Tennessee Williams' Blanche DuBois, Global Travel's
commission agents rarely have to depend on the kindness of
strangers. Global Travel's manual contains a reminder that ``ever
since the first Travel Agent set foot in the Land of Discounts,
stories have been passed down from generation to generation about
the `job perks' of being a travel agent, and it's true.''
</P>
<P>
   Global's agents around the country range from those who couldn't
care less about making a sale, except for their personal travel, to
a sprinkling of those like Richard A. Weaver in Springhill, Fla., a
retired Commerce Department employee, who has put together several
large groups of friends and acquaintances to take cruises to Europe
or the Caribbean, and has four more groups signed up for next year.
</P>
<P>
   But such examples do not dampen industry criticism of Global's
definition of a travel agent. ``Most of these people would like to
believe they're travel agents, but they're not _ they're just
referring business to a travel agency,'' said Mike Pingrey, the
owner of ACT Travel in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Some travel businesses have a different view.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of their strengths is that unlike a lot of other agencies,
their agents on commission and those on salaries are not trying to
be all things to all people,'' said Bob Blumberg, vice president
for sales at Club Med, to which Global Travel steers a lot of
business.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a big account for Amadeus, the computerized
reservation system. Doug Fogwell, its vice president for sales and
marketing, said Global Travel is ``a very exciting, very innovative
customer.''
</P>
<P>
   And not all traditional travel agents are hostile. John Hawks,
president of the Association of Retail Travel Agents, said Global
Travel was both legitimate and good for the industry. ``People in
our industry have tended to blackball anyone who doesn't do
business the way it's always been done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The petition that the Federal Trade Commission denied last year
sought a rule that effectively would have forbidden issuing travel
agent credentials to anyone who had not sold travel services in the
immediate past.
</P>
<P>
   And the National Advertising Division of the Council of Better
Business Bureaus, after being asked to investigate the claims in a
Global Travel ad published in The Wall Street Journal, determined
last November that Global Travel had provided a reasonable basis to
support its claims about the benefits of enrolling with it as an
independent travel agency.
</P>
<P>
   So Global Travel remains a threat to the 275,000 travel agents
currently registered with the International Airlines Travel Agents
Network, known as Iatan, said Michael Maino, the organization's
president. Iatan's ID card is widely accepted as the industry
standard. Almost 48,000 Iatan agents are not on any travel agency's
payroll, though they presumably still sell enough travel to meet
the group's standards.
</P>
<P>
   To qualify for registration and for the Iatan card, which is
accepted for discounts and other perks by numerous airlines, cruise
lines and hotels, travel agents must earn at least $5,000 a year in
commissions or salary, and must spend a minimum of 20 hours a week
selling or promoting travel.
</P>
<P>
   There are no reliable statistics on how many independent agents
are in the business solely or largely for the perks. But the ranks
of such people, whom other agents dismiss as ``would-be agents'' or
``order takers,'' are growing in response to Global Travel and a
handful of other companies that have followed its lead.
</P>
<P>
   Global Travel is by far the biggest of the bunch, in no small
part because of its ads in newspapers, trade publications and, for
the past few months, on radio stations in New York, Chicago, Los
Angeles, Seattle, Miami and Tampa, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To become one of Global's agents, applicants fill out a simple
form that requires little more than name, address, Social Security
number and credit card information for paying the fee. Global
Travel then returns a 77-page reference manual and, soon
thereafter, a Global Travel agent identification card. The new
agent is immediately eligible for discounts and upgrades on hotel
rooms, car rentals and cruise ships.
</P>
<P>
   Most airlines, however, require an Iatan card before they give
travel-agent discounts _ a fact that is noted in Global Travel's
manual, though not in its ads. The manual also says that to earn
the $5,000 in commissions required by Iatan, the agent will need
``about $80,000 to $100,000 in travel sales.''
</P>
<P>
   Few of Global's agents, however, regret that they do not qualify
for airlines' travel-agent discounts, which are usually 75 percent
of the full coach fare. An example shows why: The current
round-trip full coach fare between New York and Los Angeles is just
over $2,000, meaning that the agent would pay just over $500. But
many advance-purchase fares, available to anyone, are already lower
than that.
</P>
<P>
   A list of Global Travel's top-producing agencies, provided by
the company, reveals that only four have earned more than $5,000 in
commissions so far this year _ roughly 1 in 6,500. (The commission
figures do not include the reward for signing up friends equally
desirous of becoming travel agents _ and willing to pay the initial
fee and the annual renewal.)
</P>
<P>
   And the list of top producers includes only individuals, not the
many businesses that Global Travel said had signed up through its
business development department.
</P>
<P>
   When asked the names of the ``national law firms'' and ``Fortune
500 companies'' handled by Global Travel, as its manual asserts,
Warren said it should have said members of those firms, adding that
he ordered a correction in subsequent editions.
</P>
<P>
   Global Travel apparently does handle many satisfied companies,
among them Automotive Marketing Services of Cornelius, N.C., a
suburb of Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've saved an enormous amount of money with them, somewhere
in the tens of thousands of dollars,'' said Peter Bond, founder of
that auto consulting business, whose 400 employees and consultants
are often on the road teaching independent auto dealers how to run
their businesses more effectively.
</P>
<P>
   He was drawn to Global Travel a few years ago, he said, after
seeing its ad in The Robb Report, a monthly magazine for the rich _
and those aspiring to become rich. Once Bond signed up as an agent,
his company began saving on hotels and car rentals, so Bond put his
entire sales staff and consultants on his account.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every one of our people are using the card,'' Bond said.
``They'd be foolish not to.''
</P>
<P>
   So what does the future hold for Global Travel?
</P>
<P>
   Despite widespread criticism of its fees by traditional agents
and the American Society of Travel Agents, Global Travel appears
unlikely to do away with them. ``They help pay for the newspaper
ads and our costly infrastructure, including a
three-quarter-of-a-million-dollar Lucent call center system,''
Warren said. ``By charging fees, we'll be able to keep providing
new and better services, and be able to deliver 110 percent of
exactly what we promised the customer. And if people pay, they're
more likely to commit to us.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, he said, the annual renewal rate is more than 90
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The fees are unlikely to rise, though, because a fee of $500 or
higher would bring the company under laws governing franchises _
the very thought of which is enough to invite angina in both
partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every state would have jurisdiction,'' Warren said, ``and it
would be way too cumbersome.''
</P>
<P>
   Expansion is more like it. Gross, Global Travel's president,
said the company was considering various options. Among them, he
said, ``going public is definitely in our future and something
we're currently considering.''
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, the company's sights remain fixed on American Express,
the industry giant, and rivals like Travelocity, owned by AMR's
Sabre Group, and Microsoft's Expedia, travel companies that have
also broken with tradition and have made use of the Internet. While
respectful of their competitors, the partners do not appear
fearful.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trick is to find opportunity by taking advantage of the
future,'' Warren said. ``While some agencies are still thinking
about brick and mortar, we're already a click-and-mortar agency.''

 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Brian Jordan had just finished taking batting practice
Friday afternoon at Turner Field, and he was engulfed by a swarm of
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   He was giving all the stock answers yes, I'm excited to be in my
first World Series, oh sure, the New York Yankees are a good team,
etc., etc. when someone wondered if the Yankees' gallant World
Series comeback against the Atlanta Braves in 1996 would have a
carryover effect on his team.
</P>
<P>
   He shook his head firmly.
</P>
<P>
   ``No way... this is a different year and the Braves are a
different ball club,'' said the Braves' RBI-producing right
fielder, a one-time Atlanta Falcon starting safety who's been given
credit for instilling a toughness in an Atlanta team that lacked
such a quality in previous seasons. ``I just know I wasn't with the
Braves in 1996. What happened in the past won't affect us now. We
respect the Yankees. But we don't fear anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   It's fitting that the Yankees, who have won 25 world
championships during the 20th century, will close out the
millennium in another World Series.
</P>
<P>
   It's also fitting that the Braves, who have won eight straight
division titles, five National League pennants and one world title
this decade, will be making an appearance in this sacred October
event.
</P>
<P>
   It's not surprising that these two organizations are meeting
again in the World Series, inasmuch as their owners, the Braves'
Ted Turner and the Yankees' George Steinbrenner, have spent huge
amounts of money to stock their teams with a gaggle of high-priced
personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Jordan is right when he says this is a different Braves
team than the one that three years ago lost four straight World
Series games against the Yankees after opening with two victories.
</P>
<P>
   This Braves team that commences proceedings tonight against the
Yankees at Turner Field has had to endure the loss of two of its
top batsmen, Andres Galarraga (diagnosed with cancer) and Javy
Lopez (knee injury), and also had to withstand a bruising playoff
challenge from the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   This Braves team has displayed a stubborn resolve that was
conspicuously missing from those recent ones who were known to fold
up under duress.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the wary hunch here is that Yankees once again will
emerge victorious and earn their third world championship in four
years against a Braves team determined to claim that
media-instigated Team of the 90s designation.
</P>
<P>
   While the current Yankees didn't come close to matching the
achievements of last year's club that won 125 games and established
a legacy of greatness, they still affect an aura of cool
self-confidence and matchless poise.
</P>
<P>
   While the current Yankees had several uncharacteristically dark
stretches during the past summer, they have been performing at peak
efficiency during the playoffs, sweeping the Texas Rangers in three
games and then winning four of five against the Boston Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   While the current Yankees don't have a MVP candidate like a
Chipper Jones, they do have the same cast intact that cut a
frightening swath across the baseball landscape in 1998 with names
like Derek Jeter, Paul O'Neill, Tino Martinez, Bernie Williams,
Scott Brosius, Chuck Knoblauch, Orlando (El Duque) Hernandez,
Mariano Rivera, David Cone and Andy Pettitte.
</P>
<P>
   Oh yes, they also have a newcomer, chap named Roger Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   It won't be easy for the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves aren't the San Diego Padres, who surrendered meekly
to the Yankees a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   This won't be a four-game wipeout.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is important is that we win,'' says the Braves' veteran
coach, Pat Corrales, who sits next to the team's manager, Bobby
Cox, during games. ``Anything less, and we won't be satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   The same, of course, goes for the Yankees, who have more good
hitters in their lineup and also have slightly superior depth with
people like Chili Davis, Darryl Strawberry, Jim Lyritz, Chad Curtis
and Luis Sojo all available for pinch-hit duties at Turner Field
where the DH won't be used.
</P>
<P>
   As the Houston Astros, the Mets and every other team in the
National League can attest, the Braves' starting pitchers Tom
Glavine, who opens tonight, five-time Cy Young Award winner Greg
Maddux, John Smoltz and Kevin Millwood can be stifling. And the
same goes for their relievers like John Rocker and Mike Remlinger.
</P>
<P>
   It's doubtful the Yankees will score many runs few teams ever do
against the Braves and the Mets' nine-run Tuesday night explosion
was an aberration but it's doubtful the Braves will, either.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have two extraordinary hitters in Jones and Jordan,
but most of their others never will be threats for batting honors,
notwithstanding Eddie Perez's robust, series-MVP hitting against
the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   As difficult as it will be for the Yankees to manufacture hits,
it might even be more difficult for the Braves, especially against
Hernandez, the Yankees' starter tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being with the Yankees less than two years, El Duque
already has proven to be one of his sport's prime big-game
pitchers, as he showed a year ago when he shut down a Cleveland
team that had taken a 2-1 ALCS lead against the Yankees, as he
showed against the Padres in the World Series, as he showed against
both the Rangers and Red Sox in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   The wily Cuban exile throws a variety of pitches from a variety
of angles, none of which affords opposing hitters clean cuts at the
ball.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte and Cone both have histories of performing
exceptionally well in high profile games. And the other Yankee
starter, Roger Clemens, is one of the most dominating pitchers in
baseball if he pitches like Roger Clemens instead of like that
impostor who embarrassed himself a week ago against the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   John Rocker might be receiving all the publicity because of his
stalwart work against the Mets and his feud with their fans but the
Yankees have the top reliever in the game in Mariano Rivera.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams are solid defensively, although with notable
exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch, a one-time Golden Glover with the Minnesota Twins,
has become a liability at second base because of his erratic throws
and the Braves' first baseman against righthanded pitchers, Ryan
Klesko, has a knack for turning every fielding play into a wild
adventure.
</P>
<P>
   As for the teams' field commanders, Bobby Cox has been
celebrated in baseball lore for past World Series blunders, but he
has managed flawlessly this season so far.
</P>
<P>
   I still don't know if Joe Torre can manage or not he was fired
by the Mets, Braves and St. Louis Cardinals but he certainly seems
to be able to pull all the proper levers on a team brimming with
talent.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees work counts deftly, deliver hits when needed most,
don't make mistakes and know what it takes to win games, traits
possessed by their championship predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   The storied lineage favors the Yankees, and they should close
out business in six memorable games.

(Editors: Note time element, meeting on Saturday) 
(ko) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two months ago, the Rev. Jerry Falwell, well known for
conservative political and theological views, took the unusual step
of agreeing with the Rev. Mel White, a supporter of gay rights, to
convene a meeting bringing together 200 of each man's associates.
</P>
<P>
   The goal was simple: a civil exchange of views between two
groups that disagree profoundly over gay rights in church and
state. The two ministers also promised to avoid harsh language on
the issue in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting is to take place Saturday at Falwell's Thomas Road
Baptist Church in Lynchburg, Va. It has generated controversy for
weeks, with plans for protests by some gay rights supporters, who
say nothing can be gained from meeting with Falwell, and by some
gay rights opponents.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Falwell said he thought the gathering
significant for its occurring at all, for the fact that
conservative evangelicals who believe homosexual activity a grave
sin would break bread with gay men, lesbians and their supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``To my knowledge, it's never happened before,'' he said, adding
that the occasion was so historic it would be ``remembered in the
same way the formation of Moral Majority is remembered.'' That was
Falwell's political organization, founded in 1979, a highly visible
effort to persuade religious conservatives to take part in
politics.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Falwell wrote an autobiography, using a ghost
writer recommended by his publisher. The writer was White, a former
seminary professor and, at the time, a married man. Six years ago
White declared that he is gay and said he had come to terms with
that after a long struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he has met with Falwell twice, most recently in
August, when he complained that language about homosexuals in
fund-raising letters from Falwell's organizations was so harsh that
it could provoke antigay violence. Falwell, in turn, said he had
been a target of aggressive, threatening language, some of it from
gay groups.
</P>
<P>
   The 90-minute meeting, to begin at 4 p.m., will be closed to the
press but will be followed by a news conference. Falwell said he
would affirm at the meeting that neither he nor his associates
would ever change their view that the Bible makes homosexual
activity wrong, or ever support legal recognition of same-sex
unions.
</P>
<P>
   But although he said he did not believe that language from his
ministry had contributed to violence against homosexuals, he
acknowledged White's criticism that the language had sometimes been
strident.
</P>
<P>
   ``We plead guilty to that, and we will try to do better,'' he
said, ``and I will use what influence I have across the evangelical
landscape'' to encourage others to do likewise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Christians believe the gay life style is wrong,'' Falwell
said. But ``we've got to, in the next century, make the world
believe we love the sinner more than we hate the sin.''
</P>
<P>
   White, ordained but not a church pastor, is chairman of
Soulforce, a group devoted to nonviolent action to advance gay
rights. In an interview, he said Falwell would ``set the pace''
Saturday by speaking first.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he's going to say we're sinners,'' White said. ``And
that's what we disagree on. But what we agree on is, this
conversation has gotten out of hand.''
</P>
<P>
   White said he would respond by maintaining that his sexuality
was a gift from God. And others in his group will also speak:
parents and friends of homosexuals, gay men and lesbians
themselves, a few of them graduates of Liberty University, where
Falwell is chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all loved Liberty,'' White said, ``and they're going to
say, `Jerry, you gave us a great education.'''
</P>
<P>
   Both men said they hoped protests would not overshadow the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``My prayer,'' Falwell said, ``is the good thing that's
happening inside the building will not be lost outside on the
sidewalks.''
</P>
<P>
   PAPER ON ANTIGAY VIOLENCE
</P>
<P>
   While the Falwell-White meeting has been in the works, another
initiative, to rally religious voices against antigay violence, has
been undertaken by Bishop Steven Charleston, president and dean of
Episcopal Divinity School in Cambridge, Mass. On Oct. 1, Charleston
wrote the Cambridge Accord, a statement to circulate among bishops
of Anglican churches around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The document has three points: that no gay person ``should ever
be deprived of liberty, personal property or civil rights because
of his or her sexual orientation,'' that an appeal to Christian
faith can never be used to justify such discrimination, or
violence, and that everyone is equal in God's sight and deserves
respect.
</P>
<P>
   As of Wednesday, nearly 80 bishops had signed the statement, the
best-known of them the retired archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond
Tutu.
</P>
<P>
   The document is posted on the Web site of the divinity school,
www.episdivschool.org.

 &HT;    Bush not missed at N.H. debate
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.H. _ The five men chasing the leader in the Republican
presidential race generally ignored the absent Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas on Friday in a lively televised debate, the first of the
2000 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who campaigned in New Hampshire earlier in the day, was in
Vermont for a GOP fund-raising event when the forum aired on New
Hampshire Public Television and C-SPAN.
</P>
<P>
   He has no plans to schedule debates until December, saying
voters are not yet paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative activist Gary Bauer was the only candidate to
mention Bush by name. And Bauer talked about Bush only when the
moderator, Cokie Roberts of ABC News, brought up Bush's comments
about the Senate vote Thursday to ban certain late-term abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Bush agreed with the Senate vote, but said that people should be
allowed to disagree on abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush's comment was nonsensical,'' said Bauer, a
strong foe of abortion rights. ``I wish he were here so we could
talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   After the hourlong debate, however, most of the candidates
showed no such restraint. ``The fact that George Bush wasn't here
is an insult to the voters of New Hampshire,'' said publisher Steve
Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   ``An incredible insult,'' Bauer chimed in.
</P>
<P>
   Only Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), running second to Bush and
seeking middle ground in an effort to attract independent voters in
New Hampshire, took a softer approach. ``I'm sure Governor Bush
will be joining us'' at future debates, McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   The first meeting was a civil affair, each candidate laying out
basic campaign themes and not facing follow-up questions.
</P>
<P>
   They all criticized the Clinton administration's foreign policy.
McCain described a ``feckless, photo op'' foreign policy that too
easily sends U.S. forces into action.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes and Alan Keyes, the former U.S. diplomat, charged that
Clinton has cut deals with corrupt regimes in Russia and China.
Bauer and Keyes also called for restricting trade with China.
</P>
<P>
   McCain talked repeatedly about ridding Washington of ``special
interests'' by reforming the campaign finance system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington is gridlocked by special interests,'' he said in
answer to a question on health care. ``Why do you think it is we
couldn't give patients some fundamental rights. The Democrats are
in the grip of the trial lawyers, and Republicans are in the grip
of the HMOs and insurance companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes offered his detail-oriented plan for ``putting America on
a true path to prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   In third place in polls here, Forbes touted his plan to impose a
flat 17 percent tax on income, allow Americans to invest their
Social Security taxes in the stock market, and cap government
spending.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer, who jabbed at Forbes in their battle to appeal to social
and religious conservatives, said his flat tax proposal is fairer
to working families than is Forbes'.
</P>
<P>
   And Bauer also prominently mentioned that he ``spent eight years
serving Ronald Reagan,'' part of his claim to Reagan's mantle.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes said that Republicans who campaign on economic proposals
would not persuade Americans to put a Republican in the White House
during the current economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do face a serious crisis,'' Keyes said. ``It's a moral
crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), who does not register in polls in New
Hampshire, talked about his Senate experience and took partial
credit for children's health care initiatives and the defeat of
Soviet forces in Afghanistan in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said he ``convinced'' President Reagan to send Stinger
missiles to Afghan fighters.

MINUS BUSH, GOP HOPEFULS KICK OFF DEBATES IN NEW HAMPSHIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the first televised debate of the 2000 presidential campaign,
five Republican candidates excoriated President Clinton on Friday
night for his stewardship of foreign policy and virtually ignored
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the front-runner who did not take
part.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates, appearing at the University of New Hampshire in
Durham, needled one another on health care, abortion and relations
with China. But there were no raised voices in the hourlong session
as the contenders, sitting casually in a semicircle, offered mostly
like-minded prescriptions on education, taxes, trade and moral
values.
</P>
<P>
   The sharpest words were saved for a politician who will not even
be on the ballot next year: Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``This administration has conducted a feckless photo-op foreign
policy which may cost us in American blood and treasure in the next
century,'' said Sen. John McCain of Arizona. ``This administration
has failed to understand that we have to have a concept of what we
want the world to look like, where our threats and our interests
and our values lie.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, the wealthy publisher, joined in the attack,
declaring that the Clinton administration was ``adrift, indecisive
and just making plain bad judgments.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You see it in Russia,'' Forbes said, ``where we are today
subsidizing by giving billions that these kleptocrats in the
Kremlin steal, subsidizing a new system of serfdom in Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, clearly referring to Clinton, said,
``One thing I do believe is that our president of the United States
should run our foreign policy, and not the United Nations.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary L. Bauer, a conservative leader, upbraided the
administration, accusing it of having weakened the military.
``Reagan had to spend a lot of time rebuilding the American
military because of the neglect of previous presidents,'' Bauer
said. ``And I'm afraid the next president is going to have to do
the same because of the neglect of Bill Clinton and Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   And Alan Keyes, a former State Department official, said, ``We
should not follow the Clinton administration in the surrender of
American sovereignty.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate, sponsored by New Hampshire Public Television, New
England Cable News and The Union Leader of Manchester, offered
viewers the chance to see all but one member of the newly shrunken
field before live cameras for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Elizabeth Dole withdrew from the race. Pat
Buchanan, who on Monday is expected to announce that he will leave
the Republican Party to seek the Reform Party nomination, did not
participate either.
</P>
<P>
   The event was broadcast live nationally on C-Span as well as in
New Hampshire by the state's public television station.
</P>
<P>
   This state is expected to hold the first primary on Feb. 1.
Surveys have shown for months that Bush has a commanding lead in
the state, although McCain has gained ground in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's name was not even uttered until more than 50 minutes into
the program when the moderator, Cokie Roberts of ABC News, asked
the candidates about remarks by the governor on abortion. Bush, who
said he could not participate because he was committed to an
appearance in Vermont, said he agreed with Senate Republicans in
prohibiting certain late-term abortions, but said that people
should be allowed to disagree on abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush's comment is nonsensical, in all due respect to
him,'' Bauer said. ``I wish he was here so we could talk to him
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, saying there was ``too much polarization,'' was not as
blunt as others in denouncing abortion. ``We need to talk about
many ways that we can work together, both pro-life and pro-choice
people who share the goal of eliminating abortion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The contenders who were on stage did jostle over a few issues,
including whether the United States should repeal
most-favored-nation status for China because of human rights
abuses. Bauer, who was the most aggressive in taking on his
opponents, made clear he was for repeal, then turned to Forbes and
said, ``Steve, would you repeal most-favored-nation status for
China or not?''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes sidestepped the question, saying he supported measures
that would let the Chinese know ``that if they make mistakes, if
they do something wrong, there will be consequences to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   That response did not satisfy Keyes, who also favors repeal. He
interjected, ``We just need a clear answer to that very simple
question.''
</P>
<P>
   After Forbes complained that Americans were losing control of
their decisions on medical care to the government and to health
maintenance organizations, Bauer said, ``Steve, that sounded real
good, but we've got to go beyond generalities.''
</P>
<P>
   Chiding some of his opponents for their positions on health
maintenance organizations, Bauer said, ``I can't believe there were
some in my party that thought it was a wise move to come out
against my 76-year-old mother being about to deal with that HMO
bureaucracy.''
</P>
<P>
   To that, McCain responded: ``Washington is gridlocked by special
interests. Gary, why do you think it is that we couldn't give
patients some fundamental rights?'' He added that, ``The
Republicans are in the grip of the HMOs and the insurance companies
and their huge six- and seven-figure donations.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch quickly upbraided McCain, saying, ``I just don't agree
with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Keyes also attacked McCain for not speaking more forcefully when
he said he favored the abolishment of Roe vs. Wade, the Supreme
Court decision legalizing abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the way, senator,'' Keyes said, ``I think the abolition of
Roe vs. Wade would deserve a little louder affirmation than that.''

EDITORIAL: THE PRESS WINS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, October
23: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit in
the case of Food Lion vs. ABC properly preserves the right of the
press to report truthful information. First Amendment principles
require that a plaintiff like Food Lion suing for libel prove that
the news report was false and was made with actual malice. The
court wisely says that the plaintiff cannot get around this high
standard of proof in trying to recover defamation-like damages by
relying on other charges.
</P>
<P>
   The case arose after ABC's ``Primetime Live'' program broadcast
a report showing that stores in the Food Lion supermarket chain
repackaged and sold spoiled meat and fish. Food Lion sued ABC on
grounds of fraud, breach of loyalty and trespass because two ABC
reporters had lied to get jobs with Food Lion in order to videotape
food-handling practices at the stores.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of suing for libel, Food Lion sued ABC for the way it
had gathered the news. The lawsuit did not challenge the truth of
the report, but focused on the actions of reporters. A federal jury
in 1997 awarded Food Lion $5.5 million in punitive damages, and
$1,402 in actual damages. That punitive award was slashed to
$315,000 by the district court.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate court has now reversed the verdict, ruling that
Food Lion did not prove all the elements of a fraud claim. Since
the punitive damages were awarded based on fraud, it threw out
those damages as well. That left only $2 in damages awarded against
the two undercover reporters for trespass and breach of loyalty to
Food Lion.
</P>
<P>
   Food Lion had sought to use its tort claims to recover damages
related to its reputation, such as loss of good will and sales,
from the broadcast. But the court ruled that such a strategy would
be an impermissible end-run around First Amendment requirements for
libel suits.

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 224. PLEASE
NOTE: THERE IS NO ATTENDANCE CHART WASHINGTON, Oct. 22 -- The
following chart shows how senators and representatives voted on key
bills and amendments within the last week. A ``Y'' means the member
voted for the measure; an ``N'' means the member voted against the
measure; a ``?'' means the member did not vote; and a ``P'' means
the member voted ``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: REFORM1
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Tuesday failed to pass a measure that would have
revamped the campaign finance system. Voting 52-48, the measure
failed to garner the 60 votes necessary to overcome a filibuster.
The measure would ban the use of so-called soft money, regulate ads
sponsored by advocacy groups that target specific candidates and
strengthen disclosure requirements. Supporters said the current
system gives special interest groups too much power and should be
reformed. Opponents said the bill would violate the right to free
speech and limit participation in the political process. A ``yes''
vote favors the measure.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: REFORM2
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Tuesday failed to pass a scaled-back measure to
reform campaign finance laws. Voting 53-47, the bill failed to
garner the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster. The measure
would ban so-called soft money contributions to political parties.
Supporters said limiting the large and unregulated donations to
political parties was at least a start in the reform process.
Opponents said the measure was a violation of free speech and would
limit participation in the political process. A ``yes'' vote favors
the bill.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: ABORTION1
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday approved, 51 to 47, a bill to endorse the
1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing abortions. The nonbinding
measure calls the Roe v. Wade decision ``an important
constitutional right'' that should not be overturned. Supporters
said the bill would protect the right to have an abortion.
Opponents said abortion was wrong and that the vote was just an
attempt to divert attention away from the debate over a bill to ban
``partial-birth'' abortions. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   4) BILL NUMBER: ABORTION2
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday approved, 63 to 34, a bill to ban
``partial-birth'' abortions. The measure makes late-term abortions
illegal, but did not get the two-thirds support it would need to
override a veto promised by President Clinton. Supporters said
partial-birth abortions are equivalent to ``infanticide.''
Opponents said the bill violates a woman's constitutional right to
have an abortion. A ``yes'' votes favors the bill.

   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: COMMERCE
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday passed, 215-213, a spending measure that
funds the departments of Commerce, Justice and State. Supporters of
the $37 billion measure said the bill adequately funds those
departments. Opponents said it should have included funding for a
program to hire more police officers and lacks language regarding
hate crimes. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: EDUCATION1
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday approved, 311-111, a measure that
restores a program to ensure gender equality in schools. Supporters
said girls need to be encouraged to take more science and math
classes. Opponents said the measure was unnecessary because gender
equality had already been achieved. A ``yes'' vote favors the
measure.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: EDUCATION2
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday rejected, 166-257, an amendment to spend
$100 million a year on vouchers that students in struggling public
schools could use to pay for tuition at private schools. Supporters
said the bill would help students whose schools are deemed to be
``disasters''. Opponents said it would divert funding from public
to private schools. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   4) BILL NUMBER: EDUCATION3

   The House on Thursday approved, 213-208, a compromise bill to
form a pilot program that would allow ten states to pool targeted
federal funds into one block grant. Supporters, many of whom had
wanted the bill to include all 50 states, said states should have
more power when making education decisions. Opponents feared the
bill would enable states to divert federal help from disadvantaged
students. A ``yes'' vote favors the measure.

UNVERIFIED ACCOUNT SPAWNED MANY NEWS REPORTS
</HEADLINE>
  (af)  
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An old allegation about George W. Bush, recycled by anonymous
sources in a book that has been withdrawn by its publisher, was
widely reported last week, even by news organizations whose
reporters had long since decided that the rumor was probably false.
</P>
<P>
   Day by day, more news organizations published accounts of the
old rumor that in 1972 Bush was arrested for cocaine possession and
that there was a coverup involving Bush's father, former President
George Bush. Some played their accounts prominently, others buried
them deep within political reports printed on inside pages, and
virtually all included denials from the candidate or his campaign
spokesmen.
</P>
<P>
   But in the fast-changing ecosystem of the news business, an
anonymously sourced account about the leading Republican
presidential contender lived as a news item. Denials, first by the
Bush campaign and later by the former president, made some editors
judge the allegations more newsworthy, not less.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the online magazine Salon started things off with a
report, flagged on its front page, on the book, ``Fortunate Son:
George W. Bush and the Making of an American President,'' by J.H.
Hatfield. The magazine's editor, David Talbot, said it was
newsworthy to report something that St. Martin's Press, which he
described as a reputable New York publisher, had been willing to
print. Acknowledging that the allegations had circulated for months
without proof, he said, ``The fact they put it between hard covers
made it news.''
</P>
<P>
   That same day, the candidate denied the rumor at a campaign stop
in Phoenix. The denial became the springboard for reports by The
Associated Press, CBS Radio News, The Arizona Republic, The Dallas
Morning News, The New York Post and The Washington Times.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Wilk, the managing editor of The Dallas Morning News,
said that the details had been published in another report on an
inside page.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why go with the denial? It was out there,'' Wilk said. ``We
gave him an opportunity to respond. He chose to respond. I think we
should pass that along to readers. But we make judgments every day
where things go and where in the body of a story the statement
goes. And that tells the reader something.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, there was another denial _ this one by former
President Bush, who called the rumor ``a vicious lie.''
</P>
<P>
   This led to brief news accounts in The Washington Post, The Los
Angeles Times, The Atlanta Constitution and The St. Louis Post
Dispatch.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson Diehl, The Washington Post's assistant managing editor
for national news, said Friday that Post reporters had looked into
the rumors early in the week and that they had failed to check out.
But when the former president issued his statement, Diehl said, the
action was unusual enough to be newsworthy.
</P>
<P>
   Diehl said, ``You don't want to publish a denial that only has
the effect of publicizing allegations that you think have no basis.
That's why we didn't do anything with reporting Monday. Sometimes
other people or things or events make it news that has to be
reported.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Salon _ whose initial report about the allegations
was still posted on line _ began publishing skeptical pieces about
St. Martin's Press. Talbot said that whatever relevant facts or
context were missing from the earlier article were available in the
later coverage.
</P>
<P>
   But it was The Dallas Morning News that revealed that a man
convicted in 1988 of solicitation of capital murder, a man who had
served five years in prison in Texas, bore the same name _ James H.
Hatfield _ as the book's author, had a biography that matched the
author's and was under the supervision of a parole agency in
Arkansas, where the author now lives.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, News editors posted this report on the
newspaper's Web site. On Thursday, St. Martin's Press announced it
would suspend promotion and distribution of the book.
</P>
<P>
   The accounts of the publisher's decision were displayed more
prominently, in most cases, than any earlier reports. The New York
Times displayed its report _ its first to mention the allegations _
on the front page on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Times, which had spent several days investigating the
rumors, held off printing anything until the action by St.
Martin's. Bill Keller, the managing editor, said Friday: ``Without
verification, why would we want to traffic in unsubstantiated
charges? Once you've made that decision _ the fact that either Bush
or his father is forced by the dynamics of the campaign to deny
it'' is not an occasion to report it.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by St. Martin's, Keller said, changed the picture.
``The publishing house suspended publication of a book because of
these disclosures about the author. That made for a pretty
interesting story. It would be hard to tell that story without
saying what was in the book that made it so controversial. But in
that context it is easier'' to highlight the flimsiness of the
charges, he said.

EDITORIAL: THE KLAN LOSES FIRST AMENDMENT DECISIONS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, October
23: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Friday's decision by a federal appellate panel upholding New
York City's right to forbid masked Ku Klux Klan members to stage a
rally Saturday in lower Manhattan was a legal victory for Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani but a low moment for the First Amendment and a
city that prizes freedom of expression. Few would quarrel with
Giuliani's depiction of the Klan as a ``disgusting, horrible
organization that represents the very worst of American history.''
</P>
<P>
   But when the city is allowed to selectively target the
free-speech rights of a deservedly unpopular group like the Klan,
it diminishes the rights of everyone.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the three-judge appeals panel overturned
Thursday's ruling by two district judges that rebuffed the city's
attempt to block the ``white pride'' rally. The city had cited a
rarely invoked provision of the state penal code that makes it
unlawful to be masked or disguised in a public place except in
connection with a masquerade party and with the permission of city
officials. The Police Department refused to permit the rally if
Klan members insisted on wearing their traditional masks, saying it
would make it hard to identify people in the event of violence.
</P>
<P>
   No testimony suggested that Klan members were likely to engage
in violence. But the lower court recognized that the Klan's
fearsome masks _ themselves a form of symbolic hate speech _ afford
members protection against threats of physical and economic
retaliation for their views.
</P>
<P>
   In its reversal, the appeals panel said the city was not trying
to bar the rally because of the Klan's views but merely enforcing
an existing state law. That interpretation conveniently ignored the
city's selective invocation of the anti-masking provision. It also
raced past a line of Supreme Court cases protecting the anonymous
speech of pariah groups, and other federal court rulings tossing
out similar anti-mask provisions on First Amendment grounds.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, October
23: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Further evidence of a real contest for the Democratic
presidential nomination, if any were needed, can be found in the
fact that both Vice President Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley are
moving aggressively to lay out specific policy positions on various
issues. This is a positive development. In the early stages of a
campaign, candidates tend to narrow the field of fire by avoiding
detailed agendas and sticking with safe generalizations. For
different reasons _ Bradley because he wants greater credibility
and Gore because he needs greater traction _ neither man has that
luxury.
</P>
<P>
   Both have offered prescriptions for improving the health care
system. On Thursday, Bradley offered some bold ideas on poverty
while Gore risked the wrath of the oil companies with a challenging
proposal on offshore drilling.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's antipoverty program aims to reduce the number of
children below the poverty line, now 13.5 million, by half over the
next eight years. The plan would cost about $10 billion a year, and
for the most part would involve strengthening existing programs
like the earned income tax credit, Head Start and the minimum wage.
Gore has strongly supported many of these same strategies. The real
contest now will be to see who can better impress upon the voters
the moral need to address this critical problem.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, meanwhile, returned to one of his signature issues, the
environment, with a promise to ban any new drilling for oil and gas
along the Florida coasts. Like Bradley's poverty proposal, this one
builds on previous actions. Former President Bush and President
Clinton both imposed moratoriums on new drilling leases off the
Florida and California coasts. Gore would go beyond that to prevent
drilling by companies that already hold leases potentially worth
billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   This will almost certainly bring legal action from the
companies, and at the very least will cost the federal government
money if it has to buy back leases. Nevertheless, Gore's proposal
is one more important step in the continuing effort to repair the
destructive legacy of the Reagan years, when James Watt, the
secretary of the interior, handed out offshore drilling leases like
peanuts.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is designed to reassure those environmental groups
that feel Gore lost some of his enthusiasm for their cause during
the Clinton years. It is also likely to force Bradley to be more
precise about his own environmental agenda beyond his general
remarks in New York on Tuesday. His voting record in Congress has
pleased environmentalists, but only occasionally has he assumed a
leadership role. This is what campaigns are supposed to do _ force
candidates into a clearer definition of themselves and their
beliefs.

JOAO CABRAL, 79, UNFLINCHINGLY VISUAL POET  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Joao Cabral de Melo Neto, one of the
century's most distinguished and influential poets in the
Portuguese language, died here on Oct. 9 after a long illness. He
was 79.
</P>
<P>
   In a career that spanned more than 50 years and inspired two
generations of younger Brazilian writers, Cabral earned a
reputation as a cerebral, even difficult writer who in collections
like ``The Dog Without Feathers'' and ``Museum of Everything''
demonstrated an unflinching, cinematic eye but showed little
patience with romanticism or sentimentality. ``To me, poetry is
something that is built, like a house,'' he once said.
</P>
<P>
   Cabral's poetry never became widely known in the
English-speaking world, though the Wesleyan Press published an
anthology, ``Selected Poetry, 1937-1990,'' in 1995. But he had many
admirers among his American colleagues, including W.S. Merwin, who
translated several of his poems, and Elizabeth Bishop, who lived in
Brazil for many years and came to know him and his work well.
</P>
<P>
   In ``An Anthology of Twentieth-Century Brazilian Poetry,'' which
she edited with Emanuel Brasil, Ms. Bishop described Cabral as
Brazil's ``most important poet of the postwar generation.'' His
``work displays the highest development and the greatest coherency
of style of any Brazilian poet,'' she wrote, characterized by
``striking visual imagery and an insistent use of concrete, tactile
nouns.''
</P>
<P>
   Among his countrymen, Cabral's most popular work was undoubtedly
``The Death and Life of Severino,'' which describes the desolate
existence of a peasant from the poor northeastern region where
Cabral himself was born and raised. Ms. Bishop rendered one moving
passage into English this way:
</P>
<P>
   We are exactly alike: exactly the same big head
</P>
<P>
   That's hard to balance properly,
</P>
<P>
   The same swollen belly on the same skinny legs,
</P>
<P>
   Alike because the blood we use has little color.
</P>
<P>
   And if we Severinos are all the same in life,
</P>
<P>
   We die the same death, the same Severino death.
</P>
<P>
   Cabral liked to say that ``The Death and Life of Severino'' was
one of his weaker works because it was written in a hurry, at the
request of a producer seeking a text for a Christmas festival in
1954. But millions of Brazilians can recite at least some of the
verses of the poem, which was also transformed into a play, put to
music by the composer Chico Buarque de Hollanda, filmed in 1977
and, more recently, made into a television drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no other work that reaches these heights,'' the actor
Paulo Autran, who performed in an early theater version, said after
Cabral's death. ``It is of a social, literary and poetic content
that no other author has ever reached. It is a terrible social
indictment, but at the same time, poetry of the highest level.''
</P>
<P>
   Cabral was born on Jan. 9, 1920, into a distinguished family in
the city of Recife: his cousins included Manuel Bandeira, also a
well-known poet, and the sociologist Gilberto Freyre. He moved to
Rio de Janeiro, then the nation's capital, in 1940 and published
his first collection of poems, ``Stone of Slumber,'' at his own
expense in 1942.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Latin American intellectuals of his generation, Cabral
was unable to earn a living from his writings, which included
occasional essays as well as a score of collections of poems.
Instead he entered the Brazilian diplomatic service in 1945,
serving in posts on four continents until his retirement in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   As a young vice consul stationed in Barcelona in the late
1940's, Cabral became a friend of the Catalan painter Joan Miro.
The two collaborated on a book about the artist, now a much-valued
collector's item in the Ibero-American world, with Cabral supplying
the text and Miro contributing whimsical engravings.
</P>
<P>
   In 1952, while serving in London, Cabral was summoned back to
Brazil on suspicion of communist sympathies and suspended from
duty. But a supreme court ruling two years later restored him to
the civil service, and he eventually rose to the rank of
ambassador, serving in Senegal, Ecuador and Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   A complete edition of Cabral's poems was published here in 1994.
But in recent years he had become nearly blind and had stopped
writing, complaining that ``I cannot separate my poetry from visual
perception.''
</P>
<P>
   Cabral's first wife, Stella, died in 1986. He is survived by his
wife, the poet Marly de Oliveira; five children from his first
marriage, Rodrigo, Luiz, Isabel, Inez and Joao, and two
stepdaughters, Monica and Patricia.

6,000 U.N PEACEKEEPERS TO BE SENT TO SIERRA LEONE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The Security Council voted Friday to send a
6,000-member peacekeeping force to Sierra Leone, where an uneasy
coalition of elected officials and former rebels has pledged to
restore order after the latest round of a civil war.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main tasks of the peacekeepers will be to collect
weapons from rebel factions and help reintegrate their forces,
numbering up to 45,000, into society. They will also be responsible
for protecting relief workers and for the distribution of aid in a
shattered country.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. force will operate with troops from a West African
peacekeeping unit that is dominated by Nigerians, who have given
mixed signals about how long they want to stay but seem likely to
form the major part of the new operation.
</P>
<P>
   Which other countries may contribute personnel has not been
decided, but the United States will be asked to pay one-third the
costs.
</P>
<P>
   With approval of a U.N. force of 10,000 for East Timor also
expected in the next few days, the issue of money has become more
acute. The United States is in arrears on its dues by hundreds of
millions of dollars, and there is less and less support in Congress
to pay the ever-rising bill.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate action Friday, the Security Council extended for a
month the term of a smaller operation in the Central African
Republic, where President Ange-Felix Patasse began a second term in
office amid continued political tensions. The country has been
unstable for decades.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council, preoccupied with crises in the Balkans and
East Timor, has been under pressure from African nations and other
countries to pay more attention to Africa, with greater priority
given to the war centered in Congo, which has involved more than
half a dozen nations in shifting alliances.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, the United Nations may have to set up a
substantial peacekeeping operation in Congo. But officials here,
who have so far sent only liaison officers to neighboring countries
of Congo, say there has to be a durable truce first.
</P>
<P>
   In Sierra Leone, rebels who fought the government of President
Ahmad Tejan Kabbah have been responsible for brutal acts of
violence. The rebels chopped off the hands or legs of thousands of
civilians, including many children, as warnings or punishment.
Thousands of others have died, and half a million people were
driven from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   To reach a peace agreement with two competing rebel leaders,
Foday Sankoh and Johnny Paul Koroma, Kabbah agreed to give them
amnesty and positions in government, a move that was sharply
criticized by human rights groups. Secretary-General Kofi Annan was
among those expressing reservations about the deal struck with the
rebels, which was signed July 7.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, in a speech to the Security Council, Richard
Holbrooke, the U.S. representative, said Washington had offered to
help Sierra Leone establish a truth and reconciliation commission
to deal with past atrocities. ``Like the secretary-general,'' he
said, ``we are concerned by the provisions for amnesty. We remain
committed to justice and accountability.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright visited Sierra Leone this
week and discussed the next steps in restoring order with both the
government and rebel leaders. She described what she saw as
``unspeakable horror.''
</P>
<P>
   American officials and diplomats from other nations say the
Kabbah government had no choice but to accept rebel demands for a
share in power after Nigeria, which restored the president to power
nine months after he was overthrown and then kept the rebels at
bay, said it was uncertain about how long it could continue its
role. No other nation, African or otherwise, volunteered to take on
the job of keeping order.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution passed Friday gives the force a six-month initial
mandate, but is renewable. It requires that the peacekeeping force
sent to Sierra Leone include ``personnel with appropriate training
in international humanitarian, human rights and refugee law,
including child and gender-related provisions.''

IN MIAMI, AN EARLIER PARALLEL TO BROOKLYN MUSEUM CONTROVERSY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MIREYA NAVARRO    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Several years ago, an art museum here challenged the
sensibilities of the community. Much uproar ensued. The mayor and
city commissioners reacted by trying to cancel the museum's lease.
The museum went to court, and won. The First Amendment prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the Brooklyn Museum of Art in its current battle
with New York's mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, might take comfort from
the tale of the victory of the Cuban Museum of Arts and Culture
over the city of Miami in 1991. But a closer look at the Miami
dispute, which foreshadowed the Brooklyn case in many ways,
provides a different perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years later, the Miami museum is out of business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody closed their doors to us,'' said Ramon Cernuda, a
book publisher and art collector who served on the museum's board
for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The museum languished like a wounded animal for many years.
Eventually, they succeeded in crushing us,'' he said, referring to
the museum's opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the stated religious basis of the objections against the
Brooklyn Museum of Art's ``Sensation'' exhibition, the controversy
here revolved around politics. It began in 1988, when the Cuban
museum, devoted to preserving the cultural heritage of a people
divided by Cold War politics, held a fund-raising auction that
included the paintings of artists who lived in Cuba or had not
criticized the Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
   The auction provoked a commotion among Cuban exiles here and
divided the museum's board of directors between those who viewed
the artists as representatives of the Communist leader of Cuba,
Fidel Castro, and those who argued for tolerance and artistic
freedom. The auction took place, but emotions were at such a high
pitch that one protester bought one of the Cuban paintings for $500
and then proceeded to set it on fire on a Miami street.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy raged for the next three years, leading to the
resignation of more than a dozen museum trustees, two pipe bomb
explosions (one at the museum, the other under the car of a museum
official), numerous city investigations and three city audits of
museum finances. Finally, Miami officials began eviction
proceedings, claiming that the museum, housed in a former Little
Havana firehouse since 1982, had violated its $1-a-year lease by
selling artwork on its premises.
</P>
<P>
   The museum sued. It alleged that the city's real motivation was
its objections to the exhibiting and auctioning of Cuban works of
art, and contended that the city was violating the museum's First
Amendment rights. In a May 1991 decision, Judge James Lawrence King
of U.S. District Court agreed and stopped the eviction, ruling that
``the First Amendment must assure that government does not curtail
valid expression because a majority, a plurality, or any segment of
its constituency wishes to prohibit or penalize that expression.''
</P>
<P>
   Lorna Bade Goodman, a spokeswoman for the New York City Law
Department, said New York officials were not worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``That case is only a lower-court case,'' she said. ``That
decision does not bind the courts up here.''
</P>
<P>
   But Floyd Abrams, the First Amendment lawyer who is representing
the Brooklyn Museum of Art in its lawsuit against New York City,
called the Miami case central to the New York dispute and said it
was of immense ``persuasive value at the district level and on any
appeals.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In both cases you have a city responding to art of which it
disapproves by seeking to punish the museum that displayed it,'' he
said. ``The cases are very close.''
</P>
<P>
   Any legal parallels notwithstanding, the two museums were in
vastly different positions and ran different risks when controversy
befell them, several former officials of the Cuban museum said.
With a $23 million annual budget and a world-class collection that
ranges from ancient Egyptian art to American paintings spanning
several centuries, the Brooklyn Museum of Art, they say, will
surely survive its current turmoil. Although New York City has
withdrawn financing from the museum and has threatened to cancel
its lease, polls show solid support for the institution, which
dates to the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Cuban museum, which was founded in 1973 to
showcase Cuban culture only, counted on an annual budget of about
$200,000, drawn mostly from the state of Florida and Cuban-American
companies. Its actions were deemed offensive by a powerful segment
of the population _ the conservative exiles who have made Miami
home for the 40 years since the Cuban revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The case here prompted no international debate, no solidarity
statements from other arts organizations, the former trustees said.
The public rejection was so extensive, they said, that most funding
sources dried up and the museum limped along, first with grants
from the Ford Foundation, and later with donations from its
directors, who eventually narrowed the museum's scope to exile
artists only and changed its name to the Cuban Museum of the
Americas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The museum never recovered from the controversy,'' said Jose
Alonso, an art dealer who served on the museum's last board. ``It
had the stigma of being politically incorrect. We tried to
fund-raise and I had people on the phone calling me a Communist.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the hostilities, however, the Cuban museum managed to
survive until this year, when news that Miami had placed the museum
building on a list of properties it could sell to resolve a
municipal financial crisis prompted museum directors to explore
their options. In June, they decided to donate the museum's
500-piece collection of original artwork and historical memorabilia
to the University of Miami's Lowe Art Museum.
</P>
<P>
   (Miami officials, as it turned out, kept the property and have
turned it into a community service center. Laura Billberry, Miami's
asset management director, said city officials decided to hold onto
it because the city had achieved financial stability before a sale
was necessary.)
</P>
<P>
   Former trustees insist that the museum was not the building but
the collection, and said they were optimistic that it could now
thrive under the aegis of a bigger cultural institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be a healthy Cuban Museum of the Americas,''
said Maria C. del Valle, a real estate and art lawyer here who
served on the museum's last board, which is now an advisory group
to the Lowe Art Museum.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The fate of freedom of artistic expression in Miami, however, is
less certain. Today, violence, protests and verbal attacks still
greet some of the few Cuban artists who risk coming here. Michael
Spring, executive director of the Miami-Dade County Department of
Cultural Affairs, said most Miami art institutions did not sponsor
the work of artists who are still in Cuba out of both sensitivity
and fear to offend.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``The psychological and real wounds of Cuban exiles here in
Miami are still so fresh that artistic decision-making takes that
into account,'' he said. But he added, ``If you're trying to build
an audience for the arts, you're certainly not going to program
against the grain as a practical matter.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Local laws also make it difficult for a cultural institution to
stray. A county law prohibits the county and any county-funded
institution from doing business with anyone who does business with
Cuba. That includes recipients of cultural grants. The local law is
more stringent than federal law, which exempts informational
material like books, records and paintings from restrictions
imposed by the American economic embargo of Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   But there has been improvement, said Cernuda, the former Cuban
museum trustee. Los Van Van, Cuba's most popular dance band, has
been able to perform here despite large protests, he said, and
private galleries sell and exhibit Cuban paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the works of Manuel Mendive, the Cuban artist
whose painting was burned in 1988 by a protester, were sold at a
Coral Gables gallery without incident, Cernuda noted. ``We started
this work of presenting artistic expressions without censorship,''
Cernuda said. ``Back then it was considered crazy. Today, there's a
segment wide enough so that these expressions can't be censored.
That was won in the battle of 1989 to 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost because the institution couldn't survive, but we
contributed to creating a climate of artistic freedom.''

BRUINS SET FOR DREADED SPREAD ATTACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORVALLIS, Ore. _ Technically, Oregon State's offense is called
the spread because its numerous wide receivers spread the defense
from sideline to sideline. But for UCLA's purposes, the spread
could be called the dread.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins (3-4, 1-3) couldn't have asked for a tougher matchup
today in their showdown to avoid last place in the Pacific-10.
They've lost three of their past four games, their confidence is so
thin it's transparent, they haven't won on the road this season and
they must win three of their final four to qualify for a bowl game.
</P>
<P>
   All that, and now their porous pass-defense faces the No.1
passing attack in the Pac-10 and the No.2 total offense  &UR; !ital! &LR; in
the nation.!off! Thanks to new coach Dennis Erickson and his spread
offense, the once-lowly Beavers are averaging 489 yards per game,
including 327 through the air.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's defensive deficiencies are well-documented.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a team's in the spread and you miss an arm tackle, the
guy can go for 10 yards,'' said Bruins coach Bob Toledo, whose team
has missed an arm tackle or 20 this season. ``This will be a real
challenge for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The spread offense, which uses four- and five-receiver
formations, was created 30 years ago by Granada Hills High coach
Jack Neumeier to help his struggling team compete against bigger
and faster opponents. It remained obscure until Cal State
Northridge coach Jack Elway copied it at Cal State Northridge and
later San Jose State. (Elway's son, John, played for Neumeier at
Granada Hills.)
</P>
<P>
   Elway hired Erickson to coach offense at San Jose State, and
Erickson has preached the spread ever since _ at Idaho and
Washington State, Miami and Oregon State. Most Pac-10 teams use it
for third-and-long situations, but only Oregon State and Washington
State base their playbooks on it. The Beavers use the spread on
second-and-four, third-and-two, whatever.
</P>
<P>
   The system uses two formations _ four receivers and one running
back, or five receivers and no running backs _ and it's designed to
create numeric mismatches.
</P>
<P>
   If the defense has six players assigned to pass coverage and
five to the run (one defender for each offensive lineman), the
Beavers use tailback Ken Simonton, who's averaging 151 yards per
game, tops in the Pac-10 and fifth in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   If the defense commits six players to the run and five to the
pass, then several receivers have one-on-one matchups with
cornerbacks. It's little wonder quarterback Jonathan Smith is
second in the Pac-10 in passing (277 yards per game).
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have just five (players committed to run defense),
they'll kill you with the running game,'' Bruins defensive
coordinator Bob Field said. ``You have to have one more guy to stop
the run than they have (blocking for it). But once you do that, you
limit your pass-coverage options.''
</P>
<P>
   The spread will prevent UCLA from playing its base defense (four
linemen, three linebackers, four defensive backs) and force the
Bruins into pass-oriented formations.
</P>
<P>
   They'll use one linebacker (true freshman Marcus Reese) with
five or six defensive backs, and that's when the trouble starts.
UCLA's cornerbacks and safeties have blown coverages and missed
tackles for two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way (the Beavers) isolate you with the spread,'' Toledo
said, ``it really makes you defend differently, and it makes you
coach differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the way UCLA's secondary has performed, maybe
different is better.

BIG GAINS BY GRAMM IN DILUTING LENDING ACT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Texas)   (af)  
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Community-lending advocates and banking industry officials found
one thing to agree on Friday about the rewrite of the Community
Reinvestment Act: It is not going to improve lending in poor
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   After long negotiations on legislation to overhaul the nation's
financial services laws, Senate Republicans and the Clinton
administration resolved their differences early Friday over whether
to strengthen or weaken the law involving lending to minorities and
others denied credit.
</P>
<P>
   The law's chief critic, Sen. Phil Gramm, R.-Texas, appeared to
get much of what he wanted. Gramm not only secured reductions in
how often small banks would have to face compliance examinations,
but he also won a provision requiring his ideological adversaries,
the community advocacy groups, to disclose how much they receive
from reinvestment agreements with banks.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm has said the groups use these agreements to ``extort''
money from banks by dropping objections to mergers or expansions in
exchange for payments. Community groups say that the agreements are
an important part of insuring better access to credit in poor areas
and that fewer banks will agree to them if the details have to be
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, a provision trumpeted by the Clinton
administration failed to impress many low-income-lending advocates.
The administration, which had threatened to veto any measure that
weakened the community lending law, inserted language barring
institutions from expanding or buying an insurer, brokerage firm or
bank unless all their affiliated lending institutions have
satisfactory ratings on fair lending. Clinton said the new
provisions will ``promote continued investment in America's
communities.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics pointed out that the deal includes no penalties for
banks that fail to maintain satisfactory grades. Moreover, they
said, the forces that have lobbied hardest for the bill are among
the biggest lending institutions in the country, and they almost
never receive unsatisfactory community-lending ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``In their desire to please the financial industry, the
administration has agreed to substantially reduce the impact of
CRA,'' said Chris Saffert, a legislative representative for the
Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now. ``Phil Gramm
completely walked over the administration. And for them to be
saying this is a good bill is a poor reflection on their
priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal struck Friday also allows banks with less than $250
million in assets to undergo a community-lending compliance
examination once every five years if their last exam resulted in an
``outstanding'' grade, and every four years if they last scored
``satisfactory.'' Under current law, examinations are required
every 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Community groups expressed concern, saying that this change
would allow many institutions to finesse the examination process by
sloughing off community-reinvestment loans in most years, as long
as they take them seriously in the period leading up to an
examination.
</P>
<P>
   John Henneberger, director of the Texas Low Income Housing
Information Service, said a study of 89 Texas banks that failed
exams from 1990 to 1995 found that 87 had less than $250 million in
assets. But he said the study also showed that most of those
quickly improved their lending practices after their bad ratings,
demonstrating that vigilant oversight of small banks is effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Communities that rely exclusively on small banks to provide
mortgage credit are having the same hard time as inner-city
folks,'' Henneberger said. ``The numbers are very close.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Scurlock, executive vice president of the Independent
Bankers Association of Texas, said the changes would not hurt
small-town lending. The study's findings are not surprising, he
said, given that more than 90 percent of Texas banks have less than
$250 million in assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overwhelming majority of community banks do a very
credible job of serving their community,'' he said, ``which has a
direct relationship to the well-being of banks over the long
term.''

LOIS CHAPTER 11 SIGNALS A SHIFT IN AD INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An era may be coming to an end in New York
advertising. George Lois, the colorful, outspoken art director who
has created some of the best-known campaigns of the last four
decades, has filed for bankruptcy for his agency company, Lois/USA.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of several big accounts was a primary cause of the
filing. Lois/USA had about 280 employees handling accounts with
billings estimated at $303.6 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Lois, who began his advertising career in 1956 after working as
a designer, was one of the foremost figures in advertising's
so-called creative revolution in the 1960s and '70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad day, but I've had a helluva career,'' Lois,
co-chairman and co-chief executive at Lois/USA, said in a telephone
interview Friday from his office in midtown Manhattan. ``I've done
the kind of work I've wanted to do for 40 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision by executives of Lois/USA to file for Chapter 11
protection in U.S. Bankruptcy Court on Wednesday is indicative of
the intensifying competitive pressures in the advertising industry.
In the past, agencies that lost large clients could retrench,
regroup and recover. But that has become increasingly difficult in
recent years, as shown by the swift closings of agencies like
Smith/Greenland; Geer, DuBois, and Ally &AMP; Gargano.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old days, I could go to the media and work it out,''
Lois said, referring to the companies to which Lois/USA owed money
for commercial time and ad space. ``Not now.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a petition filed in Manhattan, Lois/USA, which also
has offices in Los Angeles, Chicago, Dallas, Houston and Austin,
Texas, has assets of almost $57.7 million but liabilities of almost
$72 million.
</P>
<P>
   A ``deepening liquidity crisis'' brought on by a change in
lenders and the sudden and unexpected loss of certain key clients
forced the bankruptcy, according to the petition filed on behalf of
Lois/USA by the law firm of Togut, Segal &AMP; Segal.
</P>
<P>
   Trade publications had reported financial problems at the Lois
Chicago operations, which lost accounts from Corona beer, local
Chevrolet dealers and two big drug chains, Osco and Sav-on.
</P>
<P>
   Operations have been suspended in Chicago and New York, Lois
said, adding that a small agency in Los Angeles is remaining in
business. The bankruptcy court has been asked to approve a deal to
sell back the Texas operation, known as Fogarty Klein &AMP; Partners,
to the managers there who sold it to Lois/USA in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Lois, who is 68, contributed to the famous Volkswagen Beetle
campaign at Doyle Dane Bernbach and was later involved with
landmark ads for products like Wolfschmidt vodka, Naugahyde and
Coty cosmetics at his own agency, Papert, Koenig, Lois. He also
designed many famous covers for Esquire magazine in the late '60s
and early '70s.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Lois helped popularize the cry ``I want my MTV!'' for the
cable music channel and gathered a gang of nonsinging celebrities
to warble, ``I read it every day'' for USA Today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm taking it on the chin,'' Lois said, ``but I've had worse
days.''

SHRUNKEN SPLINTERED KLAN STILL LURES DISAFFECTED 
</HEADLINE>
  (Editors: Note time element, Saturday rally 
(ko) 
 By DAN BARRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two years ago and at the behest of some new friends,
James W. Sheeley left the upstate home he shares with his mother
and twin brother and drove eight hours to western Pennsylvania.
There, a large cross in flames melted away his life's frustrations,
and he knew what he wanted to be.
</P>
<P>
   His search had ended. No longer would Sheeley, a 46-year-old
employee of a small computer-services company, have to hunt the
Internet for an organization that understood the root of his pain:
that ``other groups are encouraged to have pride, but not whites.''
The Church of the American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan understood;
so did its imperial wizard, a bearded, chain-smoking,
barrel-chested convicted felon named Jeffery L. Berry.
</P>
<P>
   Now Sheeley is a member of the fastest-growing Klan faction in
the country _ a growth measured in tens, not thousands _ as well as
being its grand dragon for the realm of New York and New Jersey.
Although his attendant duties of letter-writing and recruitment may
carry no more glamour than those of a Kiwanis official, he revels
in his position of authority.
</P>
<P>
   At a Klan rally scheduled for Saturday in lower Manhattan, which
Klan members say will be the first in the city, Sheeley's
hood-and-robe set will be distinguished from the simple white of
others by the green cape draped across his back, the green stripes
on his sleeves, and the various patches that signal his elevated
role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah, I have very high status,'' he said. ``When I go to
these events, they know who I am.'' (Nonmembers may know, too,
since a federal appeals court on Friday denied Sheeley and his
colleagues the right to wear masks.)
</P>
<P>
   It seems that everybody knows the Ku Klux Klan. A distinctly
American white-separatist organization, its membership soared into
the millions in the early 1920s, with strong local followings in
Yonkers, southwestern Connecticut and Long Island. Today's
permutation of the Klan finds its members, estimated by analysts to
be fewer than 4,000, struggling to outdo other separatist groups
like the Aryan Nation and Christian Identity in provocative
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   And by no means do its members present a united front. Various
factions have splintered from other factions, sometimes for reasons
as basic as some grand dragon yearning to be called imperial
wizard.
</P>
<P>
   The Anti-Defamation League, the Southern Poverty Law Center and
other organizations that monitor the Klan say that in recent years
a schism has formed over a movement toward a more sophisticated
Klan, once personified by former Klan leader David Duke of
Louisiana. ``This group is trying to present the new Klan, in
three-piece suits and focusing on white rights, instead of using
racial epithets,'' said Gail Gans, who tracks the Klan for the
Anti-Defamation League.
</P>
<P>
   But that position, which critics say is merely racism wrapped in
politically correct language, offends members who like their
crosses in flames, their epithets in plain words and their T-shirts
adorned with racist cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of Thom Robb, a Klan leader in Arkansas who
advocates an end to wearing hoods and robes in public, except on
rare occasions. The defection from his organization was so great
that, Ms. Gans said, only 31 people showed up for his group's
annual Christmas party last year. ``As far as the robe's concerned,
we're trying to reach people in the general population,'' Robb
said. ``If the racial movement doesn't like that, that's too bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing in contrast to Robb is Sheeley's mentor, Berry, of
Indiana. Berry has fully embraced the use of racist literature, the
taunting rallies that flirt with violence, and the wearing of hoods
and robes.
</P>
<P>
   Berry, who is 46, likes to quote Rodney King's plea that people
get along with one another, and describes himself as a ``white
civil-rights leader.'' Although he did not return calls seeking
comment, he has said in the past that he holds no malice in his
heart, only a desire to celebrate his heritage.
</P>
<P>
   To the Anti-Defamation League, however, Berry impeaches that
position almost every time he speaks at one of his many rallies.
Last October, for example, he traveled to Jasper, Texas, after the
arrests of three white men charged with killing a black man by
tying him to their truck and dragging him for two miles. In a
speech laced with racial epithets, he declared his hatred for
blacks and Jews and challenged blacks to describe ``one thing your
race has accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   Without the distinction of leading a small Klan group, Berry
might be just another troublemaker in the Indiana county of DeKalb,
officials there say. ``I've spent more time than I'd want to on
him,'' said Monte Brown, the county prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   There have been repeated police visits to Berry's neighborhood,
where he and his neighbors have swapped complaints of gunshots,
bomb explosions and physical confrontations. He was also convicted
several years ago of a felony charge involving a car-repair scam,
Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   But as a Klan leader, Berry has become a person of some
notoriety, juggling requests for interviews, boasting on ``The
Jerry Springer Show'' and traveling around the country in his role
as smiling provocateur _ even though he is estimated to have only a
few hundred active followers. (Berry, like most Klan members,
declines to provide membership figures.)
</P>
<P>
   Analysts acknowledge the temptation to see the Klan of the late
1990's as pathetic, almost funny; Berry, for example, occasionally
publishes a newsletter called Thoughts Under the Hood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tempting to treat them as a joke,'' said Chip Berlet,
senior analyst at Political Research Associates, a nonprofit
institution in Somerville, Mass. ``But they'll be back. You have to
assume that there's always going to be these groups, and you have
to stand up to them even if they appear to be in a period of
collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheeley, a grand dragon but nevertheless a relative neophyte in
the world of the Klan, has a much more benign interpretation. He
said his 82-year-old mother, Edith, and his twin brother, John, had
no problem with his avocation because ``they know I wouldn't belong
to an organization that's illegal or violent.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, his association with the Klan forced him to resign in
1997 from the state Department of Corrections, where he had spent
18 years working first as a clerk and then as an inmate counselor.
He stepped down after an internal investigation found that he had
Ku Klux Klan magazines and other white-supremacist literature.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about hate,'' he said of the Klan. ``It was the idea
that I was frustrated to see that whites have no rights. Other
groups are encouraged to have pride, but not whites. And that
irritated me. I looked around for white organizations to join, and
I kept coming back to the Klan.''
</P>
<P>
   And to Berry. On Thursday afternoon, the two men walked into a
federal courtroom together to hear arguments on their plans for a
rally. Sheeley, a wisp of a man with tinted glasses, seemed even
smaller alongside his imperial wizard.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a man I like, admire and respect very much,'' the grand
dragon said. ``He's Mr. Klan as far as we're concerned.''

   Hughes wrote 12 books _ six on intellectual and cultural
history, two general histories, three collections of essays, and an
autobiography. Six remain in print.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, as a history professor at Harvard University,
Hughes spoke out for nuclear disarmament and against American
military involvement in Vietnam. He was co-chairman with Dr.
Benjamin Spock of the National Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy,
and later was chairman of the organization.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, the Federal Bureau of Investigation asked the State
Department to have its embassies monitor his activities while he
was in Europe on a sabbatical. His case helped bring that practice
to public attention and prompted the department to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   He was a native of New York and a grandson of the former Chief
Justice Charles Evans Hughes. Hughes, whose first name was Henry,
graduated summa cum laude from Amherst College in 1937 and received
a Ph.D. in history from Harvard in 1940. He also studied at the
universities of Heidelberg and Munich.
</P>
<P>
   In World War II, Hughes served in the Army and was discharged in
1946 as a lieutenant colonel in the Office of Strategic Services.
After two years as chief of research for Europe at the State
Department, he returned to Harvard to teach.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes was Gurney professor of history and political science
until 1975, when he joined the San Diego faculty. He assumed
emeritus status in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife of 35 years, Professor Judith Markham
Hughes; their son, David M., of Berkeley, Calif.; a daughter and
son from a previous marriage, Sandra L. Hughes, of Chevy Chase,
Md., and Kenneth S., of Arlington, Va.; and five grandchildren.
Hughes' previous marriage, to the former Suzanne Rufenacht, ended
in divorce.

A LOT OF ATTENTION FOR A SMALL EL AL PLANE DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Airbus Industrie released blueprints for a synagogue
in the sky: a converted business-class lounge, complete with ark
and Torah.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, not known as a patron of the arts here, helped haul in
64 tons of Alaskan ice for a Seattle sculptor's installation at
Jerusalem's city gates.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, European ambassadors and American cabinet
members were button-holing Israeli officials, promoting the
purported advantages of the Airbus 340 over the Boeing 777, or vice
versa, and hinting at diplomatic consequences should the sale go
the wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   Flying synagogues and melting arctic ice cubes are two of the
more visible products of a yearlong public relations battle between
the world's dominant aircraft manufacturers, which are vying to
supply Israel's national airline with its next generation of
midsize jets.
</P>
<P>
   But when El Al's board meets Monday to award the contract, it is
the invisible but palpable pressure from the United States and the
European Union that may prove decisive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a campaign that clearly has a political aspect,'' said
Alan Dupiech, an Airbus spokesman. ``There is strong political
pressure in Israel from the U.S., but for the first time there is
nearly an equal response from Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   The competitors acknowledge that their aggressive campaigns here
are disproportionate to the sale's size: El Al is deciding between
three B-777s and two A330s and two A340s, an approximately $400
million order that would expand its long-range fleet by 900 to
1,000 seats. Airbus and Boeing fill contracts on that scale almost
every month.
</P>
<P>
   But for both companies, Israel and its airline are a powerful
symbol.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's dependence on American military and economic help has
made it loath to place big aircraft orders anywhere except the
United States. El Al is one of the few remaining all-Boeing
international airlines, and Boeing wants to keep it that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had more high-level executive visits per potential
airplane sold than in any sales campaign ever,'' one Boeing
executive said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has also had more high-level Washington help than usual
for a three-jet contract. Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers
raised the issue with Israel's finance minister, and Commerce
Secretary William M. Daley pressed Boeing's case here this month
with Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody likes to lose competition because it fuels the next
deal,'' Daley said. ``You get on a roll. Boeing was on that roll
for a long time, with no competition, or very little from Airbus.
Airbus is now a very real, serious competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's fear, and Airbus' hope, is that an El Al contract would
give Airbus bragging rights in a midsize market that is expected to
double from 1,500 jets now to 3,000 in two decades. If Airbus can
sell here, it reasons, it can sell anywhere, because of a
perception that Israel would buy European jets only if they were
clearly superior, technically and economically.
</P>
<P>
   For Boeing, though, the American connection is more carrot than
stick. In one pointed display of its resources, Boeing senior
executives were holding a weekend meeting with Israeli military
industry leaders to discuss new contracts with local
subcontractors, which already total $150 million yearly _ much of
it financed by United States military appropriations.
</P>
<P>
   John Leahy, the executive vice president in charge of commercial
sales for Airbus Industrie, lashed out on Tuesday at what he called
unfair support for Boeing from the United States. But the Europeans
have applied leverage of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the French, German, British and European Union
ambassadors to Israel trooped into the office of Industry and Trade
Minister Ran Cohen to make their own pitch for Airbus. After
expressing hope that the sale would be ``independent of political
considerations,'' the ambassadors promised that an Airbus order
``would undoubtedly lead to more extensive Israeli-European
cooperation in the sphere of aeronautics,'' according to a ministry
account of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   That promise is tempting. Airbus, based in Toulouse, France, is
controlled by the newly merged military giants Aerospatiale of
France and DaimlerChrysler Aerospace of Germany, in partnership
with British Aerospace and Construcciones Aeronauticas of Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's competitive but small state-run aeronautics industry
has been seeking European supply deals and technological
partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three or four planes is not a huge thing, but collaboration
with a $10-billion-plus program certainly is,'' one Airbus
executive said.
</P>
<P>
   After listening, Cohen told the four diplomats what almost
nobody here believes: Israel's government ``is not involved in the
independent El Al decision, which will be made exclusively on
economic and technical grounds.''
</P>
<P>
   As a state-owned airline with a board of political appointees,
it is difficult for El Al not to be perceived as a division of the
government. Officials here worry openly about the repercussions on
Capitol Hill if El Al were to spend $400 million on European
aircraft at a time when Israel is lobbying for a special $1.2
billion congressional appropriation to cover the costs of
withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus also worries about Washington. In 1997, after an advisory
committee urged El Al to buy the midrange Airbus 320 instead of the
Boeing 737, El Al's board rejected the recommendation and opted for
Boeing planes instead.
</P>
<P>
   To seal the deal, Boeing cut its price by 6 percent, a discount
Airbus said it never had a chance to match. ``Two years ago we were
defeated at the ultimate minute by a decision that was hard for us
to understand,'' Dupiech said this week. ``Even if we lose this one
due to politics, we will know that we tried.''
</P>
<P>
   Trying to debunk the notion of an all-American company fighting
a wholly European competitor, Airbus says it provides more than
100,000 jobs in the United States. ``Israelis say they have to back
United States industry, but 40 percent of the content of the A340
is American,'' Dupiech said. Besides, he said, ``If American and
United can buy Airbus, why can't El Al?''
</P>
<P>
   In their final presentations to El Al this week, the main
battleground was price. Though neither company would disclose its
terms, company officials agreed privately that on a per-passenger
basis, the four Airbus jets were cheaper than the three Boeing
planes.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has countered with a proposal to guarantee discounted
prices now for future El Al purchases, and has argued that keeping
the fleet homogeneous will bring additional savings in training and
maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take every customer seriously,'' said Jim Frank, the Boeing
salesman responsible for trying to secure the deal, ``but when a
customer is using only Boeing equipment, it takes on a higher level
of importance.''

WILMA CURLEY, 62, BALLET AND BROADWAY DANCER  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Wilma Curley, a ballet and Broadway dancer who became
noted for restaging works by Jerome Robbins, died on Oct. 16 at St.
Luke's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 62 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was liver failure, said the dancer Christian Holder, a
friend.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Curley was born in Brooklyn and trained in dance at the New
York City Ballet-affiliated School of American Ballet. She
performed with City Ballet from 1944 to 1957 and toured with
Robbins' Ballets: U.S.A. from 1958 to 1961. Ms. Curley created
roles in Robbins' ``Concert,'' ``New York Export: Op. Jazz'' and
``Moves'' and John Butler's ``Unicorn, the Gorgon and the
Manticore.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Robbins' favorite dancers, Ms. Curley helped the
choreographer with revivals of his dances and later became known
herself for restaging his ballets for companies that included
American Ballet Theater, City Ballet and the Joffrey Ballet. Ms.
Curley was best known for her stylish, vibrant stagings of ``New
York Export: Op. Jazz.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what appealed to Jerry was that she was a very
unadorned dancer,'' Holder, whom Ms. Curley cast in Robbins ballets
at the Joffrey, said. ``She was pivotal in the creation of many of
those pieces, and so she was able to provide us with a
psychological blueprint of Robbins.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Curley also performed on Broadway in musicals, including ``I
Can Get It for You Wholesale'' and ``West Side Story,'' in which
she created the role of Graziella. She performed as a guest artist
at Radio City Music Hall, on the television shows of Ed Sullivan,
Perry Como and Garry Moore and in summer theater at Jones Beach.
Ms. Curley also choreographed dances for the Alabama State Ballet,
Harkness Ballet and Joffrey second company, for which she created
her best-known piece, a comic ballet called ``Mother's Mozart '73''
in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Curley's marriage to Pat Harrison ended in divorce. She is
survived by two sons, Timothy and Gene, both of Manhattan; two
sisters, Gail Clark of Cherry Hill, N.J., and Joan O'Brien, of
Nanuet, N.Y.; and two granddaughters.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Roscoe L. Egger Jr., a commissioner of the Internal Revenue
Service in the Reagan administration, died on Oct. 14 at the Mayo
Clinic in Rochester, Minn. He was 79 and lived in Green Valley,
Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   He died after angioplasty to open arteries in his heart, said
his wife, Betty.
</P>
<P>
   Egger headed the IRS from 1981 to 1986, a period of tumult at
the service. Its computers were dated; its budget was under fire;
the tax code was constantly being changed; and the number of
returns being filed was increasing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, Egger issued a rare apology to taxpayers after the
service lost hundreds of thousands of returns, some of which were
found in trash cans, and refunds were delayed because of computer
problems.
</P>
<P>
   In his last year in office, Egger secured money to upgrade the
agency's computer system. He also helped develop a sweeping tax law
that simplified the federal tax code and closed some loopholes.
</P>
<P>
   Roscoe Lynn Egger Jr. was born on Sept. 19, 1920, in Jackson,
Mich. He graduated from Indiana University and served in the Army
in World War II, receiving a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart. He
then earned a law degree from George Washington University.
</P>
<P>
   Egger went to work for the General Accounting Office and later
was a private tax accountant. He also practiced law for several
years before joining Price Waterhouse in 1956. He was head of the
firm's office of government services when he was nominated by
President Ronald Reagan to be commissioner. Egger was the second
certified public accountant to head the service.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to Price Waterhouse as a consultant after retiring
from the IRS in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife, Egger is survived by two daughters, Gabrielle
Shaykin of Westport, Conn., and Antoinette Taylor of Chevy Chase,
Md.; two stepdaughters, Cathe Schultz of Alexandria, Va., and
Martha Coutts of Burlingame, Calif.; a stepson, Steven Spear of
Centreville, Va.; two sisters, Gertrude Rigle of Jackson, and
Beatrice Luce of Bowling Green, Ohio; and seven grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   A story Egger often used to tell, about what he thought was
widespread noncompliance with the tax laws, became well known.
</P>
<P>
   Once, Egger said, while he was awaiting confirmation as tax
commissioner, he was in a taxi on his way to a make a speech, and
the driver began talking about the sagging economy, his rising
costs and byzantine taxi regulations.
</P>
<P>
   When Egger asked how he coped, the cabby confided that the only
way to make enough money was to cheat on his taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Egger said nothing; the poor cab driver, the commissioner
figured, would never have believed who his passenger was.

FINALLY, BRUINS' HOUSTON GETS TO SHOW WHAT HE CAN DO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORVALLIS, Ore. _ While teammates base their days on plays made
and effort given, UCLA safety Lovell Houston uses different
criteria. Can he walk without pain? Can he carry his books to
class? Should he prep for surgery?
</P>
<P>
   Houston, a freshman safety, will make the first start of his
career today against Oregon State's high-powered spread offense,
which is second in the nation in yards per game (489). But compared
to Houston's past 15 months, the spread's a cinch.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best I've felt since I've been here,'' he said.
``I'm finally ready to show I can play.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston, of Denver, was one of the top recruits in UCLA's
No.1-ranked class of 1998. He missed his first training camp
because of a strained thigh and was forced to redshirt. He had
surgery on one shoulder in October and surgery the other in
January, each the result of high school injuries. He missed spring
practice, arrived healthy for training camp '99, then strained the
same thigh in double days.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were days when it was really, really hard,'' he said.
``After the shoulder surgery, I could barely carry my books to
class. I didn't know if they'd heal right and if I'd be able to
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt good coming into fall camp, then I pulled my quad, and
that broke me down. I kept thinking, `This is finally supposed to
be my time.'''
</P>
<P>
   The thigh eventually healed and Houston became the Bruins' top
kickoff returner after his 95-yard touchdown return at Stanford.
This week, the coaches asked him to switch from reserve cornerback
to starting safety to replace inconsistent senior Eric Whitfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows how he's going to play,'' defensive coordinator Bob
Field said. ``He's young, and he's going to make mistakes. But he's
a good athlete, and against (the spread offense) he doesn't have
the usual range of responsibilities. He doesn't have to be as
involved with the running game as he would against a normal
offense.''
</P>
<P>
   New surface: The Beavers had the worst AstroTurf in the
Pacific-10 for years. Now, $1.2 million later, they might have the
best.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best turf I've been on,'' Beavers coach Dennis
Erickson said. ``We haven't lost any players (to turf-related
injuries). It's not like the old turf here.''
</P>
<P>
   Full squad: Despite a slew of injuries and illnesses, the Bruins
brought the league-maximum 60 players to Corvallis. The last two
spots went to walk-on tailback Mike Vanis and seldom-used safety
John Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Vanis, who weighs 170 pounds, practiced at fullback this week
because of injuries to the regulars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're as low (on manpower) as we've been since I've been
here,'' UCLA coach Bob Toledo said.

GIULIANI EMBRACES GOP, AND INDIANAPOLIS CANDIDATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ As part of his effort to cast himself as a
dutiful member of his party, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani campaigned here
Friday for the Republican candidate for mayor who is seeking the
seat held by the outgoing Republican incumbent. The current Mayor,
Stephen Goldsmith, is also the chief domestic policy adviser to
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani had never met or spoken to the Republican candidate,
Sue Anne Gilroy, before Friday, he praised her in a brief
endorsement speech at the City-County Building for her ``fiscal
responsibility'' and added that ``Sue Anne's background and public
career tell me she'll be a fine Mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gilroy, Indiana's secretary of state, is in a tight race
against Bart Peterson, a real estate developer and Democrat who was
the chief of staff to former Gov. Evan Bayh, who is now a U.S.
senator.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani reserved his most extravagant praise for Goldsmith, who
is not seeking re-election and intends to devote more time when he
leaves office to Bush's campaign for president.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said his appearance here was to ``repay a debt'' to
Goldsmith, who he said had helped him with ideas and policy after
Giuliani lost in his first race for mayor of New York City in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was kind enough to spend a lot of time with me,'' Giuliani
said, adding, ``Many of the ideas that we were able to put into
place in New York I can trace to what I learned from Steve.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldsmith, who like Giuliani is a favorite of the Manhattan
Institute, the conservative research group, has made a national
reputation for himself by privatizing city services.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who has never been forgiven by many prominent
Republicans for endorsing Mario Cuomo, a Democrat, for governor in
1994, has in recent months embraced his party as he prepares to run
against Hillary Rodham Clinton for the U.S. Senate next year.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 1, Giuliani endorsed Bush, whose extraordinarily
successful fund-raising operation could help Giuliani in his
pursuit of the $20 million he says he needs to run for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Goldsmith said he invited Giuliani about a month ago to appear
in Indianapolis.

 WHAT THE DESERVING DESERVE AND WHETHER THEY GET IT  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   (How to define and judge merit has been at the center of bitter
debates over college admissions and affirmative action. Reports
last month that the Educational Testing Service, creator of the
most widely used college entrance examinations, was considering a
program to identify disadvantaged students set off a whirl of
protest. The plan, labeled ``Strivers,'' has been shelved, but the
debate over merit continues. The New York Times asked educators how
they would define that elusive term. Times staff member Joyce
Jensen compiled their responses.)  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Merit is greatness cut down to size. Beauty and courage are
heroic feats, and fashionable ancestors are luck; but anyone can
achieve merit. The substitution of merit for approved bloodlines in
awarding prizes and building institutions was one of this nation's
most humane, democratic accomplishments. It is now unraveling.
</P>
<P>
   Different people admire different things _ which doesn't excuse
us from making judgments about merit. No responsible parent ever
says: ``In view of the philosophical difficulties, the idea of good
behavior is hereby abolished and my children are invited to do
whatever they feel like. And the weaker ones are advised to take
out accident insurance immediately.'' Recognizing merit is a moral
obligation of parenthood, and also of intellectual life. We have a
duty to seek out future Shakespeares (even future Thurbers!) and
urge them on. We make mistakes; ``merit'' is no infallible Sherpa
guide to intellectual life. But it's the only guide we have.
</P>
<P>
   _ David Gelernter, a writer who teaches at Yale University.
</P>
<P>
   When Boston College, the Boston Celtics and Bank Boston pick new
recruits ``on the merits,'' they invariably choose very different
people. Why? Because the three organizations have very different
objectives. What choosing ``on the merits'' means is picking the
people who will help most to fulfill the legitimate purposes of the
institution.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to college admissions, grades and test scores help
predict which students will succeed academically (although not as
reliably as many people think). But grades and scores say little
about which applicants will best fulfill other important aims of a
college such as contributing to the education of their classmates
or to the welfare of society following graduation. That is why
colleges take many other characteristics into account.
</P>
<P>
   Race is such a characteristic, and for several reasons. As
students overwhelmingly attest, racial diversity enriches
everyone's education and helps prepare everyone to live in an
increasingly multiracial society. Minority students also have
special opportunities to benefit society by helping to meet the
widely acknowledged need to diversify professions and leadership
positions in America. Thus, race becomes one valued element in a
richly diverse student body in which all admitted students are
academically qualified and ``meritorious,'' having all been judged
especially likely to further the legitimate purposes of the
institution.
</P>
<P>
   _ Derek Bok, former president of Harvard University and, with
William G. Bowen, the author of ``The Shape of the River: Long-Term
Consequences of Considering Race in College and University
Admissions.''
</P>
<P>
   There are doubtless many forms of merit in the eyes of God. But
selective institutions of higher learning are best advised and best
equipped to judge applicants on the basis of their academic merit,
as measured by grade point averages adjusted for course difficulty,
class rank and scores on standardized tests. These indicators allow
us to predict with considerable confidence who will flourish in
college or graduate school and who will barely scrape by or drop
out.
</P>
<P>
   But some groups earn higher grades and have better academic
records than others. Thus, Asian Americans _ just 4 percent of the
population _ are 27 percent of the undergraduates at Cal Tech, 25
percent of those at Columbia and 20 percent of those at Harvard.
Jews are similarly overrepresented at the top schools.
</P>
<P>
   If groups with large numbers of star students are hugely
overrepresented at elite institutions, groups with fewer high
achievers will inevitably be underrepresented. Pretending that such
applicants have academic skills they lack does nothing to resolve
the real problem, and indeed deflects attention from it. Nothing
less than radical reform in K-12 education is required to make
students from underrepresented groups fully competitive with
others.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stephan Thernstrom, the Winthrop Professor of History at
Harvard University and, with Abigail Thernstrom, the author of
``America in Black and White.''
</P>
<P>
   We may never agree about what constitutes merit. But a thought
experiment modeled after John Rawls' ``original position'' can help
us decide what's fair. Suppose you have no idea what genes your
unborn child would have, what sort of family or neighborhood he
would grow up in, or what kind of school she would attend. Under
this ``veil of ignorance,'' how would you want selective colleges
to choose their students?
</P>
<P>
   I think most parents would want colleges to consider their child
as a ``whole person,'' weighing all his accomplishments,
determination and intentions, in light of the obstacles he has
faced. This is in fact what many elite institutions try to do. As a
practical matter, though, we can never identify all the factors
that affect a person's achievement, much less assign objective
weight to their relative importance. So what's the next fairest
alternative? If parents were operating in a vacuum of knowledge
about their child, I suspect they would want selective colleges to
admit students based on grades, not tests. Both grades and tests
reflect a mix of achievement and effort, but grades seem less
fickle because they're averaged over multiple years, subjects and
teachers.

 UNDATED: Christopher Jencks. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his brilliant 1958 satire, ``The Rise of the Meritocracy,''
the British sociologist Michael Young argued that the real
consequences of meritocracy are to leave intact the vast
inequalities of a traditional class society while convincing both
the winners and the losers that they deserve their lot in life.
</P>
<P>
   Meritocracy's dirty little secret is that the content of
``merit'' in any given society is defined by the powerful. In
Victorian England, the cultivated Anglo-Saxon ``gentleman'' with a
classical education was the highest embodiment of merit; in Maoist
China, his equivalent was the militantly loyal Communist who
possessed expertise useful to the regime.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States today, the prevailing definition of merit
is a strange mishmash of grades, test scores (especially
standardized multiple-choice tests), extracurricular activities and
that elusive quality called ``character,'' a criterion that was
introduced at America's leading universities only in the 1920s,
when ``too many'' Jews succeeded in meeting the academic
qualifications. The demise of affirmative action in California and
elsewhere has generated calls to redefine merit, and such a
reconsideration is long overdue. But if the past is any guide to
the future, we should not forget that the subjective definitions of
merit that give gatekeepers broad discretion _ the alternative
currently favored by many advocates for minorities and the poor _
can as easily serve purposes of exclusion as inclusion.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jerome Karabel, a professor of sociology at the University of
California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Universities try to determine merit by admitting students who
have demonstrated both intellectual ability (a trait) and
conscientious determination (an act) to do college-level work in
their chosen field. By looking at both standardized test scores and
high school grades, colleges attempt to measure both traits and
acts. A student who scores 1300 on his SAT but barely passed his
high school classes probably won't do very well at a highly
competitive university. But neither will a diligent student whose
hard work earned him a B average in high school but who scores 800
on the SAT.
</P>
<P>
   Most traditional affirmative action programs have been aimed at
black and Hispanic students who fall into this second category.
Worse, many programs admit black and Hispanic students with both
lower test scores and grades than whites and Asians. Unfortunately,
hope rarely triumphs over experience, and such students often fare
poorly in schools where they must compete with more able, or better
disciplined, students.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to determine merit solely on the basis of effort are
doomed to failure, but so is the assumption that ability trumps
all.
</P>

Washington and former director of the U.S. Commission on Civil
Rights under President Reagan.

IRATE AT MANNESMANN DEAL, VODAFONE WEIGHS RESPONSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y.)   (af)  
 By ALAN COWELL and ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Despite a show of public nonchalance, Vodafone Airtouch
PLC, the world's leading mobile phone operator, is privately
considering a range of options including a hostile bid for
Mannesmann AG after the German company's move into the British
wireless market, executives close to the discussions said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann, an acquisitive engineering and telecommunications
conglomerate, offered $33 billion on Thursday for Orange PLC, the
No. 3 British wireless operator, setting itself in direct
competition with Vodafone Airtouch on its home territory, and even
though the two giants have major partnership deals in Germany,
Italy and France.
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to the situation emphasized that Vodafone had
reached no final decision on its response and was looking over a
palette of possible moves toward Mannesmann, its
partner-turned-rival. And in public, Vodafone insisted that its
relationship with Mannesmann was unchanged, though British press
reports said Vodafone's chief executive, Christopher Gent, was
furious at the German company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have agreements in place with Mannesmann, and we look
forward to continuing to work with them,'' a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts, however, said Mannesmann's move had
fundamentally shifted the balance of power between the two
companies. ``Vodafone has to do something if only to fight for
their place in Europe,'' one analyst said. ``If they don't, their
position would be diluted. There's a lot of sentiment in all
this.''
</P>
<P>
   If Mannesmann's acquisition of Orange is completed, the German
company will reinforce its position as the biggest cellular phone
operator in Europe. Moreover, the deal would rupture what analysts
depict as an unofficial turf agreement between Mannesmann and
Vodafone Airtouch by bringing them into direct competition for
customers in Britain and leaving them to battle for European market
share.
</P>
<P>
   Top Vodafone executives met on Thursday with the company's
advisers to review possible responses, but reached no clear
decision on which course to take, according to executives close to
the discussions. One option was to depict a bid for Mannesmann as
friendly to avoid a loss of face, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The executives said the chances of an offer would partly depend
on the fortunes of Mannesmann's stock, which has slumped since its
share-and-cash bid for Orange was announced early Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are concerned that the price it offered for the
five-year-old cellular company, a money loser, is too high. And if
Mannesmann shares continue to fall, that would lower the cost of a
bid by Vodafone, which is currently valued around $60 billion. In
Frankfurt Friday, Mannesmann's shares declined 2.2 percent more, to
140.3 euros, or $149.77.
</P>
<P>
   The German company secured a 12 billion euro interim loan to
finance part of the cash component of the Orange deal from a group
of five banks, including Deutsche Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Any move for Mannesmann by Vodafone would face regulatory and
other problems. European Union and British antitrust authorities
could be expected to scrutinize an acquisition that gave Vodafone
Airtouch _ itself created only in January _ dominance in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, British competition rules could mean that Vodafone would
have to shed Orange if it acquired Mannesmann, analysts said.
``Vodafone would actually be paying two premiums on Orange and
subsequently have to dispose of Orange, possibly at a discount,'' a
research note from Salomon Smith Barney said.
</P>
<P>
   The note estimated the market value of the Mannesmann-Orange
combination at 90 billion euros, or about $96 billion. ``And
assuming a 20 percent premium on top of that, the size of the deal
would be very large,'' it said. Salomon put Vodafone Airtouch's
market value at 125 billion euros, or $133.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, a Mannesmann shareholder resolution dating from
the 1970s forbids any single shareholder from owning more than 5
percent of the company's voting rights, although that restriction
is to expire late next year.
</P>
<P>
   A Mannesmann spokesman parried questions about a possible
Vodafone offer, saying, ``We basically do not comment on such
rumors.'' Vodafone also withheld comment.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone has an estimated 31 million customers worldwide, 13
million of them in Europe. After absorbing Orange, Mannesmann would
have about 20 million customers in Europe, drawn substantially from
the dominance of its D2-Mobilfunk network in Germany, its newly
acquired Omnitel network in Italy and from Orange's 3.5 million
British customers.
</P>
<P>
   The European mobile phone market is expected to double over the
next two years. In a frantic scramble for that market in recent
days quite apart from the Mannesmann-Orange deal, France Telecom
offered $8.94 billion for E-Plus, Germany's third-largest wireless
provider, while Deutsche Telekom said Friday that it would pay $2
billion for the cellular operations of the Mediaone Group in
Poland, Hungary and Russia.

JOHN E. SANDERS, GEOLOGIST, DEAD AT 73 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ John E. Sanders, a geologist and a longtime professor
at Barnard College who was also a major figure 20 years ago in a
plan to clean up the Hudson River, died Wednesday at a hospital in
Sleepy Hollow, N.Y. He was 73.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death has not been determined, said his daughter,
Stephanie Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, who lived in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., was a specialist in
sedimentary geology, and much of his research was on the geology of
the New York region.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, as chairman of the Hudson River PCB Settlement
Advisory Committee of the New York state Department of
Environmental Conservation, Sanders was also influential in working
out the details of a $200 million plan, with money from the state,
the federal government and General Electric, to clean up 30 to 40
so-called hot spots in the Hudson River that were contaminated with
PCBs, polychlorinated biphenyls, chemicals that have been
associated with birth defects, skin disorders and cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders was born on May 5, 1926, in Des Moines. He earned a
bachelor's degree from Ohio Wesleyan University and a doctorate
from Yale University. He taught at Yale from 1954 until 1964, and
also served as a visiting assistant professor at Wesleyan
University from 1956 until 1957.
</P>
<P>
   From 1969 to 1989, he taught at Barnard; he also taught at
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and was a senior research
associate at Columbia University's Hudson Laboratories. In 1990, he
became professor emeritus at Barnard. He also taught at Hofstra
University. He worked as a consultant at a law firm, specializing
in environmental law, for several years after he retired from
teaching.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders wrote ``Physical Geology'' (Harpers College Press, 1976)
and, with G.M. Friedman, ``Principles of Sedimentology'' (John
Wiley &AMP; Sons, 1978).
</P>
<P>
   Besides his daughter, Stephanie, of Silver Spring, Md., he is
survived by his wife, Barbara Sanders; two sons, Philip, of
Poquoson, Va., and Thomas, of Hawthorne, N.Y.; three sisters, Mary
McBride, of Napa, Calif., Alice Grant, of Plainwell, Mich., and Pat
Webb, of Sarasota, Fla.; and four grandchildren.

NORTHRIDGE FRESHMEN GETTING SOME ATTENTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It wasn't a fancy plan. Just run and catch, run
and catch, day after day.
</P>
<P>
   All summer, Joe Gilliam went to his high school field in Fresno
and prepared for the transition to college football. His former
coaches threw him passes and sent him on routes.
</P>
<P>
   Gilliam remembers their post-workout conversations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said: `You'll just have to work hard,' '' Gilliam said,
``and they will notice you.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Cal State Northridge coaches have noticed Gilliam and
several other top Matadors recruits who are part of one of CSUN's
best freshman recruiting classes.
</P>
<P>
   Gilliam, a wide receiver who made his first start last week
against Sacramento State and had eight catches for 99 yards and a
touchdown, did exactly what he needed to do to make an impact at
CSUN.
</P>
<P>
   He and, most notably, offensive lineman Nick Longshore and
fullback Crayton Milton, have mostly avoided the dreaded scout
team, where most first-year players are sent.
</P>
<P>
   Although hard work can pay off, so can luck.
</P>
<P>
   Gilliam played last week because Aaron Arnold was out with a
shoulder injury.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries meant playing time for Longshore, a left tackle from
Canyon High who also was impressive in fall camp, and defensive
backs Bryson Atkins (Alemany) and Travis Campbell (Westlake) have
traveled, a rarity for a team that can only have 58 players make
road trips.
</P>
<P>
   Milton, a 260-pound fullback, has been playing recently to
bolster the Matadors' running game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Timing plays a huge role,'' said Jeff Kearin, CSUN's interim
head coach. ``Joe Gilliam, we had every intention of redshirting.
The same for Nick Longshore. The hardest thing for freshmen is
really being ready.''
</P>
<P>
   And adjusting to a life where they are no longer the star
player. Just last year, Marquis Brignac was one of the top players
in the L.A. City Section, a record-setting tailback who led Taft
High to a City title.
</P>
<P>
   Now Brignac is fifth-string.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just stay humble, day in and day out,'' said Brignac, who
will redshirt the season. ``It's a `starting over' process. Coming
out of junior high, and going to Taft, nobody knew me there.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all I can do, compete.''
</P>
<P>
   Kearin's challenge is to keep freshmen such as Brignac and D.J.
Hackett, a wide receiver who was an All-Southern Section selection
at San Dimas High, motivated to stay in the program.
</P>
<P>
   Egos at this level can bruise easily, and thoughts of
transferring can be more than fleeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``A great program is able to redshirt their freshmen so they are
here for five years,'' Kearin said. ``I try to tell them why they
are doing it, and that it's to their advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett seems to have gotten the point. He progressed slowly in
fall camp and his chance for playing this season was dashed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't really accustomed to catching hard (passes),''
Hackett said, ``so that put me behind. The people in front of me
are better than me, so I'm not complaining.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the freshmen should look at CSUN sophomore quarterback
Marcus Brady, who redshirted his first year and is now one of the
top players in the Big Sky Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stayed focused and paid attention,'' Brady said.

PARALEGAL DIVORCE FIRMS ACCUSED OF SKIRTING LAW
</HEADLINE>
   (ko) 
 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They call out with flashy signs, subway banners and
ads in the Yellow Pages, promising to deliver hassle-free divorces
at rock-bottom prices. Some say they can do it by mail, while
others assure ``no signature required.''
</P>
<P>
   They are paralegal firms, and their owners say they provide a
beneficial service to those who cannot afford or do not need legal
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   But many lawyers, judges and advocates for the poor say these
businesses sometimes skirt the law and subvert people's rights.
</P>
<P>
   The debate came to the fore last month after Steven Singer, the
chief divorce court clerk in Manhattan, pleaded guilty to counts of
taking bribes from paralegal services and high-volume law firms in
exchange for expediting divorce papers.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Kramer, who owns the Divorce Center, says his and other
paralegal firms offer a legitimate service to people who do not
have complicated divorce issues and that people need such services
because the matrimonial courts are too difficult to navigate alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court's divorce packet is terrible and impossible to
understand,'' said Kramer, whose two-decade-old company has about
250 offices in New York and New Jersey. ``The courts are very
difficult to deal with and intimidating, and usually the people
behind the counter are very unhelpful.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers say they generally charge $1,500 to $2,500 for
uncontested divorces. Some of the paralegal services say an
uncontested divorce application can be written up and filed for
$150 to $400 on average.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say the services sometimes allow one party in a
divorce to take advantage of the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many cases one party says there is no property, but they
lie, and unless you put the time in to discover this, you will
never find out,'' said Eleanor Alter, a divorce lawyer who is
chairwoman of the Lawyers Fund for Client Protection of the State
of New York. ``Sometimes things like this happen just because of
sloppiness, and sometimes it's desire to do the least amount of
work for the most profit. But you are really talking about serious
rights that can be terminated, and then a person has to spend a lot
of money to rectify the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Businesses specializing in legal matters like uncontested
divorces have boomed over the last decade as court procedures have
been streamlined and computer software programs have been developed
to help people handle basic legal documents. Besides uncontested
divorces, many paralegal firms deal with bankruptcies,
tenant-landlord disputes, wills and property closings.
</P>
<P>
   New York began streamlining its matrimonial court system in
1993, when it introduced new rules that set a rough timetable for
dealing with divorce cases and gave the court system more
responsibility for expediting them. Simple cases are supposed to
take no more than six months, while complex cases are supposed to
be resolved within 12.
</P>
<P>
   A little over a year ago, courts in all counties began using the
same simplified packet for uncontested divorce cases. In some
counties, judges outside matrimonial court and specially designated
lawyers _ called referees _ can now grant uncontested divorces,
further speeding the process.
</P>
<P>
   Administrators of the system say such changes have reduced the
time it takes for a divorce. Contested divorces in New York City
are now routinely handled in about 400 days, compared with more
than 800 days in 1993, according to court statistics.
</P>
<P>
   The court system does not keep information on how long it takes
to get an uncontested divorce, but lawyers and judges say this
process appears to be moving more quickly than in years past. The
average uncontested divorce in Manhattan can now be had in about a
month and a half once the paperwork has been filed, lawyers and
paralegals say, though it can still take six to eight months in
other counties, like the Bronx, which have fewer people trained to
handle such cases.
</P>
<P>
   The paperwork, while easier to understand than before, remains
complicated, and small mistakes, like using the wrong color paper
for certain forms, can cause court clerks to return divorce
documents for refiling, lawyers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better than it used to be when I got divorced, but I'm a
paralegal, and even I have a hard time with these forms,'' said
Heather Woolfolk, who went to Manhattan Supreme Court recently to
pick up a divorce packet for her sister.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the paralegal firms say the firms have sometimes been
used to rush divorces through the system, even when there are
complicated monetary issues at stake. Those who suffer, they say,
often are immigrants who do not know their rights.
</P>
<P>
   Other times, lawyers and judges say, unscrupulous ``divorce
mills'' will perform ``sewer service'' by processing and notarizing
the paperwork for a client but never serving the papers on a
spouse. When there is no response, the client can receive a default
divorce judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Jacqueline Silbermann, the state administrative judge for
matrimonial matters, said she had seen many cases in which divorce
papers were improperly served and signatures were forged. She said
that in some cases where paralegal firms were used it turned out
that signatures were notarized out of the presence of the signer or
there turned out to be no notary at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``My remedy was to have an inquest, to say the divorce would not
be signed unless both parties came in,'' she said. ``It turned out
that some of these documents had been made up whole cloth.''

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 224. PLEASE
NOTE: THERE IS NO ATTENDANCE CHART WASHINGTON, Oct. 22 -- The
following chart shows how senators and representatives voted on key
bills and amendments within the last week. A ``Y'' means the member
voted for the measure; an ``N'' means the member voted against the
measure; a ``?'' means the member did not vote; and a ``P'' means
the member voted ``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: REFORM1
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Tuesday failed to pass a measure that would have
revamped the campaign finance system. Voting 52-48, the measure
failed to garner the 60 votes necessary to overcome a filibuster.
The measure would ban the use of so-called soft money, regulate ads
sponsored by advocacy groups that target specific candidates and
strengthen disclosure requirements. Supporters said the current
system gives special interest groups too much power and should be
reformed. Opponents said the bill would violate the right to free
speech and limit participation in the political process. A ``yes''
vote favors the measure.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: REFORM2
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Tuesday failed to pass a scaled-back measure to
reform campaign finance laws. Voting 53-47, the bill failed to
garner the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster. The measure
would ban so-called soft money contributions to political parties.
Supporters said limiting the large and unregulated donations to
political parties was at least a start in the reform process.
Opponents said the measure was a violation of free speech and would
limit participation in the political process. A ``yes'' vote favors
the bill.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: ABORTION1
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday approved, 51 to 47, a bill to endorse the
1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing abortions. The nonbinding
measure calls the Roe v. Wade decision ``an important
constitutional right'' that should not be overturned. Supporters
said the bill would protect the right to have an abortion.
Opponents said abortion was wrong and that the vote was just an
attempt to divert attention away from the debate over a bill to ban
``partial-birth'' abortions. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   4) BILL NUMBER: ABORTION2
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday approved, 63 to 34, a bill to ban
``partial-birth'' abortions. The measure makes late-term abortions
illegal, but did not get the two-thirds support it would need to
override a veto promised by President Clinton. Supporters said
partial-birth abortions are equivalent to ``infanticide.''
Opponents said the bill violates a woman's constitutional right to
have an abortion. A ``yes'' votes favors the bill.

</P>
<P>
   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: COMMERCE
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday passed, 215-213, a spending measure that
funds the departments of Commerce, Justice and State. Supporters of
the $37 billion measure said the bill adequately funds those
departments. Opponents said it should have included funding for a
program to hire more police officers and lacks language regarding
hate crimes. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: EDUCATION1
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday approved, 311-111, a measure that
restores a program to ensure gender equality in schools. Supporters
said girls need to be encouraged to take more science and math
classes. Opponents said the measure was unnecessary because gender
equality had already been achieved. A ``yes'' vote favors the
measure.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: EDUCATION2
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday rejected, 166-257, an amendment to spend
$100 million a year on vouchers that students in struggling public
schools could use to pay for tuition at private schools. Supporters
said the bill would help students whose schools are deemed to be
``disasters''. Opponents said it would divert funding from public
to private schools. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   4) BILL NUMBER: EDUCATION3
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday approved, 213-208, a compromise bill to
form a pilot program that would allow ten states to pool targeted
federal funds into one block grant. Supporters, many of whom had
wanted the bill to include all 50 states, said states should have
more power when making education decisions. Opponents feared the
bill would enable states to divert federal help from disadvantaged
students. A ``yes'' vote favors the measure.

NICHOLAS METROPOLIS, 84, A MAKER OF THE A-BOMB AND COMPUTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By NICK RAVO 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Nicholas C. Metropolis, a mathematician who was one of the
initial team of scientists involved with the Manhattan Project and
who later became a pioneer in computer science, died last Sunday at
a nursing home in Los Alamos, N.M. He was 84.
</P>
<P>
   Metropolis was best known for his contributions to the Monte
Carlo mathematical method, which applies the laws of probability to
scientific research. From 1948 to 1952, he also used the stored
program _ a principle that outlines the internal organization of a
computer _ to develop one of the first high-speed electronic
digital computers, which he named Maniac, for mathematical and
numerical integrator and computer. The principle was developed by a
colleague, the mathematician John von Neumann.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nick's work in mathematics and the beginnings of computer
science forms the basis for nearly everything the laboratory has
done in computing and simulation science,'' said John C. Browne,
director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory, where Metropolis
was a senior fellow emeritus.
</P>
<P>
   Metropolis was born on June 11, 1915, in Chicago. He earned a
bachelor's degree and a doctorate in experimental physics from the
University of Chicago, where he collaborated with Enrico Fermi and
Edward Teller on the earliest nuclear reactors.
</P>
<P>
   In 1943, J. Robert Oppenheimer recruited him to Los Alamos for
the Manhattan Project, the United States' wartime effort to build
the first atomic bomb. His first assignment was to develop
equations for the state of materials at high temperatures,
pressures and densities.
</P>
<P>
   He sometimes joked that he spent much of his time repairing
electromechanical calculators with Richard Feynman, a physicist who
later shared a Nobel Prize for research in quantum electrodynamics.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Metropolis taught at the University of Chicago.
In 1948, he returned to Los Alamos to lead the group that built
Maniac and Maniac II. He went back to the University of Chicago in
1957 and founded the Institute for Computer Research. In 1965, he
returned to Los Alamos once again.
</P>
<P>
   Metropolis became a senior fellow of the laboratory in 1980, and
in 1987 became the first Los Alamos employee given emeritus status
by the University of California, which had operated the laboratory
since its creation in 1943. He was also a member of the American
Academy of Arts and Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a son, Christopher, of Berkeley, Calif.; two
daughters, Penelope Metropolis, of Brookline, Mass., and Katharine
Metropolis, of Goleta, Calif.; and two sisters, Joan Kent, of
Boulder, Colo., and Helen Yannias, of Westchester, Ill.

JACK BROMWICH, 80, AUSTRALIAN TENNIS STAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jack Bromwich, who won the Australian Open singles championship
twice in a tennis career that was interrupted by World War II, died
earlier this week in Geelong, Australia. The ambidextrous Bromwich,
who won 17 major doubles titles and was a prolific representative
of Australia in Davis Cup play, was 80.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was a heart attack, his family said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Bromwich, who served in the Australian Army during the war,
played in seven of eight Australian Open singles finals from 1937
to 1949, winning in 1939 and 1946. He and his customary doubles
partner, Adrian Quist, captured the Australian Open doubles
championship a record eight consecutive times beginning in 1938,
and they were in their mid-30s when finally dethroned in 1951 by a
more youthful duo of native Australians, Frank Sedgman and Ken
McGregor. The tournament was not held from 1941-45 because of the
war.
</P>
<P>
   For Australia's Davis Cup team, he captured 20 of 21 doubles
matches and 19 of 30 singles matches. Bromwich and Quist, 9-1
together in Davis Cup doubles, formed the two-man team that
wrestled the Cup away from the United States in 1939. In his final
Davis Cup appearance in 1950, Bromwich partnered Sedgman to a
Cup-deciding five-set victory over Ted Schroeder and Gardnar Mulloy
of the United States at Forest Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Fair-haired and lanky, Bromwich's iconoclastic double-fisted
playing style was in part a precursor to that of the modern-era
champion Monica Seles. But unlike Seles, Bromwich used both hands
on his forehand side only. His backhand was hit singlehandedly,
with his left arm. More curious still was Bromwich's decision to
serve right-handed despite being a natural lefty.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to confounding his opponents, Bromwich backed up his
unorthodox formula with an aggressive attacking game and an
opportunistic touch around the net. He volleyed with impunity and
took pains to ambush servers by chipping his returns straight at
their sneakers, a tactic that meshed well with the grass courts
that were prevalent in his heyday.
</P>
<P>
   At Wimbledon, Bromwich distinguished himself by winning the
men's doubles in 1948 and 1950 and the mixed doubles in 1947 and
1948. But his most disappointing major match occurred in the
Wimbledon singles final against Bob Falkenburg in 1948, when
Bromwich squandered three match points at 5-3 before losing by 7-5
in the fifth set.
</P>
<P>
   Three times a singles semifinalist at the United States
Nationals, where he earned three men's doubles championships and a
mixed doubles title, Bromwich ranked among the top 10 in the world
five times, reaching a career-best No. 2 in 1939. He was elected to
the International Tennis Hall of Fame along with Quist in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Bromwich is survived by his wife, Zenda.

MANAGING EDITOR WILL REMAIN WITH WALL STREET JOURNAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two questions hanging over The Wall Street Journal's
future were answered Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper's managing editor, Paul Steiger, ended more than a
week of uncertainty by turning down an offer to head all financial
news operations at CNN. A few hours later, company and labor union
negotiators ended more than seven months of sometimes tense
negotiations with an agreement to resolve the volatile issue of
retirement benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Steiger nor any spokesman for CNN would comment on the
resolution of the protracted deliberations or on speculation about
the cable network's efforts to replace Lou Dobbs, one of the
best-known financial journalists on television. Dobbs left last
summer for a job at a Web site, Space.com.
</P>
<P>
   But speaking on the condition of anonymity, one person who
talked to one of the parties in the tug of war over Steiger said
that the editor had informed Dow Jones' chief executive, Peter
Kann, of his decision Thursday morning and called Tom Johnson, the
chief executive of CNN, Thursday evening. Friday morning, Steiger
told a group of top editors that he intended to remain in the
managing editor's job, which he has held since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Steiger's decision surprised some executives at CNN. ``I'd just
been telling a friend that I was betting Steiger was coming here,''
one nonplused CNN executive said Friday, adding that he had spoken
with Steiger earlier this week. Exactly what tipped the scales in
The Journal's favor was unclear.
</P>
<P>
   What tipped the union negotiators in favor of a tentative
agreement early Friday was the guarantee of company contributions
of a minimum of 10 percent and up to 12 percent of employees'
salaries as retirement benefits, through two new retirement plans.
</P>
<P>
   The company paid out some $40 million in retirement benefits to
roughly 5,500 employees in 1998 under the current arrangement,
which calls for a 15 percent retirement contribution. The new
agreement _ if ratified by the membership of the Independent
Association of Publishers' Employees/Communications Workers of
America Local 1096, which represents 2,400 of the Journal's 8,200
employees, most of them reporters or editors _ would have saved the
company $8 to $10 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The initial proposal to cut retirement benefits almost in half
infuriated many members of the union. It led last April to a
demonstration at Dow Jones' annual meeting, led by Pulitzer
Prize-winning reporters. More recently, it provoked dozens of
overtime claims, which were not honored _ a decision that is the
subject of a pending appeal to the National Labor Relations Board.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Chen, the president of Local 1096, said Friday that ``the
current profit-sharing plan had no bottom, no safety net.'' He
added, ``The significance of this is that for the first time there
is a guaranteed retirement benefit of 10 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   The contract also provides for wage increases of 9.5 percent
over three years. A 3 percent increase for 1999 is retroactively
effective to May 1. Another 3 percent takes effect May 1, 2000, and
the final 3.5 percent increase takes effect May 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Dow Jones' current profit-sharing plan remains in effect through
1999. Next year, two new plans will be established: a pension plan
to which the company will contribute 7 percent of an employee's
salary in one lump payment, and a new 401(K) retirement plan to
which the company will contribute 3 percent of an employee's
salary, paid monthly.

PENELOPE MORTIMER, 81, AUTHOR OF `PUMPKIN EATER' 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Penelope Mortimer, an English author who drew on her complex and
often turbulent relationships with men in writing novels like ``The
Pumpkin Eater'' and a heatedly debated account of the romantic life
of Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, died on Tuesday at a London
hospice. She was 81 and lived in Willesden, a suburb in north
London.
</P>
<P>
   Her dozen novels focus on the upper middle class in Britain.
``The Pumpkin Eater'' (1962), which dealt with a troubled marriage,
was made into a successful film in 1964 starring James Mason and
Anne Bancroft.
</P>
<P>
   Her novel ``My Friend Says It's Bulletproof'' (1968) is loosely
based on an affair she had with a lawyer on a trip to Canada.
``Long Distance'' (1974), which tells Kafka-esque story of a woman
confined to a bizarre institution, was one of the few novels to be
published in its entirety in The New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mortimer also wrote two highly praised volumes of memoirs
and several television screenplays, including her adaptation of
``Portrait of a Marriage,'' the 1973 biography of Vita
Sackville-West and her husband, Harold Nicolson, by Nigel Nicolson,
their son.
</P>
<P>
   Shown in the United States in 1992 as a three-part series on
``Masterpiece Theater'' on PBS, the programs were upsetting to many
viewers because of their portrayal of homosexual liaisons and
lesbian love scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mortimer was well known if not always beloved in Britain for
her biography ``Queen Elizabeth: A Life of the Queen Mother''
(1986), which delved into the subject's romantic life before her
marriage to the future King George VI.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mortimer, the former Penelope Ruth Fletcher, was born in
Oxfordshire, the daughter of a vicar who periodically professed to
have lost his faith in God. When she was 16, she attended the
Central Educational Bureau for Women in London to learn secretarial
skills.
</P>
<P>
   In 1937, she married Charles Dimont, a Reuters correspondent
with whom she lived in Vienna and observed the German annexation of
Austria. Divorced in 1949, she married John Mortimer, the author,
the same year.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by a son, Jeremy Mortimer of London; five
daughters, Madelon Dimont Burk of France, Caroline Bennett of
London, Julia Mankowitz of London, Deborah Rogers of Cornwall,
England, and Sally Silverman of Bristol, England, and 11
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s and '60s the couple were frequently photographed at
London society events and, The London Daily Telegraph's obituary
said, they ``seemed to represent the last word in marital chic.''
Behind this facade, however, Ms. Mortimer had frequent bouts of
depression. The marriage ended in divorce in 1972.

<P>
   It is likely that the Fells Acres Day School case will be argued
as long as there is a criminal justice system. Was it the
horrendous case of child molestation that prosecutors described and
that sent Violet Amirault and her son and daughter to prison? Or
was it a gross miscarriage of justice borne on winds of hysteria
reminiscent of the witch trials of 17th-century Salem?
</P>
<P>
   The case was among the first of a nationwide wave of child
molestation cases that had the country in an uproar in the 1980s.
In the end, some 40 Fells Acres children bore witness against their
teachers and described fantastic scenes and acts that to this day
stretch credulity. There were charges that overzealous prosecutors
coached and manipulated the children, only a few of whom testified
in court, to make them say things they might not otherwise have
said.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the child molestation bubble burst. Many cases across
the country failed to stand up under scrutiny, and the
investigative practices of prosecutors were shown to be faulty.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the Fells Acres case, two juries believed the
prosecution, and after an appeal, the Supreme Judicial Court of
Massachusetts sustained the convictions, overruling a lower-court
reversal.
</P>
<P>
   Now we have a curious compromise designed to please everybody
and nobody. Violet Amirault has died of cancer, and her daughter,
Cheryl Amirault LeFave, is set free as long as she promises not to
protest her innocence on television, does not make money off her
case, and stays away from children. The state does not admit her
innocence, and she, as she has steadfastly maintained, does not
admit guilt. The state is willing to limit her sentence to time
served but doesn't want to deal any longer with the question of
guilt or innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps there is enough doubt about the leading of child
witnesses in this case to release Cheryl Amirault LeFave from
prison, but what about her brother, Gerald, who has been in jail
since 1986 on a 30- to 40-year sentence? There is an inconsistency
here that promises to keep the Fells Acre case alive for a long
time to come.

BOARD DELAYS RELEASE DATE FOR IMMIGRANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ A three-member panel of the Board of Immigration
Appeals, in a sharply divided decision Friday, delayed until
midnight on Monday its order releasing a 31-year-old Palestinian
immigrant who has been detained in prison for 18 months on secret
evidence accusing him of being connected with terrorist groups.
</P>
<P>
   The action in the case of Hany Kiareldeen came as a result of a
request by the federal Immigration and Naturalization Service,
which said that it needed more time to determine how and whether to
appeal a string of rulings this past week that have rejected the
agency's arguments that Kiareldeen is dangerous and a threat to
national security.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's position is based on classified information
Kiareldeen and his lawyers have not been allowed to see but which
an immigration judge termed ``unreliable.''
</P>
<P>
   The week was also marked by a flurry of activity in the case in
federal courts, including a district court judge's ruling that the
use of secret evidence to detain Kiareldeen was a violation of due
process. An appeal of that ruling, the first such action by a
federal judge, was heard by an appeals court judge on Thursday and
then sent, on an expedited basis, for further hearing to a
three-judge panel of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   In what appeared to be a compromise ruling by the board, Anthony
Moscato wrote in the majority opinion that only ``a brief stay'' of
the release was warranted in order ``to permit the service to
consider its course of action in light of its national security
responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Gilhooly, a spokesman for the INS, said that the agency
would consider over the weekend one of three courses of action
allowed by immigration law. The first is a formal request to the
board panel acting Friday to reconsider its release order. The
second option is to appeal the board's release order to Attorney
General Janet Reno. The third alternative is to accept the ruling
and release Kiareldeen by Monday.

A FINAL SOLUTION FOR HITLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Berlin construction workers accidentally dug up part of Adolf
Hitler's bunker last week, fueling the debate about what historical
relics should be saved and what are best left buried.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin city officials made the right call when they stuck by a
1994 decision not to preserve the former Nazi leader's compound.
The construction crew was told to cover up the 20-foot slab of
concrete believed to be the roof of Hitler's bunker and to continue
building a new street and government offices over the remains,
which beneath a plot of grass south of the Brandenburg Gate.
</P>
<P>
   That is fitting symbolism _ smothering the hard, ugly power of
the past under modern political foundations. A country cannot
obliterate its history, nor should it try, but it most definitely
can move on.
</P>
<P>
   No one should forget why the concrete is there, just as no one
should forget the evil that Hitler unleashed upon the world. But
that heinous time is best recalled in solemn walks through
Holocaust memorials and museums. It can also be remembered through
countless books and movies that tell the story of the madman who
sought to annihilate the Jewish people and dominate the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Putting parts of his bunker on display, or excavating whatever
might still be found in the dust of the bombproof strongholds
Hitler built for himself and his associates, would serve no purpose
other than feeding morbid curiosities. Such a display might also
attract neo-Nazi groups and become a rallying place for racist
violence.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years Hitler's birthday, April 20, has been a rallying
date for hate group demonstrations and attacks _ it may have been a
catalyst for the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 as well as the
Columbine High School shootings in Colorado last spring. Hitler
does not deserve a shrine. His memory stands as a warning to the
world on the crest of a new millennium: Beware the hater and do not
follow.

A TOP NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICER CHARGED WITH SEX ASSAULT 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One of the highest noncommissioned officers in the
Army has been charged with sexually assaulting a female sergeant in
Germany last April in the latest in a series of embarrassing
sex-related incidents in the military.
</P>
<P>
   Army officials announced on Thursday that Sgt. Maj. Riley Miller
had been accused of forcible sodomy, kidnapping, indecent assault
and maltreatment of a subordinate.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued in Heidelberg, Germany, the Army said the
crimes were believed to have been committed in Hanau, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Montgomery Meigs, commanding general of United States Army
forces in Europe, said Miller was relieved of his duties on Sept.
22 pending an investigation. In its statement, the Army stressed
that the defendant was presumed innocent until and unless proven
guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Meigs said the accusations made it impossible for Miller to
carry out his duties.
</P>
<P>
   As the top noncommissioned officer in Europe, Miller has one of
the most prestigious posts among the enlisted ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Miller is 51 and has 30 years of service, including Vietnam
combat for which he was awarded numerous decorations, The
Washington Post reported in its Saturday editions. The Post said
the woman he was accused of attacking was a sergeant who served as
his driver. He is married and had served in his post about three
years, The Post said.
</P>
<P>
   Until the accusations surfaced, Miller was a strong candidate to
be the next sergeant major of the Army. A predecessor in that
position, Gene McKinney, had been accused of sexual harassment. In
1998, he was convicted of obstruction of justice and demoted to
master sergeant.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the armed services have had to deal with
numerous sex-related episodes, some involving adultery or
fraternization _ military charges that have no real parallel in
civilian life _ and some involving harassment or assault. The
accused have ranged from enlisted men and women to generals.
</P>
<P>
   The Army's announcement did not describe Miller's new duties,
nor did it say whether he was still receiving his full salary. If
convicted of all charges, he could be given a dishonorable
discharge, sentenced to prison and forfeit his benefits.

SAVING THE FORESTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton's far-reaching decision to extend protection
to 40 million acres of national forest highlights the largest
single treasure still vulnerable to timber industry ambitions. The
17-million-acre Tongass rain forest in Alaska, not covered by
Clinton's action, is still in danger.
</P>
<P>
   Every woodland has unique characteristics that distinguish it
from others _ terrain, type of tree, the animals and birds that
live in it. The Tongass is special even in this company. It is the
last native growth of woodland fed by steady flows of moist air
from the Pacific _ the only surviving temperate rain forest in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, its streams are spawning zones for the Pacific
salmon, an important economic resource in itself. Those salmon are
put at risk by logging roads, which can still be built in Tongass
in the absence of action by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The Tongass issue pits Clinton, who has done a great deal to
protect forest tracts during his presidency, against Senator Ted
Stevens, an Alaska Republican who is a dogged supporter of
timbering operations in the Tongass. As chairman of the Senate
Appropriations Committee, Stevens can threaten any piece of
legislation involving money in retaliation for moves to protect
Tongass.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's support of forest protection should stand him in good
stead in dealing with the Tongass issue before he leaves office.
The highest level of protection _ ``wilderness'' designation _
requires congressional approval, an unlikely course given the
political realities that Stevens typifies. But Clinton made good
use of his executive powers in starting a process that will ban
road building and other development in the 40 million acres covered
by his recent action. Congress lacks the power to overturn such
action without legislation the president would likely veto.
</P>
<P>
   Stretching over millions of acres, the Tongass is a precious
asset that deserves the fullest reasonable protection before
Clinton leaves office.

<P>
   In an encouraging indicator that partisanship may not freeze all
action on Capitol Hill, the House this week turned back an
ill-advised school voucher program and voted to continue one of the
nation's most basic and successful education programs _ Title I.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 30 years, Title I has directed federal money to
students, most of them poor, who are at least two grade levels
behind their peers. While results have varied from state to state,
the overall impact has been to equalize educational opportunity
across the country. The program accounts for more than half of the
federal dollars spent for education progams in kindergarten through
Grade 12.
</P>
<P>
   The reauthorization of Title I, which carries a price tag of
$8.3 billion to help 10.5 million students in the next five years,
had little direct opposition. Chairman William Goodling of the
House Education and Workforce Committee was a strong supporter
because of accountability provisions that have been added.
</P>
<P>
   But the House majority leader, Dick Armey, tried to attach a
voucher plan that would give parents of low-performing students up
to $3,500 to send them to private or parochial schools. Fifty-two
Republicans, including Goodling, joined in defeating the voucher
proposal, 257-166.
</P>
<P>
   Vouchers had the support of most of the Republican leadership,
but the proposal was misguided. Vouchers can drain public funds
from public schools, making them worse for the students who remain
and diminishing hope for improvement. Vouchers can also raise
constitutional church-state difficulties. And there is no assurance
that they would produce better learning.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence on the effectiveness of vouchers should be gathered
carefully on a pilot basis. The issue is already under study in
Milwaukee, in Florida, and before the US Supreme Court, which is
considering an Ohio voucher case. There is no need for a nationwide
program that could produce disastrous results for many schools and
students.
</P>
<P>
   The House did well to reauthorize Title I, with minor
improvements, and not make the issue more complex and contentious
than it needed to be.
