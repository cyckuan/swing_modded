<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Vows to Strengthen Ties With OIC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 1 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Friday voiced his hope to strengthen the cooperation and
partnership between the United Nations and the Organization of the
Islamic Conference (OIC).
</P>
<P>
Annan made the message to the annual Coordination Meeting of
the OIC Foreign Ministers, which was held Friday in New York. The
text of the statement was delivered on his behalf by the U.N.
assistant secretary-general for political affairs, Ibrahim Fall.
</P>
<P>
"I have long considered the OIC a vital partner for the United
Nations throughout the Islamic world, and beyond," Annan said.
"The cooperation between our two organizations continues to deepen
and broaden as we find growing areas of common interest."
</P>
<P>
"In opening this year's General Assembly, I decided to make our
common opposition to the slaughter of people a key focus of my
address," he said, "I argued that as the world can no longer stand
aside when gross and systematic violations of human rights take
place, it must act effectively and legitimately to halt such
violations."
</P>
<P>
"The OIC has a vital role to play in helping us achieve this
aim -- through early warning, preventive diplomacy and action," he
said. "It is my aspiration that together -- in your area of
concern, as everywhere -- we can create a global environment where
disputes are settled peacefully, and where no regime believes it
can commit with impunity either aggression beyond its borders or
vicious repression within them."
</P>
<P>
In cooperation with the OIC, the United Nations sees Afghan,
Somalian and the Balkan conflicts are major concerns, he said.
</P>
<P>
The OIC was founded in May 1970, and it has some 55 members.

<HEADLINE> UK's Labour Conference Ends on Upbeat Note </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Britain's ruling Labor Party set
its sights on a second term in power on Friday at the end of an
annual conference, in the southern city of Bournemouth, which was
considered to have tightened its grip on the center ground of
British politics.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair on Friday led the drive to
present the opposition Conservatives as a marginal and discredited
force.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to BBC, he called the once-mighty party which ruled
Britain for 18 years until 1997 "a complete wreck". The prime
minister described the Conservatives as "extreme and out of touch"
and appealed to moderates to cross over to Labor.
</P>
<P>
Blair's keynote speech on Tuesday threw aside the caution of
his first two years in office and displayed a new commitment to
radical social change and "true equality".
</P>
<P>
Blair attacked what he described as "forces of conservatism on
the left" who opposed his welfare and education reforms. He said
Labor had been far too conservative in the 1980s in its response
to Margaret Thatcher's reforms.
</P>
<P>
He tried hard to ram home the message that the middle classes
would have nothing to fear from his drive to improve chances for
the poor.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Party at present enjoys a 52-25 percentage point
advantage in public polls over William Hague's Conservative Party,
which meets on Sunday in the northwestern city of Blackpool.
</P>
<P>
A poll in The Times newspaper this week highlighted Hague's
failure to connect with voters, more than two years after he took
over the party in the wake of a decisive defeat in 1997. While
Blair still enjoys a positive personal approval rating of 58 to
34, only 23 percent of voters are satisfied with Hague and 50
percent dissatisfied.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Leaders Make No Progress in New Round of Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's main political
party leaders on Friday completed a second round-table session
chaired by U.S. mediator George Mitchell but made no progress over
guerrilla disarmament.
</P>
<P>
David Trimble, leader of the pro-British Ulster Unionist Party
(UUP), said in Belfast that no progress had been made in the
discussions with Gerry Adams, head of Sinn Fein, the political
wing of the Irish Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which will resume on Monday in Belfast, are part of
a drive by Mitchell to broker a compromise between Sinn Fein and
Trimble's party.
</P>
<P>
It is the second time the Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams and UUP
leader David Trimble have met since July as part of the review.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell's review was sparked by the collapse of talks at
Stormont, Belfast in July, following the Ulster Unionists' refusal
to sit in government with Sinn Fein until the IRA begins to
decommission its weapons.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein says that is a precondition which was not in the Good
Friday Agreement.

<HEADLINE> Britain Sets Rule to Govern Devolution "Turf wars" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Britain on Friday unveiled rules
aimed at preventing damaging "turf wars" between the British
government and new regional parliaments in Scotland and Wales.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines, or concordats, cover areas such as relations
with the European Union, international relations, financial
assistance to industry and government statistics, the Reuters
reported.
</P>
<P>
Scottish Secretary John Reid said these documents provided a
solid foundation for good working relationship between the UK
government and the Scottish government.
</P>
<P>
There have been widespread reports of a power struggle between
First Minister Donald Dewar, head of the new parliament, and Reid,
who replaced him in British Prime Minister Tony Blair's cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Both men have denied the rift and appeared together on Friday
to present the "fine print" of Blair's policy of devolving limited
powers to the different nations that make up the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The new Scottish parliament, and to a lesser extent the new
Welsh assembly, controls regional issues like health and law and
order, although it has no say over UK-wide issues such as defense
and the economy.
</P>
<P>
A new Northern Ireland power-sharing executive has been delayed
due to the stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines also set up a committee to resolve disputes
chaired by the British prime minister and made up of different
ministers in London, Edinburgh and Cardiff.

<HEADLINE> Russia Continues Air Raids on Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Russia pressed ahead Friday with
a bombing campaign against the breakaway republic of Chechnya as
more refugees fled to neighboring provinces in Russia's North
Caucasus region.
</P>
<P>
While political leaders said Thursday that government troops
had taken strategic heights several miles inside Chechnya, the
military has declined to give any details on troop movements.
</P>
<P>
More than 88,000 refugees have fled Chechnya to neighboring
Ingushetia to the west, straining the resources of the
impoverished territory. Four trucks from the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees, with tents, mattresses, food and other
supplies, arrived in Ingushetia on Friday, Russia media reported.
</P>
<P>
Chris Carpenter, the head of UNHCR in Moscow, was quoted as
saying that there could be 100,000 refugees in Ingushetia within
days if the current pace continues.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax news agency reported that federal fighter jets
kept up the air strikes on Chechnya, carrying out more than 20
strikes on suspected rebel targets overnight Friday.
</P>
<P>
The bombing raids have targeted suspected rebel strongholds,
oil refineries and bridges, according to the Russian air force.
The air force has carried out more than 350 air raids on Chechnya
in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The raids came after Muslim militants based in the Chechnya
twice infiltrated neighboring Daghestan, seeking to create an
independent Islamic state in southern Russia. The militants have
also been blamed for a series of apartment bombings in Moscow and
other Russian cities last month that killed about 300 people.
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said Russia would
regard a Chechen parliament elected in 1996 as "the sole
legislative organ of authority." That parliament was dismissed
earlier this year by President Aslan Maskhadov.
</P>
<P>
Ali Alavdinov, speaker of the 1996 parliament, said its members
would set up a government-in-exile and asked President Boris
Yeltsin to help normalize the situation in Chechnya, Interfax
reported.
</P>
<P>
"We support the use of force against gangsters, but so-called
pinpoint strikes against peaceful towns and villages must not be
allowed," Chechen parliamentarians said in an appeal made public
by the Government Information Department.
</P>
<P>
"Thousands of people in Chechnya find themselves the hostages
of gangster and radical extremist groups, while thousands have
become displaced persons and refugees," it said.

<HEADLINE> UNDP Calls for Dialogue on Older Persons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Dialogue across the
generations is urgently needed in solving the global problem of
increasing older persons, said United Nations Development Program
(UNDP) Administrator Mark Malloch Brown Friday.
</P>
<P>
The number of those over 60 is expected to surpass those under
15 worldwide for the first time in history by 2050, he said in a
message marking the International Day of Older Persons which falls
on October 1.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that developing countries are likely to host 19
percent of the people aged above 60 in 2050 and 30 percent in 2150
from the current level of eight percent.
</P>
<P>
"We realize that increasingly, families are unable to
adequately care for their elderly. Social security has become a
key issue everywhere," the UNDP chief said.
</P>
<P>
He saw dialogue as a way to better deal with the issue of
caring for all generations when the older persons need to stay
active while the youth's employment cannot be forgotten.
</P>
<P>
"Bringing all generations into the global development dialogue
is key to a more peaceful and prosperous 21st century," Brown
declared.
</P>
<P>
A UNDP-sponsored international dialogue was held in Washington
in January, attracting 112 countries to participate in discussions
for a common future with a fair chance for all.
</P>
<P>
The initiative is now being followed up through national and
regional intergenerational dialogues in a number of countries,
such as Argentina, Bangladesh, Nigeria, Paraguay, Romania and
South Africa, UNDP said.

<HEADLINE> Seychelles Becomes First to Ratify UN Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The Republic of
Seychelles has becomes the first country to formally ratify a new
United Nations convention to protect children against harmful or
abusive working conditions, a U.N. release said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The treaty, known as the Worst Forms of Child Labor
Convention, was adopted unanimously in June by the 174 member
countries of the International Labor Organization (ILO).
</P>
<P>
The ILO estimates that as many as 250 million children are
economically active worldwide, with many millions working in
conditions that are detrimental to their physical, mental and
emotional well being and that prevent them growing into healthy,
productive adults.
</P>
<P>
The Convention defines the worst of child labor as, or
similar practices such as the sale and trafficking of children,
debt bondage, serfdom and forced compulsory labor, compulsory
recruitment of children in armed conflict, the use of children
in prostitution or pornography or in illicit activities such as
drug production and trafficking, and work which is likely to
harm their health, safety or morals.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabweans Told to Live Traditional Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe Friday appealed to Zimbabweans to stick to the country's
traditional way of life in order to overcome the HIV/AIDS scourge.
</P>
<P>
At an occasion to mark International Day of the Elderly in
Harare, Mugabe said the country's young generation were easily
influenced by western type of life which was contributing to the
spread of the AIDS pandemic.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, having a population of about 12.5 million, is one of
the African countries with the highest rate of AIDS cases, and
1,200 people die of AIDS each week in the southern African
country.
</P>
<P>
He also said the issue of elderly people had become a matter of
great concern to both the communities in which they live and to
the government.
</P>
<P>
"The needs of those aged 60 years and above are quite many and
diverse in our country and as such government alone can not
adequately meet them due to constraints of resources and
capacity," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Realizing such limitations, the government has decided to go
into partnerships with voluntary organizations and others in
providing quality service to the elderly population in Zimbabwe,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Putin Hails Russia's Ties With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin said here Friday that a stable and constructive strategic
partnership between Russia and China conforms with the interests
of both countries.
</P>
<P>
At a luncheon hosted by Chinese Ambassador to Russia Wu Tao
marking the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic
ties between Beijing and Moscow, Putin said history has proven
that Russia and China have no alternative but to develop friendly
and good-neighborly ties on the basis of mutual respect and
equality.
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union established diplomatic relations with China on
October 2, 1949, just one day after the founding of the People's
Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Putin praised China's achievements made in the past five
decades, saying the birth of new China was a major event in the
20th century that exerted profound influences on the historical
development in Asia and the world at large.
</P>
<P>
"Our great neighbor has made remarkable achievements in various
social and economic fields" and secured its worthy position in the
world community of nations.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Wu, for his part, said the two countries will see
their friendly cooperation further develop smoothly. "We will
remain good friends, good neighbors and good partners forever," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Wu said China and Russia face the common task of developing
their economies and invigorating their nations and they share the
same concerns in safeguarding national independence, sovereignty
and territorial integrity. The two countries, therefore,
understand and support each other.
</P>
<P>
Other Russian guests present at the luncheon in the Chinese
Embassy included Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and former prime
ministers Yevgeny Primakov and Sergei Kiriyenko.
</P>
<P>
Before the luncheon, Putin, entrusted by President Boris
Yeltsin, met with Wu Tao in the Kremlin and conveyed Yeltsin's
warm regards to Chinese President Jiang Zemin and his own
greetings to Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji.

<HEADLINE> Putin's Approval Rate Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin's popularity rose sharply last month, making him the "hero"
of the week from September 18 to 25, the Interfax news agency
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Putin's actions commanded the attention of 36 percent of
Russians on September 25, compared to between 14-15 percent on
September 18, the Public Opinion service said in reporting polls
on the two days.
</P>
<P>
Not even Yevgeny Primakov ever enjoyed such public interest
when he was prime minister between September 1998 and May 1999,
though he was consistently showing top popularity ratings, Public
Opinion said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,500 people were questioned in each of September's
polls. It's not clear what the margin of error was.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of those whom Putin gave a good impression
surged to 51 percent on September 25 from 42 percent a week
before. The proportion of those who disliked him dwindled to 7
percent down from 9 percent, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
Confidence in Putin swelled to 31 percent from 23 percent while
the percentage of people mistrusting him dropped from 27 percent
to 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
In a survey on August 14, only 5 percent of those polled said
they trusted Putin while 29 percent had no confidence in him.
</P>
<P>
The poll also showed that Putin could be one of the leading
candidates if the next presidential election were held now instead
of in mid-2000 as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
When naming Putin as the new prime minister on August 9,
President Boris Yeltsin has also appointed him as his preferred
successor in the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
Those willing to have him as president accounted for 10 percent
of the population by September 25 compared with 7 percent a week
before and with between 1 percent and 2 percent immediately after
he became prime minister.
</P>
<P>
One-third of Russians think a strong will is Putin's main
personal characteristic.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Gunmen's Demand on Helicopter Denied by Thai Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The Thai police has denied the
demand of Myanmar gunmen, who stormed Myanmar embassy in Thailand
and took about 20 people hostage earlier Friday, of being provided
with a helicopter to fly to the Thai-Myanmar border, a
well-informed source told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the 12 gunmen, calling themselves "Vigorous
Burmese Students Warriors", took the embassy, they faxed to
Asiaworks Television Ltd, a local media group, their demands.
</P>
<P>
The demands include all political prisoners in Myanmar being
immediately released, the Myanmar government entering dialogue
with the opposition and convening a democratic parliament.
</P>
<P>
They also asked for a helicopter which can carry 20 people and
fly to the Thai-Myanmar border and for food for the hostages.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Myanmar government has authorized its ambassador
to Thailand, who apparently is not among those taken hostage, to
be responsible for all the negotiations with the Thai sides on
measures to be taken against the gunmen, the source said.
</P>
<P>
The 12 heavily armed men stormed the Myanmar Embassy in
Thailand at about 11:45 a.m. local time (0445 GMT). Soon after
that shots of guns were heard and residents living nearby reported
to the police.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 people inside the embassy at the moment were taken
hostage, including a counsellor of the embassy, while three of
them were released later.
</P>
<P>
Chatchawal Suksumjit, spokesman of Royal Thai Police, told
Xinhua that no hostage has been hurt so far.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, he confirmed the number of the gunmen was at
12, but was unable to give the exact figure of hostages.
</P>
<P>
At about 3 p.m. local time (0800 GMT), one of the gunmen was
seen stepping out of the embassy and was immediately taken into
custody by the Thai policemen surrounding the embassy.
</P>
<P>
He was believed to be the one who will conduct negotiations
with the Thai police.
</P>
<P>
A Thai policeman released earlier said that the gunmen claimed
they are carrying assault rifles and 20 handgrenades.
</P>
<P>
Thai police has blocked the roads leading to the Myanmar
Embassy in downtown Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai said he was following the
situation closely and Interior Minister Sanan Kachornprasart
directed security operations from the scene.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Personal Income, Spending Up in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Americans' personal income
rose in August but their spending increased much faster, leaving
the nation's savings rate matching a record low, the Commerce
Department reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Personal income, which includes wages, interest and government
benefits, rose a faster-than-expected 0.5 percent in August,
following a 0.2 percent increase in July. Wages rose 0.6 percent
in August.
</P>
<P>
But spending went up 0.9 percent in August, more than many
analysts had expected. In July, spending rose 0.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Because consumer spending has repeatedly outpaced incomes, the
nation's savings rate, savings as a percentage of after-tax
income, has set a string of record lows this year. In August, the
savings rates was minus 1.5 percent, matching the record low set
in May.
</P>
<P>
A major reason for the negative savings rate, economists say,
is that the stock market is boosting Americans' net worth and
making them more comfortable about dipping into savings to pay for
their spending sprees.
</P>
<P>
Spending on durable goods, big-ticket manufactured items
expected to last at least three years such as washing machines and
cars, rose 2.6 percent in August, compared with a decline of 0.7
percent in July.
</P>
<P>
For nondurable goods, such as food and fuel, spending went up
by 0.8 percent, more than the 0.3 percent gain the month before.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the government reported that the nation's economic
growth slowed to an annual rate of 1.6 percent in the second
quarter, the smallest gain in four years. However, many private
economists believe that was only a temporary lull and are
expecting growth in the existing third quarter to be considerably
higher.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve, seeking to slow the economy and keep
inflation at bay, bumped up interest rates twice this summer,
making borrowing more expensive. Fed policy-makers meet again on
Tuesday and many economists doubt another rate increase is in the
offing, although some say it is a close call.

<P>
Addressing the 54th session of the United Nations General
Assembly, Bilivia's Minister of Foreign Affairs Javier Murillo
De La Rocha said its function as a source of channeling official
aid for development has been limited by the privatization of
financial groups and technology that go from industrialized
nations to emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
Its role as a forum for negotiation and coalescing between
the North and the South, between developed and developing
nations is being postponed by a new and different structure
which reevolves around technical mechanism such as the
international monetary fund, the World Bank and the World Trade
Organization where the negotiating arms are structured in a very
different way from the traditional one, the Minister said.
</P>
<P>
The role of the United Nations as a collective security system
sometimes seems to be overwhelmed by the unilateral action of
nations or groups of nations intent of their agendas prevailing
over the world mechanism, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Minister urged to reform the United Nations, saying that
Bolivia, as always, is willing to contribute its part.

UNITED NATIONS, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Land-locked Tajikistan

<HEADLINE> Israeli, Palestinian Officials to Meet Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
officials are scheduled to meet again Saturday evening to iron out
differences over the opening of the southern safe passage route
linking Gaza and the West Bank, Israel Radio said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted Israeli security officials as saying that the
two sides have held several intensive meetings recently to discuss
the security issues relating to the route, but some differences
still remain.
</P>
<P>
One of the points of contention is Israel's demand of the right
to arrest wanted "terrorist suspects" who are passing the route,
which was refused by the Palestinians. The Palestinian side
insists that the route should be a safe passage, not a trap, for
all Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Israel also demands the right to issue magnetic cards for the
Palestinians using the route, but the Palestinian side said that
is their responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ehud Barak said Thursday that the route should
be opened on Sunday, saying the opening of the route is part of
the implementation of the signed agreement between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The route, which will link Gaza and the West Bank city of
Hebron, is to be open from 7 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. and the
Palestinians will have to apply for permits beforehand and undergo
security checks.
</P>
<P>
Authorized buses will travel daily from Gaza along the route,
and several times a week a convoy of buses accompanied by an
Israeli border police escort will use the route.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli groups for and against the opening of the
safe passage are both scheduled to hold demonstrations on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Health of Tanzania's Nyerere Keeps Worsening </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The health of the founding
father of Tanzania Julius Nyerere, who is suffering from leukemia
and in a critical condition at St. Thomas Hospital in London,
kept worsening Friday, an official statement said.
</P>
<P>
Doctors have given medicine to the 77-year-old statesman so
that he could sleep and take a good rest, said a statement issued
here by the President's Press Secretary Geoffrey Nkurlu, who has
informed the mass media four times Friday.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere, suffering from chronic lymphocytic leukemia and
jaundice, has been sent to the intensive care unit.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian government is trying to get the best treatment
available in Britain for Nyerere, who was admitted to the hospital
one week ago.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa has asked the nation to pray
for elderly African statesman.
</P>
<P>
The Minister of Administration and Local Government, Kingunge
Ngombale- Mwiru, left Tanzanian capital Dar es Salaam for London
Tuesday to administer issues concerning Nyerere in collaboration
with Tanzanian High Commission in Britain.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere led the then Tanganyika to independence from Britain in
1961 and masterminded its union with Zanzibar isles in 1964 to
form Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
After retiring as president in 1985, he played an advisory role
in both Tanzanian politics and African affairs. He tirelessly
mediated Burundi peace talks in the past four years.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere is highly respected as Mwalimu, or teacher in
nation-building, for his wisdom and integrity.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Changes Its National Flag </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan government has
decided to change the country's national flag and adopt a new
motto in a bid to scrap all divisive elements contained in these
symbols.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken Thursday during a cabinet meeting
chaired by Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu.
</P>
<P>
The new flag's colors are "blue" and "green" with sunrise in
the middle, in replacement of the old "red-yellow-green and an "r"
in the middle," state-run Radio Rwanda announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
The new motto is "unity-work-patriotism" in replacement of
"liberty- cooperation- progress" which Rwanda has used since its
independence from Belgium in 1962.
</P>
<P>
In relation to these changes, the government has called upon
the Ministry of Local Government to organize contests to create a
new national anthem with suitable words inspired by the
above-proposed motto.
</P>
<P>
Changing the flag, motto, anthem, names of streets and public
places has been on the agenda of the current government which took
over in July 1994, in the aftermath of one of the worst genocides
of the century which claimed the lives of more than 500,000
people.
</P>
<P>
The current motto, court of arms, anthem, and names of streets
and public places reflect the Hutu extremist ideology which
culminated into the genocide.

<HEADLINE> GA to Discuss Possible Policy Recommendations on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Challenging and changing
the negative stereotypes treating aging as a disease or
affliction is a major objective of many delegates and
non-governmental officials as the United Nations General Assembly
prepares to discuss possible policy recommendations on aging
issues in a two-day debate on 4 to 5 October, U.N. said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Far from treating aging as a drag on development and on
societies, the General Assembly's approach to aging issues has
concentrated on promoting the idea that older persons are regarded
as valuable human resources, not discardable cast-offs, and on
policies that allow societies to provide for the needs of the
elderly and that allow older persons to fully participate in
society.
</P>
<P>
Already growing at ever-increasing rates, the world's aging
population is expected to grow even faster in the first half of
the twenty-first century. The over-80 population, which numbered
only 26.7 million in 1970, grew to 66 million by 1998. In 2050,
the ranks of that age group will swell to 370.4 million, if
current trends continue.
</P>
<P>
Th increased older-person population represents major advances
in health care and public health policies that have allowed more
people to live longer. For government officials and policy makers,
the increase in the number of older persons poses major
challenges, with older people often requiring special attention
for their health care, transportation, and social needs.
</P>
<P>
The International Year of Older Person 1999, promoting the them
of "Towards a Society for All Ages," has been instrumental in
focusing global attention on aging issues.

<HEADLINE> IMF, Philippines Reach Agreement on Economic Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) and the Philippines have reached an agreement on the
outlines of the macro-economic framework for 2000 and the
government's policy plans in support of those targets, according
to a joint statement released on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which still has to be ratified by the Philippine
president and IMF management, paves the way toward release of the
next tranche of about 290 million U.S. dollars, subject to
approval by the IMF's executive board.
</P>
<P>
Real gross domestic product (GDP) is targeted to broaden and
accelerated to 4-5 percent next year, and inflation is to be
contained at 6-7 percent. Real GDP is expected to increase 3-3.5
percent this year while inflation to end the year below the
program target of 7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
"In support of these objectives, it was agreed that fiscal
policy should remain accommodative in 1999, while ensuring that
the deficit is kept under control," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
But it added that as the recovery gains momentum, a measured
shift toward the necessary medium-term fiscal consolidation is
envisaged for next year.
</P>
<P>
Besides the discussions on macroeconomic policies, the IMF and
the Philippine delegation also discussed the government's
structural reform priorities.
</P>
<P>
"There was agreement on the specific steps to be taken in the
various refrom areas, including the banking, corporate and power
sectors, as well as on tax administration and other public sector
reforms," the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Britain Hits at French Decision on Beef Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Britain said Friday that France's
decision not to lift its ban on British beef imports had
"seriously underestimated" measures taken to ensure the beef was
safe.
</P>
<P>
British Agriculture Minister Nick Brown Friday told BBC that he
had seen advice presented to the French government by its
scientific committee and it seemed to have "seriously
underestimated the very powerful public protection measures" in
place in Britain.
</P>
<P>
"The European Union imposed the ban," Brown said. "We didn't
like it... but we obeyed the law. The EU has lifted the ban and it
is for our partners in the EU to obey the law."
</P>
<P>
France said it was keeping its embargo since there were
insufficient "scientific guarantees" to lift it. It made the
decision after the publication of a report by the French Health
and Food Safety Agency, according to earlier reports.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission ruled on July 23 that the three-year EU
ban on British beef exports should be lifted on August 1.
</P>
<P>
The 15-member EU imposed the ban in 1996 when the mad cow
crisis erupted in Britain. The ban wiped out markets worth almost
1 billion U.S. dollars a year and hammered an industry also
weakened by a strong pound, low prices and falling exports. As a
result, British farmers say they are enduring their worst crisis
since the 1930s Depression.
</P>
<P>
Brown said he had spoken to his French counterpart, Jean
Glavany, and made it clear the government's case was based on
science and the technical implementation of the export scheme. He
urged sceptics to visit Britain and see for themselves.
</P>
<P>
"I have repeatedly offered to all our EU partners that they
should come and see for themselves and have it explained," he
said. "We've proved our point to everybody that has come and asked
to inspect, that British beef is amongst the safest in the world."

including the pressing African problems regarding development,
debts, technology transfer and combating terrorism, Hassan said.

<P>
African and EU countries are expected to discuss ways of
enhancing bilateral and multilateral cooperation in the political
and economic fields in a bid to promote the development of the
African continent.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Nuclear Accident More Serious Than Believed: U.N. </HEADLINE>

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA) said Friday that the Tokaimura nuclear
accident in Japan appears to have been more serious than
originally thought, according to a U.N. spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Some 39 workers at the plant were exposed to radiation,
including three seriously exposed in the accident which took place
Thursday, spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
Despite IAEA's offer to send an expert team to Japan, the
authorities have declined the offer at the moment, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese delegate to an IAEA conference in Vienna said the
accident was under control and that there was no longer any
radiation risk to the population.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that the accident
is not likely to have any public health impact beyond the local
population.
</P>
<P>
The accident is certainly not a concern beyond the Japanese
territory, WHO said.

WASHINGTON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
has asked for a review of safety procedures at U.S. nuclear fuel
fabrication plants after this week's nuclear accident in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said Friday that he had "a pretty good level of
confidence" that the commercial plants in the United States are
being operated safely.
</P>
<P>
However, the accident in Japan "should again sensitize us to
the importance of... nuclear safety," he said, adding that he
wants "to make sure we've done everything to protect ourselves."
</P>
<P>
There are seven nuclear fuel fabrication plants in the United
States, all operated by private companies to produce fuel for
commercial reactors.
</P>
<P>
The accident in Japan occurred at a fuel fabrication plant,
similar to the U.S. plants, although the fabrication process in
Japan is somewhat different, a nuclear expert was quoted by AP

<HEADLINE> Mexico Earthquake Toll Rises to 23 Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The 7.4 Richter degree
earthquake that shook 13 Mexican states Thursday left 23 dead and
50 injured, as well as hundreds of buildings and houses damaged or
destroyed, the authorities said Friday.
</P>

<HEADLINE> European Stock Markets Hit By U.S. Data </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Europe's main stock markets
closed firmly in the red Friday as sentiment took a hit from
stronger-than-expected U.S. economic data.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. data sparked a mild sell-off in Europe after a
relatively subdued performance for most of the session. London was
the biggest loser as it fell 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE ended down 59 points at 5,970, below the
psychologically important 6,000 level. The drop left the UK's blue
chip index down 0.6 percent for the week.
</P>
<P>
The UK's airports operator BAA led the index down as a profit
warning wiped 17 percent off its shares.
</P>
<P>
The company said the abolition of European Duty Free is having
a greater impact on profits than expected and shares in the
company nosedived 107p to 507p.
</P>
<P>
Oil giant BP Amoco, which accounts for around 9 percent of the
FTSE 100's market capitalization, was one of the few bright spots.
The share rose 26 to 1,135.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, the electronic Xetra Dax recovered more than half
its earlier losses to close 0.5 percent lower at 5,124.55, a fall
of 25 points.
</P>
<P>
Paris shares ended down but off session lows on the day as
strong U.S. and European data rekindled fears of further interest
rate hikes. The Cac-40 index ended down 0.89 percent at 4,550.57
points.

<HEADLINE> Argentine Criticizes Spain's Meddling in Chile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Argentine President Carlos
Menem said Friday that the Pinochet case "is a direct
interference" of the Spanish justice in the domestic affairs of
Chile.
</P>
<P>
The crimes that "dictator Pinochet" may have committed in Chile
cannot be tried in Spain, said Menem in New York in an interview
for the U.S. CNN TV network newscast in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
The Pinochet case "is damaging in some measure the Chilean
sovereignty," said the Argentine president, adding that the
Spanish judge, but "not the Spanish State", violates with his
attitude the nations' territoriality principle.
</P>
<P>
Menem reaffirmed his refusal to attend the 9th Iberoamerican
Summit to be held in November in Havana if the Pinochet case is
not solved by then according to the desires of the Chilean
government, which demanded the release of the former dictator.
</P>
<P>
The Argentine president said that his absence from the Havana
meeting is a gesture of solidarity with his Chilean counterpart
Eduardo Frei, who also cancelled his attendance to the summit as a
protest for Pinochet's detention.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet was detained October 16 of 1998 in London at the
request of Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon, when he was convalescing
of surgery in his spine.
</P>
<P>
A British court will decide next October 8 whether Pinochet is
extradited to Spain, where the Spanish judge wants to try him for
crimes against humanity during the 1973-1990 military regime in
Chile.
</P>
<P>
Menem, who has been ruling Argentina since 1989, said he will
seek a no consecutive second reelection in the presidential
elections of the year 2003 after the voting of next October 24, in
which his successor will be elected.
</P>
<P>
"We are preparing for this, since my life would not have any
sense without a reelection," he said.
</P>
<P>
Menem said that his government has been the most successful of
all the times in Argentina because he eradicated inflation,
reduced unemployment, and opened the country to the world.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed the failures of his regime, saying "I cannot erase
with my elbow what I did with my hand."

<HEADLINE> HKSAR Fully Committed to Rule of Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) government is fully committed to
maintaining the rule of law in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
This was said by a spokesman for the HKSAR Chief Executive's
Office here Saturday in response to media inquiries regarding the
rule of law.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong will continue to play a constructive role in the
development of the nation, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that interpreting the Basic Law to resolve
the right of abode issue has not damaged the rule of law or the
common law system in Hong Kong. It was legal and constitutional to
seek an interpretation from the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress (NPC) to resolve the issue. This was entirely in
accordance with the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
The Government respects the right of final adjudication of the
Court of Final Appeal. We are assessing the application of about 3,
700 people who claimed the right of abode according to the Court
of Final Appeal's decision of January 29, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The right of final adjudication by the Court of Final Appeal is
distinct from the right of final interpretation of the Basic Law
by the NPC Standing Committee. Both constitutional rights are
protected by the Basic Law and have been respected throughout the
process.
</P>
<P>
Interpretation of the Basic Law to resolve the right of abode
issue received majority support in the Legislative Council.
According to opinion polls, it also received wide public support.
</P>
<P>
The legal system is Hong Kong is firmly entrenched and
protected by the Basic Law. In the two years since the transition,
the Judiciary has continued to administer justice fairly and
impartially, the spokesman concluded.

<HEADLINE> Congolese Rebels Warn Against Repeated Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Congolese rebels have threatened
to resume war if attacks by President Laurent Desire Kabila's
forces are not stopped, Rwandan News Agency (RNA) reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The warning followed an outbreak of heavy fighting in the
eastern city of Kabinda Saturday morning with Kabila's loyalist
forces supported by Zimbabwean troops and Rwandan renegade former
government soldiers and "Interahamwe" militia attacking the
positions of the rebels at Munyenga.
</P>
<P>
Munyenga, 12 kilometers southwest of Kabinda, is a strategic
locality on the Ngandanjika road heading towards Mbuji-Mayi, the
diamond-rich city, targeted by Congolese rebels.
</P>
<P>
Kabinda, about 180 kilometers southeast of Mbuji-Mayi, is under
siege by Congolese rebels since June, with many Zimbabweans
reportedly trapped there.
</P>
<P>
"The fighting started at 3:00 a.m (GMT) with Kabila's forces
launching a surprise attack on our positions, and is still
continuing," Lambert Mende, spokesman for the Congolese Rally for
Democracy (RCD) - Goma told RNA in a satellite phone interview
from the northeast city.
</P>
<P>
"This is the biggest attack ever since we signed the Lusaka
accord," Mende highlighted, saying that Kabila has renounced to
the peace deal.
</P>
<P>
Mende said that the attack involved a battalion of Congolese
forces, together with the Zimbabweans and the Rwandan Hutu
extremist forces, supported by 14 tanks and a heavy artillery.
</P>
<P>
"We will not continue to be on the defensive," RCD
Vice-President Moise Nyarugabo told RNA, saying that the Lusaka
accord is in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
He said that so far Kabila's forces and the rebels have been
engaged in skirmishes until Saturday when the attack escalated the
situation to the intolerable level.
</P>
<P>
He said that the RCD has informed Zambian President Frederic
Chiluba, Secretary General of the Organization of African Unity,
about Kabila's violations of the accord.
</P>
<P>
"Our political bureau is currently holding an emergency session
to decide on appropriate reaction to Kabila's provocations," Mende
said.
</P>
<P>
The RCD rebels and Kabila's government have blamed each other
for breaching the Lusaka ceasefire agreement.

<HEADLINE> Wild Life in Ethiopia Endangered: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The wild life in the
Ethiopian rift valley lakes region are exposed to extinction due
to human activities, the Ethiopian News Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to a paper presented to a two-day workshop ending
here Friday on biodiversity conservation, human needs for
agriculture, settlement, fishery, irrigation and industrialization
as well as deforestation are heavily influencing the wild life
resources in the region.
</P>
<P>
The paper, under the entitle "Wild Life Diversity Threats in
the Rift Valley Ecosystem", said that the residuals from the
textile and ceramic factories located at the vicinities of lakes
Abaya and Awassa as well as the soda ash plant pose a significant
threat on mammalian and bird species.
</P>
<P>
The rapid population growth, pollution, over-exploitation of
resources, poor farming and husbandry practices, lack of clear
land use policy and low public awareness were among the major
causes of wild life diversity loss in the rift valley ecosystem,
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
It said Ethiopia, being a member state to Biodiversity
Convention and signatory to the "Agreement to African Eurasian
Migratory Birds", shares a bigger responsibility to conserve and
sustainably manage these valuable resources.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Vice Admiral Abdul Aziz has
been appointed as Pakistan's new chief of the Naval Staff
replacing Fasih Bukhari who has sought retirement.
</P>
<P>
Aziz, who is the most senior man in Pakistan's navy after
Bukhari, has also been promoted to the rank of Admiral, according
an official handout.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said earlier that Navy Chief Admiral Fasih
Bukhari resigned Saturday after a meeting with Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Bukhari held a meeting with Sharif where he presented his
resignation which was accepted by the prime minister, according to
a report by Pakistan Television (PTV).
</P>
<P>
However, PTV failed to give any reasons for the resignation of
the top naval officer.
</P>
<P>
According to News Network International, a private press agency
here, the naval chief resigned because he was superseded by
General Pervez Musharaff in his appointment as chairman of Joint
Chiefs of Staff Committee (JCSC) on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Bukhari was appointed chief of the Naval Staff on May 2, 1997.

<HEADLINE> Greece Pledges to Support Cyprus on All Fronts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Greek Defense Minister Akis
Tsohatzopoulos Saturday reiterated here that Cyprus has Greece's
unwavering support on all fronts.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a meeting with Cyprus' Parliament President
Spyros Kyprianou, he said the strategy is based on two pillars,
namely to make Cyprus a full member of the European Union (EU) and
to boost its defenses.
</P>
<P>
"If we continue steadily on this track, we shall be in a
position to meet any challenge ahead," he added.
</P>
<P>
Tsohatzopoulos noted that all developments should be monitored
carefully in order to respond positively to any move leading to a
just, acceptable and democratic solution to the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus and Greece reached an agreement in November, 1993 that
Greece will offer Cyprus land, sea and air cover in the event of
fresh Turkish attacks.
</P>
<P>
Kyprianou said they discussed the prospects and possible
developments in the Cyprus issue and agreed that EU accession
is a primary objective.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus applied for EU membership in 1990 and started
substantive accession negotiations with the EU in November 1998.
It hopes to be admitted as an EU member by January 2003.
</P>
<P>
Tsohatzopoulos is here on a four-day official visit. Earlier
Saturday, he was briefed by Cyprus' National Guard leaders about
the annual military exercise "Nikiforos '99" which started
Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Famous Lebanese Singer Accused of Insulting Islam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 2 (Xinhua) -- A renowned Lebanese singer was
accused of allegedly insulting Islam by using a chapter from the
Muslim holy book, the Koran, in his song, the Voice of the People
radio quoted judicial sources as saying Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Beirut's judge Abdelrahman Shihab said in his formal
accusation that Marcel Khalife insulted religious rituals by
using a chapter of Koran in his song.
</P>
<P>
He demanded an imprisonment of the artist from six months to
three years, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Khalife, 49, is very famous in both Lebanon and the Arab
world. His songs were particularly popular among young Lebanese
during the country's 15-year civil war that ended in 1990.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, he faced a similar charge for the same song, which is
included in his 1995 album "Arabic Coffeepot", but then Prime
Minister Rafik Hariri ordered the case to be dropped after
widespread protests.
</P>
<P>
After studying the judge's accusation, the Beirut prosecutor
will set a date for a court hearing.

<HEADLINE> Sporadic Ground Fighting Reported in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 2 (Xinhua) -- There has been sporadic fighting
between Russian federal troops and armed rebels in the breakaway
republic of Chechnya, the Itar-Tass news agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Although some federal units have arrived inside the North
Caucasus republic, the Russian army's General Staff First Deputy
Chief Valery Manilov said a large-scale ground operation in
Chechnya "is not being conducted and is not planned to be
conducted."
</P>
<P>
He said the troops in Chechnya are to set up a "security zone",
and the artillery and air power is "making and will be making
strikes" on the guerrilla's fortified positions that stand in the
way of federal troops.
</P>
<P>
Also on Saturday, Tass reported that the federal troops have
occupied Borozdinovka, the first Chechen village to be seized
following about two weeks' of air strikes on rebel positions.
</P>
<P>
The village is about three kilometers from Chechnya's border
with Dagestan. The entry into the village, proceeded by artillery
shelling, went without hindrance, Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
In Ingush, another Russian region bordering Chechnya, federal
tanks also pounded rebel positions on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The federal assaults on Chechnya are a response to the seizure
of villages in neighboring Dagestan in August and September by
Chechen-led rebels seeking to establish a separate Islamic state.
They are also Moscow's answer to a string of terrorist bombings
that have killed about 300 people since August 3. Authorities
blame the bombings on Chechens, but the Chechens deny the
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Russian forces launched a disastrous invasion of Chechnya in
mid-December 1994 to quell a secessionist movement. They were
driven out in 1996 after 80,000 people died, most of them
civilians or untrained Russian conscripts.
</P>
<P>
Many warned against another large-scale ground operation in
Chechnya amid reports that the Kremlin has approved a Defense
Ministry plan for such an operation.

</P>
<P>
The BAMWSP was launched with assistance from the World Bank and
the Swiss Development Corporation to address the issue of arsenic
which has already contaminated 211 thanas (sub-districts) covering
more than 20 million people in the country.
</P>
<P>
Hasina directed the concerned authorities to evolve
cost-effective and sustainable technology for ensuring arsenic
mitigation and pure water supply and sanitation services.
</P>
<P>
According to the prime minister, the arsenic contamination in
tube well water was first detected in the country's northern
region in 1993.
</P>
<P>
She called on health and family planning workers, field workers
of the agriculture department, mass communication activists and
socio-cultural and voluntary organizations to prevent people from
drinking arsenic-contaminated water and help them fetch pure
drinking water from other sources, particularly surface water
which is free from arsenic pollution.
</P>
<P>
"We have plenty of surface water and if we can properly tap
this source, our drinking water problem would be greatly solved,"
she said, suggesting selection of at least pond in each village
for using it exclusively for drinking-water purpose and planting
tress around the ponds to keep the water pure and cold.
</P>
<P>
Arsenic, a deadly mineral in water, has so far attacked as many
as 59 out of Bangladesh's 64 districts, according to Minister of
Local Government and Rural Development Zillur Rahman.
</P>
<P>
And arsenic-related diseases have taken on an epidemic form in
21 districts of the country claiming the lives of hundreds of
people, The Independent daily newspaper reported.

<HEADLINE> Leukemia-Hit Nyerere Still in ICU for Rescue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's founding
president Julius Nyerere, admitted in a London hospital for
leukemia last week, remained in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for
rescue following his condition deteriorated Thursday night, a
presidential press release said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"His condition has not become even worse since last night and
the doctors are trying to rescue him with medicine including
tranquilizers," said the release signed by Geoffrey Nkurlu, Press
Secretary to Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa.
</P>
<P>
Nkurlu said that a son and a daughter of Nyerere have left for
London to join Nyerere's wife Maria and two other daughters to
monitor his condition.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa's wife Anna Mkapa, Tanzanian Minister for Regional
Administration and Local Governments Kingunge Ngombale-Mwiru and
other officials are already in St Thomas Hospital in London.
</P>
<P>
Beginning from Friday, Mkapa has been urging his people to pray
for Nyerere's recovery, the release said.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere, 77, was admitted to the Hospital on September 23 when
he was not able to speak with a bit consciousness.
</P>
<P>
Medical tests showed that he has been improving steadily since
then but developed jaundice on September 29, a condition which was
described as normal by doctors treating him.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa confirmed on September 26 at an emergency news conference
in the State House that Nyerere is suffering from chronic
lymphocytic leukemia,

or blood cancer.
</P>
<P>
Since then, many Tanzanians have answered his call to pray for
the recovery of their Father of the Nation.
</P>
<P>
Born in the town of Butiama, Tanganyika in 1922, Nyerere led
the Tanganyika African National Union (TANU) to win an
independence from British colonial rule in 1961.
</P>
<P>
He also united Tanganyika and Zanzibar as one republic in 1964
and became its first president until he retired in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere, who preferred to be called Mwalimu in Kiswahili or
teacher in English, has been a prominent leader on many
Pan-African issues. He has successfully assembled the warring
factions of Burundi to start a tortuous peace process.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has protested to the
United Nations against U.S. interception of civilian vessels
carrying humanitarian aid to Iraq, the Iraqi News Agency INA
reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to U.N. chief Kofi Annan, Iraqi Foreign Minister
Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf said U.S. navy in the Gulf intercepted
and inspected a Danish vessel before approaching Iraqi
territorial waters recently.
</P>
<P>
The vessel carried 3,000 tons of beans imported from the
Philippines, he added.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said U.S. navy also intercepted a Chinese
vessel carrying a power generator and a tugboat imported under the
oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
Under the humanitarian deal, Iraq is allowed to export
limited amount of oil in every six months to buy food,
medicine and other humanitarian supplies for its 24 million
people reeling under harsh U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has long accused the U.S. and Britain of impeding
the implementation of this humanitarian program, which it argues
has failed to alleviate the sufferings of the Iraqi people.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 2 (Xinhua) -- All the major newspapers in
Hong Kong Saturday gave wide coverage to Beijing's Friday parade
in celebration of New China's 50th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
Almost all Hong Kong newspapers carried on their front pages
big photos showing the military part of the parade together with
relevant stories and comments.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Commercial Daily ran a set of photos of the parade on
the front page. It also published President Jiang Zemin's National
Day speech in full, saying China will surely emerge as a
prosperous, strong, democratic and culturally advanced modern
socialist country in the East of the world.
</P>
<P>
Wen Wei Po devoted a total 16 pages to covering the event as
well as the celebration activities in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In addition to photos and stories on the military parade on
Tiananmen Square and Jiang Zemin's speech, Ta Kung Po also ran
detailed reports on the celebration gala at Hong Kong Stadium and
fireworks over the Victoria Harbor Friday marking China's 50th
birthday.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Standard, one of the two local major English
newspapers, said that China celebrated 50 years of the People's
Republic in a vast parade in which the armed forces showcased
their latest military hardware and President Jiang Zemin pledged
to reunify Taiwan with the motherland and to keep China on the
socialist reform road.
</P>
<P>
The other major English newspaper South China Morning Post also
covered the event with photos on many of its pages including the
whole front page, saying that President Jiang marks the

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Independence Day Marked on Low-Key </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria Friday passed its 39th
Independence Day on an unprecedented low-key fashion, The
Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper, reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The usual commemorative parades were cut out by the Federal and
 nearly all the state governments. Only Jos, the capital of
Plateau State, was reported to have an Independence rally.
</P>
<P>
In Nigeria's capital Abuja, actually there was nearly nothing
to indicate the occasion other than President Olusegun Obasanjo' s
nationwide broadcast appealing for intensified input of his
people to "make Nigeria great again", the paper said.
</P>
<P>
It said that a ride through the streets of the capital city
showed significant absence of national flags and banners, which
usually bear nationalistic messages. Also absent was the
nostalgic feeling usually associated with the historic day.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo had reportedly directed that this year's celebration
should be low-key, hence there was no official government program
in Abuja for the National Day.
</P>
<P>
Tafawa Balewa Square, the usual venue for children's march past
during the Independence Day in Lagos, the west African country's
commercial capital, continued to play host to people who came for
the on-going "Motor Fair".
</P>
<P>
A pupil in the square said that "we were told by our teachers
to come here for a march past. When we got here there is nothing
like that, we are going home."

<HEADLINE> Pak Denies Having Postponed Missile Test Due to US Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Saturday rejected
reports that it had postponed the test firing of its most advanced
ballistic missile as a result of so-called American pressure.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Foreign Office spokesman Tariq Altaf described those
reports as "baseless and mischievous" and "Indian inspired".
</P>
<P>
He noted that the U.S. State Department had also denied the
reports which had appeared in Indian newspapers.
</P>
<P>
The reports said Pakistan postponed its test firing of
Ghauri-III missile, the latest version of its Ghauri series of
ballistic missiles with a range up to 3,000 kilometers, at the
last minute due to pressure from the United States a couple of
days ago and then tested the engine for the missile.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman clarified that no flight test of the Ghauri-III
missile had been planned and as such there was no question of its
postponement.
</P>
<P>
He added that the test firing of the engine used in the Ghauri
missile series is a normal practice and is carried out from time
to time.
</P>
<P>
Such routine testing of the engine was carried out a few days
ago, as already reported in the media, the spokesman pointed out,
adding that such testing is obviously different from the flight
testing of a missile.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The HKSAR Secretary for
Justice Elsie Leung Oi-sie Saturday urged Hong Kong legal
professionals to have a better understanding of the legal system
of China's mainland and to explore the direction of its future
development.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a law conference on the development of law and
legal system of the People's Republic of China (PRC), Leung said
that in the past 50 years, China has attained considerable
accomplishments in development of all aspects, and the development
of the contemporary legal system has taken an important step
forward.
</P>
<P>
The conference was held to mark the 50th anniversary of the
founding of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
"Given that Hong Kong is an inalienable part of China, we have
to understand the legal system of the mainland and realize the
role of the laws of Hong Kong in the concept of 'one country, two
systems', so that there can be a smooth implementation of the
Basic Law, " Leung said.
</P>
<P>
Leung said the road to establishing law and order and legal
system in China has had many twists and turns.
</P>
<P>
China has since the late 1970s stressed the principles of "
strengthening the socialist legal system so that there are laws to
be observed, laws must be observe and strictly enforced, and
lawbreakers must be dealt with," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Since the implementation of the 'open-door' policy in 1978,
the National People's Congress and its standing committee have all
along given top priority to legislative work, " said Leung.
</P>
<P>
She added that the 15th National Congress of the Communist
Party of China also put forward the target of "ruling the country
according to the law and building a socialist state with the rule
of law", and proclaimed a progression from "rule by law" to "rule
of law."
</P>
<P>
Leung said the target had been formally adopted in the
constitution earlier this year and there was no turning-back in
the development of the legal system.
</P>
<P>
Advancing into the third millennium, China will speed up its
modernization process and prepare for the accession to the World
Trade Organization, she said.
</P>
<P>
"I believe this will be an opportune moment for the legal
system of our country to develop further towards international
standards," she concluded.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Urges ASEAN to Do More for East Timor Peacekeeping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. Secretary of
Defense William Cohen Saturday urged members of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to make an all-out effort for the
success of the peacekeeping mission to East Timor.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference following his meetings with Singapore
leaders, Cohen said the ASEAN countries should do all that is
necessary to ensure peace is restored in the troubled East Timor
territory.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said all ASEAN countries should be openly and visibly
supportive of these peacekeeping mission and each country has to
make a determination to take its responsibility in the way of
forces and financial contribution.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said the issue now is how to bring peace and stability to
East Timor instead of going back to try to calculate whether the
timing of the referendum was right or wrong.
</P>
<P>
Cohen also said that the bringing forward of the Indonesian
presidential election was a positive news, as this would enable
the new government to quickly set about tackling the problems in
East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Touching on the military ties between Singapore and U.S., Cohen
said the two countries have warm and strong defense relations and
Singapore is one of his country's strongest partners.
</P>
<P>
He also said U.S. aircraft carriers would use Singapore's
Changi naval base when its construction was completed.
</P>
<P>
Cohen arrived in Singapore Friday from Bangkok as part of his
ongoing tour which has already taken him to Jakarta and the
Australian cities of Darwin and Cairns in addition to Bangkok.
From Singapore, he is scheduled to visit Manila before going back
home.

<HEADLINE> Child Labor on Increase in Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Child labor has become a
serious problem in Ethiopia with the number of street children and
child prostitutes increasing steadily, the Ethiopian Herald
newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim Jabr, Representative of the United Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF), was quoted as saying that in Ethiopia the most
vulnerable are the street children, whose number has now reached
about 15,000.
</P>
<P>
Jabr made the remarks at a UNICEF-sponsored forum on child
labor.
</P>
<P>
According to a study funded by the United Nations International
Labor Organization, more than 51 percent of child laborers in
Ethiopia work over nine hours a day.
</P>
<P>
But Jabr observed that Ethiopia has no child soldiers. While
there are about 300,000 child solders in the world at any time, no
child soldier can be found in Ethiopia, he said.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Build More Houses for Low-income People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- As part of its thrust to provide
affordable housing to the low-income people, the Philippine
government will build 150,000 low-cost housing units next year, an
official said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In a radio-TV program, Chairman of the Housing and Urban
Development Coordinating Council (HUDCC) Karina David said that
the funds for these houses are already in the proposed budget for
2000.
</P>
<P>
"With our budget for 2000, we can build a minimum of 150,000
houses," David said.
</P>
<P>
David said the plan to build 150,000 new homes next year is
part of the government's program to build one million socialized
housing units in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
In the past year, she said, the government managed to build
housing units to serve 90,000 families.
</P>
<P>
After consultations with President Joseph Estrada and his
administration's economic managers, David noted the program will
have better terms of payment.
</P>
<P>
These terms include provision for restructuring loans, so
long-time tenants can have a better chance of paying their
obligations, she said.
</P>
<P>
"The reaction has been good from banks. Interest rates have
steadily fallen from 29 to 13 percent," she said.

<HEADLINE> Gold Price Reaches Climax in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Instability in world gold
prices continued to hit Nepalese market Saturday when gold prices
rose by over 200 rupees (3 U.S. dollars) per tola (11.664 grams),
The Kathmandu Post reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Gold per tola was traded at Rs 8400 (120 U.S. dollars) when the
market opened Saturday but it jumped to Rs 8600 (123 U.S. dollars)
during the afternoon, registering the highest price during the
last two years.
</P>
<P>
Local bullion businessmen expressed surprise over the price
fluctuation.
</P>
<P>
"We are totally surprised by the extent of the fluctuation. But
we think this price has reached the highest point and will not
rise further," said Biyaya Tamrakar, executive member of Nepal
Gold and Silver Traders Associations.
</P>
<P>
World gold had been hovering around 20-years low of around 260
dollars an ounce until Monday, depressed by announcement this year
of gold sales by the Bank of England and the Swiss Central Bank as
well as the International Monetary Fund (IMF)'s sale plan.
</P>
<P>
The Cologne Summit of G-7 nations earlier this year agreed that
IMF would sell 300 tons of its gold reserves for the purpose of
debt relief for poor countries.
</P>
<P>
The market in Nepal had seen continuous dropping for gold
prices during the last few months. It reached as low as 7260
rupees (104 U.S. dollars) per tola during the mid-August.
</P>
<P>
However, the world gold prices resumed upward swing this week
when IMF Thursday confirmed that it would not sell gold on the
open market. The Nepali market has followed the trend and saw a
surge in gold prices.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Tobacco Earns 330 Million U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's tobacco selling season
 closed on Friday, with the crop earning 12.6 billion Zimbabwean
dollars (330 million U.S. dollars), well above last seasons's 7.5
billion Zimbabwean dollars.
</P>
<P>
But the increase has failed to arouse excitement among farmers
who attributed the increase to nothing more than the massive
devaluation of the Zimbabwean dollar against major currencies, the
daily Herald reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Their cry could not have been far from the truth as statistics
from last year show that the seasonal average price was 1.73 U.S.
dollars a kilogram compared to this season's 1.74 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
This shows that in real terms there was only a marginal
increase in earnings from the golden leaf this year.
</P>
<P>
By the close of sales on Friday, 191.47 million kilograms had
been sold at the two auction floors, compared to 215 million
kilograms sold last year.
</P>
<P>
Public Affairs Executive of the Zimbabwe Tobacco Association
Oliver Gawe Friday said there was nothing really dramatic in the
earnings as farmers had rarely made much in view of the high cost
of production.
</P>
<P>
Despite this, he said, farmers were still aiming to produce 200
million kilograms in the coming season, assuming the government
honors its promise to reduce and finally scrap the tobacco levy.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is one of the largest tobacco selling markets in the
world. Tobacco is the country's biggest foreign currency earner.

<HEADLINE> SADC States to Cooperate in Culture, Sport and </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African Development
Community (SADC) member states have embarked on efforts to improve
co-operation in the areas of culture, sport and information, Times
of Zambia newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted SADC Coordinator for Sector Renato Matusse as
saying the member states has since started drafting a document
aimed at realizing the set goals of cooperation in the three areas
at the on- going workshop held in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
He said the purpose of the workshop is to identify the best
ways of dealing with the regional problems faced in these areas.
</P>
<P>
Participants would table some of the suggestions to be included
in the final draft document for studying until May.
</P>
<P>
Thereafter, he said, the documents would be submitted for
recommendations by the SADC ministers of culture, sport and child
development.
</P>
<P>
Concerning culture, SADC is working for a corporate protocol in
the region to protect artists against the piracy of their material
by having uniform laws on copyright.
</P>
<P>
Matusse said there is a need to enhance sports exchanges among
SADC members and to form regional teams to compete with those in
other regions of the continent.
</P>
<P>
On information, SADC is looking for the best ways of involving
journalists within the region who best understand the limitations
and resources of the region.
</P>
<P>
"There is an urgent need to develop data bank which would help
promote interactions among the people. But this would only be
achieved if we involve our own journalists as they best know our
limitations and resources, " he said.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Aluminium Smelter Half Completed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The construction of MOZAL
aluminium smelter at Beluluane, 17 kilometers from Mozambique's
capital Maputo, is now over 50 percent complete.
</P>
<P>
With an investment of 1.3 billion U.S. dollars, MOZAL is the
largest foreign project in Mozambique, out of this amount, 520
million dollars comes in the shape of equity and the rest in debt,
 MOZAL Chairman Rob Barbour said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The largest shareholder is the London-based metal company
Billiton, which has 49 percent of the equity. The Japanese company
Mitsubishi holds 26 percent and the South African Industrial
Development Corporation (IDC) has the remaining 25 percent. The
Mozambican government has four percent preference shares.
</P>
<P>
 Currently the construction is ahead of schedule and under
budget, the chairman said, predicting that the smelter will go
into production by the last quarter of the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The raw material, alumina, will be imported from Australia,
and MOZAL is building a berth of its own in the Maputo-Matola
harbour complex where alumina will be unloaded and the finished
aluminium ingots be delivered for exports, Barbour said.
</P>
<P>
Power requirements are being handled by MOTRACO, a consortium
formed by the Mozambican, South African and Swazi electricity
companies. The 450 megawatts required by MOZAL is twice
Mozambique's total current electricity consumption.
</P>
<P>
The MOTRACO substation, fed by two lines from South Africa, one
direct, and one via Swaziland, is on track, Barbour said.
</P>
<P>
The crucial challenge for MOZAL in the year 2000 would be
taking over all the equipment from the contractors and testing it,
he added.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Embassy Hostage Drama Ends in Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The 25-hour-long Myanmar embassy
hostage drama has ended in peace, Thai Interior Minister Sanan
Kachornprasart announced on Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Foreign Minister Sukhumbhand Paribatra and another Thai
official who accompanied the gunmen to a village near the Myanmar
border have returned safe and sound, Sanan said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference held in front of the Myanmar
embassy in downtown Bangkok, Sanan confirmed that the hostage
taking was done by five gunmen instead of 12 as previously
believed.
</P>
<P>
He also said that as many as 96 people were under siege
including the 38 taken hostage and the other 58 were hiding
somewhere within the embassy compound.
</P>
<P>
Sanan said no terrorist accident like this should be allowed to
happen again on the Thai soil.
</P>
<P>
He also pledged that Thailand will protect personal and
property safety to all the people, Thais and foreigners, living in
the country.
</P>
<P>
He called for foreigners living in Thailand to abide by the
Thai laws, or their rights of staying will be deprived, he said.
</P>
<P>
Five heavily armed men, all Myanmar students living in
Thailand, stormed Myanmar embassy in Bangkok at 11:45 a.m. local
time (0445 GMT) on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Wearing headbands, the gunmen dashed into the embassy with
assault rifles and 20 handgrenades. They then dressed some of the
hostages the same attire as them to confuse the police.
</P>
<P>
Those held captive by the gunmen included some Myanmar
diplomats, officials, members of the public and many foreigners.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen then faxed local media their demands, asking the
Myanmar government to immediately release all political prisoners
in Myanmar, enter dialogues with the opposition and convene a
democratic parliament.
</P>
<P>
They also asked for helicopters to take them to the
Thai-Myanmar border.
</P>
<P>
After hours of negotiation, the Thai police agreed to provide
helicopters for the gunmen on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
As there was no enough open space for helicopters' landing in
the embassy compound, the gunmen agreed to take the helicopters in
a military preparatory school, about two kilometers away from the
embassy.
</P>
<P>
Then two minivans taking all the gunmen and some of the
hostages left the Myanmar embassy to the Armed Forces Preparatory
School, where helicopters were waiting.
</P>
<P>
Sukhumbhand, who is now acting as foreign minister, and another
Thai official accompanied the gunmen as a guarantee of safety to
take a helicopter, which flew them to the border village in
Thailand's western province of Ratchaburi.
</P>
<P>
The helicopter then returned with the two Thai officials after
dropping off the gunmen there.
</P>
<P>
There has been no further report on what has happened to the
gunmen and their whereabouts.

</P>
<P>
In the semi-finals on Saturday, European champion Hungary

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Vice-President Urges to Buy Domestic Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Vice-President George
Saitoti Friday called on his people to buy locally produced goods
in an effort to build the economy of the east African country.
</P>
<P>
The idea of importing cheap eggs, meat and vegetables is
"deplorable in a country that can produce them", Saitoti said at a
press conference.
</P>
<P>
He warned that by importing such things Kenyans are killing the
local industries and reducing employment opportunities for the
current and future generations.
</P>
<P>
Saitoti urged Kenyans to back his newly-launched slogan "Buy
Kenya, Build Kenya", noting that it was the only way the economy
could be improved.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan market has been reportedly flooded with cheap
imports, especially those from South Africa.

<P>

policy for dealing with the pensions mis-selling scandal.
</P>
<P>
Daily Telegraph:

<P>
-- Tony Blair intervened on behalf of farmers Friday after

<HEADLINE> Lebanon to Discuss 2000 Budget Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The Lebanese government is
expected to begin discussions next week on the 2000 draft budget
calculating a deficit of 38-39 percent compared with the 41
percent set in this year's budget.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Star on Saturday quoted Lebanese Finance Minister
George Korom as saying he feels confident that his next budget
will accelerate the progress toward fiscal health.
</P>
<P>
"The main aim of the 2000 budget is to underline the
government's determination to reform the finances of the
country," he said Friday upon his return from a week in Washington
for the meeting of the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The total expenditure in the 2000 budget is projected to be
around 5.8 billion U.S. dollars with revenues at 3.8 billion
dollars, in contrast to the current budget's 5.6 billion dollars
spending forecast against projected revenues of 3.4 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The minister predicted that the deficit at the end of 1999 will
reach 41 percent, adding the figure might rise to 44 percent if
spending from outside the budget is included.
</P>
<P>
Some economists dispute Korom's figures, saying that the
deficit for 1999 can actually reach at least 52 percent.
</P>
<P>
Korom said the balance of payments, which registered a
deficit of 34.7 million dollars at the end of August, will
show an improvement following the successful issue of 712
million dollars in sovereign eurobonds last month.
</P>
<P>
The minister also said a rise in the Central Bank's
foreign-currency reserves will increase the chances of achieving
a considerable balance-of-payments surplus.
</P>
<P>
The reserves rose by 100 million dollars to 6.7 billion
dollars between August and the end of September.

</P>
<P>
Al-Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- The ministers of irrigation of Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia
will hold a tripartite meeting in Khartoum, capital of Sudan,
early November. The ministers will discuss rational use of the
Blue Nile waters by the three Nile basin countries, said Egyptian
Minister of Public Works and Water Resources Mahmoud Abu Zeid.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Cancels Cross Subsidies in Phone Calls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique's publicly-owned
telecommunications company, TDM, has increased the prices of
domestic phone calls by 8.9 percent while reducing the prices of
international calls by 2.1 percent, as from Friday.
</P>
<P>
This is part of TDM's declared strategy of eliminating cross
subsidies. In the past, international calls subsidized local ones,
but now, as part of restructuring TDM prior to privatization, this
will no longer happen.
</P>
<P>
The cost of a three-minute local phone call rises from 918 to
1000 meticais (at current exchange rate, one U.S. dollar equals
12,950 meticais).
</P>
<P>
 Long distance calls are much cheaper if made at night or
weekends, while the monthly line rental has been increased by 5.5
percent.

<HEADLINE> American Freedom A Farce: UAE Newspaper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The freedom that the United
States claims to represent and tries to impose on other countries
"is a farce," said a United Arab Emirates (UAE) newspaper
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Dhabi-based daily Al Ittihad based such an argument on
the fact that a UAE journalist was denied entrance to the Epoc
Center in Orlando, Florida, to cover the Disney millennium
exhibition.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, which opened on Friday, has for the past few
weeks generated sharp protests and criticism from Arabs and
Muslims worldwide due to an Israeli exhibit which was said to
depict controversial Jerusalem as the Jewish state's capital.
</P>
<P>
The UAE was at the forefront of the protests and called for a
boycott by Arabs against all Disney products. However, the calls
were rejected by an Arab foreign ministers meeting last week.
</P>
<P>
Disney did not allow Abu Dhabi TV correspondent Wajd Waqfi to
cover the event, apparently because of UAE's tough stance on the
company's siding with Israel and its attempt to distort the nature
of Jerusalem, said the daily, which reflects the government's
views.
</P>
<P>
The issue "calls for second thoughts over the type of freedom
the U.S. represents," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., which has portrayed itself as a model of freedom and
justice, is afraid to open up to the media for fear that its
contradictions will be exposed, said the paper.

NAIROBI, October 2 (Xinhua) -- At least 11 primary school

<HEADLINE> Strong IPO Market in U.S. Reported </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Initial public offering (IPO)
markets for venture capital backed companies in the United States
have been gaining strength, according to a report released Friday.
</P>
<P>
Despite some turbulence in the public equity markets, said the
National Venture Capital Association (NVCA), 84 venture-backed
companies went public raising 5.9 billion U.S. dollars in the
third quarter. Total valuation of those companies on the IPO date
was 33.8 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to NVCA, 180 venture-backed companies have raised 13
billion dollars through IPOs, after three quarters in 1999. In
1996, the previous record year for venture-backed IPOs, 12.3
billion dollars was raised.
</P>
<P>
In addition, average offer sizes and average post offer
valuations continue to grow. At the end of the third quarter, the
average offer size has leaped to 72 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
A strong IPO market is essential to high levels of new venture
investment, said NVCA, which described the current market
environment as "extremely healthy."
</P>
<P>
According to NVCA, venture capital funds will only invest in an
entrepreneurial company if there is reasonable assurance that the
investment can be exited during the life of the fund, typically
five to eight years.
</P>
<P>
NVCA's report noted "a huge wave of technology IPOs." Among the
84 venture-backed companies that went public during the third
quarter were 27 Internet, 26 computer software and service, and 10
communications companies.

<P>
BEIRUT, October 2 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli soldier was wounded
in south Lebanon in an attack on Friday launched by Lebanese
guerrillas, Lebanese security sources said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The soldier was injured when his outpost at Rihan in the
central sector of the Israeli occupied border zone in south
Lebanon was attacked by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has claimed
responsibility for the attack.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 to protect its north from Lebanese guerrillas'
cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to oust Israeli troops out of the
country.

<P>
NAIROBI, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
has expressed optimism here that the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) will resume their aid to Kenya
soon.
</P>
<P>
The East African Standard daily Saturday quoted Moi as saying
that the ongoing negotiation between Kenya and foreign donors in
Washington is going well and his government is confident about the
funds.
</P>
<P>
However, he criticized on Friday some Kenyans who opposed aid
resumption to Kenya and wanted the collapse of his government,
adding that these people are ignorant of the reality that Kenyans
are going through hard times.
</P>
<P>
Kenya has witnessed an economic recession since1997 when the
IMF halted a three-year 205 million U.S. dollar loan as a protest
at the poor governance and corruption in the east African country.

<HEADLINE> McHale, Thompson to be Inducted to Basketball Hall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Kevin McHale, part of
arguably the best front line in NBA history, and John Thompson,
who helped create one of the best programs in college basketball,
will be inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame Friday night in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
Contributor Wayne Embry, former women's college coach Billie
Moore, and the late Fred Zollner will also be inducted.
</P>
<P>
A nominee needed 18 of 24 votes from the Honors Committee for
enshrinement. McHale, Embry and Moore were both first-time
nominees, while Thompson and Zollner had previously been up for
election.
</P>
<P>
A seven-time NBA All-Star during his 12-year career, McHale
teamed with fellow forward and Hall of Famer Larry Bird and center
Robert Parish to help the Boston Celtics win three NBA
championships in the 1980s. Before retiring after the 1991-92
season, McHale led Boston to six Eastern Conference crowns and
nine Atlantic Division titles.
</P>
<P>
McHale was named one of the NBA's 50 Greatest Players in 1996.
Noted for his high shooting percentage, ninth best in NBA history
at 55 percent, McHale averaged 17.9 points and 7.3 rebounds in his
13 years with the Celtics.
</P>
<P>
McHale has served the last four years as a vice president of
basketball operations for the Timberwolves, who have made the
palyoffs each of the last three seasons.
</P>
<P>
Thompson, the men's basketball coach at Georgetown University
in 1972, promised the school would someday win a national
championship. His teams played in 14 consecutive NCAA
championships, made 24 straight postseason appearances and won
seven Big East championships.
</P>
<P>
Embry, who recently stepped down as president of the Clevel
Cavaliers, impacted basketball on and off the court. He played 11
years with the Cincinnati Royals, Boston Celtics and Milwaukee
Bucks and was named to five All-Star teams.
</P>
<P>
Moore coached State Fullerton to a remarkable 140-15 record,
eight straight conference titles and a national championship. She
went on to coach at UCLA for 16 seasons and recorded a 296-181
record. She also coached the first U.S. Olympic women's basketball
team to a silver medal in Montreal in 1976.

<HEADLINE> Pistons Center Dele Wants to Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Detroit Pistons center Bison
Dele, who has seen his career overshadowed by a number of off-the-
court distractions, miss the start of training camp and is
contemplating retirement.
</P>
<P>
According to a release issued by the team Friday, the 30-year-
old Dele has informed the Pistons of his desire to retire and said
he is not 100 percent committed to playing at the level necessary
for the NBA.
</P>
<P>
Pistons vice president Rick Sund has said the team is committed
to Dele but that he would miss the start of training camp. Dele is
currently in Beirut, Lebanon and is not expected back in the
country for at least a couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
Dele, an eight-year veteran, averaged 10.5 points and 5.6
rebounds in 49 games last season. He signed a seven-year, 45
million U.S. dollars contract on August 16, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Dele changed his name from Brian Williams just prior to last
season after researching his family history. His intensity on the
court has often been questioned by teammates and coaches and Dele
himself has admitted to a lack of passion for basketball.
</P>
<P>
Dele has averaged 11.0 points and 6.2 rebounds in 413 games. He
was the 10th overall selection of the Orlando Magic in the 1991
draft and has spent time with Denver, the Los Angeles Clippers,
Chicago Bulls and Pistons.

<HEADLINE>   Pippen to be Traded to Portland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The Houston Rockets has
decided to trade Scottie Pippen to the Portland Trail Blazers for
six bench players, according to a report reaching here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press said Pippen will be traded Saturday in a
six-for-one deal. Portland will release Kelvin Cato, Stacey Augmon,
Walt Williams, Ed Gray, Brian Shaw and Carlos Rogers.
</P>
<P>
Pippen broke the relation with Rockets teammate Charles Barkley
Wednesday, making negative remarks in a TV program.
</P>
<P>
The Blazers had to give up six players in order to make the
trade work under NBA salary guidelines. Pippen, 34, will earn more
than 14 million U.S. dollars this season.
</P>
<P>
Pippen, who left the Chicago Bulls eight months ago, displayed
a disappointing show last season, only averaging 14.5 points and
shooting just 43 percent from the field.
</P>
<P>
Pippen cursed Barkley on Wednesday in an ESPN interview, saying
he "doesn't show the desire to want to win" and "he is selfish and
fat". The attack came after Barkley criticized Pippen in August
for publicly lobbying for a trade to the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
Barkley complained he had sacrificed greatly in February to
make salary-cap room in order for the Rockets to get Pippen from
the Bulls in a sign-and-trade deal.
</P>
<P>
"He's creating all this controversy just to get traded,"
Barkley said Thursday. "He wants to get traded so bad that he'll
just say anything to make it happen."
</P>
<P>
Pippen is a seven-time All-Star and two-time Olympian who won
six titles with the Bulls.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Russian Cooperation Conducive to World Peace, Leaders Say </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and Russian leaders have
highlighted the importance of the Sino-Russian cooperation to the
world peace and development on the occasion of the 50th
anniversary of the establishment of the bilateral diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin and his Russian counterpart Boris
Yeltsin shared the view in their respective messages to
congratulate each other on the event which fell on October 2, the
second day of the founding of the People's Republic of China five
decades ago.
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased to see that the relations between the two big
neighbors of China and Russia have not only been set on normal
tracks in a smooth and healthy way, but also are growing ripe,"
Jiang said in his message, adding the bilateral strategic
cooperative partnership is being consistently reinforced and
developed.
</P>
<P>
It has been proved that a Sino-Russian relationship of good
neighborliness and cooperation not only confirms to the
fundamental interests of the two countries and the two peoples,
but also is conducive to the peace and stability in the region and
the world as a whole, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
In his message to Jiang, Yeltsin said the past decades have
testified that the guideline to establish a sound Russian-Chinese
relationship and bilateral dialogs based on equality and trust is
extremely necessary.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Russian-Chinese strategic cooperative
partnership is a key factor to promote the establishment of a
multi-polar world pattern and safeguard the peace and development
in Asia and the whole world.
</P>
<P>
To mark the occasion, Li Peng, chairman of the Standing
Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress, and Chinese
Premier Zhu Rongji also exchanged congratulation messages with
Yegor Stroyev, chairman of the Russian Federal Assembly, Gennady
Seleznev, chairman of the State Duma, and Russian Prime Minister
Vladimir Putin.

<HEADLINE> Another Hostage Released From Myanmar Embassy in Bangkok </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 2 (Xinhua) -- One more hostage was released
Saturday morning from the Myanmar embassy here which has been
occupied by gunmen since Friday.
</P>
<P>
The hostage, a Thai woman, was released at about 11 a.m. local
time (0400 GMT), more than 23 hours after the gunmen stormed the
embassy and took more than 20 people hostage on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Saturday two hostages were freed from the embassy. One
of them is a Thai women who is four-month pregnant while the other
is a Myanmar embassy staff member who is almost out of strength.
</P>
<P>
Local media had interviewed the head of the gunmen through
telephone earlier Saturday. According to the tape of the
interview, the gunmen asked for a helicopter which can take 14
people to land in a nearby school before flying to the
Thai-Myanmar border and a minibus ready to take them to the
school.
</P>
<P>
The 12 gunmen insisted that they mean no harm and will not hurt
anybody.
</P>
<P>
The Thai police are said to be considering the demand of the
gunmen. But no agreement has been reached yet.
</P>
<P>
Helicopters were seen hovering over the embassy at about 10
a.m. local time (0300 GMT), but were flown away. Sources said it
is because there is no enough open space for the helicopters to
land.
</P>
<P>
Bangkok police chief Wanarat Kocharat said earlier if the
gunmen do not use violence the Thai police will not use violence.
</P>
<P>
He said the Thai authority is now negotiating with the gunmen
who demand to be provided with a helicopter to fly to the
Thai-Myanmar border.
</P>
<P>
The Thai police said a medical team has been sent to deal with
any possible accidents. An ambulance has been stationing near the
embassy since Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
A dozen armed men stormed the Myanmar embassy in Bangkok at
noon Friday and took about 30 people hostage, including diplomats
and foreigners.
</P>
<P>
The foreigners held include people from France, Canada,
Germany, the United States, Malaysia, Singapore, Japan and
Thailand. So far no one can give an exact namelist of the
hostages, and all the hostages are safe.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen released three Thai hostages Friday including a Thai
policeman who was part of the embassy security detail.
</P>
<P>
A faxed statement from a group claiming responsibility for the
action demanded the Myanmar government free political prisoners,
enter a dialogue with the opposition and convene a democratic
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Thai Deputy Foreign Minister Sukhumbhand Paribatra told
reporters on Friday the ministry has notified all the embassies
concerned in Thailand whose citizens were taken hostage, and
promised that the Thai government will do its best to protect the
safety of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai also told reporters on Friday
that he was following the situation closely and had ordered
agencies concerned to protect the safety of the hostages.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Reduces Trade Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian trade deficit for
the first nine months of this year fell by 78.7 percent over the
same period last year to 773 million U.S. dollars, said a
government report Friday.
</P>
<P>
Last September alone registered a fall of 94 percent from the
same month a year ago to 67 million U.S. dollars, said the report
from the Development, Industry and Foreign Trade Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Though the Brazilian trade deficit has diminished so far this
year, the country will not be able to fulfill its original target
of a trade surplus of 1.5 to 3.4 billion dollars, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Brazil, which imports an average of 600,000 barrels of oil
every day to fulfill the national demand, will have at the end of
this year a trade deficit of 1 billion dollars, mainly due to the
increase of oil prices in the international market.

<HEADLINE> Care for U.S. Children Living in Poverty Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 1 (Xinhua) -- There are still too many
children living in poverty in the United States and the majority
are in families with at least one person working, a U.S.
organization said Friday.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 13 million children living in poverty in
this country despite a strong economy, said the Children's Defense
Fund in a statement quoting new figures released Thursday by the
census bureau.
</P>
<P>
According to the bureau, 13.5 million children were living in
poverty in 1998 with annual incomes of less than 13,000 U.S.
dollars for a family of three, and 16,660 dollars for a family of
four. Moreover, 3.2 million of these children lived in families
headed by someone who worked full time in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"We are deeply concerned for those who are still not reaping
the benefits of this good economy," said the fund quoting its
president Marian Wright Edelman. "This data also indicates that
while families are playing by the rules and holding down a job,
they are not making enough to lift themselves out of poverty."
</P>
<P>
The census bureau defines poverty as an income below 13,000
dollars a year, or the equivalent of 1,084 dollars a month for a
family of three. After paying rent for a typical two-bedroom
apartment at 594 dollars, child care and food, the family would
have only 17 dollars for other expenses. They would be unable to
afford daily bus fare to and from work, clothes or any emergencies,
or any extras like school supplies.
</P>
<P>
The data shows that families are struggling with low wages, the
Children's Defense Fund's statement said. They need help with
affordable child care, transportation, food stamps and job
training so they can move up to better paying jobs.

<HEADLINE> Chile Denies Seeking Pinochet's Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Chilean Foreign Minister Juan
Gabriel Valdes denied Friday that his country had formally asked
the British government to release lifetime Senator Augusto
Pinochet for humanitarian reasons.
</P>
<P>
Valdes said that only a medical report on Pinochet's health
status was sent to British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook through
the Chilean ambassador.
</P>
<P>
The document was attached to a note in which the concern of the
Chilean government for the physical well-being of the former
commander in chief of the South American country's army was stated.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, who will complete one year of detention in London
this month, faced a trial this past week to decide his extradition
to Spain, where he will face another trial for human rights
violations at the request of Judge Baltasar Garzon.
</P>
<P>
Judge Garzon requested Pinochet's detention and extradition
while he was recovering from a surgical operation in a London
clinic, so he could not return to his country.
</P>
<P>
Spanish, British and Chilean authorities are still awaiting the
decision of the recent trial in England. Valdes said he could not
say at this moment what the position of his government would be
after the decision is known.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Chilean government will continue promoting
Pinochet's release as long as the legal process continues.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Golden Eagle Sport Project Not Going Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- An official of the Indonesian
Olympics Committee (KONI) Hindarto is resigned to the fact that
Garuda Emas (Golden Eagle) Project has not worked as well as
expected, although as much as 24 billion rupiah (3 million U.S.
dollars) has been spent on the campaign.
</P>
<P>
The Garuda Emas Project was set up by the government three
years ago with the aim of reaching a place in the top six at the
2006 Asian Games through a supposedly systematic, conceptual and
scientific process of working.
</P>
<P>
Hindarto, who is the chief of the Athletes' Development and
Achievement Department, said one of the main reasons behind the
sluggish performance is the country's failure to create an
integral and comprehensive administration system.
</P>
<P>
He mentioned a case in which a provincial administration had
failed to carry out the program for a specific sport, which KONI
had given it priority to develop.
</P>
<P>
"What adds to the stagnation is that there is no specific
person directly responsible for supervising the project. Instead,
the project is the full responsibiity of the local authority," he
was quoted by the Indonesian Observer Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
He hinted that the lack of control had resulted in
irregularities in the use of funds when he said that the local
administration had organized a sports event, not of nationwide
status, using the project budget.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the question of how the problem can be solved, he
suggested that the government set up a Garuda Emas Project
controlling body involving more related institutions with the task
of keeping a close eye on progress and evaluating the project.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Legislators Agree to Bring Forward Presidential Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian legislators agreed to
accelerate the presidential election, but adjourned the general
session after failing to reach a consensus on the exact dates of
the crucial schedule, according to national newspapers Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In a consultative meeting between all factions and the acting
chairman of the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) on Friday,
the country's highest decision-making body agreed to bring forward
the presidential election from the scheduled date of November 10.
</P>
<P>
The source of contention comes down to whether the president
would be elected before or after the State Policy Guidelines is
drafted and endorsed.
</P>
<P>
Leader of the Golkar Party Marzuki Darusman said the party
hopes to have a new president selected by October 28 at the
latest.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle continued to push
for a MPR General Session schedule comprising one phase, which
would culminate in a presidential election within a fortnight.
</P>
<P>
The move would mean endorsement of the guidelines would take
place after the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The current schedule puts the presidential election in
November, the final part of the two-stage General Session of the
MPR that began on October 1, when 700 new House of Representatives
(DPR) and MPR members were sworn in to choose the new leaders of
the two bodies.
</P>
<P>
After forming a working group and factions, the new DPR/MPR
would deliberate on outlining the state's broad guidelines and
amending the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Late into Friday night, the Jakarta Post reported, MPR members
were lobbying hard in an attempt to break any possible impasse
that may arise on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Nearly four months after the June 7 elections, the 700-seat MPR
finally convened its General Session on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The MPR is comprised of members of the DPR, of which 462 were
elected through the polls and 38 were allotted to the military.
</P>
<P>
In addition, there are 135 regional representatives and 65
interest group representatives.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Government, Rebels to Define Talks Date </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The Colombian
government and the largest rebel group, FARC, will decide on the
date to resume the peace talks next Sunday, Colombian RCN radio
network reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
High Commissioner for Peace Victor Ricardo said he would meet
Raul Reyes, Joaquin Gomez and Fabian Ramirez, spokesmen for the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), to agree on the
date.
</P>
<P>
He said they would also decide upon the guidelines for a
subcommission, made up of spokesmen from both sides and in charge
of receiving complaints and demands from the buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
The government and FARC have already agreed that negotiations
will be held in the La Uribe municipality, in the Meta department,
one of the five areas that make up the buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
Previous peace talks were suspended for two and a half months,
due to the rebels' opposition to the creation of an international
verification commission.
</P>
<P>
FARC said last Saturday that they had agreed to resume peace
talks "as soon as possible," because the government decided to
hold talks without the verification commission.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Inflation Declines in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia suffered a 0.68
percent deflation or negative inflation in September, the
country's seventh month of deflation in a row, according to the
Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS).
</P>
<P>
BPS chief Sugito Suwito said the inflation continued to decline
thanks in large part to a drop in food prices.
</P>
<P>
"The price of several food commodities, including rice, fell
quite sharply in September," he was quoted by the Jakarta Post
Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
BPS said food prices in September, particularly for rice,
chili, onions, chicken, eggs and fish, were down by 3.81 percent
from their August levels.
</P>
<P>
It also said health care expenses dropped by 0.44 percent in
September.
</P>
<P>
However, BPS reported that the price of processed foods,
beverages, cigarettes and tobacco increased by 0.43 percent for
the month.
</P>
<P>
It added that prices in a number of other areas, including
housing, clothing, transportation, communications, education,
recreation and sports, also increased in September.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia posted a deflation of 0.18 percent in March, 0.68
percent in April, 0.28 percent in May, 0.34 percent in June, 1.05
percent in July and 0.93 percent in August.
</P>
<P>
Sugito said cumulative inflation for the first nine months of
the year was 0.02 percent, which is the lowest level of inflation
over the past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
The central bank earlier projected inflation for 1999 would be
between 5 percent and 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia suffered hyperinflation of more than 77 percent in
1998 as a result of the worsening economic crisis.

<HEADLINE> China's Air Force Fighter Manufacturer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Some 30 fighter planes from the
Shenyang Aircraft Industrial Group Co. in Liaoning Province
attended the ceremony for the 50th anniversary of the founding of
New China on October 1.
</P>
<P>
The company occupies a more than 8-million-sq.m. area and has
three parts: manufacturing facilities, an airfield, and a
residential community, and 20,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
It is closely connected to China's air force, says Xu Huangang,
the general manager, and has produced several thousand fighter
jets and about 60 percent of China's air defense jets. Its
advanced manufacturing techniques have allowed it to enter the
international market.
</P>
<P>
It has also produced many spare parts for civilian airplanes
since 1987 and signed a contract with the U.S.'s Boeing Aircraft
to manufacture 1,000 tail parts for 737s in 1996.
</P>
<P>
It developed a small airfield with the help of Zhang Xueliang,
a well-known general in the 1930s. It was occupied by Japanese
troops after 1931 and was used as a military repair base, Xu
explains. After liberation, to build its own powerful air force,
the Central Government decided to set up a manufacturing plant
there in 1953 in a project that lasted three years. The first jet
fighter took off from the base on July 19, 1956.
</P>
<P>
A high-altitude, high-speed fighter that it produced and flew
on June 12, 1984 was the most advanced fighter in China at that
time and showed that China had reached a more advanced level, Xu
says. The first Chinese training plane, the first supersonic jet
fighter, the first high-altitude reconnaissance plane, and the
first high-altitude, high-speed jet fighter planes were all
produced by the company.

<HEADLINE> Ince and Wise Recalled to England Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- English soccer team manager Kevin
Keegan threw the door wide open for two of the supposed "bad boys"
of English football as he recalled Paul Ince and Dennis Wise to
his squad to face Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Keegan gave himself some room for manoeuvre by naming a 25-
strong squad for the friendly international as he will only learn
24 hours before kick-off whether Poland have clinched a European
Championship play-off place ahead of England.
</P>
<P>
If Poland should win or draw in Sweden then Keegan will not
throw out the old guard but will certainly experiment slightly
more, especially from the substitutes bench, at the Stadium of
Light in Sunderland. The presence of goalkeeper Richard Wright,
midfielders Frank Lampard, Trevor Sinclair and Steve Guppy, and
striker Emile Heskey - as well as Sunderland duo Michael Gray and
Kevin Phillips - shows he is willing to bring in, or keep faith
with fresh faces.
</P>
<P>
However, if Poland lose then Keegan will field his strongest
side and the irony is that it has been a red card which has
effectively opened the door for Wise and Ince, who both tend to be
frequent visitors to Lancaster Gate for disciplinary hearings.
</P>
<P>
David Batty has been left out of the squad as he would be
suspended for any play-off games after being sent off in Warsaw.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Lampard and Jamie Redknapp would now seem to be Ince's
only main competitors for a place in the starting line-up after
the midfielder had feared that the end of his international career
was nigh.
</P>
<P>
Having been suspended himself for Keegan's first game in charge
against Poland after being sent off in Sweden, this is the first
time Ince has been selected by him in an England squad.
</P>
<P>
But Keegan said: "I didn't put Paul in before but I did always
say that the door was still open and he's never closed that door
on himself.
</P>
<P>
"To be fair to him, he hasn't self-destructed in any way by
making comments.
</P>
<P>
"There's always a danger when players are disappointed they may
come out in the open and say things they feel," he said.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks fell Friday
as the government reports on the rise in personal income and
consumer spending triggered fears of higher intereat rates.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 63.95 at
10,273.00, recovering back from a loss of as much as 135 points in
early trading.
</P>
<P>
broader stock indicators were mostly lower. The technology
heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 9.31 at 2,736.85 but the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 0.10 at 1,282.81.
</P>
<P>
Most of the stock indexes moved down after the Commerce
Department reported that the personal income got the eighty
straight monthly increase of 0.5 percent in August while consumer
spending rose 0.9 percent in the same month. The investors worried
that the new reports could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise
interest rates for the third time this year to battle inflation
because the increase in income and consumer spending will bring
pressures on inflation.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve raised rates twice in the recent months in
an effort to preempt inflation from a teating economy. Most
analysts believed it would leave the benchmark rate alone at a
monetary policy meeting on October 5, but the new pressures on
inflation sparked fears of rate hike among investors.
</P>
<P>
meanwhile, the market was put on more concerns with rate hike
as the National Association of purchasing Management reported a
stronger-than expected growth rate in the manufacturing sector in
September and the highest price level for raw materials since May
1995.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 0.31 at 592.48 and the American Stock
Exchange index fell 1.67 at 786.56. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies fell 3.77 at 423.53.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-5 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,798 down, 1,257 up and 499
unchanged.

NYSE volume declined to 891.87 million shares from 1.01 billion
