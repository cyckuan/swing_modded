Singapore stock market down sharply on regional currency woes

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's stock market dropped sharply
Tuesday morning and looked set to break important support levels as
regional currency woes continued to rattle equity prices.
	   The benchmark Straits Times Industrials Index slid 2.6 percent,
or 26.85 points, to 1,012.42 in late-morning trading, easily
breaching this year's intra-day low of 1031.30 hit on January 12.
Market observers indicated that the worsening regional currency
situation was to blame.
	   ``It's more of a currency fear than anything else,'' a dealer at
a local brokerage told Dow Jones Newswires.
	   Already at a level not seen in a decade, the index was poised to
sink below the psychologically important support level of 1,000 and
eventually drop much further, according to market observers.
	   ``It's heading to 800, without much respite, by the end of this
year,'' said Edwin Tay, research manager at BT Brokerage and
Associates.
	   Persistent fears that China might devalue its currency, the
yuan, were underlying the poor sentiment, dealers said.

Ecuador's new president takes power with call for peace
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CARLOS CISTERNAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ With Ecuadorean troops in a tense standoff
with soldiers in neighboring Peru, Jamil Mahuad began his
presidency Tuesday looking for a peaceful solution to the
longstanding conflict.
	   In his inaugural speech to Congress Monday, the Harvard-educated
lawyer offered to meet with Peru's president to negotiate a
resolution to the border dispute.
	   ``I call on President Alberto Fujimori to join us in a united,
responsible and cooperative effort, thinking of the future of our
peoples, to reach a peace,'' said Mahuad, wearing the yellow, blue
and red presidential sash across his chest.
	   The standoff began last Thursday when Peru charged Ecuadorean
troops had entered its territory in a disputed region where the
countries fought a brief war in early 1995. Ecuador denied the
charge.
	   Fujimori canceled his trip to Mahuad's inauguration to meet with
his generals.
	   The Andean nations have fought wars in 1941, 1981 and 1995 over
49 miles (78 kms) of unmarked border amid a mountainous jungle.
	   Representatives from the United States, Brazil, Chile and
Argentina hurriedly tried to broker a deal to end the standoff, but
their initials efforts failed.
	   Mahuad assumes power after 18 months of political chaos that
followed the removal of eccentric former President Abdala Bucaram
by Congress for ``mental incapacity.'' Congress named Fabian
Alarcon as an interim replacement.
	   The final days of Bucaram's government were plagued by street
protests and allegations of corruption as Ecuador's 19-year-old
democracy hung by a thread.
	   Mahuad, who has a master's degree in public administration from
Harvard University, earned a reputation as an honest, competent
administrator during his six-year stint as Quito mayor.
	   He was elected by voters who saw him as the best chance to end
the carnival-like politics that had embarrassed many Ecuadoreans.
	   The eccentric Bucaram, called ``El Loco'' or ``The Crazy One,''
recorded a rock music record, sang at wild campaign rallies
accompanied by scantily clad dancing girls and dubbed himself the
``scourge of the oligarchy.''
	   Mahuad's rival in the July 12 presidential runoff, banana tycoon
Alvaro Noboa, was backed by Bucaram.
	   ``I've been elected to prevent this country from sinking,'' said
Mahuad.
	   He inherits an economy battered by massive El Nino-driven floods
and mudslides, a ballooning budget deficit and a sharp drop in the
price of its main export, oil.
	   Mahuad's term in office ends in January 2003.

Mexican bishop urges peace before papal trip
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS 4 grafs to RECAST showing Ruiz not suggesting pope
cancel trip. Picks up 6th graf pvs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ The bishop of this
mountain city in southern Chiapas state urged a solution to
Mexico's Indian rebellion before January's visit of Pope John Paul
II, but officials said there was no chance the pope would cancel
his trip.
	   ``If there isn't a more or less peaceful situation in the
country, a visit by the Holy Father wouldn't be appropriate,
because it could appear to be an approval of the lack of respect
for human dignity,'' Ruiz said in an interview Sunday night.
	   However Ruiz did not say the pope should cancel his trip and
said the visit provides a ``remote but not non-existent''
opportunity to resolve the uprising by the Zapatista National
Liberation Army, a guerrilla group that demands greater rights for
Mexico's poor Indians.
	   Peace talks with the group have been stalled for two years,
while gunmen linked to either side have targeted sympathizers of
the other.

No end in sight for weakening Singapore economy, government says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's fragile economy continued to weaken
in the second quarter of this year because of the Asia's economic
crisis, and officials warned Tuesday that growth will slow even
further.
	   The Ministry of Trade and Industry said gross domestic product
grew only 1.6 percent in the second quarter compared to the same
period last year, down from a more robust 6.1 percent in the first
three months of the year.
	   ``Economic growth is expected to weaken further in the rest of
the year,'' said the ministry in a statement. ``Without clear signs
of a regional revival, external demand will remain weak.
Forward-looking indicators paint a weak picture for the economy as
a whole.''
	   The government stood by its growth forecast of 0.5 to 1.5
percent for the year, an estimate that was revised downward in June
when the severity of the Asian crisis and its effect on Singapore
had become more apparent.
	   But many economist and analysts in the island republic are even
more bearish than the authorities, predicting that Singapore will
see an overall contraction for 1998.
	   The government attributed the sharp slowdown in Singapore's
second-quarter growth to ``adverse developments in the global
electronics industry'' compounded by a weakening of service exports
to the region.
	   It noted that while volatility in Asia has moderated, ``economic
contraction has begun to bite.''
	   Singapore's important manufacturing base depends heavily on the
electronics sector, which has continued to suffer because of
over-supply and falling prices, especially in the semiconductors
and computer industries.
	   Manufacturing output shrank 1.1 percent in the second quarter
compared to the same period in 1997, according to the ministry.
Compared to growth of 6.1 percent in the first quarter, the sharp
reversal bodes ill for the economy in general.
	   For the first time since the recession of the mid-1980s, overall
demand contracted during the second quarter, the ministry noted. It
shrank by 5.2 percent versus the year-earlier period, compared with
4.2 percent growth in overall demand during the first quarter.
	   External demand was down as regional trade shrank, declining
``significantly'' in the second quarter by 7.7 percent against the
same period last year.
	   Domestic demand also fell, mainly as a result of inventory
reductions and a cutback in capital spending by companies here.
	   Singapore consumers spent less locally as well, instead
channeling ``some of their expenditure overseas, attracted by the
weaker regional currencies,'' stated the economic report.
	   One of the few positive developments of the second quarter was
the performance of the construction sector, which posted ``robust
expansion at 9.8 percent, largely in residential building activity
and civil engineering work.''

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's stock market plunged Tuesday
morning and looked set to break important support levels as
regional currency woes continued to rattle equity prices.
	   The benchmark Straits Times Industrials Index tumbled 3.6
percent, or 37.16 points, to 1,002.11 at the mid-day break, its
lowest level in nearly a decade.
	   The index was poised to break the psychologically important
support level of 1,000 and eventually drop much further, according
to market observers.
	   ``It's heading to 800, without much respite, by the end of this

	   ``It's more of a currency fear than anything else,'' a dealer at
a local brokerage told Dow Jones Newswires.
	   Persistent fears that China might devalue its currency, the

plunges in other Asian stock markets were further dampening the
Singapore bourse, they added.

Defying international pleas, Caribbean island votes on secession
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHARLESTOWN, St. Kitts and Nevis (AP) _ In a narrow vote
reflecting fears of going it alone as the smallest nation in the
Western hemisphere, Nevis islanders voted to stay tied to St.
Kitts, according to unofficial results.
	   Preliminary results announced just before midnight Monday showed
the vote fell short of the two-thirds needed for secession. With a
couple hundred votes still being counted, 2,427 voted ``Yes'' to
secession and 1,418 against.
	   Some voters said they were dissuaded from voting ``yes'' in the
hastily called referendum because no one had explained what would
happen if they seceded.
	   ``The uncertainty increased over the weekend. The people began
to wrestle with reality,'' said Kofi Adams, a farmer from the
village of Brick Kiln on the seven-mile-long island.
	   When the islands became independent in 1983, Nevis reluctantly
joined in a federation with neighboring St. Kitts, population
32,000. But Nevisians insisted on a constitutional clause allowing
them to break away.
	   After years of complaining they are treated like second-class
citizens by the federal government on St. Kitts, they invoked that
right with Monday's referendum.
	   Premier Vance Amory, the force behind the independence drive,
urged citizens to ignore naysayers who warned the tiny island
cannot sustain itself in a global economy.
	   ``Small is not an indication of capability,'' Amory said Sunday
night at a rally. He noted Nevis runs most of its own affairs
already.
	   But opposition leader Joseph Parry of the Nevis Reform Movement
said the island wasn't ready for secession.
	   ``The people aren't ready, neither economically nor politically
nor psychologically,'' he said.
	   St. Kitts and Nevis is already the smallest nation in the
Western hemisphere. Caribbean officials privately said the island
could be at the mercy of global drug cartels with far greater
resources.
	   The 15-member Caribbean Community has suggested an independent
Nevis could have problems joining the trade bloc.
	   That stung in Nevis, where residents wondered how the community
could embrace communist Cuba's Fidel Castro while condemning their
right to freedom and independence.
	   The United States also has urged secessionists to reconsider.
	   Monday's vote was the culmination of a struggle that began with
Britain's colonization in 1628. In 1882, Britain stripped Nevis of
its Legislature and wed it to St. Kitts. At independence in 1983,
Nevis won limited autonomy.
	   Under overcast skies Monday, residents filtered into churches,
schools and police stations to vote. ``I think we need it. It's
time,'' voter Errol Libure said.
	   Some wondered what lay ahead, despite Amory's assurances that
passport requirements, trade between the islands, residency and
police protection issues would not immediately change.
	   In St. Kitts, a two-mile (3-kilometer) ferry ride across the
Narrows strait, federal Premier Denzil Douglas had urged Nevisians
to vote ``No'' and offered to enhance the island's say in the
federation.
	   He has argued that the population of St. Kitts and Nevis,
overwhelmingly descended from African slaves, are bound by family,
history, trade and politics.

Japanese leader pledges to work with opposition to pass bank bills
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHESTER DAWSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Vowing to act quickly to stabilize Japan's shaky
financial system, Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi signaled his
readiness Tuesday to compromise with opposition parties to pass key
banking reform bills.
	   The willingness to deal comes after the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party suffered a humiliating loss in elections last
month that strengthened the opposition's hand in the upper house of
Japan's bicameral Parliament.
	   That put Obuchi, who has staked his nascent administration on a
pledge to resuscitate a stagnant economy, in the uncomfortable
position of having to court political enemies to win passage of
legislation.
	   ``We will work toward getting the understanding of and
cooperation from opposition parties to ensure swift passage of this
legislation by listening to what they have to say about the
bills,'' Obuchi said, speaking in response to questions from
opposition lawmakers in the upper house.
	   But this may be easier said than done.
	   Opposition parties have reserved some of their harshest
criticism for the government's so-called Total Plan to clean up the
bad loan-burdened financial sector. They have portrayed it as a
taxpayer-financed bailout of inept bank executives.
	   While the ruling party's majority in the lower house may be
enough to override any upper house decision flatly rejecting the
bills, it would be a cumbersome and controversial move which many
analysts see as unlikely.
	   What's more, the Democratic Party of Japan, the largest
opposition party, agrees something needs to be done to deal with
the bad loan problem. The party's own policy proposals share many
elements of the government plan.
	   For example, both call for the establishment of a kind of
``bridge bank'' to fill the breech left by troubled private
lenders. They also support reform measures making it easier to sell
off real estate used as collateral for non-performing loans.
	   Obuchi's comments appeared designed, at least in part, to calm
nervous investors who have been selling off Japanese stocks and the
yen amid uncertainty over the outlook for the financial reform
legislation.
	   The ruling party had hoped to speed passage of the banking bills
through both houses of Parliament with the help of two minority
parties. But the disastrous performance in the July polls has
forced the Liberal Democrats to re-think their strategy.
	   The 61-year-old prime minister, who assumed the premiership just
two weeks ago, has repeatedly rejected persistent calls for the
resignation of his Cabinet and snap elections for the lower house
of Parliament.
	   On Tuesday, he reiterated a pledge to put Japan's economy back
of track for recovery within two years through tax cuts and other
stimulus measures, saying economic issues were his Cabinet's ``top
priority.''

Chinese president to visit Japan from Sept. 6-11
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ President Jiang Zemin will visit Japan from Sept.
6-11, becoming the first Chinese president ever to make a state
visit here, a Foreign Ministry official said Tuesday.
	   Jiang's exact itinerary, however, was still being worked out,
said the official, who works in the China section of Japan's
Foreign Ministry. He asked that his name not be used.
	   The dates for the visit were approved at a Cabinet meeting
Tuesday morning, he said.
	   Jiang last visited Japan in 1992 in his capacity as general
secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, he added.
	   Kyodo News agency reported that Jiang will hold talks with Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi, meet Emperor Akihito and visit the cities of
Sendai and Sapporo.
	   The visit is part of celebrations marking the 20th anniversary
of the conclusion of a peace and friendship treaty between the two
countries in 1978, the official said.
	   Japan and China normalized relations in 1972.
	   Japan is China's biggest trading partner and a major source of
investment and development aid. But their relationship is still
haunted by memories of Japan's brutal 1931-1945 occupation of
China.
	   Japan has offered apologies to ease lingering animosity in
recent years. In 1995, then-Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama
expressed ``deep remorse'' and a ``heartfelt apology for the
tremendous damage and sufferings to the Chinese people caused by my
country's colonial rule and aggression.''

	   In Phoenix, Curt Schilling pitched a three-hitter in his major
league-leading leading 11th complete game of the season as the
Philadelphia Phillies beat the Arizona Diamondbacks.
	   Schilling (11-11) struck out five and walked one as the Phillies
won for just the second time in 12 games. He threw only 94 pitches
in his second shutout of the year.
	   Hard-luck Omar Daal (5-7) nearly pitched his third consecutive

innings. He lost 2-0 to the Chicago Cubs in his last start on
Tuesday.

	   Bichette, who was 4-for-5 with a homer and five RBIs on Sunday,
broke a 2-2 tie with his 19th homer of the season and sixth grand
slam of his career.
	   The grand slam helped Jamey Wright (7-10) win consecutive
decisions for the third time this year. Wright allowed two runs and
five hits in seven innings and helped himself at the plate by
doubling and scoring a run.
	   Vladimir Guerrero homered for the Expos, who had won six of

Businessmen opposed to new tax proposal end strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ Traders protesting a new tax proposal
ended their 11-day-old strike Tuesday after the government invited
them for talks, organizers said.
	   Many businesses and industries remained closed across the
Himalayan state to protest the government's decision to impose a
ten percent value added tax.
	   The protesters said the new system would drive small
entrepreneurs out of business. The exemption to those earning less
than two million rupees (dlrs 29,850) a year was not enough, they
said.
	   Government and representatives of the Anti-VAT Action Committee
are scheduled to meet later Tuesday at the suggestion of Prime
Minister Girija Prasad Koirala.

Key Hong Kong stock index hits five-year low
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The key stock index plunged early Tuesday to
its lowest level in more than five years as investors, haunted by
fears of a weakening yen, continued to dump shares, traders said.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index hit an intraday low of 6,880.58 in
midmorning trading before rebounding slightly. That was its lowest
level since July 29, 1993.
	   The index closed up 0.2 percent higher at 7,034.62 points on
Monday after slumping 12 percent last week on a string of poor
local economic news and weaknesses in the region's markets.
	   Traders said investors fear that Hong Kong may be forced to
de-link its U.S. dollar-pegged currency, which is under pressure
from a weak yen and new speculative attacks.
	   A trader with a U.S. investment house said speculators who moved
into the market last week consisted of ``quality'' firms that are
more powerful than those involved in previous attacks on the Hong
Kong dollar.
	   Investors also fear that the anemic yen eventually will force
China to devalue its yuan, which likely would bring a new round of
currency devaluations in the region.
	   In midday trading in Tokyo, the U.S. dollar bought 146.30 yen,
down 0.35 yen from late Monday but above its New York rate of
146.15 yen overnight.

Foreign activists still detained, no decision on trial: Govt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ The 18 foreign democracy activists
detained for handing out anti-government leaflets remained in the
custody of the military regime Wednesday, their fate undecided.
	   Two government officials denied reports that the ruling State
Peace and Development Council had decided to charge the activists
and put them on trial, saying no decision had been taken.
	   ``The legal process is under way and it will be premature to
give comment on the outcome at this moment,'' a spokesman said in a
statement faxed to The Associated Press in Bangkok, Thailand.
	   The earlier reports panicked supporters and family members of
the activists meeting in Bangkok. The detainees include six
Americans, three Thais, three Malaysians, three Indonesians, two
Philippines citizens and an Australian.
	   Embassies in Myanmar, also known as Burma, have been seeking
access to their citizens since they were detained Sunday. None was
known to have been visited yet, though the government said again
Tuesday access would be available pending formal requests.
	   ``We need to give some time to the government of Myanmar to
investigate first,'' Sukhumbhand Pharibatra, Thailand's deputy
foreign minister, told reporters in Bangkok. ``We are asking for
the return of the three and that they be taken care of.''
	   Another Myanmar official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
told The Associated Press that there had been a misinterpretation
of a government statement Monday by some news organizations, which
reported the activists would be charged and tried.
	   The Burmese-language statement, issued after a news conference
Monday, said: ``It is obvious that this was premeditated, therefore
arrangements are being made to take necessary action.''
	   The action included detention and interrogation, which the
activists presumably were still undergoing Tuesday, but did not
mean that the activists would go through a criminal trial, the
official said. Deportation remained an option.
	   A British-Australian citizen was sentenced to five years
imprisonment in April for distributing leaflets. He was freed last
week after serving three months in the notorious Insein Prison,
where hundreds of political prisoners are held.
	   Officials said they want to discourage leafleting and that the
activists broke two laws, including a printing act and an emergency
law. The catch-all emergency law can carry a 10-year sentence and
is frequently used against political opponents.
	   The 18 activists, who belong to overseas groups opposed to the
government, had entered Myanmar as tourists on the eve of the 10th
anniversary of a nationwide uprising that took place Aug. 8, 1988.
	   The anniversary Saturday passed calmly, with no unrest reported
anywhere. Both the government and exiled opposition leaders have
said Myanmar's people fear a repeat of the 1988 bloodshed.
	   On Sunday, the activists passed out small leaflets urging people
to remember the anniversary and not to give up. They were arrested
on the streets and at the airport and the government has accused
them of trying to incite unrest.
	   The military has ruled Myanmar since 1962 and tolerates almost
no dissent. The 1988 uprising resulted in a change of leaders, but
was eventually crushed by troops. An estimated 3,000 people died.
	   The anniversary came two weeks before an Aug. 21 deadline set by
pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi, winner of the Nobel Peace
Prize, for the government to finally allow a parliament elected in
1990 to convene. The opposition won the election, but the military
refused to relinquish power.

Flood crest sweeps through ravaged city, dikes threatened
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JIUJIANG, China (AP) _ A flood peak rolled through this port
city along the swollen Yangtze River early Tuesday, threatening to
burst dikes sodden by more than a month of flooding.
	   ``The situation here is serious,'' said a local official who
gave only his surname, Huang. ``Today is clear and hot, but that
doesn't mean we can relax.''
	   In Jiujiang and elsewhere along the turbulent Yangtze, soldiers
and local residents worked desperately to repair damaged levees and
fortify those likely to collapse as flood waters swelled yet again.
	   More than 100 trucks loaded with stones were pushed into a major
Yangtze tributary, the Hanbei river, on Monday to block a 25-meter
(82.5-foot) gap that could have caused dangerous flooding in
adjacent Hanchuan county, the newspaper China Daily reported.
	   In Jiujiang, a city of 500,000, two dikes about 10 kilometers
(six miles) from the city were most at risk, Huang said. He said
that the water level near the city, in eastern Jiangxi province,
had risen slightly Tuesday, although it was below the peak recorded
on July 31.
	   Low-lying parts of the city remained flooded after the river
burst a 60 meter- (198 foot-) wide hole in a levee last Friday,
although the worst breaches had been repaired, state media said.
	   Upriver, the situation in the industrial city of Wuhan was calm
after the flood peak passed on Monday, but the miseries of more
than a month of flooding continued in many other areas along the
Yangtze.
	   Flooding nationwide has killed more than 2,000 people and
destroyed over 17 million houses, leaving millions homeless and
often bereft of clean drinking water, food, medicine and other
necessities in brutally hot and humid weather.
	   Medical teams were rushing to the area to prevent the spread of
contagious diseases, dysentery and infections.
	   With some 240 million people _ about one-fifth of China's
population _ affected by the floods, provinces less severely hit
were shipping in relief supplies.
	   The government also has stepped up efforts to raise donations
for the flood victims, opening a hotline for phone pledges and
encouraging local efforts to raise money.
	   On Tuesday, a U.S. Air Force cargo plane delivered a shipment of
relief supplies, such as tents, plastic sheeting, blankets and
drinking water containers to southern Hunan province, one of the
areas worst affected by the floods.
	   A second shipment was scheduled for Wednesday.
	   The flood crest that passed through the middle stretches of the
Yangtze on Monday and early Tuesday came within centimeters
(inches) of previous record highs, with water lapping the tops of
sandbagged dikes.
	   Floods from summer rains that fell heavier and earlier than
usual have raised the river to levels not seen since 1954 when
floods killed some 30,000 people.
	   The Yangtze is expected to remain at dangerously high levels for
weeks to come, with more rain falling along the river's upper
reaches in southwest Sichuan province.
	   Torrential rains have also fallen in northeastern Heilongjiang
and Jilin provinces, raising the Nenjiang river to dangerous
levels.
	   Southern Guangdong province, meanwhile, was bracing for the
onslaught of Tropical Storm Penny, which was expected to batter the
area Tuesday with violent winds and torrential rains.
	   Residents in areas likely to be flooded were to be evacuated and
fishing boats were ordered back to port, the China Daily reported.
	   Unlike central China, which has been deluged with unusually
heavy rains, much of Guangdong has been stricken by drought this
summer, making the storm not entirely unwelcome.
	   Preparations to flood more farmland along the Yangtze to protect
cities downstream were put on hold after the latest flood crest
passed. Farmers unwilling to sacrifice their homes and land had
vehemently objected to the plan, and flood waters would not be
diverted unless the situation became ``really out of control,'' the
newspaper reported.
	   Authorities did deliberately blast dikes in Hubei province's
Jianli county on Sunday to divert flood waters and protect major
levees, displacing 50,000 people.

 &UR; Marlins 3, Padres 2 &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   In San Diego, Florida's Livan Hernandez pitched a five-hitter
for his seventh complete game, breaking Kevin Brown's club record,
and the Marlins handed Brown his first loss since May 21.
	   Brown (14-4) was trying to win his 12th straight decision, which
would have set the Padres' record.
	   Hernandez (10-8) pitched his second complete game in three
starts. He allowed two runs, struck out six and walked four.
	   The Marlins scored three runs, two earned, on six hits off Brown
in seven innings. Brown struck out seven and walked three.
 &UR; Cubs 8, Giants 5 &QC; 
	   In San Francisco, Sammy Sosa hit his 45th and 46th homers to tie
Mark McGwire for the major league lead as the Chicago Cubs beat the
San Francisco Giants.
	   Sosa's first homer of the night, a towering blast into the first
row of the left-field bleachers, was the first of three consecutive
solo shots by the Cubs.
	   His second one, a solo blast over the center-field bleachers
estimated at 480 feet, pulled him even for the first time this
season with McGwire _ who went homerless in St. Louis' loss to the
New York Mets.
	   Tyler Houston added a two-run shot as the Cubs hit five homers
on a balmy night with the wind blowing out at 20 mph. Chicago broke
a four-game losing streak.

Fearing Y2K bug, Singapore experts suggest banks close doors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Computer experts in Singapore are so wary of
the dreaded Y2K bug that they are counseling banks to remain closed
for the first few business days of the new millennium, a newspaper
reported Tuesday.
	   ``If nothing is changed, Singapore banks will be among the first
in the world to use such facilities and will take the highest
risk,'' Andrew Lee, a computer consultant working for a major
Singapore bank, told The Straits Times.
	   Singapore banks are scheduled to open for business on Monday,
January 3, 2000.
	   Because of their location closer to the international date line,
banks in Singapore, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan and other Asian
countries will witness the calendar transition in computer systems
before much of the rest of the world.
	   The millennium bug, in which computer systems use an antiquated
two-digit format to mark the current year, threatens to disrupt
important computer systems world-wide unless old software is
rewritten and tested properly.
	   Some experts in Singapore have indicated that many businesses _
including banks _ are not adequately prepared for the calendar
change, though the government has said that most large institutions
are on track.
	   ``The Year 2000 issue is a crisis which is going to hit us for
sure and nothing can prevent it from happening,'' warned Lee. ``We
have to work together to minimize its risks.''
	   A worst-case scenario might involve entire computer systems
crashing and billions of dollars in overseas transactions becoming
lost, the paper noted.
	   Singapore's de facto central bank, the Monetary Authority, said
it would release an assessment of the financial sector's
preparedness shortly, according to the report.

Cabinet to vote on bank rescue package Friday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The Thai cabinet will hold a special
session Friday to vote on a financial-reform package aimed at
easing the crisis of the country's debt-laden banking system.
	   Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai called the meeting to hurry through
the unveiling of the package after wrapping up meetings with a
visiting International Monetary Fund team, a government spokeswoman
said Tuesday.
	   Authorities would announce the much-awaited plan, considered a
vital step toward reviving the recession-bound economy, either late
Friday or Saturday, the spokeswoman said on condition of anonymity.
	   Confusion over how the government will deal with the sector,
crippled by non-performing loans, has added to investor pessimism
over recent days. Banking stocks slipped 6.5 percent on the
benchmark Stock Exchange of Thailand index Monday.
	   The majority of Thailand's 15 commercial banks have failed to
raise adequate new capital from the private sector after becoming
laden with bad debt. Many analysts now expect the government to
step in.
	   This could be in the form of a swap of debt for bonds at a
discount. Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda has ruled out a
consolidation of bad assets under state management.
	   Tarrin said Monday that Thailand will lose some of its weaker
banks, possibly through mergers with stronger institutions, but
refused to say that any would be closed outright.
	   Widely expected is the merger of three state-run banks _ Siam
City Bank, First Bangkok City Bank and Bangkok Metropolitan Bank. A
fourth state-run bank, Bangkok Bank of Commerce, may be put up for
sale to foreign investors.
	   An IMF team has been in Bangkok negotiating terms of the latest
quarterly installment of a dlrs 17.2 billion bailout.
	   Thailand's financial system all but collapsed in mid-1998
following political interference in the once independent central
bank, and massive uncontrolled lending and corruption in private
financial institutions.
	   Chuan's government, which came to power after the crisis
erupted, has made financial restructuring a major priority.

Estrada approves human rights accord with Communist rebels
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By OLIVER TEVES &QC;

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine President Joseph Estrada
has approved a human rights accord with communist rebels, paving
the way for the resumption of peace talks, officials said Tuesday.
	   Howard Dee, the chief government peace negotiator, said Estrada
approved the human rights accord last Friday ``for immediate
implementation without reservations or precondition.''
	   The talks have stalled since the two negotiating panels signed
the human rights agreement in March. Estrada's predecessor, Fidel
Ramos, failed to approve the accord before he stepped down on June
30.
	   The rebels have said they were unwilling to continue the talks
unless the human rights agreement received presidential approval.
	   Dee said the approval ``will certainly go a long way in building
and nurturing a climate of peace in the Philippines.''
	   ``It is the hope of the peace panel that ... we can now move
forward in the peace process,'' said Senator Franklin Drilon, one
of the government peace negotiators.
	   Dee said talks with the Marxist underground umbrella, the
National Democratic Front, are expected to resume in the first week
of September.
	   He said he also expects the rebels to announce a cease-fire, as
they had promised once the agreement was approved by the president.
	   Lawyer Rene Sarmiento, another member of the government panel,
said the agreement contains provisions that will ``humanize and
lessen the severity of the armed conflict'' particularly on
children, women and the elderly.
	   Under the agreement, children are not to be used in the armed
conflict and the government will not be allowed to use
``unnecessary bombardments'' of suspected rebel positions, impose
food blockades and force the evacuation of communities.
	   Sarmiento said the two sides also agreed not to use land mines,
possibly making the Philippines the first country to implement an
international agreement to ban land mines.
	   A key feature of the accord is the support by both the
government and the rebels for the indemnification of 9,539
Filipinos who won a class action suit for human rights violations
against the estate of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos.
	   The government and the victims of abuse under Marcos are
claiming about dlrs 540 million in Marcos Swiss bank deposits,
which have been transferred to an escrow account in a Philippine
bank.
	   The Marcos family has indicated it was willing to settle the
claims out of court, but there have been no negotiations so far.
	   Sarmiento said Estrada's approval of the accord is a signal for
the courts handling Marcos wealth cases to speed up their
proceedings.
	   Dee said a joint monitoring body will be established to oversee
the implementation of the agreement and address past and future
human rights violations.
	   He also said both sides will identify the ``repressive'' decrees
and laws that will be recommended for repeal by Congress.
	   Sarmiento said he also expects more political prisoners to be
released. A human rights group says 127 political prisoners are
still being held in jails nationwide.
	   The agreement on respect for human rights rights and
international humanitarian law is the first of four accords leading
to a political settlement of three decades of insurgency.
	   The others cover social and economic reforms, political and
constitutional reforms and disposition of armed forces.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ After visiting 20 hospitals and making
daily rounds of mortuaries, Joseph Kaimburi's worst fears were
finally confirmed: One of the bodies crowded on a slab in the
stench-filled city morgue was his beloved older brother.
	   They were supposed to meet at Nairobi Hospital at 11 a.m. Friday
to visit a friend. But David Kaimburi, a 40-year-old businesman
with a wife and three children, never arrived. He had gone to the
American Embassy to pick up visa forms for a visit to America, his
37-year-old brother said.
	   A bomb exploded in the embassy's rear parking lot at 10:35 a.m.
	   For three days, Kaimburi had hoped he would find his brother in
a hospital bed. He had even gone to hospitals outside Nairobi in
his desperate search.
	   As he stood by the slab _ which normally holds one body but now
held two because of the overwhelming number of casualties from the
bombing _ he struggled with his emotions.
	   And as he spoke, he kept looking at his brother, still wearing
green pants, a striped shirt and jacket. His head was battered, but
his face was still recognizable. A metal identification tag, number
3799, hung from his ankle.
	   ``It's very torturing,'' he said quietly.
	   His brother was at the embassy by chance, an innocent victim of
terrorist bombers.
	   ``It's unfortunate that the bombing is coming in an African
country where we are very peaceful, where we have no problems,''
Kaimburi said. ``We have never had any problems with America. ...
The relationship is very good. They are supportive. ... This is a
very unfortunate incident.''
	   While Kaimburi was speaking, dozens of Kenyans walked through
the morgue looking for husbands and wives, brothers, sisters,
parents, children and friends. Some bodies were relatively intact,
some badly burned, some partially or totally decapitated, some
already decomposing.
	   It was a gruesome scene, yet there was almost complete silence _
except for the hysterical wailing of a woman outside.
	   Mary Otieno, 23, had just identified the body of her husband,
Elias Otieno, 30, a clerk at the Ufundi Cooperative building
adjacent to the embassy, which collapsed in the explosion.
	   Overcome with grief, she collapsed near a bench outside, sobbing
uncontrollably.
	   ``I don't understand how people can be so inhuman,'' said
Francesca Atieno, 34, a cousin of the dead man, explaining that he
left three young children, the youngest just 1 month old.
	   ``Maybe the world is too lenient with them. Maybe that's why
they get away with it,'' said Atieno, who has a public relations
business. ``The world has a population of over 4 billion. The
terrorists are just a pocket in the 4 billion. If we all say `no'
to it, it will stop.''
	   At another slab in the mortuary, Maurice O. Orato, 38, had just
identified his wife, Margaret Akinyi, 34, who was an accountant at
the Ufundi Cooperative and the mother of four children ages 3 to
13.
	   ``Since the bombing, I've been to every hospital. I've come to
this mortuary several times but didn't find her. Today, we called
the hot line, and they told us to come here,'' Orato said.
	   Tears welling in his eyes, he said he had identified his wife by
the clothes she wore when she went to work, her shoes and a
necklace.
	   ``I'm an unhappy man because I'm left with no wife,'' said
Orato, who works for the post office. ``It's a very difficult life
now for me and the family. The children are all crying. I have no
peace now. They're asking where their mother is.''
	   He said he didn't know what could be done about the terrorists.
	   For Charles Kamuti, 31, the visit to the morgue was another
exercise in frustration.
	   His younger brother, Lawrence Gitau Kamuti, 29, an assistant
pharmacist in the badly damaged 22-story Cooperative Bank of Kenya
building near the embassy, was still missing. He has a wife and two
children, the youngest just 2 months old.
	   ``I came here in the morning and evening. On Sunday we were here
again. And today we came _ but so far nothing,'' Kamuti said.
	   He complained that relatives still looking for loved ones
weren't getting any help from police or the government.
	   Lists have been posted at hospitals, and at Uhuru Park in the
center of Nairobi, but they are not complete. Nearly 5,000 people
were injured in the bombing, and 203 killed. Medical facilities in
this poor East African country have been overwhelmed.
	   The International Committee of the Red Cross is compiling a
computerized list of all the dead and injured, including those
treated and discharged.
	   It hopes to publish the list in the next few days, and use its
expertise in global tracing to help Kenyan authorities identify the
dead and reunite the living, said spokeswoman Nina Galbe.
	   But as the hours pass by, people like Kamuti become more
desperate for news.
	   On Monday, he went to the pharmacy where his brother worked and
found his brother's jacket, with his wallet and identification
still in the pocket. The pharmacy, on the ground floor, wasn't too
badly damaged.
	   ``If only he were inside he would have survived,'' Kamuti said.
``But if he went out after the first explosion ...''
	   He couldn't finish the sentence.
	   Many survivors reported hearing a small first explosion before
the big bomb blast _ and some said they ran to windows or outdoors
to see what had happened.
	   He said he couldn't find words to describe how he felt about the
bombers, but he said the bombing may contain a lesson for Kenyans,
and Africans.
	   ``It's high time we learn why Americans are fighting
terrorism,'' Kamuti said. ``In Kenya, we've never had such a
terrorist attack.''
	   Dr. Richard Gakunju, a clinical pharmacist, was at the morgue
searching for his brother-in-law, a teacher he did not want to
name. The brother-in-law tutored students every day in the
Cooperative Bank building between 10 a.m. and 11 a.m., just the
time that the bomb exploded.
	   When he heard the blast, Gakunju said, he couldn't believe it.
	   ``It's the last place you'd expect a bomb of such magnitude,''
he said.
	   Why would terrorists choose Kenya?
	   ``Maybe because this is the last country you'd expect it and
security might be lax, and maybe because the Americans have the
biggest diplomatic station here in East Africa,'' Gakunju said.
	   ``Of course, we don't understand why they would want to kill so
many Kenyans in the process, because we do believe it's Middle East
terrorists who are responsible. Kenyans would not do that,'' he
said.
	   Then, Gakunju was off on another search of hospitals and
morgues, still hoping he would find his brother-in-law alive.

Dollar hits eight-year high, Tokyo stocks close sharply lower
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES with closing Nikkei, mid-afternoon dollar and
bond price &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rose to an eight-year high against
the yen Tuesday as Tokyo stock prices finished sharply lower on
concerns the government could have trouble winning passage of key
banking reform bills.
	   At mid-afternoon, the U.S. dollar bought 146.99 yen, up 0.34 yen
from late Monday and also above its New York rate of 146.15 yen
overnight.
	   ``This sets the direction for a move toward 150.00 yen,'' said
Koichi Kubo, assistant general manager of foreign exchange at
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank.
	   Fears of intervention to support the yen encouraged a mild round
of dollar selling Tuesday morning, but the U.S. currency climbed in
the afternoon above the previous eight-year high of 146.73 yen set
on June 16.
	   The dollar gained momentum to rise as high as 147.13 yen at one
point before retreating slightly. It was the dollar's highest
intraday level since Aug. 20, 1990, when the currency moved as high
as 147.81 yen.
	   The yen was also under selling pressure after Japan's Economic
Planning Agency on Tuesday downgraded its assessment of the economy
in its August report, saying the economy is ``sluggish.''
	   Among major negative factors undermining the yen Tuesday was
continued declines in Japanese stock prices.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 219.43 points,
or 1.40 percent, closing at 15,406.99 points. On Monday, the
average posted its sixth straight decline, dropping 202.75 points,
or 1.28 percent.
	   Concerns among investors that weaker banks may be forced to
close helped drive down shares of troubled Long-Term Credit Bank of
Japan Ltd., whose stocks tumbled to 38 yen per share at the day's
close, down 5 yen from Monday's close.
	   Share prices below 100 yen are traditionally seen as a warning
sign of a company's imminent demise. Sumitomo Trust and Banking
Corp. announced in June that it was considering a merger with the
debt-plagued bank.
	   Other bank shares also slid as investors fretted special
inspections of banks ending next month by Japan's financial
authorities will reveal most to be in worse shape than the banks
have admitted.
	   With banks one of the biggest components of the Tokyo stock
market ``the cool situation will continue,'' said Tsuyoshi
Nomaguchi, a strategist at Daiwa Securities Ltd.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section fell 20.21 points, or 1.67 percent, to 1,186.88. It
had fallen 18.21 points, or 1.49 percent, the day before.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 1.195 percent from Monday's close of 1.170 percent,
driving its price down to 111.81 yen from 112.00 yen.

Asian stock markets fall on weakening yen, fears of yuan
</HEADLINE>
devaluation &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets slipped further early
Tuesday on lingering fears that the ever-weakening Japanese
currency, which fell to an eight-year low, may force China to
devalue its yuan.
	   Investors in the region were also dogged by a slump in Hong Kong
shares Tuesday morning to five-year lows, which was putting more
strain on its currency link with the U.S. dollar. The Hong Kong
dollar has been under strong speculative attacks.
	   ``A stronger dose of Japan jitters and (worries over a)
potential devaluation of the Hong Kong dollar and the yuan, set off
another round of negativity,'' said James Bryson, a trader at
ANZ-Panin Securities, in Jakarta.
	   After flirting with resistance around 146.70 yen to the dollar
for much of the afternoon, the dollar reached an intraday high of
147.10 yen, its highest level since Aug. 20, 1990, when the
currency moved as high as 147.81.
	   ``This sets the direction for a move toward 150.00 yen,'' said
Koichi Kubo, assistant general manager of foreign exchange at
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank.
	   Traders said the dollar could touch 150.00 yen before the end of
the week.
	   The factors undermining the yen Tuesday included another drop in
Japanese stock prices. The benchmark Nikkei Stock Average slid
219.43 points, or 1.4 percent, to 15,406.99, its lowest closing
level since June 29. It was the first time since February 1996 that
the Nikkei had dropped for seven straight sessions.
	   In Hong Kong, the blue-chip plunged 2.7 percent to close midday
at 6,841.46 points, the lowest level since July 29, 1993.
	   A trader with a U.S. investment house said speculators who moved
into the market last week consisted of ``quality'' firms that are
more powerful than those involved in previous attacks on the Hong
Kong dollar.
	   Traders also said investors are spooked by speculation of a yuan
devaluation, which would likely lead to another round of currency
devaluations in the region. At a news conference Tuesday, the
deputy governor of China's central bank, Liu Mingkang, reiterated
that China would not devalue its currency.
	   In Singapore, the benchmark Straits Times Industrials Index
tumbled 3.6 percent, or 37.16 points, to 1,002.11 at the mid-day
break, its lowest level in nearly a decade.
	   The index was poised to break the psychologically important
support level of 1,000 and eventually to drop much further,
according to market observers.
	   ``It's heading to 800, without much respite, by the end of this
year,'' predicted Edwin Tay, research manager at BT Brokerage and
Associates.
	   Philippine shares dropped for the fourth session, with the key
Philippine Stock Exchange Index closing 3.8 percent lower at
1,373.19. It had lost 10 percent in the past four days.
	   In Jakarta, foreign economic woes and political unrest at home
dragged the key JSX Composite Index down 2.1 percent at 412.410
points by midday.
	   Malaysian shares also opened down, with the Composite Index at
344.48 points, down 8.80 points, or 2.5 percent, from Monday's
close.
	   Australia's key stock index closed 35.3 points lower at 2,561.1,
and the index in New Zealand lost 7.71 points to close at 1,993.27.
	   Thai shares were marginally lower in early trading.
	   But in Taiwan, bargain hunting in rubber stocks led shares
slightly higher, with the benchmark Weighted Price Index of the
Taiwan Stock Exchange closing up 11.86 points to 7,383.98.
	   Shares in South Korea also opened slightly higher, with the key
index gaining 2.39 points at 314.24.

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Rescue teams continue to pour in Tuesday,
eager to save victims of the U.S. Embassy bombings in Kenya and
Tanzania. But there's almost no one left to save.
	   Investigators were luckier, having a witness to talk to: A
Kenyan guard at the Nairobi embassy survived the bombing.
	   ``He resisted heroically,'' U.S. State Department spokesman
James Foley said in Washington.
	   The East African Standard said guard Joash Okindo and his
colleagues, armed only with short clubs, confronted five men,
barring them from the main entrance to the embassy. The bombers
drove to the rear parking lot.
	   The attackers opened up with automatic rifle fire, and at least
one Marine returned fire, he told the Kenya Television Network
Monday. But one of the attackers threw a hand grenade. Moments
later, their truck exploded.
	   ``We saved people's lives by sending it to the rear entrance,''
Okindo told the Standard. ``If we hadn't done that, I don't think I
would be alive and talking to you now.''
	   The Standard said it talked to Okindo before he was taken out of
the country on a U.S. medical evacuation flight to Germany for
treatment of serious wounds.
	   In Tanzania, a dozen people, including Sudanese and Iraqis, were
detained. But U.S. officials played down the importance of the
roundup.
	   Israel army radio also signaled a possible break in the case. In
a report from Nairobi, it said investigators suspect the bombers
used the sophisticated plastic explosive Semtex.
	   The FBI says finding out what kind of explosives were used and
how would be critical to the investigation.
	   So would an informant, and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
on Monday offered a dlrs 2 million reward for information leading
to the capture of the ``cowards that committed this act.''
	   Meanwhile, Israeli soldiers, the first professional
search-and-rescue team to reach Nairobi after the bombing,
continued to dig for a woman named Rose.
	   Her voice fell silent Sunday, but they heard a tapping noise
Monday morning that spurred them on. At nightfall, however, there'd
been nothing but silence for hours.
	   Titus Ngwele, Red Cross coordinator at the scene, said the
Israelis sank a microphone into the debris to check whether Rose
was breathing late Monday.
	   ``They weren't sure whether she was or not. She hasn't spoken
today (Monday). But they're still working to get her out and still
hoping that she's alive,'' he said.
	   The bombing in Nairobi was the deadliest attack ever on a U.S.
Embassy. A dozen Americans at the embassy died.
	   The bodies of 11 of them began their last journey home on Monday
when their flag-draped coffins were loaded onto a military
transport plane.
	   The 12th, who was married to a Kenyan, will be buried in her
adopted homeland.
	   In all, the twin bombings claimed more than 213 lives and
injured nearly 5,000. Another 11 bodies were pulled from the rubble
in Nairobi overnight, said Red Cross spokeswoman Nina Galbe.
	   The vast majority of the victims were in Nairobi, where
university students marched to the bomb site Monday in a
candlelight vigil.
	   ``Go Fight Americans in America,'' said one sign.
	   The United States is a favorite target of militant Islamic
fundamentalists and many ordinary people here feel Kenya got caught
in the cross fire of a battle that isn't theirs.
	   U.S., Kenyan and Tanzanian investigators are silent on any
evidence they may have recovered from the blast sites, and have not
pinpointed any one group. U.S. officials have said, however, that
the exiled Saudi financier Osama bin Laden is one potential
suspect.
	   ``We will not confirm or deny the existence of evidence in this
criminal inquiry,'' said an American diplomat in Dar es Salaam,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   In Nairobi, the head of the Kenyan side of the investigation,
Army Maj. Gen. George Agoi, said he hadn't even talked to the FBI.
	   ``The Americans are here handling their side, and we are
handling our side,'' he said.
	   The rescue efforts _ haphazard at first _ may have destroyed
evidence at the two bomb sites, but U.S. officials said it was
inevitable because the victims came first.
	   ``Obviously, the first priority is finding people alive and then
to recover bodies,'' said U.S. Embassy spokesman Chris Scharf.
	   No one has been pulled alive out of the rubble since Saturday.
	   The United States is bringing in a Navy Seabees battalion in the
next few days to help with the recovery.
	   ``If there are still missing victims, that will be their first
priority,'' said Navy Cmdr. Gordon Hume.
	   The Seabees are part of a 200-strong U.S. military task force
deployed in Nairobi. The task force includes a 20-person medical
team and a crisis response team to counsel people, Hume said.

Myanmar says foreign activists still detained, no decision on trial
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ The 18 foreign democracy activists
detained for handing out anti-government leaflets remained in the
custody of the military regime Tuesday, their fate undecided.
	   Two government officials denied reports that the ruling State
Peace and Development Council had decided to charge the activists
and put them on trial, saying no decision had been taken.
	   ``The legal process is under way and it will be premature to
give comment on the outcome at this moment,'' a spokesman said in a
statement faxed to The Associated Press in Bangkok, Thailand.
	   The earlier reports panicked supporters and family members of
the activists meeting in Bangkok. The detainees include six
Americans, three Thais, three Malaysians, three Indonesians, two
Philippines citizens and an Australian.
	   Embassies in Myanmar, also known as Burma, have been seeking
access to their citizens since they were detained Sunday. None was
known to have been visited yet, though the government said again
Tuesday access would be available pending formal requests.
	   ``We need to give some time to the government of Myanmar to
investigate first,'' Sukhumbhand Pharibatra, Thailand's deputy
foreign minister, told reporters in Bangkok. ``We are asking for
the return of the three and that they be taken care of.''
	   Another Myanmar official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
told The Associated Press that there had been a misinterpretation
of a government statement Monday by some news organizations, which
reported the activists would be charged and tried.
	   The Burmese-language statement, issued after a news conference
Monday, said: ``It is obvious that this was premeditated, therefore
arrangements are being made to take necessary action.''
	   The action included detention and interrogation, which the
activists presumably were still undergoing Tuesday, but did not
mean that the activists would go through a criminal trial, the
official said. Deportation remained an option.
	   A British-Australian citizen was sentenced to five years
imprisonment in April for distributing leaflets. He was freed last
week after serving three months in the notorious Insein Prison,
where hundreds of political prisoners are held.
	   Officials said they want to discourage leafleting and that the
activists broke two laws, including a printing act and an emergency
law. The catch-all emergency law can carry a 10-year sentence and
is frequently used against political opponents.
	   The 18 activists, who belong to overseas groups opposed to the
government, had entered Myanmar as tourists on the eve of the 10th
anniversary of a nationwide uprising that took place Aug. 8, 1988.
	   The anniversary Saturday passed calmly, with no unrest reported
anywhere. Both the government and exiled opposition leaders have
said Myanmar's people fear a repeat of the 1988 bloodshed.
	   On Sunday, the activists passed out small leaflets urging people
to remember the anniversary and not to give up. They were arrested
on the streets and at the airport and the government has accused
them of trying to incite unrest.
	   The military has ruled Myanmar since 1962 and tolerates almost
no dissent. The 1988 uprising resulted in a change of leaders, but
was eventually crushed by troops. An estimated 3,000 people died.
	   The anniversary came two weeks before an Aug. 21 deadline set by
pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi, winner of the Nobel Peace
Prize, for the government to finally allow a parliament elected in
1990 to convene. The opposition won the election, but the military
refused to relinquish power.

China cites domestic factors for maintaining yuan rate
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ The central bank Tuesday warned investors not to
bet against its U.S. dlrs 140 billion in foreign exchange reserves,
saying China will defend its currency for the sake of the domestic
economy.
	   A devaluation of the yuan would spark inflation and force a hike
in interest rates that could further slow the economy, said Liu
Mingkang, deputy governor of the People's Bank of China, the
country's central bank.
	   ``Devaluation is not a good policy for China,'' he told a news
conference.
	   Liu's comments marked the first time China has justified
maintaining the yuan's value for the sake of the domestic economy,
which fell short of targeted 8 percent economic growth in the first
half of the year.
	   Officials have repeatedly stressed that China has a
responsibility to hold firm on the yuan rate to prevent another
round of devaluations among Asian countries _ despite the harm done
to China's export competitiveness
	   China's strict control over capital flows and massive trade
surplus set it apart from countries in the region whose currencies
have fallen prey to speculators, said Liu.
	   ``I'd like to tell speculators that China is a big player, and
they'd best not miscalculate,'' Liu said.
	   China's yuan is convertible only for current account trade in
goods and services. The restrictions, together with a trade surplus
that reached U.S. dlrs 22.6 billion in the first half of 1998, have
safeguarded the yuan from speculative attack and allowed the
country to sidestep the worst of the Asian financial crisis.
	   But the regional crisis has slowed economic growth, and Liu
announced a series of measures to expand foreign banking practices
in China in an effort to reverse a downturn in foreign investment.
	   Other foreign banks may apply to join the current nine allowed
to conduct yuan transactions, and will be permitted to run those
operations in the southern boom town of Shenzhen, in addition to
Shanghai's Pudong financial district, Liu said.
	   Foreign banks may now more than double their yuan working
capital to 100 million, enjoy equal treatment in the interbank
borrowing market, and participate in syndicated yuan-denominated
loans with Chinese banks, Liu said.
	   The measures ``are conducive to a wider presence of foreign
banks and more foreign investment in China,'' Liu said.
	   Badly needed foreign investment totaled U.S. dlrs 20.5 billion
in the first half of this year, a drop of 1.3 percent against the
same period in 1997.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Rescue teams continue to pour in Tuesday,
eager to save victims of the U.S. Embassy bombings in Kenya and
Tanzania. But there's almost no one left to save.
	   Investigators were luckier, having a witness to talk to: A
Kenyan guard at the Nairobi embassy survived the bombing.
	   ``He resisted heroically,'' U.S. State Department spokesman
James Foley said in Washington.
	   The East African Standard said guard Joash Okindo and his
colleagues, armed only with short clubs, confronted five men,
barring them from the main entrance to the embassy. The bombers
drove to the rear parking lot.
	   The attackers opened up with automatic rifle fire, and at least
one Marine returned fire, he told the Kenya Television Network
Monday. But one of the attackers threw a hand grenade. Moments
later, their truck exploded.
	   ``We saved people's lives by sending it to the rear entrance,''
Okindo told the Standard. ``If we hadn't done that, I don't think I
would be alive and talking to you now.''
	   The Standard said it talked to Okindo before he was taken out of
the country on a U.S. medical evacuation flight to Germany for
treatment of serious wounds.
	   In Tanzania, a dozen people, including Sudanese and Iraqis, were
detained. But U.S. officials played down the importance of the
roundup.
	   Federal law enforcement officials in Washington said
investigators believe the Tanzania bomb was attached to a water
truck that serves the embassy and was triggered remotely,
apparently without the driver's knowledge.
	   Israel army radio also signaled a possible break in the case. In
a report from Nairobi, it said investigators suspect the bombers
used the sophisticated plastic explosive Semtex.
	   The FBI says finding out what kind of explosives were used and
how would be critical to the investigation.
	   So would an informant, and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
on Monday offered a dlrs 2 million reward for information leading
to the capture of the ``cowards that committed this act.''
	   Meanwhile, Israeli soldiers, the first professional
search-and-rescue team to reach Nairobi after the bombing,
continued to dig for a woman named Rose.
	   Her voice fell silent Sunday, but they heard a tapping noise
Monday morning that spurred them on. At nightfall, however, there'd
been nothing but silence for hours.
	   Titus Ngwele, Red Cross coordinator at the scene, said the
Israelis sank a microphone into the debris to check whether Rose
was breathing late Monday.
	   ``They weren't sure whether she was or not. She hasn't spoken
today (Monday). But they're still working to get her out and still
hoping that she's alive,'' he said.
	   The bombing in Nairobi was the deadliest attack ever on a U.S.
Embassy. A dozen Americans at the embassy died.
	   Eleven of them began their last journey home on Monday when
their flag-draped coffins were loaded onto a military transport
plane. The bodies reached Ramstein Air Force Base in Germany early
Tuesday, where they will be kept until they're flown home Thursday.
	   The 12th, who was married to a Kenyan, will be buried in her
adopted homeland.
	   In all, the twin bombings claimed more than 213 lives and
injured nearly 5,000. Another 11 bodies were pulled from the rubble
in Nairobi overnight, said Red Cross spokeswoman Nina Galbe.
	   The vast majority of the victims were in Nairobi, where
university students marched to the bomb site Monday in a
candlelight vigil.
	   ``Go Fight Americans in America,'' said one sign.
	   The United States is a favorite target of militant Islamic
fundamentalists and many ordinary people here feel Kenya got caught
in the cross fire of a battle that isn't theirs.
	   U.S., Kenyan and Tanzanian investigators are silent on any
evidence they may have recovered from the blast sites, and have not
pinpointed any one group. U.S. officials have said, however, that
the exiled Saudi financier Osama bin Laden is one potential
suspect.
	   ``We will not confirm or deny the existence of evidence in this
criminal inquiry,'' said an American diplomat in Dar es Salaam,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   In Nairobi, the head of the Kenyan side of the investigation,
Army Maj. Gen. George Agoi, said he hadn't even talked to the FBI.
	   ``The Americans are here handling their side, and we are
handling our side,'' he said.
	   The rescue efforts _ haphazard at first _ may have destroyed
evidence at the two bomb sites, but U.S. officials said it was
inevitable because the victims came first.
	   ``Obviously, the first priority is finding people alive and then
to recover bodies,'' said U.S. Embassy spokesman Chris Scharf.
	   No one has been pulled alive out of the rubble since Saturday.
	   The United States is bringing in a Navy Seabees battalion in the
next few days to help with the recovery.
	   ``If there are still missing victims, that will be their first
priority,'' said Navy Cmdr. Gordon Hume.
	   The Seabees are part of a 200-strong U.S. military task force
deployed in Nairobi. The task force includes a 20-person medical
team and a crisis response team to counsel people, Hume said.

Iranian doctors find 1.5 kilograms heroin in sick man's stomach
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A man had just crossed into Iran from
Pakistan when he fell ill with severe stomach cramps.
	   Moved by his distress, officials arranged for him to be taken to
hospital in the nearby city of Zahedan.
	   Surgeons operated and quickly found the source of his pain: 109
small packets containing a total of 1.5 kilograms (3.3 pounds) of
of heroin, Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency reported
Tuesday.
	   The man, a Tanzanian national, said he swallowed the packets in
Pakistan and planned to travel overland to Europe, IRNA said.
	   A doctor told the agency the patient's condition was improving.
	   He would be handed over to the police once he had recovered
fully, a hospital official said.

	   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) _ Suspected Muslim extremists have
killed a village official they suspected of being a government spy,
police in the southern Philippines police said Tuesday.
	   Police said the body of Alibasa Ali was found Monday minutes
after he was slain in Landang Laum village on Sacol Island, just
off the port city of Zamboanga.
	   Regional police chief Dominador Resos said Ali was returning
home from a village meeting when about four suspected extremists
blocked his path and opened fire with automatic weapons.
	   Resos quoted villagers as saying the rebels killed Ali because
of his opposition to their extortion activities and because they
suspected that he was informing police about them.
	   Sacol is a known lair of Muslim rebels and pirates.
	   Last year, kidnapped German executive Robert Buehs spent most of
his 108 days in captivitiy on the island. He was released after his
family paid ransom, whose amount was not made public.

Russian government to submit seven austerity bills to parliament
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Seeking to improve its weak tax collection system,
President Boris Yeltsin's government will ask parliament to approve
seven new bills at a special legislative session this week.
	   The government was able to push through only part of an
austerity program last month because the Communists and other
hard-liners in parliament rejected a number of tax-raising
measures.
	   The new bills include a program for rescheduling debts of
insolvent enterprises and a measure that would raise fines imposed
on enterprise directors accused of administrative offenses,
ITAR-Tass and Interfax news agencies reported Tuesday.
	   Russia's tax chief Boris Fyodorov has said that 5,000 companies
owe a total of dlrs 50 billion in taxes and fines, incurred over
the past few years.
	   ``It is impossible to collect all the old debts, accrued over
many years,'' Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko said Tuesday.
	   The government mainly wants to see timely payments of current
taxes, Kiriyenko added, according to Interfax.
	   Yeltsin's government has made countless promises to improve tax
collection. But it has consistently failed to raise the revenues
needed to provide basic services and pay millions of state workers
on a timely basis.
	   Russia's tax collection figures have improved in recent months,
though not as much as hoped.
	   Kiriyenko urged the state tax service to raise collections in
August to 13.5 billion rubles (2.2 billion dollars), Interfax
reported.
	   Earlier, officials said that receipts for August would total
12.5 billion rubles (dlrs 2 billion). This would have been up
marginally from 12.1 billion rubles (dlrs 1.9 billion) in July.
	   Parliament's lower house will hold the special session Wednesday
and Thursday to consider the new bills as well as amended versions
of bills that were rejected in July.
	   The chamber has blocked a number of tax increases the government
has sought, and chances that even the amended versions will all be
approved are ``minimum,'' the chief of parliament's budget
committee, Alexander Zhukov, was quoted as saying by ITAR-Tass.
	   Meanwhile Yeltsin, who is on vacation in the northwestern lake
resort region of Valdai, was to meet Tuesday with his chief of
staff Valentin Yumashev, Interfax reported, citing presidential
press service.

Weather bureau reports 6.3 earthquake, no damage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ A magnitude 6.3 earthquake rattled parts
of Taiwan, including the capital, Tuesday but no damage or injuries
were reported.
	   The Central Weather Bureau said the quake struck about 190
kilometers (118 miles) off the coast of northeast Ilan County, and
almost 80 kilometers (50 miles) below the earth's surface, late
Tuesday morning.
	   ``Normally, an earthquake of 5.0 or above on the Richter scale
would cause damage to buildings,'' said Lu Wen-hsi of the bureau's
Earthquake Center. ``But since the epicenter was very far from
Taipei, no damage was expected.''
	   Taipei is about 45 kilometers (28 miles) from Ilan County.
	   Earthquake magnitude is a measure of the total energy released
by an earthquake, as indicated by ground motion recorded on
seismographs. An increase of one digit in the scale represents a
tenfold increase in the strength of the quake.
	   In mid-July, an earthquake with a magnitude of 6.2 jolted
Taiwan, causing rock slides on a southern mountain that killed at
least four people and injured 19.
	   Officials said the earthquake was the worst to hit southern
Taiwan since a 1964 quake that killed 106 people, injured 650 and
buried 10,500 homes.

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's stock market tumbled Tuesday below
a key support level untested in nearly a decade, while its currency
also weakened as regional woes continued to rattle local markets.
	   In afternoon trading, the benchmark Straits Times Industrials
Index plunged 3.9 percent, or 40.33 points, through the
psychologically important 1,000-point level to 998.94, its lowest
intra-day level since 1988. The index finished at 1.039.27 Friday,
and the stock exchange was closed Monday for a national holiday.
	   The Singapore dollar was also significantly weaker Tuesday,
dropping to about 1.76 against the U.S. dollar in response to the
Japanese yen's fall to an eight-year low against the American
currency. In late Asian trading Monday, the U.S. dollar bought
1.752 Singapore dollars.
	   Although it is already at levels not seen in years, the stock
index may eventually drop much further, analysts said.
	   ``It's heading to 800, without much respite, by the end of this
year,'' Edwin Tay, research manager at BT Brokerage and Associates,
told Dow Jones Newswires.
	   On its way down, the index easily breached this year's intra-day
low of 1,031.30, set Jan. 12. Analysts said the worsening regional
currency situation and softening Asian equity markets were to
blame.
	   The yen's plunge and persistent fears that China might devalue
its currency, the yuan, were discouraging investors, dealers said.
Similar drops in other Asian stock markets were further dampening
the Singapore bourse, they added.

 &UR; URGENT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ The Taliban militia said Tuesday a
former prime minister who was a leader of the factions opposing
them was killed in northern Afghanistan.
	   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he was
shot by three gunmen in the northern province of Takhar, an area
held by the anti-Taliban alliance of which he was a leader. They
had no further details and there was no confirmation.

Seventeen kilograms of gold seized from car in Siberia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Police confiscated more than 17 kilograms (37.4
pounds) of gold from a car stopped on a highway in a gold-mining
region in eastern Siberia, a news report said Tuesday.
	   Theft from Siberian gold mines has become widespread, and police
believe that the gold seized in the Kolyma region was stolen,
Interfax news agency reported.
	   The car was apparently pulled over for a traffic violation, and
its two occupants offered no resistance, Interfax said.
	   The gold is worth about dlrs 170,000 at the current world price
of around dlrs 285 an ounce.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Investigators began to piece together
evidence from last week's embassy bombings Tuesday, with a heroic
Kenyan guard's eyewitness account providing possibly important
information.
	   In all, the twin bombings claimed more than 213 lives and
injured nearly 5,000. Another 11 bodies were pulled from the rubble
in Nairobi overnight, Red Cross spokeswoman Nina Galbe said
Tuesday.
	   The East African Standard said guard Joash Okindo and his
colleagues, armed only with short wooden clubs, confronted five
men, barring them from the main entrance to the embassy and forcing
them to drive to the rear parking lot.
	   The attackers then jumped from the truck and opened fire with
automatic rifles. At least one Marine returned fire and one of the
attackers threw a hand grenade. Moments later, the truck exploded,
Okindo told the Kenya Television Network Monday.
	   ``We saved people's lives by sending it to the rear entrance,''
Okindo told the Standard. ``If we hadn't done that, I don't think I
would be alive and talking to you now.''
	   The Standard said it talked to Okindo before he was taken out of
the country on a U.S. medical evacuation flight to Germany for
treatment of serious wounds.
	   ``He resisted heroically,'' U.S. State Department spokesman
James Foley said in Washington.
	   In Tanzania, a dozen people, including Sudanese and Iraqis, were
detained. But U.S. officials played down the importance of the
roundup.
	   Israel army radio also signaled a possible break in the case. In
a report from Nairobi, it said investigators suspect the bombers
used the sophisticated plastic explosive Semtex.
	   The FBI says finding out what kind of explosives were used and
how would be critical to the investigation.
	   So would an informant, and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
on Monday offered a dlrs 2 million reward for information leading
to the capture of the ``cowards that committed this act.''
	   Meanwhile, Israeli soldiers, the first professional
search-and-rescue team to reach Nairobi after the bombing,
continued to dig for a woman named Rose.
	   Her voice fell silent Sunday, but they heard a tapping noise
Monday morning that spurred them on. At nightfall, however, there'd
been nothing but silence for hours.
	   Titus Ngwele, Red Cross coordinator at the scene, said the
Israelis sank a microphone into the debris to check whether Rose
was breathing late Monday.
	   ``They weren't sure whether she was or not. She hasn't spoken
today (Monday). But they're still working to get her out and still
hoping that she's alive,'' he said.
	   No one has been pulled alive out of the rubble since Saturday.
	   The bombing in Nairobi was the deadliest attack ever on a U.S.
Embassy. A dozen Americans at the embassy died.
	   The bodies of 11 of them began their last journey home on Monday
when their flag-draped coffins were loaded onto a military
transport plane headed for Germany. Albright is expected to
accompany the dead back to the United States on Thursday.
	   The 12th, who was married to a Kenyan, will be buried in her
adopted homeland.
	   The vast majority of victims were in Nairobi, where university
students marched to the bomb site Monday in a candlelight vigil.
	   ``Go Fight Americans in America,'' said one sign.
	   The United States is a favorite target of militant Islamic
fundamentalists and many ordinary people here feel Kenya got caught
in the cross fire of a battle that isn't theirs.
	   U.S., Kenyan and Tanzanian investigators are silent on any
evidence they may have recovered from the blast sites, and have not
pinpointed any one group. U.S. officials have said, however, that
the exiled Saudi financier Osama bin Laden is one potential
suspect.
	   ``We will not confirm or deny the existence of evidence in this
criminal inquiry,'' said an American diplomat in Dar es Salaam,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   In Nairobi, the head of the Kenyan side of the investigation,
Army Maj. Gen. George Agoi, said he hadn't even talked to the FBI.
	   ``The Americans are here handling their side, and we are
handling our side,'' he said.
	   The rescue efforts _ haphazard at first _ may have destroyed
evidence at the two bomb sites, but U.S. officials said it was
inevitable because the victims came first.
	   ``Obviously, the first priority is finding people alive and then
to recover bodies,'' said U.S. Embassy spokesman Chris Scharf.
	   The United States is bringing in a Navy Seabees construction
battalion in the next few days to help with the recovery.
	   ``If there are still missing victims, that will be their first
priority,'' said Navy Cmdr. Gordon Hume.
	   The Seabees are part of a 200-strong U.S. military task force
deployed in Nairobi. The task force includes a 20-person medical
team and a crisis response team to counsel people, Hume said.

Foreign activists still detained, no decision on trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Philippines protest, grafs 8-9; details of
government review, 4th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ The 18 foreign democracy activists
detained for handing out anti-government leaflets remained in the
custody of Myanmar's military regime Tuesday, their fate undecided.
	   Two government officials denied reports that the ruling State
Peace and Development Council had decided to charge the activists
and put them on trial, saying no decision had been taken.
	   ``The legal process is under way and it will be premature to
give comment on the outcome at this moment,'' a spokesman said in a
statement faxed to The Associated Press in Bangkok, Thailand.
	   The Home Affairs Ministry and legal departments were working
``to come up with a legal point of view'' that would be presented
to ``relevant officials'' for a decision, a subsequent fax said.
	   Earlier reports of a criminal trial panicked supporters and
family members of the activists meeting in Bangkok, Thailand. The
detainees include six Americans, three Thais, three Malaysians,
three Indonesians, two Philippines citizens and an Australian.
	   Embassies in Myanmar, also known as Burma, have been seeking
access to their detained citizens since they were taken in Sunday.
None was known to have been visited yet, though the government said
again Tuesday access would be available pending formal requests.
	   ``We need to give some time to the government of Myanmar to
investigate first,'' Sukhumbhand Pharibatra, Thailand's deputy
foreign minister, told reporters in Bangkok. ``We are asking for
the return of the three and that they be taken care of.''
	   In Manila, 30 human rights activists, some holding placards
reading ``Democracy for Burma,'' picketed the Myanmar Embassy and
demanded the release of the detainees. They attempted to deliver a
letter, but were stopped by guards.
	   ``I'm afraid. I don't know what happened to my son,'' said
Leticia Resuena, mother of detained activist Ponciano Resuena.
	   Another Myanmar official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
told The Associated Press that there had been a misinterpretation
of a government statement Monday by some news organizations, which
reported the activists would be charged and tried.
	   The Burmese-language statement, issued after a news conference
Monday, said: ``It is obvious that this was premeditated, therefore
arrangements are being made to take necessary action.''
	   The action included detention and interrogation, which the
activists presumably were still undergoing Tuesday, but did not
mean that the activists would go through a criminal trial, the
official said. Deportation remained an option.
	   A British-Australian citizen was sentenced to five years
imprisonment in April for distributing leaflets. He was freed last
week after serving three months in the notorious Insein Prison,
where hundreds of political prisoners are held.
	   Officials said they want to discourage leafleting and that the
activists broke two laws, including a printing act and an emergency
law. The catchall emergency law can carry a 10-year sentence and is
frequently used against political opponents.
	   The 18 activists, who belong to overseas groups opposed to the
government, had entered Myanmar as tourists on the eve of the 10th
anniversary of a nationwide uprising Aug. 8, 1988.
	   The anniversary Saturday passed calmly, with no unrest reported
anywhere. Both the government and exiled opposition leaders have
said Myanmar's people fear a repeat of the 1988 bloodshed.
	   On Sunday, the activists passed out small leaflets urging people
to remember the anniversary and not to give up. They were arrested
on the streets and at the airport, and the government has accused
them of trying to incite unrest.
	   The military has ruled Myanmar since 1962 and tolerates almost
no dissent. The 1988 uprising resulted in a change of leaders, but
was eventually crushed by troops. An estimated 3,000 people died.
	   The anniversary came two weeks before an Aug. 21 deadline set by
pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi, winner of the Nobel Peace
Prize, for the government to finally allow a parliament elected in
1990 to convene. The opposition won the election, but the military
refused to relinquish power.

	   The sketchy report from Taliban sources did not make clear who
might have been responsible for his death, or when he died.
	   Hekmatyar fled to neighboring Iran after the Taliban ousted his
government from Kabul in 1996. He returned to help lead a fractious
coalition of anti-Taliban factions and was last reported in
Badakshan province in the far northeastern province of Afghanistan.

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Like other Europeans, Austrians are
broiling in a fierce summer-long heat wave, with temperatures in
this Alpine country reaching levels more common in sunny lands of
the Mediterranean or Africa.
	   The 1,000-year-old city of Tulln, 30 kilometers (18 miles)
northwest of Vienna, holds the distinction of recording the
summer's highest temperature _ 36.9 degrees Centigrade (98.4
Fahrenheit) on June 7.
	   According to the national meterological service, the hottest day
of the year nationwide was July 21, when several cities posted
record highs around 36 degrees Centigrade (97 Fahrenheit),
including St. Polten, Amstetten and Linz.
	   Even Salzburg, normally associated with cool high valleys and
snow-capped peaks, sizzled under 36 degrees Centigrade (96.8
Fahrenheit) on July 21.
	   Vienna's hottest day was the day before _ July 20 _ when the
mercury hit 34.5 Centigrade (94.1 Fahrenheit) in the center of the
city.
	   The week's advance forecast: sunny and hot.

Reactor restarted at Ukraine's Zaporizhya nuclear power plant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A reactor at the Zaporizhya nuclear power
plant was restarted early Tuesday after an automatic shutdown the
day before, officials said.
	   No radiation leaks or violations of safety rules were reported
during the restart, the state nuclear energy company Energoatom
said.
	   The No. 5 reactor automatically shut down Monday due to a
malfunction in the turbine generators' water level regulation
system. The accident at Europe's largest nuclear power plant
occurred just a day after the reactor was restarted following 99
days of repairs.
	   A total of 14 accidents have occurred at the Zaporizhya plant in
the first seven months of 1998, more than at any other of Ukraine's
nuclear energy facilities, according to plant figures.
	   Ukraine's five nuclear plants accounted for 41.4 percent of the
former Soviet republic's electricity production in July, Energoatom
says.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with further drop in market, comments &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong's key stock index plunged Tuesday to
its lowest level in more than five years because investors haunted
by fears of a weakening yen continued to dump shares, traders said.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index broke through 7,000 at the start
of the day and kept heading down. By midafternoon, it was down
almost 4 percent for the day to 6,769. Analysts warned it could go
lower.
	   ``No one can really think of a reason to buy,'' said James
Osborn, a director at ING Barings Securities. ``There's still
enough reason to sell.''
	   The Hang Seng was dragged down by heavyweight banking company
HSBC Holdings, which lost nearly 5 percent.
	   The loss continued a bad run for HSBC, which is down 18 percent
since the end of July. On Aug. 3, it reported first-half net profit
had dropped 16 percent.
	   Traders said investors fear that Hong Kong may be forced to
delink its currency, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar, under
pressure from a weak yen and new speculative attacks.
	   A trader with a U.S. investment house said speculators who moved
into the market last week appeared to consist of ``quality''
companies that are more powerful than those involved in previous
attacks on the Hong Kong dollar.
	   But traders said they didn't know precisely who was behind the
move.
	   Investors also fear that the anemic yen eventually will force
China to devalue its yuan, which likely would bring a new round of
currency devaluations in the region.
	   The yen also weakened further, breaking through 147 to the
dollar in afternoon trading to reach 147.60.
	   After losing 12 percent last week on a string of poor local and
regional economic news, the Hang Seng had posted a gain of 0.2
percent Monday, closing at 7,034.62 points.

Big fire breaks out in oil facility in India's northeast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GAUHATI, India (AP) _ In a case of suspected sabotage, a massive
fire erupted early Tuesday in an oil storage tank in eastern India,
but there were no casualties, police said.
	   At least 26 fire engines battled flames that leapt 50 meters
(150 feet) high. The state-owned Indian Oil Corp. facility stores
motor oil and diesel in the Nagaon district, 60 kilometers (40
miles) east of Gauhati.
	   Police said they suspected rebels of the United Liberation Front
of Assam, who have stepped up violence as a protest against India's
independence day celebrations this week.
	   Two businessmen were shot and killed Monday night by suspected
ULFA militants in Gauhati, the state capital of Assam, police said.
No one claimed responsibility for the attack. In a separate
incident blamed on the separatist group on the weekend, three army
soldiers were killed in a land mine explosion in a central rural
district.
	   ULFA seeks full sovereignty for Assam, accusing India of
exploiting the state like a colony by stripping its resources and
failing to invest in its development.

	   Ousted President Burhanuddin Rabbani, leader of another
anti-Taliban faction, had fought a bitter struggle for power with
Hekmatyar, leader of the southern-based Hezb-e-Islami. Rocket
bombardments by their rival forces reduced Kabul to rubble.
	   At that point, the Taliban entered the fray, swiftly capturing
the southern province of Kandahar. In June 1996, Hekmatyar, having
been all but eliminated as a military power in the civil war,
signed a peace pact with Rabbani and returned to his former post in
the capital as prime minister.
	   The Taliban militia advanced and captured Kabul in September,

Cambodian leader offers prince's party stake in new government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian strongman Hun Sen offered
Tuesday to give Prince Norodom Ranariddh's opposition party a stake
in the new government, but was likely to leave out the party led by
outspoken critic Sam Rainsy, an adviser said Tuesday.
	   The offer came a day after election authorities said they would
no longer investigate complaints of fraud and irregularities in the
July 26 parliamentary elections. Opposition leaders have said they
would spurn coalition offers until the allegations are addressed.
	   Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party won last month's
parliamentary elections, but lacks the two-thirds majority needed
to form a government. Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party and the Sam
Rainsy Party have been invited to join him.
	   Prak Sokhon, a Hun Sen adviser, said the CPP and FUNCINPEC,
which finished second in the balloting, will ``work out an
arrangement of a new government, leaving the third party in the
opposition, in accordance with its profession.''
	   Hun Sen's party would take 60 percent of the Cabinet portfolios
and FUNCINPEC 40 percent, Prak Sokhon said.
	   Ranariddh's party finished first in U.N.-sponsored elections in
1993, but agreed to a co-premiership when Hun Sen menaced civil
war. Their tense arrangement was shattered last year when Hun Sen
deposed his partner in fighting in the capital.
	   Last week, the CPP was declared winner of the July elections,
with an official tally of 64 of the 122 National Assembly seats
against 43 for FUNCINPEC and 15 for the Sam Rainsy Party.
	   The opposition has alleged hundreds of irregularities and
refuses to recognize the election results pending investigations
and recounts. It also has appealed to the United Nations for help
in contesting the formula used to allocate seats.
	   The Sam Rainsy Party looks like being left in the cold. It is
the smallest of the three and is numerically unnecessary to form a
government. Sam Rainsy, a former finance minister, has been
critical of corruption in both other parties.
	   ``Hun Sen said if it joins the government just in order to
disturb it, it is better to leave it as an opposition party,'' Prak
Sokhon said, adding that the suggestion is in line with
recommendations by several donor countries.
	   So far, Hun Sen has demanded that he be named prime minister and
that his party keep control of the key ministries _ defense,
interior, justice, finance and foreign affairs.

Taliban says former prime minister killed

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ The Taliban militia said Tuesday that
a former prime minister and leader of one of the factions opposing
their rule has been killed in northern Afghanistan.
	   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Gulbuddin
Hekmatyar was shot by three gunmen in the northern province of
Takhar, an area held by the anti-Taliban alliance that he helped
lead. They provided no further details, and there was no
independent confirmation.
	   The sketchy report from Taliban sources did not make clear who
might have been responsible for his death or when he died.
	   Hekmatyar fled to neighboring Iran after the Taliban ousted his
government from Kabul in 1996, but he returned to help lead a
fractious coalition of anti-Taliban factions. An ally said recently
he was in Badakshan province in the far northeastern province of
Afghanistan, bordering Takhar province.
	   The Taliban, who control most of Afghanistan, are opposed by a
loose coalition of forces concentrated in the northeastern part of
the country.
	   Before the Taliban seized power, ousted President Burhanuddin
Rabbani, leader of another anti-Taliban faction, had fought a
bitter struggle for power with Hekmatyar, leader of the
southern-based Hezb-e-Islami. Rocket bombardments by their rival
forces reduced Kabul to rubble.
	   At that point, the Taliban entered the fray and swiftly captured
the southern province of Kandahar. Hekmatyar was all but eliminated
as a military power in the civil war, and in June 1996 he signed a
peace pact with Rabbani and returned to his former post in the
capital as prime minister.
	   The Taliban militia advanced and finally captured Kabul in
September, 1996.

Philippine official: rejecting military accord could strain
</HEADLINE>
relations with U.S. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon said
Tuesday that Manila's ties with the United States could be strained
if the Philippine Senate rejects an accord allowing the resumption
of joint military exercises in the country.
	   Siazon said the Manila government will submit the proposed
Visiting Forces Agreement to the Philippine Senate for ratification
in October.
	   Early this year, Philippine and U.S. officials signed the
accord, which governs the conduct of the exercises and provides
some legal protection to U.S. soldiers while on duty in the
country. It must be ratified by the 23-member Philippine Senate
before it can take effect.
	   Siazon told Filipino senators in a meeting that ``when relations
sour in one sector of the relationship, they tend to impinge
negatively on all aspects of the relationships.''
	   He said without elaborating that trade between the two countries
could be particularly vulnerable. The United States is one of the
Philippines' largest trading partners.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen and Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright separately met President Joseph Estrada and
other Philippine officials recently to seek support for the accord,
which is opposed by church leaders and many left-wing groups.
	   Critics say the accord infringes on Philippine sovereignty
because it limits the Manila government's right to prosecute
American soldiers who commit crimes here.
	   They said the presence of foreign troops would also promote
prostitution.
	   Estrada has said the country needs the accord to boost its very
weak military when tensions are running high in Asia because of
various territorial disputes.
	   Siazon and Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado were asked to
appear before the Senate committees on defense and foreign affairs
Tuesday to explain why Estrada, Mercado and other senior officials
were not informed in advance by the military of a live-fire war
exercise by the Philippine and U.S. navies last week in
international waters.
	   Siazon said Estrada was not informed of the exercise because it
was just one of several minor military exercises staged by the two
countries yearly.
	   The United States halted major joint exercises in the
Philippines and visits by U.S. military ships in December 1996,
when the Manila government ended a legal loophole that had shielded
U.S. military personnel from prosecution by the Philippines for
crimes committed here.
	   Military ties with the United States have remained a sensitive
issue since a nationalist Philippine Senate forced the closure of
the last U.S. base in the country in 1992, ending close to a
century of American military presence in its former colony.

China's industrial production slows as floods take toll
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's value-added industrial production rose
7.8 percent from a year earlier to 1.11 trillion yuan (dlrs 134
billion) in this year's first seven months as widespread flooding
and the Asian financial crisis took their toll.
	   Value-added output for July grew 7.6 percent from a year
earlier, compared with growth of 7.9 percent in the first half of
the year, the State Statistical Bureau reported Tuesday.
	   The value-added, or incremental value, of industrial production
excludes the cost of raw materials used in the manufacturing
process. It is China's benchmark measure of industrial production.
	   In addition to seasonal factors, industrial production has
slowed due to destructive floods that have disrupted transportation
routes and forced some companies to suspend production, the bureau
reported.
	   Collective companies' output rose 5.1 percent in July from a
year ago, down 1.3 percentage points from growth in June; and
production at joint-venture companies climbed 11.6 percent, a 0.3
percentage point drop from June, the report said.
	   State company output grew 2.6 percent in July from a year
earlier, 1 percentage point more than growth in June, the SSB said.

Pakistan: We cannot be held responsible for events in Afghanistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Pakistan cannot be held responsible for the
safety of 12 Iranians Tehran says were captured by the Taliban in
northern Afghanistan, Pakistan's Embassy in Iran said Tuesday.
	   Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi has said his country
holds Pakistan responsible for 11 Iranian diplomats and a reporter
for the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency.
	   Iran says they were captured by the Taliban when forces of the
hard-line Islamic group blazed into the northern opposition
stronghold of Mazar-e-Sharif on Saturday.
	   Pakistan is believed to be the main force behind the Taliban,
who now control most of Afghanistan.
	   On Tuesday, relatives of the Iranian reporter, Mahmoud Saremi,
gathered in front of the Pakistan Embassy in Tehran, demanding
action for his return.
	   ``The government of Pakistan has used all possible influence
over the Taliban for the security and safety of the Iranian
personnel and would continue to do so in future,'' the embassy said
in a statement.
	   But ``Pakistan ... cannot be held responsible for developments
in Afghanistan,'' the statement said.

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Gunmen loyal to Georgia's government
ambushed a patrol vehicle in the country's breakaway Abkhazia
region Tuesday, killing four policemen, a news report said.
	   The attackers fired automatic rifles at the Abkhazian police
car, which was patrolling the restive Ghali district. One policeman
was also seriously wounded in the ambush, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   Earlier in the day, Abkhazian gunmen opened fire at residential
homes, wounding one person, officials said.
	   Ten Abkhazian separatists crossed into the Zugdidi region under
the cover of darkness and rained down grenades and automatic weapon
fire on surrounding homes, said Dali Dzhodzhua, a spokeswoman for
Abkhazia's pro-Georgian government-in-exile.
	   Georgian troops returned fire, forcing the gunmen to flee. Five
houses were burned down in the skirmish, Dzhodzhua said.
	   Separatist in Abkhazia, located on the Black Sea in Georgia's
northwest, drove out Georgian troops and ethnic Georgian civilians
in a 1992 independence war.
	   Violence has broken about sporadically since the 13-month
struggle, despite the presence of Russian peacekeepers in the
region.

Government investigates bacteria levels in milk
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The government will carry out nationwide testing
of milk to determine if pasteurization destroys bacteria that might
be linked to Crohn's disease, an intestinal illness whose cause is
unknown.
	   Food safety experts Tuesday sought to calm public fears over
milk after preliminary government tests suggested mycobacterium
paratuberculosis could be in one fifth of the supply of pasteurized
milk.
	   The bacteria cause Johne's disease, a cattle disorder that
scientists say might be linked with Crohn's disease in humans.
	   Previous research has indicated that pasteurization should be
effective in destroying the organism, but results from a small
number of samples analyzed as part of the preparatory work for the
national survey showed that the bacteria may be present in
pasteurized milk, albeit to a lesser extent than in raw milk.
	   The 18-month nationwide survey will test a thousand samples for
a range of bacteria.
	   Health officials stressed there was no need for people to change
their dietary habits.
	   Dr. Norman Simmons, a government food safety adviser, played
down the risk and said the government decided to be open about the
investigation to avoid being accused of secrecy.
	   ``The government is trying to be honest with the consumer, to
give them the information as soon as possible. What's the
alternative? If it's concealed the government is accused of hiding
it, if it's revealed, the government is accused of being
alarmist,'' he said.
	   Researchers visited 16 dairies in Northern Ireland as part of
the preparatory work for the survey. They collected 62 samples _ 31
of raw milk and 31 of pasteurized milk.
	   Provisional results showed the bacteria were in 10 raw milk
samples and six pasteurized samples.
	   The National Dairy Council and the Farmer's Union said they
supported the further investigation.
	   Hugh Pennington, professor of bacteriology at Aberdeen
University in Scotland, told GMTV news that pasteurized milk is one
of the safest foods and that there is no need for concern.
	   The tests are designed to make ``absolutely certain'' there is
no risk to the public at all,'' he said.
	   Pennington said Crohn's disease, an intestinal inflammation, has
some similarities to the cattle affliction and that the connection
may go no further than that.
	   ``The evidence that's come up to suggest there's any link
between Crohn's disease and this bug in cows is not really there at
all, but people are still looking, to be absolutely certain,''
Pennington said.
	   Scientists trying to determine the cause of Crohn's disease also
have considered viruses and dietary factors. The disease, occurring
mostly among people under 40, is a chronic inflammation of the
intestinal tract.

Tokyo stock prices tumble for seventh day, dollar hits eight-year

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stock prices tumbled Tuesday for the
seventh consecutive trading day as investors worried about the
banking sector and the yen's slide to an eight-year low against the
U.S. dollar.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 219.43 points,
or 1.40 percent, closing at 15,406.99. Including Monday's
202.75-point fall, or 1.28 percent, the Nikkei index now has
dropped a total of 971.98 points in seven sessions.
	   Concerns among investors that weaker banks may be forced to shut
down helped drive down shares of troubled Long-Term Credit Bank of
Japan Ltd., which closed at 38 yen, down 5 yen from Monday's close.
	   Share prices below 100 yen are ordinarily seen as a warning sign
of a company's imminent demise. Sumitomo Trust and Banking Corp.
announced in June that it was considering a merger with the
debt-plagued bank.
	   Overall, the banking sector was among the market's top decliners
Tuesday for a second straight day, falling 2.7 percent.
	   Japan's Parliament is now in session to debate
government-proposed bills to clean up an estimated 80 trillion yen
(dlrs 548 billion) in bad debts held by Japanese banks.
	   Also affecting the Tokyo market was a continued fall in Hong
Kong share prices. By midafternoon, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index
was down almost 4 percent to 6,769.
	   ``The continued fall in Hong Kong shares triggered fears about a
further drop in the yen and other Asian currencies,'' said Yasuo
Ueki, general manager at Nikko Securities.
	   Among other losers were shares of trading companies, including
Sumitomo Corp. and Itochu Corp.
	   Trading was moderate, with an estimated 460 million shares
changing hands on the first section, up from Monday's 363 million.
Declines overwhelmed advances 952 to 189, with 131 issues
unchanged.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section fell 20.21 points, or 1.67 percent, to 1,186.88. It
had dropped 18.21 points, or 1.49 percent, the previous day.
	   In late afternoon, the dollar bought 147.41 yen, up 0.76 yen
from late Monday and also above its New York rate of 146.15 yen
overnight.
	   In Tuesday's trading, it ranged between 146.00 yen and 147.64
yen, the dollar's highest intraday level since 147.81 yen on Aug.
20, 1990.
	   The dollar moved in a relatively narrow range in the morning
amid fears of intervention by Japan's central bank to support the
yen.
	   But lifted by sliding Tokyo stock prices, the U.S. currency
gained momentum in the afternoon, moving above its previous
eight-year high of 146.73 yen, set on June 16, traders said.
	   The yen also was hurt by the latest monthly report by Japan's
Economic Planning Agency, which called the economy ``sluggish.''
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 1.180 percent from Monday's close of 1.170 percent,
driving its price down to 111.92 yen from 112.00 yen.

	   EPISKOPI BASE, Cyprus (AP) _ A bush fire has destroyed the villa
of the commander of this British military base and the houses of
ten other senior officers.
	   ``The houses have been completely razed, its a tragedy,'' base
spokesman Capt. Jon Brown said of the fire, which was continuing to
burn Tuesday.
	   The fire, which began in the brush surrounding the base in
southwestern Cyprus on Monday, damaged three more houses at the
base as well as storerooms and vehicles, Brown said.
	   There were no injuries as the base evacuated the occupants of
328 houses and gave a total of 582 people, mainly women and
children, temporary accommodation at the adjacent Royal Air Force
station of Akrotiri, Brown said.
	   Hundreds of British soldiers, assisted by the Cypriot fire
brigade, fought the fire, which spread rapidly owning to a strong
wind from the sea.
	   The fire fighters managed to contain the fire late Monday night,
but it continued to smolder in places Tuesday morning.
	   Firemen feared it might revive if the wind, which abated during
the night, picked up.
	   It is estimated it will cost 2 million Cypriot pounds (dlrs 4.4
million) to repair the damage.
	   The base lies at one of the most beautiful spots in Cyprus. The
servicemen's family houses and other installations are built on
wooded slopes that descend sharply to the sea. The villa of the
base commander, Maj. Gen. Angus Ramsay, was a two-story building
with garden and swimming pool on the edge of cliff overlooking the
Mediterranean Sea.
	   Britain retained two sovereign bases on Cyprus after the island
gained independence in 1960. About 4,000 people, including
servicemen's families, live at the Episkopi base.
	   The fire broke out as Cyprus was experiencing its worst heat
wave in 40 years with temperatures rising to 43 degrees Celsius
(110 Fahrenheit).

Asian stock markets fall on weakening yen, fears of yuan

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets slumped Tuesday in a
vicious circle of pessimism about the region's economy, and
especially about Japan.
	   Investors also were dogged by another sharp fall in Hong Kong,
where the Hang Seng index reached a five-year low and put more
strain on the territory's currency link with the U.S. dollar. The
Hong Kong dollar has been under strong speculative attacks.
	   More than a year after Asia's economic crisis began, there still
was no good news to be found anywhere. Fears about stock prices and
currencies were reinforcing each other, driving both down.
	   Besides Asia's own troubles, there now are worries about whether
the U.S. economic boom is running out of steam.
	   A weaker U.S. economy likely would lessen demand for Asian
goods. That would hurt countries that have been hoping to export
their way out of their troubles.
	   ``A stronger dose of Japan jitters and (worries over a)
potential devaluation of the Hong Kong dollar and the yuan set off
another round of negativity,'' said James Bryson, a trader at
ANZ-Panin Securities in Jakarta.
	   During the day, the dollar broke through 147 yen, its highest
level since August 1990. Traders said it could reach 150 by the end
of the week.
	   The factors undermining the yen Tuesday included another drop in
Japanese stock prices. The benchmark Nikkei Stock Average slid
219.43 points, or 1.4 percent, to 15,406.99, its lowest close since
June 29. It was the first time since February 1996 that the Nikkei
had dropped for seven straight sessions.
	   In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index plunged almost 4
percent, closing at 6,779.95, the lowest since July 29, 1993.
	   A trader with a U.S. investment house said speculators who moved
into the Hong Kong market last week appeared to be ``quality''
companies that are more powerful than those involved in previous
attacks on the Hong Kong dollar.
	   Traders also said investors are spooked by worries over a
devaluation of the Chinese yuan, which would likely lead to another
round of devaluations in the region. At a news conference Tuesday,
the deputy governor of China's central bank, Liu Mingkang,
reiterated that China would not devalue.
	   The news was bad elsewhere in Asia, as well.
	   Singapore's Straits Times Industrial Index broke through the
1,000 barrier, falling 3.9 percent in afternoon trading. Although
that was the lowest level in 10 years, analysts predicted it
wouldn't stop there.
	   ``It's heading to 800, without much respite, by the end of this
year,'' predicted Edwin Tay, research manager at BT Brokerage and
Associates.
	   Philippine shares dropped for the fourth session, with the key
Philippine Stock Exchange Index closing 3.8 percent lower at
1,373.19. It had lost 10 percent in the past four days.
	   In Jakarta, foreign economic woes and domestic political unrest
dragged the JSX Composite Index down 2.1 percent at 412.410 points
by midday.
	   Malaysian shares also fell sharply. The Composite Index dropped
5.4 percent by afternoon, shedding 19.05 points to 334.25.
	   Australia's key stock index closed 35.3 points lower at 2,561.1,
and the index in New Zealand lost 7.71 points, closing at 1,993.27.
	   Thai shares were marginally lower in early trading.
	   But in Taiwan, bargain hunting in rubber stocks led shares
slightly higher, with the benchmark Weighted Price Index of the
Taiwan Stock Exchange closing up 11.86 points at 7,383.98.
	   Shares in South Korea also opened slightly higher, with the key
index gaining 2.39 points to 314.24.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Eight people were confirmed drowned
and seven were missing two days after a passenger ship capsized and
sank in eastern Indonesia, the official Antara news agency reported
Tuesday.
	   The ship, the Diamond Star, sank Sunday in strong winds and huge
waves during a voyage between the islands of Tual and Elat in
southeastern Maluku province, about 2,800 kilometers (1,750 miles)
east of Jakarta.
	   Antara said 174 passengers and an unspecified number of crew
were aboard. Most were rescued by other vessels in the area.
	   Police said the search for more victims was continuing.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Economic Planning Agency downgraded its
assessment of the country's overall economy Tuesday to reflect
vanishing hopes for a recovery in personal consumption.
	   In its monthly report for August, the agency said that flagging
consumer confidence amid rising unemployment has made the overall
economy ``sluggish,'' with economic conditions increasingly severe.
	   The latest appraisal represented a ``slight downgrade of the
nuance'' from ``stagnant,'' an expression the agency had used since
February, said Takafusa Shioya, deputy director-general of the EPA.
	   Shioya, briefing reporters on the report, said the latest
assessment was meant to reflect the fact that hopes for a recovery
in personal spending have disappeared for the time being.
	   The downgrade comes as consumers have become reluctant to spend
while Japan struggles with its worst recession since the end of
World War II.
	   In its August report, the EPA struck the words ``although there
are some signs of recovery'' from its description of personal
spending, saying instead that the decline in real wages is making
people increasingly less inclined to spend money.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ The central bank Tuesday warned investors not to
bet against its U.S. dlrs 140 billion in foreign exchange reserves,
saying China will defend its currency for the sake of the domestic
economy.
	   A devaluation of the yuan would spark inflation and force a hike
in interest rates that could further slow the economy, said Liu
Mingkang, deputy governor of the People's Bank of China, the
country's central bank.
	   ``Devaluation is not a good policy for China,'' he told a news
conference.
	   Liu's comments marked the first time China has justified
maintaining the yuan's value for the sake of the domestic economy,
which fell short of targeted 8 percent economic growth in the first
half of the year.
	   Officials have repeatedly stressed that China has a
responsibility to hold firm on the yuan rate to prevent another
round of devaluations among Asian countries _ despite the harm done
to China's export competitiveness
	   China's strict control over capital flows and massive trade
surplus set it apart from countries in the region whose currencies
have fallen prey to speculators, said Liu.
	   ``I'd like to tell speculators that China is a big player, and
they'd best not miscalculate,'' Liu said.
	   China's yuan is convertible only for current account trade in
goods and services. The restrictions, together with a trade surplus
that reached U.S. dlrs 22.6 billion in the first half of 1998, have
safeguarded the yuan from speculative attack and allowed the
country to sidestep the worst of the Asian financial crisis.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The Thai cabinet will hold a special
session Friday to vote on a financial-reform package aimed at
easing the crisis of the country's debt-laden banking system.
	   Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai called the meeting to hurry through
the unveiling of the package after wrapping up meetings with a
visiting International Monetary Fund team, a government spokeswoman
said Tuesday.
	   Authorities would announce the much-awaited plan, considered a
vital step toward reviving the recession-bound economy, either late
Friday or Saturday, the spokeswoman said on condition of anonymity.
	   Confusion over how the government will deal with the sector,
crippled by non-performing loans, has added to investor pessimism
over recent days. Banking stocks slipped 6.5 percent on the
benchmark Stock Exchange of Thailand index Monday.
	   The majority of Thailand's 15 commercial banks have failed to
raise adequate new capital from the private sector after becoming
laden with bad debt. Many analysts now expect the government to
step in.
	   This could be in the form of a swap of debt for bonds at a
discount. Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda has ruled out a
consolidation of bad assets under state management.
	   Tarrin said Monday that Thailand will lose some of its weaker
banks, possibly through mergers with stronger institutions, but
refused to say that any would be closed outright.
	   Widely expected is the merger of three state-run banks _ Siam
City Bank, First Bangkok City Bank and Bangkok Metropolitan Bank. A
fourth state-run bank, Bangkok Bank of Commerce, may be put up for
sale to foreign investors.
	   ___
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's value-added industrial production rose
7.8 percent from a year earlier to 1.11 trillion yuan (dlrs 134
billion) in this year's first seven months as widespread flooding
and the Asian financial crisis took their toll.
	   Value-added output for July grew 7.6 percent from a year
earlier, compared with growth of 7.9 percent in the first half of
the year, the State Statistical Bureau reported Tuesday.
	   The value-added, or incremental value, of industrial production
excludes the cost of raw materials used in the manufacturing
process. It is China's benchmark measure of industrial production.
	   In addition to seasonal factors, industrial production has
slowed due to destructive floods that have disrupted transportation
routes and forced some companies to suspend production, the bureau
reported.
	   Collective companies' output rose 5.1 percent in July from a
year ago, down 1.3 percentage points from growth in June; and
production at joint-venture companies climbed 11.6 percent, a 0.3
percentage point drop from June, the report said.
	   State company output grew 2.6 percent in July from a year
earlier, 1 percentage point more than growth in June, the SSB said.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Computer experts in Singapore are so wary of
the dreaded Y2K bug that they are counseling banks to remain closed
for the first few business days of the new millennium, a newspaper
reported Tuesday.
	   ``If nothing is changed, Singapore banks will be among the first
in the world to use such facilities and will take the highest
risk,'' Andrew Lee, a computer consultant working for a major
Singapore bank, told The Straits Times.
	   Singapore banks are scheduled to open for business on Monday,
January 3, 2000.
	   Because of their location closer to the international date line,
banks in Singapore, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan and other Asian
countries will witness the calendar transition in computer systems
before much of the rest of the world.
	   The millennium bug, in which computer systems use an antiquated
two-digit format to mark the current year, threatens to disrupt
important computer systems world-wide unless old software is
rewritten and tested properly.
	   Some experts in Singapore have indicated that many businesses _
including banks _ are not adequately prepared for the calendar
change, though the government has said that most large institutions
are on track.
	   ``The Year 2000 issue is a crisis which is going to hit us for
sure and nothing can prevent it from happening,'' warned Lee. ``We
have to work together to minimize its risks.''
	   A worst-case scenario might involve entire computer systems
crashing and billions of dollars in overseas transactions becoming
lost, the paper noted.
	   Singapore's de facto central bank, the Monetary Authority, said
it would release an assessment of the financial sector's
preparedness shortly, according to the report.

Taliban says former prime minister killed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CLARIFIES wording to `its rule' in lead; minor edits

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ The Taliban militia said Tuesday that
a former prime minister and leader of one of the factions opposing
its rule has been killed in northern Afghanistan.
	   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Gulbuddin
Hekmatyar was shot by three gunmen in the northern province of
Takhar, an area held by the anti-Taliban alliance that he helped
lead. They provided no further details, and there was no
independent confirmation.
	   The sketchy report from Taliban sources did not make clear when
he died or who might have been responsible for his death.
	   Hekmatyar fled to neighboring Iran after the Taliban ousted his
government from the capital, Kabul, in 1996, but he returned to
help lead a fractious coalition of anti-Taliban factions. An ally
said recently that he was in Badakshan province in the far
northeastern province of Afghanistan, bordering Takhar province.
	   The Taliban, an extremist Islamic movement that controls most of
Afghanistan, is opposed by a loose coalition of forces concentrated
in the northeastern part of the country.
	   Before the Taliban seized power, ousted President Burhanuddin
Rabbani, leader of another anti-Taliban faction, had fought a
bitter struggle for power with Hekmatyar, leader of the
southern-based Hezb-e-Islami. Rocket bombardments by their rival
forces reduced Kabul to rubble.
	   The Taliban entered the fray and swiftly captured the southern
province of Kandahar. Hekmatyar was all but eliminated as a
military power in the civil war, and in June 1996 he signed a peace
pact with Rabbani and returned to his former post in the capital as
prime minister.
	   The Taliban militia advanced and finally captured Kabul in
September, 1996.

U.S. Embassy in Malaysian capital on heightened security

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The U.S. Embassy in Malaysia has
closed its iron gates for all but emergency services for American
citizens after deadly terrorist bombings at missions in Africa,
embassy officials said Tuesday.
	   Armed guards on 24-hour watch circled the U.S. diplomatic
compound in Kuala Lumpur as President Bill Clinton in Washington
called for heightened security at many of the 280 missions
worldwide that don't meet tough State Department standards.
	   ``As a result of the bombings of American Embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania, the Department of State has ordered the American Embassy
in Kuala Lumpur to curtail its consular services until further
notice,'' read a statement taped to the guard stand outside the
mission.
	   Patrol cars circled the diplomatic compound Tuesday. Guards,
many armed with automatic weapons, were stationed at a nearby gas
station and at various points around the mission, whose razor-wired
gates are just off a busy street in downtown Kuala Lumpur.
	   Extra precautions have been taken at U.S. embassies worldwide,
particularly those without sufficient barriers against roadside
terrorist threats, following the car-bomb explosions Friday that
killed 12 Americans and more than 200 Africans and injured more
than 5,000 people.
	   Embassy spokesman James Warren said most staff had been given
permission to work from home and visa operations had been scaled
back until security concerns were relaxed.
	   ``We just have fewer people in the building than before,''
Warren said about the staff of 80 Americans and about 90
Malaysians. He said the embassy was still officially open.
	   However, an American citizen who attempted to enter the mission
Tuesday to pick up tax forms was told by a security guard: ``The
embassy is closed. Nobody is in the consular section. Everybody is
on leave.''
	   According to the sign at the front of the embassy, the consulate
would no longer accept visa applications on a walk-in basis, only
through travel agents and couriers. Visa interview hours had been
suspended and the processing time for visa applications had been
extended from 5 to 10 days.
	   U.S. officials have refused to speculate on who might be
responsible for the almost simultaneous explosions in Kenya and
Tanzania but have said the attacks appeared to have been organized
by a terrorist group. Certain Islamic militants have been
considered possible suspects.
	   Last November, a wave of anti-American sentiment hit Malaysia
and the U.S. Embassy reported receiving terrorism threats. The
hostility erupted after a group of U.S. congressmen demanded that
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad resign over anti-Jewish remarks.
	   Malaysia, whose 22 million people are predominantly Muslim, has
been beset by economic problems, which have been blamed by the
leadership, at least in part, on foreigners.

Bushfire destroys dlrs 4 million worth of homes at British base

	   EPISKOPI BASE, Cyprus (AP) _ A bush fire has destroyed the villa
of the commander of this British military base and the houses of
ten other senior officers.
	   ``The houses have been completely razed, its a tragedy,'' base
spokesman Capt. Jon Brown said of the fire, which was continuing to
burn Tuesday.
	   The fire, which began in the brush surrounding the base in
southwestern Cyprus on Monday, damaged three more houses at the
base as well as storerooms and vehicles, Brown said.
	   He said it would cost an estimated 2 million Cypriot pounds
(dlrs 4.4 million) to repair the damage.
	   There were no injuries as the base evacuated the occupants of
328 houses and gave a total of 582 people, mainly women and
children, temporary accommodation at the adjacent Royal Air Force
station of Akrotiri, Brown said.
	   Hundreds of British soldiers, assisted by the Cypriot fire
brigade, fought the fire, which spread rapidly owning to a strong
wind from the sea.
	   The fire fighters managed to contain the fire late Monday night,
but it continued to smolder in places Tuesday morning.
	   Firemen feared it might revive if the wind, which abated during
the night, picked up.
	   The base lies at one of the most beautiful spots in Cyprus. The
servicemen's family houses and other installations are built on
wooded slopes that descend sharply to the sea. The villa of the
base commander, Maj. Gen. Angus Ramsay, was a two-story building
with garden and swimming pool on the edge of cliff overlooking the
Mediterranean Sea.
	   Britain retained two sovereign bases on Cyprus after the island
gained independence in 1960. About 4,000 people, including
servicemen's families, live at the Episkopi base.
	   The fire broke out as Cyprus was experiencing its worst heat
wave in 40 years with temperatures rising to 43 degrees Celsius
(110 Fahrenheit).

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong's key stock index plunged Tuesday to
its lowest level in more than five years because investors haunted
by fears of a weakening yen continued to dump shares, traders said.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index broke through 7,000 at the start
of the day, and closed at 6,779.95, down 254.67 points, or 3.6
percent. It was the index's lowest level since July 23, 1995.
	   Traders said investors fear that Hong Kong may be forced to
delink its currency, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar, under
pressure from a weak yen and new speculative attacks.
	   A trader with a U.S. investment house said speculators who moved
into the market last week appeared to consist of ``quality''
companies that are more powerful than those involved in previous
attacks on the Hong Kong dollar.
	   But traders said they didn't know precisely who was behind the
move.
	   Investors also fear that the anemic yen eventually will force
China to devalue its yuan, which likely would bring a new round of
currency devaluations in the region.
	   The yen weakened further, breaking through 147 to the dollar in
afternoon trading to reach 147.60.
	   ``No one can really think of a reason to buy,'' said James
Osborn, a director at ING Barings Securities. ``There's still
enough reason to sell.''
	   After losing 12 percent last week on a string of poor local and
regional economic news, the Hang Seng Index had posted a gain of
0.2 percent Monday, closing at 7,034.62 points.
	   The index was dragged down Tuesday by heavyweight banking
company HSBC Holdings, which lost 4.3 percent, or 7 Hong Kong
dollars, closing at 155.00.
	   The loss continued a bad run for HSBC, which is down 18 percent
since the end of July. On Aug. 3, it reported first-half net profit
had dropped 16 percent.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Despite a recent string of losses
against Serb government forces, secessionist Kosovo Albanian rebels
vowed Tuesday to fight on until final victory.
	   In a statement distributed to ethnic Albanian media by the
Kosovo Liberation Army, the militants said the latest Serb
offensive ``has only strengthened our resolve to bravely continue
on the road to freedom.''
	   The statement called on Kosovo Albanians, who represent 90
percent of the Serbian province's 2 million people, to ``unite with
the KLA and help us in our just freedom fight.''
	   It also warned NATO not to deploy its troops on the
Albanian-Serbian border _ the main route of arms supply for the KLA
_ ``because we would consider this the second offensive against our
freedom and our national pride.''
	   Despite the war rhetoric, one of the top KLA officials told
local Albanian Koha Ditore daily that the militants might join an
all-Albanian negotiating team in peace negotiations with the
Serbian government.
	   Diplomatic efforts to return ethnic Albanian and Serb leaders to
the negotiating table are inching forward, despite sporadic clashes
in Kosovo province.
	   While U.S. envoy Christopher Hill met with Serb and ethnic
Albanian leaders in Pristina Monday, clashes were reported
elsewhere in the Yugoslav province, particularly in areas still
held by the rebels.
	   Hill has been mediating between pacifist ethnic Albanian leader
Ibrahim Rugova and leading politician Mehmet Hajrizi, who has close
contacts with the secessionist ethnic Albanian rebels, in hopes of
getting the Albanians to rally behind one leader.
	   Hill also met Monday with Yugoslav Vice Premier Nikola Sainovic.
	   For five months, Serb troops have been fighting the KLA, which
seeks independence from Serbia, the dominant republic of
Yugoslavia.
	   But the Albanians remain largely divided between those loyal to
Rugova, and those who support the militants.
	   ``In principle, in its meeting with Hill (earlier this month)
the KLA has agreed to form ... a coalition (Kosovo Albanian)
government,'' UCK spokesman Shaban Sala told Koha Ditore.
	   But Rugova, in his answers to questions on the Internet, said it
was hard to get in touch with the KLA leaders ``because the latest
Serb offensive has isolated them. Their stands will certainly be
heard in our future coalition.''
	   On Monday, ethnic Albanian sources claimed fierce fighting
around Djakovica and the strategic western village of Junik, near
the Albanian border, where the KLA managed to hold its positions.
	   KLA reportedly also regained the control of the central village
of Likovac, the rebels' headquarters where Hill met their
commanders earlier this month.
	   Serb officials said three KLA fighters were killed in a clash
with Serb police Monday in the village of Dura, about 40 kilometers
(25 miles) south of Pristina. Authorities there said the KLA
attacked a police patrol and police fired back.
	   The Rugova-allied Kosovo Information Center also claimed close
fighting Monday in the village of Erec, with four Albanians killed
and houses burned. Serbs suffered an undetermined number of
casualties.
	   The center also reported several villages were under siege in
the Decane area close to the Albanian border.
	   In another village, Skivjan, Serb forces reportedly gave an
ultimatum to the fighters and residents to give up their weapons
and surrender.

Russian stocks tumble; government plans new austerity measures

special session scheduled for next week, sted this week. &QL;

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian stocks opened sharply lower Tuesday, as
traders feared that Russia's economy was too weak to withstand a
new round of selling in Asian financial markets.
	   The Russian Trading System Index, which has fallen 71 percent
since the start of the year, sank about 7 percent in the first 90
minutes of trading.
	   The stock market's main index and continued to sink despite a
dlrs 300 million installment of a newly approved World Bank loan
that Russia received on Monday, part of a dlrs 22.6 international
bailout package.
	   Traders said the ruble was also a bit lower on Tuesday, only
supported by heavy intervention from the Russian Central Bank.
Investors were beginning to fear that even with the international
lending, Russia cannot support its currency.
	   The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund demand that
Russia carry out a series of economic reforms, especially improving
its weak tax collection system.
	   Seeking to meet the goal, President Boris Yeltsin's government
will ask parliament to approve seven new bills at a special
legislative session next week.
	   The government was able to push through only part of an
austerity program last month because the Communists and other
hard-liners in parliament rejected a number of tax-raising
measures.
	   The new bills include a program for rescheduling debts of
insolvent enterprises and a measure that would raise fines imposed
on enterprise directors accused of administrative abuses, the
ITAR-Tass and Interfax news agencies reported Tuesday.
	   Russia's tax chief Boris Fyodorov has said that 5,000 companies
owe a total of dlrs 50 billion in taxes and fines, incurred over
the past few years.
	   ``It is impossible to collect all the old debts, accrued over
many years,'' Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko said Tuesday.
	   The government mainly wants to see timely payments of current
taxes, Kiriyenko added, according to Interfax.
	   Yeltsin's government has made countless promises to improve tax
collection. But it has consistently failed to raise the revenues
needed to provide basic services and pay millions of state workers
on a timely basis.
	   Russia's tax collection figures have improved in recent months,
though not as much as hoped.
	   Parliament's lower house will hold the special session Aug.
19-20 to consider the new bills as well as amended versions of
bills that were rejected in July.
	   The chamber has blocked a number of tax increases the government
has sought, and chances that even the amended versions will all be
approved are ``minimum,'' the chief of parliament's budget
committee, Alexander Zhukov, was quoted as saying by ITAR-Tass.

Ukrainian archaeologists find antique jewelry workshop
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The construction site for a future
McDonald's restaurant in northern Ukraine has yielded an important
archaeological find _ an antique jewelry workshop, a newspaper said
Tuesday.
	   Numerous brass and bronze bracelets, rings and crosses were
found in the workshop, which apparently was looted and burned by
invading nomads in the 11th or 12th century, the daily Fakty said.
	   The find, in the city of Chernihiv, was located just 200 meters
(yards) away from another jewelry workshop, which was discovered
recently.
	   Last month, Chernihiv archaeologists found more than 100 coins
from the Middle Ages, preserved in a velvet purse next to the
coffin of a noblewoman. The site was an ancient cemetery on the
grounds of the present-day Technological Institute.

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Another 11 people vacationing in a summer
camp in western Ukraine were hospitalized with food poisoning,
bringing the total to 92, the Emergency Situations Ministry said
Tuesday.
	   Doctors in the town of Novovolynska, where 77 children and 15
adults were hospitalized as of Monday, said the victims apparently
ate spoiled cakes.
	   Forty-two of them were diagnosed with salmonella infection, the

	   The 12th American victim, Jean Dalizu, who was married to a

	   The explosion Friday killed at least 213 people, including the

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ After visiting 20 hospitals and making
daily rounds of mortuaries, Joseph Kaimburi's worst fears were
finally confirmed: One of the bodies crowded on a slab in the
stench-filled city morgue was his beloved older brother.
	   They were supposed to meet at Nairobi Hospital at 11 a.m. Friday
to visit a friend. But David Kaimburi, a 40-year-old businesman
with a wife and three children, never arrived. He had gone to the
American Embassy to pick up visa forms for a visit to America, his
37-year-old brother said.
	   A bomb exploded in the embassy's rear parking lot at 10:35 a.m.
	   For three days, Kaimburi had hoped he would find his brother in
a hospital bed. He had even gone to hospitals outside Nairobi in
his desperate search.
	   As he stood by the slab _ which normally holds one body but now
held two because of the overwhelming number of casualties from the
bombing _ he struggled with his emotions.
	   And as he spoke, he kept looking at his brother, still wearing
green pants, a striped shirt and jacket. His head was battered, but
his face was still recognizable. A metal identification tag, number
3799, hung from his ankle.
	   ``It's very torturing,'' he said quietly.
	   His brother was at the embassy by chance, an innocent victim of
terrorist bombers.
	   ``It's unfortunate that the bombing is coming in an African
country where we are very peaceful, where we have no problems,''
Kaimburi said. ``We have never had any problems with America. ...
The relationship is very good. They are supportive. ... This is a
very unfortunate incident.''
	   While Kaimburi was speaking, dozens of Kenyans walked through
the morgue looking for husbands and wives, brothers, sisters,
parents, children and friends. Some bodies were relatively intact,
some badly burned, some partially or totally decapitated, some
already decomposing.
	   It was a gruesome scene, yet there was almost complete silence _
except for the hysterical wailing of a woman outside.
	   Mary Otieno, 23, had just identified the body of her husband,
Elias Otieno, 30, a clerk at the Ufundi Cooperative building
adjacent to the embassy, which collapsed in the explosion.
	   Overcome with grief, she collapsed near a bench outside, sobbing
uncontrollably.
	   ``I don't understand how people can be so inhuman,'' said
Francesca Atieno, 34, a cousin of the dead man, explaining that he
left three young children, the youngest just 1 month old.
	   ``Maybe the world is too lenient with them. Maybe that's why
they get away with it,'' said Atieno, who has a public relations
business. ``The world has a population of over 4 billion. The
terrorists are just a pocket in the 4 billion. If we all say `no'
to it, it will stop.''
	   At another slab in the mortuary, Maurice O. Orato, 38, had just
identified his wife, Margaret Akinyi, 34, who was an accountant at
the Ufundi Cooperative and the mother of four children ages 3 to
13.
	   ``Since the bombing, I've been to every hospital. I've come to
this mortuary several times but didn't find her. Today, we called
the hot line, and they told us to come here,'' Orato said.
	   Tears welling in his eyes, he said he had identified his wife by
the clothes she wore when she went to work, her shoes and a
necklace.
	   ``I'm an unhappy man because I'm left with no wife,'' said
Orato, who works for the post office. ``It's a very difficult life
now for me and the family. The children are all crying. I have no
peace now. They're asking where their mother is.''
	   He said he didn't know what could be done about the terrorists.
	   For Charles Kamuti, 31, the visit to the morgue was another
exercise in frustration.
	   His younger brother, Lawrence Gitau Kamuti, 29, an assistant
pharmacist in the badly damaged 22-story Cooperative Bank of Kenya
building near the embassy, was still missing. He has a wife and two
children, the youngest just 2 months old.
	   ``I came here in the morning and evening. On Sunday we were here
again. And today we came _ but so far nothing,'' Kamuti said.
	   He complained that relatives still looking for loved ones
weren't getting any help from police or the government.
	   Lists have been posted at hospitals, and at Uhuru Park in the
center of Nairobi, but they are not complete. Nearly 5,000 people
were injured in the bombing, and 213 killed. Medical facilities in
this poor East African country have been overwhelmed.

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Cycling Australia supported Neil
Stephens' claim to be an innocent victim of the Tour de France drug
scandal when it named him in Australia's Commonwealth Games team
Tuesday.
	   Stephens was part of the Festina team which was thrown out of
the Tour last month after large quantitites of banned
performance-enhancing substances were found in an official team
vehicle and about half the team later admitted taking drugs.
	   The Australian cyclist swore he did not knowingly take drugs,
although he conceded police claims of evidence that he'd been given
a banned agent which increases oxygen in red blood cells must be
correct.
	   Stephens and Stuart O'Grady, who led the tour for three days and
won the 14th stage, head a 28-strong road and track team for the
Kuala Lumpur Games which Cycling Australia president Ray Godkin
optimistically boasted would win all 16 gold medals, 12 on the
track and four on the road.
	   Godkin said there was never any question over Stephens'
selection after the Atlanta Olympian negotiated with Festina to
release him from the Tour of Spain, which is run during the Sept.
11-21 Commonwealth Games.
	   ``Not at all, Neil Stephens is the greatest team person there
is, he is a great team leader,'' Godkin said.
	   ``It will be great to have him there. Neil is a fine person,
he's been working with us for years and years on the drugs
situation and there's no cleaner person going around. What's
happened to him is a tragedy.
	   ``He wouldn't have known what they were giving him. He trusted
the team and look what happens.''
	   Until Festina's scandal, Stephens had said he would not ride at
the Games, but he had a change of heart.
	   ``After what happened in the Tour, a lot of guys like (Richard)
Virenque and (Alex) Zulle decided they wanted to do the Tour of
Spain,'' he said from his home in Spain.
	   ``It turned out we had about 19 guys going for nine spots on the
Vuelta, so I talked to the team about it. It took a fair bit of
doing, but I managed to talk the team management into letting me go
for the Commonwealth Games.'' (djp)

<SLUG> Albanian reports 70 refugees crossing from Kosovo </SLUG>


<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ About 70 ethnic Albanians have crossed
the border from Yugoslavia's Kosovo province into northern Albania
in the past 24 hours, including two badly wounded fighters, the
Albanian Interior Ministry said Tuesday.
	   Ministry spokesman Artan Bizhga said the wounded Kosovo
Liberation Army fighters were taken to hospital in Tropoja.
	   The refugee flood occurred after a string of victories by Serb
forces against the secessionist Albanian rebels in Kosovo. Despite
the setbacks, the KLA declared the setbacks had ``only
strengthened'' their resolve ``to bravely continue on the road to
freedom.''
	   The Serb offensive has also forced tens of thousands of ethnic
Albanians from their homes in Kosovo, threatening what
international aid officials have called a ``humanitarian
catastrophe.''
	   In Geneva, the spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugee, Kris Janowski, said UNHCR was sending two convoys of nine
trucks each Tuesday to Klina, and to the Glogovac and Srbica
regions of Kosovo to care for the displaced civilians.
	   The agency now estimates there are 167,000 people displaced
within Kosovo itself, and a total of 231,000 displaced counting in
those who have fled to Montenegro and Albania.
	   ``We are now well over the 10 percent mark of the Kosovo
population,'' Janowski said.
	   On Monday, a team reached the village of Klavasarija, between
Malisevo and Suva Reka, where ``we found about 4,000 people crammed
into a village which normally has a population of 850.''
	   The village food reserves were running down and some children
becoming sick, according to Janowski.
	   ``Many people are now coming down from the forest and moving
towards towns like Mitrovica, but thousands more are still
remaining in the hills and forests,'' he said.
	   He added that ``it's virtually certain that the aid reaches the
people it's destined for because you've got all these thousands of
people sitting in the woods and the food is distributed almost
instantly to the people.''
	   Also, UNICEF reported coming across many displaced children
suffering from diarrhea and mild dysentery.
	   Spokesman Patrick McCormick said a UNICEF team found some 400
people camping out in the woods near Klavasarija, most of them
(accompanied) children and most having been there for 10 days..
	   ``We estimate that there are some 3,000 people still living in
the woods in the Drenica area,'' he said.

Japanese leader pledges to work with opposition to pass bank bills

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Promising quick action to rescue Japan's shaky
financial system, Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi signaled his
readiness Tuesday to compromise with opposition parties to pass key
banking reform bills.
	   The willingness to strike a deal comes after the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party suffered a humiliating setback in July elections
that strengthened the opposition's hand in the upper house of
Japan's Parliament.
	   The loss put Obuchi, who has staked his new administration on a
pledge to revive a stagnant economy, in the uncomfortable position
of having to court political enemies to win passage of legislation.
	   ``We will work toward getting the understanding of and
cooperation from opposition parties to ensure swift passage of this
legislation by listening to what they have to say about the
bills,'' Obuchi said in response to questions from opposition
lawmakers in Parliament.
	   Opposition parties have reserved some of their harshest
criticism for the government's so-called Total Plan to clean up the
estimated 80 trillion yen (dlrs 551 billion) in bad loans burdening
the financial sector.
	   ``The Total Plan is a policy for rescuing banks and big business
using taxpayer money,'' said Ichiro Ozawa, head of the Liberal
Party. ``We cannot support the government's proposed financial
stabilization bills.''
	   The opposition says the plan also would fail to punish inept
bank executives.
	   While Obuchi's party enjoys a majority in the lower house and
could override an upper house decision to reject the bills, this
would be a cumbersome and controversial tactic that many analysts
see as unlikely.
	   What's more, the proposal of the Democratic Party, the largest
opposition party, shares many elements with the government plan.
	   Both call for establishment of a ``bridge bank'' to fill the
breach left by troubled private lenders. They also promote reforms
making it easier to sell off real estate used as collateral for
non-performing loans.
	   Obuchi's comments appeared designed, at least in part, to calm
nervous investors who have been selling off Japanese stocks and the
yen amid uncertainty over the outlook for the financial reform
legislation.
	   In Tuesday's trading, however, the yen slipped to an eight-year
low against the dollar, sinking as low as 147.64 yen at one point.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index was down 1.4 percent.
	   Obuchi said Tuesday it would be difficult to estimate how much
public money will be needed to nurse the financial system back to
health.
	   The 61-year-old prime minister, who has held the job just two
weeks, has repeatedly rejected calls for the resignation of his
Cabinet and snap elections for Parliament's lower house.
	   On Tuesday, he reiterated a promise to put Japan's economy back
on track for recovery within two years through tax cuts and other
stimulus measures.
	   Separately, Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told Parliament he
regretted his failure to prevent the speculative land and stock
price bubble of the late 1980s.
	   Miyazawa served a previous term as finance minister in 1986-1988
before becoming prime minister in 1991-1993.

Doctors in Vladivostok may join ambulance strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VLADIVOSTOK, Russia (AP) _ Hospital workers in Russia's Far East
threatened Tuesday to join local ambulance staff in a strike that
has already drastically cut emergency medical services in the port
city of Vladivostok.
	   More than 300 doctors and other employees from the city's
Infectious Disease and Psychiatric Hospitals said they would walk
out by the end of the week if they don't get months of back wages.
	   They would join protesting ambulance workers, who stopped work
Aug. 4 and reduced emergency help in Vladivostok, a city with
800,000 people, to four ambulance crews. The city normally has 30
working ambulances.
	   ``We don't want to terrorize the city,'' said Dr. Lyudmila
Lebedeva, chairwoman of the Infectious Disease Hospital. ``However,
the damage to the morale of our staff is too much. They expect us
to heal our patients only with kind words and no medications.''
	   She said funding for basic medical equipment and supplies at the
hospital was non-existent, and staffing has been cut by more than
one-third over the past year.
	   Regional Gov. Yevgeny Nazdratenko and Mayor Victor Cherepkov,
who have been locked in a long-standing political feud for years,
both say the other should pay for emergency medical services.
	   Millions of workers receive their salaries months late in
Russia, part of a cycle of non-payments that plagues the Russian
economy.
	   Meanwhile, striking workers at a motor works in the central city
of Yaroslavl have forced the plant's main assembly line to shut
down. Three plants in the city and four in Belarus may have to halt
work because of the stoppage, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   And leaders at a major strip mine in the Far Eastern Chita
region threatened Tuesday to stop shipping coal to a number of
power plants power plants that have not paid debts now totaling
over 500 million rubles (dlrs 80 million), ITAR-Tass said.

Flood crest sweeps through ravaged city, dikes threatened

	   JIUJIANG, China (AP) _ A flood crest surged through this port
city along the swollen Yangtze River early Tuesday, threatening to
burst dikes sodden by more than a month of flooding.
	   ``The situation here is serious,'' said a local official who
gave only his surname, Huang. ``Today is clear and hot, but that
doesn't mean we can relax.''
	   In Jiujiang and elsewhere along the turbulent Yangtze, soldiers
and local residents worked desperately to repair leaking levees and
fortify those likely to collapse as floodwaters swelled yet again.
	   More than 100 trucks loaded with stones were pushed into a major
Yangtze tributary, the Hanbei River, on Monday to block a 25-meter
(82.5-foot) gap that could have caused dangerous flooding in
adjacent Hanchuan County, the newspaper China Daily reported.
	   Factories and homes were flooded to first-floor ceilings in
low-lying parts of Jiujiang, a city of 500,000 in eastern Jiangxi
province. Scores of military police patrolled flooded city streets
in boats.
	   Two dikes about 10 kilometers (six miles) from the city were
most at risk, Huang said. He said the water level near the city, in
eastern Jiangxi province, had risen slightly Tuesday, although it
was below the peak recorded on July 31.
	   The area was festooned with red flags _ part of the government's
effort to bolster morale and trumpet its efforts to rescue flood
victims and control damage.
	   In southwestern Guizhou province, 25 people were confirmed dead
and three were missing after the bus they were riding became stuck
and then was swept away by a flooding river, the official newspaper
Beijing Evening News reported Tuesday.
	   It said 15 people escaped safely after heeding the bus driver's
instructions to flee to higher ground before the river rose and
swept the bus and remaining passengers away.
	   Flooding nationwide has killed more than 2,000 people and
destroyed more than 17 million houses this summer, leaving millions
homeless and often bereft of clean drinking water, food, medicine
and other necessities in brutally hot and humid weather.
	   Medical teams were rushing to the area to try to prevent the
spread of contagious diseases, dysentery and infections.
	   Upriver, the situation in the industrial city of Wuhan was calm
after the flood crest passed Monday, but the miseries of more than
a month of flooding continued in many other areas along the
Yangtze.
	   With some 240 million people _ about one-fifth of China's
population _ affected by the floods, provinces less severely hit
were shipping in relief supplies.
	   The government also has stepped up efforts to raise donations
for the flood victims, opening a hot line for phone pledges and
encouraging local efforts to raise money.
	   On Tuesday, a U.S. Air Force cargo plane delivered a shipment of
relief supplies, such as tents, plastic sheeting, blankets and
drinking water containers, to southern Hunan province, one of the
areas worst affected by the floods.
	   A second shipment was scheduled Wednesday.
	   The flood crest that passed through the middle stretches of the
Yangtze on Monday and early Tuesday came within centimeters
(inches) of previous record highs, with water lapping the tops of
sandbagged dikes.
	   Floods from summer rains that fell heavier and earlier than
usual have raised the river to levels not seen since 1954, when
floods killed some 30,000 people.
	   The Yangtze is expected to remain at dangerously high levels for
weeks to come, with more rain falling along the river's upper
reaches in southwest Sichuan province.
	   Torrential rains have also fallen in northeastern Heilongjiang
and Jilin provinces, raising the Nenjiang river to dangerous
levels.
	   Southern Guangdong province, meanwhile, was bracing for the
onslaught of Tropical Storm Penny, which was expected to batter the
area Tuesday with violent winds and torrential rains.
	   Residents in areas likely to be flooded were to be evacuated and
fishing boats were ordered back to port, the China Daily reported.
	   Unlike other areas, much of Guangdong has been stricken by
drought this summer, making the storm not entirely unwelcome.
	   Preparations to deliberately breach dikes and flood more
farmland along the Yangtze to protect cities downstream were put on
hold after the latest flood crest passed. Floodwaters would not be
diverted unless the situation became ``really out of control,'' the
newspaper reported.

Taliban captures another key town in northern Afghanistan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in first 4 grafs with opposition confirming fall of
Taloqan, reports on situation in Mazar-e-Sharif in new grafs 13-16.
No pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By ZAHEERUDDIN ABDULLAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ The Taliban militia captured another
strategic town in northern Afghanistan Tuesday, continuing advances
following the capture of the biggest city in the north.
	   The Taliban captured Taloqan, located some 250 kilometers (about
150 miles) north of Kabul, after a brief battle, said Taliban
spokesman Abdul Hay Muttayn. Opposition spokesman Zahbet Saly
confirmed the city had fallen, saying his forces retreated about 20
kilometers (about 10 miles) east.
	   ``The fighting is over now and Taliban fully controls the
city,'' he said. Taloqan is the capital of Takhar province, a
stronghold of powerful anti-Taliban commander Ahmed Shah Masood.
	   The Taliban said their early morning assault on Taloqan easily
smashed the opposition's front line. But opposition spokesman Saly
said the fighting raged all night and casualties were high on both
sides.
	   The Taliban, whose name means ``students of Islam,'' control
most of Afghanistan, including the capital Kabul. They have imposed
a strict version of Islam, barring most women from work, girls from
school, music and directing men to wear beards.
	   Earlier Tuesday, Taliban sources said an ally of Masood's,
former prime minister Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, had been shot and killed
in Takhar province, but had no details.
	   But Hekmatyar's son-in-law Ghairad Baheer said the report was
``baseless.''
	   ``I just spoke to him about five minutes ago. He's fine, he's
energetic as always,'' Baheer said in Islamabad, capital of
neighboring Pakistan. Baheer, who represents his father-in-law's
Hezb-e-Islami party in Pakistan, said he spoke by telephone to
Hekmatyar, a key anti-Taliban leader, at an undisclosed location in
northern Afghanistan.
	   The coalition has absorbed a series of setbacks in recent weeks,
starting with the fall of warlord Rashid Dostum's stronghold of
Shebergan. The Taliban advanced from Shebergan to take the biggest
northern city, Mazar-e-Sharif, on Saturday. Taliban sources said
Mazar-e-Sharif was calm Tuesday, with the Taliban in control and
confiscating weapons from residents.
	   Iranian radio reported Tuesday the Taliban attacked the
consulate of Turkmenistan, a former Soviet republic, in
Mazar-e-Sharif and expelled its diplomats. The whereabouts of the
diplomats were not immediately clear.
	   Neighboring Iran, meanwhile, awaited news about 11 diplomats it
said were seized by the Taliban Saturday in Mazar-e-Sharif. The
Taliban deny holding the diplomats, saying their whereabouts are
unknown.
	   Both Iran and the former Soviet Republics bordering Afghanistan
have been accused of supporting the anti-Taliban alliance, in part
to contain the Taliban's form of Islam.
	   Iranian radio on Tuesday accused the Taliban of a ``large-scale
massacre of civilians.'' Opposition sources have also accused the
Taliban of killing civilians, particularly Shiite Muslims, in its
attack on Mazar-e-Sharif. The Taliban adhere to the Sunni sect of
Islam.

Man arrested in Malaysian riot rumor case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian authorities on Tuesday
arrested a man suspected of using the Internet to spark rumors of
violence that frightened people throughout the Southeast Asian
nation last week.
	   Several more arrests were imminent, police spokesman Ghazali
Amin was reported as saying by the national news agency, Bernama.
Police did not disclose the identity of the man arrested Tuesday
morning.
	   The Malaysian capital has been rife with rumors, spread via the
Internet and then by word of mouth, that Indonesians have been
amassing knives and machetes.
	   On Friday evening, word spread through the capital that
Indonesian illegal immigrants in a downtown neighborhood had begun
to riot in protest against an Aug. 15 deadline to deport foreigners
who had not applied to renew their work permits.
	   Panicked workers left their downtown offices early, stocking up
on staples before securing themselves in their homes. Police were
forced to open a hot line.
	   The rumors have infuriated the Malaysian government. Officials
said instigators would be punished under the harsh Internal
Securities Act, which allows for detention without trial for up to
two years.
	   Indonesia's embassy implored its citizens Tuesday to ignore the
rumors that their compatriots were scheming to lead riots in
Malaysia.
	   ``Indonesians come to Malaysia only to work and not to create
trouble for Malaysians,'' said Indonesian Ambassador Muhammad Yacob
Dasto. ``Rumors on the Internet about Indonesians rioting in Kuala
Lumpur were just rumors.''
	   Malaysia has deported more than 30,000 Indonesians since the
Asian economic crisis worsened this year. Authorities said they
intended to deport 200,000 Indonesians by Aug. 15.
	   Aseh Che Mat, director-general of the Immigration Department,
said some 100,000 foreign workers had yet to apply for renewal of
their work permits.
	   Aseh told a news conference Monday that some 2,000 Indonesians
were leaving voluntarily each day because they refused to work on
plantations or in manufacturing, as the government has encouraged
them to do.
	   He said the immigration department had received numerous
``negative calls'' warning authorities there would be riots Friday
staged by Indonesian workers who want to stay.
	   ``All these rumors are not true,'' he said, but added, ``We will
try our best to contain any problems.''
	   Still, thousands of Indonesians don't want to go home, where
authorities expect half of the 202 million population to fall below
the poverty line by the end of the year.
	   A predawn roundup of illegal Indonesians at a detention camp
outside of Kuala Lumpur in March led to rioting and at least eight
deaths.

Monaco president rules out Henry transfer to Arsenal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Striker Thierry Henry, a member of France's World
Cup winning squad, will not be granted his wish to move to English
champion Arsenal, the president of French club Monaco said.
	   Henry, who has four years left on his contract with Monaco, said
over the weekend that he had left several messages on the Monaco
president's answering machine, pleading for talks.
	   But the club president, Jean-Louis Campora, said in an interview
published Tuesday by the magazine France Football that he recently
met with Arsenal vice-president David Dein in London and told him
Henry's transfer was out of the question.
	   ``Arsenal is and always has been interested (in Henry),''
Campora was quoted as saying. ``I met Dein in London and he asked
me if Henry was free and I said no. That's that.''
	   Campora pointed the finger at Henry's two agents, saying they
were purposely trying to unsettle the player, and that they had
been talking to Arsenal without Monaco's consent.
	   ``I'm convinced that this umpteenth attempt at intimidation is
the work of the agents,'' Campora said.
	   He added that he planned to file an official complaint about the
agents' behavior with FIFA, soccer's world governing body.
	   Campora said he would meet with Henry in the next two weeks and
offer him an extended contract, with a higher salary.
	   Henry, a close friend of Arsenal's French striker Nicolas
Anelka, says he wants to move to England for professional reasons,
not financial ones. He is also being targeted by top Spanish clubs.
	   Henry, 21, said his agents had done nothing wrong.
	   ``I'm being depicted as a baby, as if I can't make a decision on
my own at my age,'' he told France Football. ``I just want to
leave, that's all.''
	   Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger has said he wants to sign a striker
to boost his squad for the coming season, after failing to agree
terms with Dutch international Patrick Kluivert.

India takes Europeans to WTO over dumping duties on cotton imports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ India has filed complaints with the World Trade
Organization over anti-dumping duties imposed by the European Union
on imports of unbleached cotton fabrics and cotton bed linen.
	   India is claiming the EU's decisions violate WTO rules and have
caused its exports of unbleached cloth to decline.
	   It has asked for formal consultations with the EU through the
WTO. If officials from the countries fail to reach agreement within
60 days, the issue will be taken up by the WTO's dispute settlement
body.
	   Dumping involves selling a product abroad at a price lower than
in the producer's home market.
	   The EU imposed anti-dumping duties on imports of cotton bed
linen from India last year.
	   In April this year, the European executive commission imposed
duties for a six-month period on imports of unbleached cotton
fabrics from India and five other countries, China, Egypt,
Indonesia, Pakistan and Turkey.
	   In July, the commission proposed a five-year extension of these
duties on India, China, Egypt, Indonesia and Pakistan. It said the
duties on Turkish imports should be ended because they were not
causing problems.
	   July's proposal must be approved by EU ministers by October 9.
Once approved, it would go into effect immediately.
	   The Commission said it will urge unbleached cotton fabric
producers in India, China, Egypt, Indonesia and Pakistan to respect
minimum EU prices in return for exemptions from the planned
five-year duties.
	   In addition, it proposed that five-year duties on products not
covered by any minimum price commitments be lower than those
imposed in April.

Foreign activists still detained, no decision on trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with U.S., Thai detainees to receive visit, ADDS
government calling detainees saboteurs. Trims &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ The 18 foreign democracy activists
detained for handing out anti-government leaflets remained in the
custody of Myanmar's military regime Tuesday, their fate undecided.
	   U.S. and Thai diplomats reported that the government was
allowing visits Tuesday to their citizens in custody, the first
since they were arrested Sunday.
	   Government officials denied reports that the ruling State Peace
and Development Council had already decided to charge the activists
and put them on trial, saying no ruling had been made.
	   ``The legal process is under way and it will be premature to
give comment on the outcome at this moment,'' a spokesman said in a
statement faxed to The Associated Press in Bangkok, Thailand.
	   The Home Affairs Ministry and legal departments were working
``to come up with a legal point of view'' that would be presented
to ``relevant officials'' for a decision.
	   Earlier reports of a criminal trial panicked supporters and
family members of the activists meeting in Bangkok, Thailand.
	   The detainees include six Americans, three Thais, three
Malaysians, three Indonesians, two Philippine citizens and an
Australian.
	   Diplomats in Myanmar, also known as Burma, have been seeking to
visit their detained citizens since they were picked up in downtown
Yangon and at the airport Sunday. The activists were urging people
to remember a 1988 uprising against military rule and not give up.
	   In Bangkok, Thai Foreign Ministry spokesman Kobsak Chutikul said
Myanmar officials had agreed to allow the first known visit, to the
detained Thais at Yangon police headquarters, later Tuesday.
	   Myanmar officials insisted they were in good health, Kobsak
said. He was unaware whether other detainees were being visited.
	   In Manila, 30 human rights activists, some holding placards
reading ``Democracy for Burma,'' picketed the Myanmar Embassy. They
attempted to deliver a letter but were stopped by guards.
	   ``I'm afraid. I don't know what happened to my son,'' said
Leticia Resuena, mother of detained activist Ponciano Resuena.
	   A Myanmar official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told The
Associated Press that there had been a misinterpretation of a
government statement Monday saying the detainees faced legal
action.
	   Action included detention and interrogation, the official said,
but did not necessarily mean trial. Deportation remained an option.
	   Officials said they want to discourage leafleting and that the
activists broke two laws, including a printing act and an emergency
law. The catchall emergency law can carry a 10-year sentence and is
frequently used against political opponents.
	   Official newspapers described the detainees Tuesday as ``agents
saboteurs.''
	   A statement from the Myanmar Embassy in London accused them of
``beating war drums'' and acting at the behest of people ``pushing
the country down into hellish pits.''
	   The reference was to opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, winner
of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, and her National League for
Democracy. They have set an Aug. 21 deadline for the government to
finally convene a parliament elected in 1990.
	   The opposition overwhelmingly won the election, but the
military, which has ruled Myanmar since 1962 and tolerates almost
no dissent, refused to relinquish power.
	   The 18 activists, who belong to overseas pro-democracy groups,
entered Myanmar as tourists on the eve of the 10th anniversary of
the Aug. 8, 1988, uprising, which resulted in a change of leaders
but was eventually crushed. An estimated 3,000 people died.
	   No unrest by Myanmar's own people was reported on the
anniversary. Both the government and exiled opposition leaders have
said Myanmar people fear a repeat of the 1988 bloodshed.

Dissident's wife roughed up during detention: report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Plainclothes police forcibly detained the elderly
mother and the wife of a prominent Chinese dissident, but later
released them, a human rights group said Tuesday.
	   Chu Hailan, wife of veteran labor activist Liu Nianchun, and his
mother were walking to a Beijing government office Monday to press
demands that Liu be given better medical treatment when they were
forced into a car by plainclothes agents of the State Security
Bureau, the New York-based Human Rights in China said.
	   During the detention, which lasted just over 12 hours, Chu
suffered a sprained ankle and bruises, the group said.
	   Liu, China's most prominent jailed dissident, suffers stomach
problems, high blood pressure and other ailments, according to Chu.
	   Liu was taken away by police three years ago and has been held
ever since in labor camps and prisons without charge or trial. He
is now held in the Tuanhe labor camp in Beijing's suburbs and is
due for release in about a year.
	   Police in China can send detainees directly to labor camps
without trial.

Heat wave abates after killing 52 people in Cyprus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ A heat wave that has killed 52 people in
Cyprus in the past five days abated Tuesday, with temperatures
falling to a little above the norm.
	   The Health Ministry said four more people had died overnight
Monday, raising the death toll to 52 since Friday.
	   Temperatures had reached 43 degrees Celsius (110 Fahrenheit),
the highest recorded in 40 years.
	   The director of the Weather Bureau, Andreas Philaniotis, said
Tuesday's reading was 39 C (102 F) and the temperature was expected
to fall closer to the monthly average of 37 C (99 F) in the next
two days.
	   Most of the dead were elderly people who suffered from
respiratory and other ailments, said a Health Ministry statement.
	   Hospitals have been stretched to the limit with hundreds of
elderly patients suffering from heat-related illnesses, the
statement added.

Blazevic Croatian coach another 4 years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Miroslav Blazevic, who guided Croatia to
a bronze medal in its maiden World Cup last month, will remain the
national team coach for another four years.
	   ``Everything is settled, we're entering into a new cycle,''
Blazevic told the daily Sportske Novosti on Tuesday.
	   Blazevic, 63, took to the helm of the national squad in 1993,
leading the fledgling nation to the quarterfinals of the European
Championships in 1996.
	   A keen tactician and master motivator, Blazevic has registered
memorable victories over soccer giants like Germany, Italy, Holland
and Spain during his tenure.
	   Nonetheless, he was almost dumped as coach in the lead-up to the
World Cup in France as the Croats squeezed into the finals through
a backdoor playoff series following a lacklustre performance in its
qualification group with Slovenia, Bosnia and Greece.
	   ``I've achieved a lot, but I know that if we lose against
Yugoslavia that our bronze will be dragged through mud,'' Blazevic
said, aware of the pressure on the Croatian bench inspite of the
World Cup bronze.
	   Croatia starts its chase for a place in the European
Championships to be held in Belgium and Holland in 2000 against
Ireland on September 4th. Also in Group 8, are Yugoslavia,
Macedonia and Malta.

Suu Kyi leaves home to visit party offices
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi left
her home Tuesday to visit her party offices, a day after saying
that new government roadblocks around her home amounted to house
arrest.
	   Suu Kyi, winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, has been
intensifying her challenge to Myanmar's military regime, and
demanded last week that security personnel be withdrawn from her
property.
	   The detail was pulled out, but bamboo traffic barriers were
installed on University Avenue where she lives and cars have been
positioned to follow her if she leaves.
	   Suu Kyi's party, the National League for Democracy, issued a
statement Monday saying that cars leaving her compound have been
searched and the restrictions were a new form of house arrest.
	   Suu Kyi, 53, left her home Tuesday and drove to NLD
headquarters, followed by a government security detail. It was not
known whether her car was searched on the way out.
	   The government freed Suu Kyi from six years of house arrest in
1995, but later curtailed the limited freedom she had been given.
	   Two weeks ago, she left her compound and drove outside the
capital to meet provincial supporters. She was stopped and a
six-day standoff with authorities ensued.
	   The confrontation raised the profile of her struggle against the
government ahead of an Aug. 21 deadline she has set for a the
government to finally convene a pro-democracy parliament elected in
1990 but never allowed to convene.

Residents end protest in southern Italian town hit by mudslides
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EPISCOPIO, Italy (AP) _ Some 150 residents of this tiny town
ravaged by mudslides in May ended a protest early Tuesday after
officials promised to speed up work to reconstruct the area.
	   The protesters, occupying the site of the local aqueduct on
Monday evening, stopped the water supply to 60 towns in the area
south of Naples. They gave up their protest just before the towns,
which included tourist attractions such as Pompeii, suffered any
harm.
	   The May 5 mudslides, following two days of torrential rain,
killed a total of 152 people in Sarno, Episcopio and other nearby
towns, and destroyed entire neighborhoods of homes and businesses.
	   ``There have been delays in assigning public contracts which
have exasperated people here,'' Sarno Mayor Gerardo Basile said.
	   Officials from Salerno province, which includes the towns,
promised to hurry up the aid process.

U.K. trade minister seeks speedier project approval
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam needs to slash the red tape that
is bogging down foreign investment projects, including nearly dlrs
2 billion from U.K. companies, British Trade Minister Brian Wilson
said Tuesday.
	   ``In order to send a signal to other foreign investors ... it is
essential that we see results in a positive time frame,'' Wilson
told a news conference attended by representatives from a number of
British companies who are accompanying him
	   After four years of waiting, Cable and Wireless said Monday that
it had received a license for a dlrs 207 million phone project for
Hanoi.
	   But British Petroleum has been in talks for two years about a
proposed gas pipeline-power plant project. Life insurance firm
Prudential Corp. has applied for a license for a venture. Foster
Wheeler is seeking a possible dlrs 30 million project management
and consultancy contract for construction of Vietnam's first oil
refinery.
	   Visits by high-ranking foreign officials sometimes spur Hanoi to
clear deals that had been stalled, and Wilson said he hoped to
``see the beginning of a more dynamic period of relations between
the United Kingdom and Vietnam.''
	   Hanoi has said it would like to see more investment from Europe
and the United States to offset a fall-off from Asia because of the
region's economic crisis. But many Western investors are tired of
the bureaucracy and other difficulties.

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's stock market tumbled Tuesday below
a key support level untested in nearly a decade, while its currency
also weakened as regional woes continued to rattle local markets.
	   In afternoon trading, the benchmark Straits Times Industrials
Index plunged 3.9 percent, or 40.33 points, through the
psychologically important 1,000-point level to 998.94, its lowest
intra-day level since 1988.
	   It recovered slightly to 1,007.93 at the close. Last Friday, the
index finished at 1,039.27, and the stock exchange was closed
Monday for a national holiday.
	   The Singapore dollar was also significantly weaker Tuesday,
dropping to about 1.76 against the U.S. dollar in response to the
Japanese yen's fall to an eight-year low against the American
currency. In late Asian trading Monday, the U.S. dollar bought
1.752 Singapore dollars.
	   Although it is already at levels not seen in years, the stock
index may eventually drop much further, analysts said.
	   ``It's heading to 800, without much respite, by the end of this
year,'' Edwin Tay, research manager at BT Brokerage and Associates,
told Dow Jones Newswires.
	   On its way down, the index easily breached this year's intra-day
low of 1,031.30, set Jan. 12. Analysts said the worsening regional
currency situation and softening Asian equity markets were to
blame.
	   The yen's plunge and persistent fears that China might devalue
its currency, the yuan, were discouraging investors, dealers said.
Similar drops in other Asian stock markets were further dampening
the Singapore bourse, they added.

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets slumped Tuesday in a
vicious circle of pessimism about the region's economy, and
especially about Japan.
	   Investors also were dogged by another sharp fall in Hong Kong,
where the Hang Seng index reached a five-year low and put more
strain on the territory's currency link with the U.S. dollar. The
Hong Kong dollar has been under strong speculative attacks.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index plunged 3.6 percent, closing at
6,779.95, the lowest since July 29, 1993.
	   Malaysian shares also fell sharply. The Composite Index dropped
5.3 percent, or 18.58 points, closing at 334.70.
	   ``A stronger dose of Japan jitters and (worries over a)
potential devaluation of the Hong Kong dollar and the yuan set off
another round of negativity,'' said James Bryson, a trader at
ANZ-Panin Securities in Jakarta.
	   During the day, the dollar broke through 147 yen, its highest
level since August 1990. Traders said it could reach 150 by the end
of the week.
	   The factors undermining the yen Tuesday included another drop in
Japanese stock prices. The benchmark Nikkei Stock Average slid
219.43 points, or 1.4 percent, to 15,406.99, its lowest close since
June 29. It was the first time since February 1996 that the Nikkei
had dropped for seven straight sessions.
	   More than a year after Asia's economy crisis began, there still
was no good news to be found anywhere. Fears about stock prices and
currencies were reinforcing each other, driving both down.
	   Besides Asia's own troubles, there now are worries about whether
the U.S. economic boom is running out of steam.
	   A weaker U.S. economy likely would lessen demand for Asian
goods. That would hurt countries that have been hoping to export
their way out of their troubles.
	   A trader with a U.S. investment house said speculators who moved
into the Hong Kong market last week appeared to be ``quality''
companies that are more powerful than those involved in previous
attacks on the Hong Kong dollar.
	   Traders also said investors are spooked by worries over a
devaluation of the Chinese yuan, which would likely lead to another
round of devaluations in the region. At a news conference Tuesday,
the deputy governor of China's central bank, Liu Mingkang,
reiterated that China would not devalue.
	   The news was bad elsewhere in Asia, as well.
	   Philippine shares dropped for the fourth session, with the key
Philippine Stock Exchange Index closing 3.8 percent lower at
1,373.19. It had lost 10 percent in the past four days.
	   Singapore's Straits Times Industrial Index slumped 3 percent, or
31.34 points, closing at 1,007.93.
	   In Jakarta, foreign economic woes and domestic political unrest
dragged the Composite Index down 3.3 percent, or 14.103 points, to
407.064.
	   Australia's key stock index closed 35.3 points lower at 2,561.1,
and the index in New Zealand lost 7.71 points, closing at 1,993.27.
	   The Stock Exchange of Thailand index fell 4.16 points, or 1.7
percent, closing at 234.14.
	   Shares in South Korea closed slightly lower. The Korea Composite
Stock Price Index slipped 0.70 point to 311.25.
	   But on the Taiwan Stock Exchange, bargain hunting in rubber
stocks led shares slightly higher, with the benchmark Weighted
Stock Price Index closing up 11.86 points at 7,383.98.

Blazevic to remain Croatian coach for another 4 years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Miroslav Blazevic, who guided Croatia to
a bronze medal in its maiden World Cup last month, will remain the
national team coach for another four years.
	   ``Everything is settled, we're entering into a new cycle,''
Blazevic told the daily Sportske Novosti on Tuesday.
	   Blazevic, 63, took the helm of the national squad in 1993,
leading the fledgling nation to the quarterfinals of the European
Championships in 1996.
	   A keen tactician and master motivator, Blazevic has registered
memorable victories over soccer giants like Germany, Italy, Holland
and Spain during his tenure.
	   Nonetheless, he was almost dumped as coach in the lead-up to the
World Cup in France as the Croats squeezed into the finals through
a backdoor playoff series following a lackluster performance in its
qualification group with Slovenia, Bosnia and Greece.
	   ``I've achieved a lot, but I know that if we lose against
Yugoslavia that our bronze will be dragged through mud,'' Blazevic
said, aware of the pressure on the Croatian bench inspite of the
World Cup bronze.
	   Croatia starts its chase for a place in the European
Championships to be held in Belgium and Holland in 2000 against
Ireland on September 4th. Also in Group 8, are Yugoslavia,
Macedonia and Malta.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Investigators began to piece together
evidence from last week's embassy bombings Tuesday, with a heroic
Kenyan guard's eyewitness account providing possibly important
information.
	   In all, twin bombings in Kenya and Tanzania claimed at least 217
lives and injured nearly 5,000. Another 15 bodies were pulled from
the rubble in Nairobi in the past 12 hours, Red Cross spokeswoman
Nina Galbe said Tuesday.
	   Six more bodies were spotted trapped in the rubble of the
Nairobi bombing, said Kenyan Maj. Gen. George Agoi. The stench of
rotting flesh seeped from the heaped concrete and steel.
	   The East African Standard said guard Joash Okindo and his
colleagues, armed only with short wooden clubs, confronted five
men, barring them from the main entrance to the embassy and forcing
them to drive to the rear parking lot.
	   The attackers then jumped from the truck and opened fire with
automatic rifles. At least one Marine returned fire and one of the
attackers threw a hand grenade. Moments later, the truck exploded,
Okindo told the Kenya Television Network Monday.
	   ``We saved people's lives by sending it to the rear entrance,''
Okindo told the Standard. ``If we hadn't done that, I don't think I
would be alive and talking to you now.''
	   The Standard said it talked to Okindo before he was taken out of
the country on a U.S. medical evacuation flight to Germany for
treatment of serious wounds.
	   ``He resisted heroically,'' U.S. State Department spokesman
James Foley said in Washington.
	   In Tanzania, a dozen people, including Sudanese and Iraqis, were
detained. But U.S. officials played down the importance of the
roundup.
	   Tanzanian police, who announced the arrests Monday, said they
could no longer speak to the press.
	   At the wreckage of the Dar es Salaam embassy, a dozen FBI
agents, some wearing blue caps with FBI on the visors, swept and
raked Laibon Road in front of the embassy building, collecting and
sifting through debris in their search for evidence.
	   Israel army radio also signaled a possible break in the case. In
a report from Nairobi, it said investigators suspect the bombers
used the sophisticated plastic explosive Semtex.
	   The FBI says finding out what kind of explosives were used and
how would be critical to the investigation.
	   So would an informant, and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
on Monday offered a dlrs 2 million reward for information leading
to the capture of the ``cowards that committed this act.''
	   Meanwhile, Israeli soldiers, the first professional
search-and-rescue team to reach Nairobi after the bombing,
continued to dig for a woman named Rose.
	   Her voice fell silent Sunday, but they heard a tapping noise
Monday morning that spurred them on. At nightfall, however, there'd
been nothing but silence for hours.
	   Brig. Gen. Ilan Harari, chief of the Israeli rescue team, told
Israel radio chances were slim that there are other survivors,
``but we are acting on the premise that there might be someone
alive, otherwise we would just bring in bulldozers and simply
remove that building.''

Swiss Holocaust fund makes payments to 2,000 German Gypsies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ A Swiss fund to help needy Holocaust
survivors has started payments to some 2,000 Gypsies in Germany, a
fund spokesman said Tuesday.
	   Each will receive 2,000 Swiss francs (dlrs 1,350) in its biggest
operation yet involving non-Jewish victims of the Nazis, spokesman
Lorenz Wolffers said.
	   The 4 million franc (dlrs 2.7 million) payout follows an
application by the Central Council of German Sinti and Roma.
	   Some of the recipients were deported to Nazi concentration camps
because of their ethnic background and others were victims of
forced sterilization or other persecution, Wolffers said. The
oldest are aged over 90.
	   Some 88 percent of the fund, created last year, is intended to
aid destitute Jewish survivors of the Nazis, especially those in
east Europe who were denied Western assistance during decades of
communist rule.
	   The remainder is to help non-Jewish survivors, including
Gypsies, homosexuals and political opponents of the Nazis.
	   Swiss banks and industry have given 275 million francs (dlrs 190
million) to the fund, which is in addition to other efforts to aid
victims or return unclaimed bank assets.
	   The fund, chaired by Swiss Jewish leader Rolf Bloch, began
distributions in November in Riga, Latvia, and has so far paid out
36.3 million francs (dlrs 24.4 million).
	   In March, it made its first payments to Gypsies in Germany.
	   The fund has allocated 47 million francs (dlrs 31.5 million) for
Jewish Holocaust victims in the United States.
	   The U.S. application process for payments is due to start next
Monday, under the coordination of the World Jewish Restitution
Organization.

	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Dresdner Bank, Germany's second
largest, has been in intensive talks with the U.S. brokerage firm
Paine Webber Group over a possible takeover, the national business
daily Handelsblatt reported Tuesday.
	   A Dresdner Bank spokesman declined comment on the report.
	   Handelsblatt estimated the deal would cost Dresdner dlrs 9
billion to dlrs 10 billion.
	   Dresdner chairman Bernhard Walter and board member Gerhard
Eberstadt met with Paine Webber chief Donald Marron several weeks
ago, setting off a serious round of talks, Handelsblatt reported.
	   A Dresdner spokesman quoted by Handelsblatt would not confirm
rumors of a takeover, but said that they were not surprising within
the context of the globalization of the entire industry.
	   Paine Webber is one of the largest brokerage firms in the United
States, with 2.5 million customers.

Mandela awards Arafat South Africa's highest honor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Handing over a green and gold
shoulder sash, President Nelson Mandela on Tuesday awarded
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat South Africa's highest honor for
foreigners.
	   Arafat is on a three-day visit to South Africa, aimed at
cementing ties that go back to when the African National Congress
was fighting white rule and Arafat headed the Palestinian
Liberation Organization as an exile.
	   ``Congratulations, Yasser,'' Mandela said as he draped the sash
over Arafat's green army shirt and black and white head scarf.
	   Previous recipients of the Order of Good Hope include other
stalwart allies from the days of the anti-apartheid struggle such
as Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi and former Indonesia President
Suharto.
	   In return Arafat presented Mandela with the Star of Holy
Jerusalem medal while an official read out a statement praising
Mandela's role in bringing democracy to South Africa and support
for creating a Palestinian state.
	   Officials also signed two declarations of intent for closer
links in health and education.
	   It was Arafat's first visit since South Africa and the
Palestinian autonomous government established diplomatic ties in
1995.
	   Aside from meeting Mandela, Arafat will also hold talks with
Deputy President Thabo Mbeki and the leaders of all South Africa's
largest opposition parties.
	   Accorded the formal welcome of a full head of state, Arafat
inspected a military parade at the President's official Tuynhuys
offices in parliament and stood to attention as a band struck up
the Palestinian national anthem.
	   After a 21-gun salute boomed out over Cape Town, Mandela _ in a
characteristically jovial mood _ led Arafat to a gate in Tuynhuys'
gardens where a small group of onlookers had gathered and chatted.

Floods in Chita region leave 6,500 stranded
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Floods in the eastern Russian region of Chita,
near the border with China, have stranded more than 6,500 people, a
news agency reported Tuesday.
	   A state of emergency was declared Monday night in three of the
region's districts when the water level in rivers rose by 20
centimeters (eight inches), the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Regional emergency officials estimate that 2,000 houses in 45
settlements have been damaged by the floods.
	   Rising waters have also washed out a number of bridges and
ruined most potato and grain crops for this year in the region,
about 4700 kilometers (3,000 miles) east of Moscow, ITAR-Tass
reported.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The yen tumbled to an eight-year low against the
U.S. dollar Tuesday on further evidence of Japan's worsening
economy. Tokyo stock prices tumbled for the seventh consecutive
trading day.
	   In late afternoon, the dollar bought 147.41 yen, up 0.76 yen
from late Monday and also above its New York rate of 146.15 yen
overnight.
	   It ranged between 146.00 yen and 147.64 yen, the dollar's
highest intraday level since 147.81 yen on Aug. 20, 1990.
	   The weaker yen also undermined Japanese stocks. The benchmark
225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 219.43 points, or 1.40 percent,
closing at 15,406.99.
	   Including Monday's 202.75-point fall, or 1.28 percent, the
Nikkei index now has dropped a total of 971.98 points in seven
sessions.
	   Investors worry that measures intended to revive the economy may
be delayed because Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi could face trouble
having key financial reform bills approved in Parliament, traders
said.
	   Japan's Parliament is now in session to debate
government-proposed bills to clean up an estimated 80 trillion yen
(dlrs 548 billion) in bad debts held by Japanese banks. But
opposition parties are trying to force Obuchi to dissolve
Parliament and call early elections instead.
	   The yen also was hurt by the latest monthly report by Japan's
Economic Planning Agency, which called the economy ``sluggish.''
	   Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka said the weaker yen is
undesirable for both the Japanese and global economies, and that
``appropriate action'' is needed to counter excessive exchange rate
movements.
	   Some traders also say lingering speculation over China's
possible devaluation of the yuan to boost its exports was
supporting the dollar.
	   Meanwhile, Tokyo stocks fell sharply on a continued plunge in
banking shares and woes in other regional markets.
	   Investors were concerned that the weaker banks may be forced to
shut down. The banking sector was among the market's top decliners
Tuesday for a second straight day, falling 2.7 percent.
	   Shares of troubled Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. closed at
38 yen, down 5 yen from Monday. Share prices below 100 yen are
ordinarily seen as a warning sign of a company's imminent demise.
Sumitomo Trust and Banking Corp. announced in June that it was
considering a merger with the debt-plagued bank.
	   Also affecting the Tokyo market was a continued fall in Hong
Kong stocks. The blue-chip Hang Seng Index closed at 6,779.95, down
254.67 points, or 3.6 percent, the lowest in more than five years.
	   Trading was moderate, with an estimated 460 million shares
changing hands on the first section, up from Monday's 363 million.
Declines overwhelmed advances 952 to 189, with 131 issues
unchanged.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section fell 20.21 points, or 1.67 percent, to 1,186.88. It
had dropped 18.21 points, or 1.49 percent, the previous day.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 1.180 percent from Monday's close of 1.170 percent,
driving its price down to 111.92 yen from 112.00 yen.

Hundreds of illegal immigrants to be released
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By FRANCES D'EMILIO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Hundreds of illegal immigrants will likely be
released from detention centers this week, despite a rush Tuesday
to try to complete their processing for expulsion and a new law
meant to avoid exactly such a development.
	   ``In Italy you make a law, and right away you find a loophole,''
one police officer says to another in a front-page editorial
cartoon in Tuesday's Corriere della Sera, a Milan daily.
	   The looming release over the next three days of more than 600
arrivals, most of them Africans, has prompted the center-right
opposition to accuse Premier Romano Prodi's government of failing
to crack down on illegal immigration.
	   And the release, which virtually gives the immigrants a green
light to wander through Italy and northern Europe in search of
black-market jobs or relatives, was likely to only confirm northern
European partners' fears that Schengen members just can't depend on
Rome.
	   Schengen Treaty members have open borders among them, which is
why the treaty requires that external borders be properly
patrolled.
	   It was anger from Germany and other northern European nations
last fall, after hundreds of Kurds made it to Italian shores, that
led to the new law, which was supposed to tighten controls on
illegal arrivals.
	   Under the new legislation, clandestine immigrants were to kept
in detention centers for up to 30 days while their identity and
nationality were ascertained. Then those with no legal grounds for
staying in Italy, such as eligibility for political asylum or a
confirmed job, were to be shipped or flown back to their home
countries.
	   Under the old system, there were no detention centers.
Immigrants were merely given papers ordering them to leave the
country in 15 days, a virtual ticket to wander freely.
	   After more than 3,000 illegal immigrants sailed aboard
smugglers' boats from northern African since July, Rome rushed to
sign accords with Tunisia and other countries giving development
aid in exchange for promptly taking arrivals back.
	   The first illegal immigrants likely to be released starting
Wednesday from the centers in Sicily and the southern mainland were
88 people being held in Trapani, western Sicily.

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Government forces on Tuesday said they
had retaken the western town of Boma near Congo's Atlantic
coastline, while rebel Tutsis in the east insist they have ample
troops to oust President Laurent Kabila.
	   Congo's information minister said government troops had driven
rebel forces from Boma and were pushing toward the oil port of
Muanda on the coast.
	   ``We are retaking our territory house by house and piece by
piece,'' Information Minister Didier Mumengi told reporters in
Kinshasa on Tuesday.
	   A senior military commander speaking on condition of anonymity
told The Associated Press that fighting was continuing in the area.
	   There was no independent confirmation of the minister's
comments.
	   Boma, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) east of the rebel
stronghold of Muanda on the coast, is a strategic point from where
the rebels would stage an advance on Kinshasa to the north.
	   Tutsi insurgents, including many soldiers from Kabila's army,
revolted against the government nine days ago and quickly captured
the key eastern towns of Goma and Bukavu. After an airlift to the
western village of Kitona they also captured Muanda town.
	   The bulk of the rebellious forces are the same soldiers who last
year helped Kabila in his victory over longtime dictator Mobutu
Sese Seko.
	   Mumengi, clad in camouflage fatigues and flanked by rifle-toting
guards, again accused Rwanda and Uganda of fighting alongside the
rebels.
	   ``A Ugandan plane arrived in Nebbi, which is close to Karobo,
with arms and ammunition,'' Mumengi said. Karobo is in Congo's far
northwest corner near the Ugandan border while Nebbi is on the
Ugandan side.
	   Kabila, drumming up nationalist fervor in his capital, has vowed
to take the war to Rwanda, which he accuses of masterminding the
uprising. Both Uganda and Rwanda have refuted the charges, a claim
echoed by the rebels.
	   A rebel spokesman in Goma said he was sure Kabila would be
driven from power.
	   ``Well, Kabila's going to leave whether he wants to or not, but
it would be better for him if he negotiated his departure at least
in an honorable way,'' rebel information officer Sylvan Biku told
Associated Press Television.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1100 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets slumped Tuesday in a
vicious circle of pessimism about the region's economy, and
especially about Japan. Investors also were dogged by another sharp
fall in Hong Kong, where the Hang Seng index reached a five-year
low and put more strain on the territory's currency link with the
U.S. dollar. The Hong Kong dollar has been under strong speculative
attacks. The blue-chip Hang Seng Index plunged 3.6 percent, closing
at 6,779.95, the lowest since July 29, 1993. Malaysian shares also
fell sharply. The Composite Index dropped 5.3 percent, or 18.58
points, closing at 334.70. During the day, the dollar broke through
147 yen, its highest level since August 1990. Traders said it could
reach 150 by the end of the week. The factors undermining the yen
Tuesday included another drop in Japanese stock prices. The
benchmark Nikkei Stock Average slid 219.43 points, or 1.4 percent,
to 15,406.99, its lowest close since June 29. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian stocks opened sharply lower Tuesday, as
traders feared that Russia's economy was too weak to withstand a
new round of selling in Asian financial markets. The Russian
Trading System Index, which has fallen 71 percent since the start
of the year, sank about 7 percent in the first 90 minutes of
trading. The stock market's main index continued to sink despite a
dlrs 300 million installment of a newly approved World Bank loan
that Russia received on Monday, part of a dlrs 22.6 international
bailout package. Traders said the ruble was also a bit lower on
Tuesday, only supported by heavy intervention from the Russian
Central Bank. Investors were beginning to fear that even with the
international lending, Russia cannot support its currency.
(RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's value-added industrial production rose
7.8 percent from a year earlier to 1.11 trillion yuan (dlrs 134
billion) in this year's first seven months as widespread flooding
and the Asian financial crisis took their toll. Value-added output
for July grew 7.6 percent from a year earlier, compared with growth
of 7.9 percent in the first half of the year, the State Statistical
Bureau reported Tuesday. The value-added, or incremental value, of
industrial production excludes the cost of raw materials used in
the manufacturing process. It is China's benchmark measure of
industrial production. In addition to seasonal factors, industrial
production has slowed due to destructive floods that have disrupted
transportation routes and forced some companies to suspend
production, the bureau reported. (CHINA-ECONOMY)
	   BEIJING (AP) _ The central bank Tuesday warned investors not to
bet against its U.S. dlrs 140 billion in foreign exchange reserves,
saying China will defend its currency for the sake of the domestic
economy. A devaluation of the yuan would spark inflation and force
a hike in interest rates that could further slow the economy, said
Liu Mingkang, deputy governor of the People's Bank of China, the
country's central bank. Liu's comments marked the first time China
has justified maintaining the yuan's value for the sake of the
domestic economy, which fell short of targeted 8 percent economic
growth in the first half of the year. Officials have repeatedly
stressed that China has a responsibility to hold firm on the yuan
rate to prevent another round of devaluations among Asian countries
_ despite the harm done to China's export competitiveness.
(CHINA-CURRENCY)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Promising quick action to rescue Japan's shaky
financial system, Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi signaled his
readiness Tuesday to compromise with opposition parties to pass key
banking reform bills. The willingness to strike a deal comes after
the ruling Liberal Democratic Party suffered a humiliating setback
in July elections that strengthened the opposition's hand in the
upper house of Japan's Parliament. The loss put Obuchi, who has
staked his new administration on a pledge to revive a stagnant
economy, in the uncomfortable position of having to court political
enemies to win passage of legislation. Opposition parties have
reserved some of their harshest criticism for the government's
so-called Total Plan to clean up the estimated 80 trillion yen
(dlrs 551 billion) in bad loans burdening the financial sector.

Heat wave abates after killing 56 people in Cyprus

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ A heat wave that has killed 56 people in
Cyprus in the past five days abated Tuesday, with temperatures
falling to a little above the norm.
	   The Health Ministry said eight people had died overnight Monday,
raising the death toll to 56 since Friday.
	   The weekend temperatures reached 43 degrees Celsius (110
Fahrenheit), the highest recorded in 40 years.
	   Hospital officials said the state morgue in Larnaca, the
southeastern port where most deaths occurred, was hard pressed to
accomodate the corpses as the local undertakers could not manage
more than five funerals a day.
	   The director of the Weather Bureau, Andreas Philaniotis, said
Tuesday's reading was 39 C (102 F) and the temperature was expected
to fall closer to the monthly average of 37 C (99 F) in the next
two days.
	   Most of the dead were elderly people who suffered from
respiratory and other ailments, said a Health Ministry statement.
	   Hospitals have been stretched to the limit with the admission of
some 3,200 patients suffering from heat-related illnesses, the
statement added.

Hundreds of Indonesian troops to leave Aceh by early September
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The Indonesian military said Tuesday
it will withdraw hundreds of combat troops from the troubled
northern province of Aceh by early September as two fact-finding
teams collect evidence of alleged atrocities by soldiers.
	   Local military spokesman Lt. Col. Agus Ramadhan said eight
companies, with a total of between 800 and 1,200 troops, would be
withdrawn along with 80 special forces soldiers by Sept. 8.
	   Ramadhan said local and foreign journalists would be invited to
witness the pullout.
	   Last week, Indonesian military commander Gen. Wiranto traveled
to Aceh, on the northern tip of Sumatra Island about 1,750
kilometers (1,100 miles) northwest of Jakarta, to announce the
troop cutback.
	   Large numbers of troops have operated in Aceh for the past
decade to put down secessionists, who have called for the
declaration of an independent Islamic state.
	   Human rights group accuse the military of widespread abuses,
including the arbitrary killing, torture and rape of civilians.
	   Recently, villagers in several remote parts of the province have
said that opponents of the military were executed and buried in
mass graves.
	   Bachtiar, a provincial government official, said Aceh's governor
has formed a 29-member fact-finding team to investigate allegations
of atrocities and to dig up alleged mass grave sites.
	   Additionally, a team from the National Human Rights Commission
was to visit Aceh this week.
	   In Jakarta, the Muslim-oriented United Development Party called
Tuesday for a full state investigation into human rights abuses and
the immediate release of all political detainees and prisoners in
Aceh.
	   The party said the abuses ``have happened for about eight years
without a single effort or stern measure by the leadership and
institution of the military to stop it.''
	   It demanded that those responsible for abuses be put on trial.
	   Earlier this month, Indonesia withdrew 1,300 combat troops from
another troubled region, the former Portuguese colony of East
Timor, 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles) east of Jakarta.
	   East Timor has endured civil unrest, guerrilla warfare and human
rights abuses since Indonesia invaded in 1975 and annexed the
territory as its 27th province the following year.
	   The United Nations is currently brokering peace talks on East
Timor's future with Indonesia and Portugal.
	   Changes in the military's attitude toward Indonesia's
troublesome provinces have been made in the wake of the resignation
of longtime ruler Suharto.
	   His successor, President B.J. Habibie, has promised greater
political freedom and respect for human rights.

Suu Kyi leaves home to visit party offices

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES throughout with government statement
saying Suu Kyi has had 300 visitors, no restrictions &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Myanmar's military regime denied Tuesday
that new roadblocks near the home of opposition leader Aung San Suu
Kyi amounted to a new form of house arrest and said she had
received 300 visitors since they were installed.
	   Suu Kyi, winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, is intensifying
her challenge to the government, which complied with a request last
week to withdraw security personnel from her home but erected new
bamboo barrier gates on the road where she lives.
	   Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy issued a statement
Monday saying that cars leaving her compound have been searched and
that the restrictions were a new form of house arrest.
	   ``Ms. Suu Kyi has been going out of her compound almost daily
and has been receiving foreign diplomats at her residence as
well,'' a government official said in a statement faxed to The
Associated Press in Bangkok, Thailand.
	   ``There is no government restriction on her movement as long as
security conditions permit,'' the statement said.
	   Witnesses saw Suu Kyi, 53, visit NLD headquarters in Yangon
Tuesday, followed by a government security detail. She was believed
to be visiting veteran politicians.
	   The government freed Suu Kyi from six years of house arrest in
1995, but later curtailed the limited freedom she had been given.
	   Two weeks ago, she left her compound and drove outside the
capital to meet provincial supporters. She was stopped. A six-day
standoff with authorities ensued before her car was seized and she
was driven back to her home.
	   The confrontation raised the profile of her struggle against the
government ahead of an Aug. 21 deadline she has set for the
government to finally convene a pro-democracy parliament elected in
1990 but never allowed to convene.

Heat wave abates after killing 56 people in Cyprus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ A heat wave that has killed 56 people in
Cyprus in the past five days abated Tuesday, with temperatures
falling to a little above the norm.
	   The Health Ministry said eight people died overnight Monday,
raising the death toll to 56 since Friday. The weekend temperatures
reached 43 degrees Celsius (110 Fahrenheit), the highest recorded
in 40 years.
	   Hospital officials said the state morgue in Larnaca, the
southeastern port where most deaths occurred, was hard pressed to
accommodate the corpses. Local undertakers could not manage more
than five funerals a day.
	   The director of the Weather Bureau, Andreas Philaniotis, said
Tuesday's reading was 39 C (102 F) and the temperature was expected
to fall closer to the monthly average of 37 C (99 F) in the next
two days.
	   Most of the dead were elderly people who suffered from
respiratory and other ailments, said a Health Ministry statement.
	   Hospitals have been stretched to the limit with the admission of
some 3,200 patients suffering from heat-related illnesses, it said.

Israel agrees to join talks on nuclear materials ban treaty
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel has agreed to join talks on a treaty
banning the production of material used to make nuclear weapons,
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Tuesday.
	   Israel had been the only member of the 61-nation United Nations
Conference on Disarmament that had not agreed to join negotiations
on the proposed treaty to ban the manufacture of highly enriched
uranium and plutonium.
	   U.S. President Clinton has asked Israel not to oppose the
establishment of the committee, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
told his Cabinet on Tuesday.
	   As a result, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations in
Geneva, Yosef Lamdan, has been authorized to join the working group
that will discuss the treaty and ``the problems of inspection that
it raises,'' said Aviv Bushinsky, Netanyahu's spokesman.
	   Netanyahu told the Cabinet, however, that joining the talks
``does not imply adoption of a position on the agreement or its
contents,'' according to a statement from the prime minister's
office.
	   Netanyahu said he told the United States that Israel has
``considerations of our own which are particular to our situation
in the region,'' and ``basic problems with the treaty.''
	   Israel opposes international inspection of its nuclear
facilities, said lawmaker Yossi Sarid, a member of the key
parliamentary subcommittee on the secret services.
	   Israel is widely believed to have several hundred nuclear
weapons but has never admitted to having the bomb. Its deterrent
posture has been based on what it calls ``purposeful ambiguity,''
in which a potential enemy could not be certain if Israel possessed
nuclear weapons or not.
	   Lawmaker Ephraim Sneh, a retired general, said Monday it would
be a ``terrible mistake'' for Israel to give up this ``ambiguity''
in the light of the growing potential nuclear threat from Iran.
	   Iran recently tested a missile capable of reaching Israel and is
widely believed to be trying to achieve a nuclear capability.
Iran's Islamic regime has repeatedly called for Israel's
destruction.
	   Israel became the lone holdout to talks on a nuclear materials
``cut off treaty'' after India and Pakistan _ under international
pressure following their test explosions earlier this year _ both
said they are ready to engage in negotiations.

	   MBABANE, Swaziland (AP) _ The U.S. Embassy in Swaziland was
evacuated for several hours Tuesday morning after a caller phoned
in a bomb threat.
	   Sniffer dogs searched the embassy and a nearby building housing
embassy offices and found nothing, a spokeswoman said.
	   The threat caused extra concern after the bombings of U.S.

Catholic church calls for halt in new crosses at Auschwitz
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BEATA PASEK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Poland's top Catholic figure reversed
himself Tuesday and called for followers to stop putting up crosses
outside the former Nazi death camp at Auschwitz.
	   The strongly worded statement by Cardinal Jozef Glemp was a
conciliatory move in the escalating controversy over dozens of
crosses erected in the past three weeks on property adjoining
Auschwitz, outside Krakow in southern Poland.
	   The Israeli government and Jewish groups, including the Simon
Wiesenthal Center, have formally protested to Poland's government
about the newly erected crosses near Auschwitz and Birkenau camps,
where more than 1 million Jews died in World War II.
	   Glemp appealed to Catholic bishops in Poland to ``try to
restrain the growth of that non-church action,'' referring to the
smaller crosses put up by conservative Catholics near a larger
cross that has stood at the site since 1988.
	   A loose group of Catholic followers, inspired by a former
Solidarity activist and author of anti-Semitic pamphlets, intend to
erect 152 crosses at the site to commemorate the 152 Poles killed
at that spot by the Nazis.
	   But Glemp said `irresponsible groups'' were putting up the new
crosses, which he said diminished ``the meaning of the
cross-symbol.''
	   His statement followed comments by top government figures Monday
about a possible compromise in the dispute, which has touched on
one of the most emotional remnants of the war _ how to preserve the
camp that symbolized Nazi brutality and calculated killing.
	   The cross controversy began with the eight-meter (26-foot)
brown, wooden cross erected a decade ago at a Carmelite nunnery
that adjoined Auschwitz. The cross, used in a mass celebrated by
Pope John Paul II at nearby Birkenau in 1979, honors Polish victims
of the Nazis, particularly the 152 slain at the site.
	   Jewish groups say the cross, which can be seen from one part of
Auschwitz, violates the memory of Jews who died there. They also
say it adds a religious element to the property, which is a UNESCO
heritage site and protected from changes that alter its character.
	   Because of the cross, Jewish groups have refused to sign a dlrs
93.5 million development deal for the Auschwitz property reached
last year with Polish authorities.
	   The Jewish protest over the cross prompted conservative
Catholics to begin putting up the additional, smaller crosses.
	   Last week, Glemp blamed the dispute on what he called
``continuous and increasing harassment by the Jewish side.'' His
statement Tuesday admitted that ``pronouncements by the Israeli
side did not have the character attributed to them originally,''
but added that ``the wave of emotions rises.''
	   Poland's biggest daily newspaper, Gazeta Wyborcza, characterized
Glemp's statement as a surprise and praised it as ``the voice of a
Christian who has the courage to admit he wrongly estimated the
situation.''
	   Roman Catholic bishops will meet Aug. 26 at Poland's holiest
shrine, the Black Madonna monastery in Czestochowa, to discuss the
issue and seek a solution.

Tiger seriously injures longtime trainer at German circus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ A circus tiger attacked its longtime
keeper Monday night at a circus near Hamburg, seriously injuring
the man.
	   The 41-year-old man was shoveling sawdust through the bars into
the cage when the 2-year-old tiger attacked, catching the man off
guard, said Petra Boeke, a spokeswoman for the Siemoneit-Barum
circus, on Tuesday.
	   The tiger bit the man in his upper arm and wounded him in the
face before a second animal trainer came to his aid, she said.
	   The keeper, who has been with the circus for more than 20 years,
was hospitalized with serious but not life-threatening injuries,
police said.
	   The circus, which has more than 100 employees and 80 animals,
was visiting Eutin, a town about 45 miles northeast of Hamburg.
Performances will continue as scheduled, Boeke said.

Estrada approves human rights accord with communist rebels

 &UR; By OLIVER TEVES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine President Joseph Estrada
has approved a human rights accord with communist rebels, paving
the way for the resumption of peace talks, officials said Tuesday.
	   Howard Dee, the chief government peace negotiator, said Estrada
approved the human rights accord last Friday ``for immediate
implementation without reservations or precondition.''
	   The talks have stalled since the two negotiating panels signed
the human rights agreement in March. Estrada's predecessor, Fidel
Ramos, failed to approve the accord before he stepped down June 30.
	   The rebels have refused to continue the talks unless the human
rights agreement received presidential approval.
	   Dee said the approval ``will certainly go a long way in building
and nurturing a climate of peace in the Philippines.''
	   He said talks with the Marxist underground umbrella, the
National Democratic Front, are expected to resume in the first week
of September.
	   He said he also expects the rebels to announce a cease-fire, as
they had promised once the agreement was approved by the president.
	   In a statement, Luis Jalandoni, chief NDF negotiator, said the
rebel group ``warmly welcomes'' approval of the accord, but he did
not mention a cease-fire.
	   He said the rebels now are ready to resume the peace
negotiations.
	   ``This is a document of profound significance and of lasting
benefit to the Filipino people,'' Jalandoni said.
	   Rene Sarmiento, another member of the government panel, said the
agreement contains provisions that will ``humanize and lessen the
severity of the armed conflict,'' particularly on children, women
and the elderly.
	   Under the agreement, children are not to be used in the armed
conflict and the government will not be allowed to use
``unnecessary bombardments'' of suspected rebel positions, impose
food blockades and force the evacuation of communities.
	   Sarmiento said the two sides also agreed not to use land mines,
possibly making the Philippines the first country to implement an
international agreement to ban land mines.
	   A key feature of the accord is the support by both the
government and the rebels for the indemnification of 9,539
Filipinos who won a class action suit for human rights violations
against the estate of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos.
	   The government and the victims of abuse under Marcos are
claiming about dlrs 540 million in Marcos' Swiss bank deposits,
which have been transferred to an escrow account in a Philippine
bank.
	   The Marcos family has indicated it was willing to settle the
claims out of court, but there have been no negotiations so far.
	   Sarmiento said Estrada's approval of the accord is a signal for
the courts handling Marcos wealth cases to speed up their
proceedings.
	   He said he also expects more political prisoners to be released.
An organization of former political detainees, Selda, says 127
political prisoners are still being held in jails nationwide.
	   The agreement on respect for human rights rights and
international humanitarian law is the first of four accords leading
to a political settlement of three decades of insurgency.
	   The others cover social and economic reforms, political and
constitutional reforms and disposition of armed forces.

Four Italian cyclists test positive for banned substances
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Four Italian members of the Mobilvetta
cycling squad were disqualified from the Tour of Portugal race
Tuesday after testing positive for banned substances, the
Portuguese news agency Lusa reported.
	   Paolo Alberati, Graziano Recinella, Mario Monzoni and Renzo
Tagnetti were among 32 racers picked at random for a blood test
just before setting off on the second leg of the tour in southern
Spain, Lusa said.
	   The medical team from the International Cycling Union that
carries out such tests is nicknamed ``the vampires'' by the
cyclists.
	   The 2,177-kilometer (1,350-mile) race began in the southern
Spanish city of Seville on Monday, is due to cross the border into
Portugal on the third leg and finish in Lisbon on Aug. 23.
	   A squad from Festina is among the 18 taking part in the tour.
Festina was at the heart of the doping scandal that marred the Tour
de France.

Cambodian leader offers prince's party stake in new government

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Sam Rainsy Party denouncing officials for failing
to investigate election fraud in grafs 8-10; edits thruout &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian strongman Hun Sen offered
Tuesday to give Prince Norodom Ranariddh's opposition party a stake
in the new government, but appeared likely to leave out the other
main opposition party led by outspoken critic Sam Rainsy.
	   Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party won last month's
parliamentary elections, but lacks the two-thirds majority needed
to form a government. Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party and the Sam
Rainsy Party had been invited to join in a new coalition.
	   Prak Sokhon, an adviser to Hun Sen, said the CPP and FUNCINPEC,
which finished second in the balloting, will ``work out an
arrangement of a new government, leaving the third party in the
opposition, in accordance with its profession.''
	   Hun Sen's party would take 60 percent of the Cabinet portfolios
and FUNCINPEC 40 percent, Prak Sokhon said.
	   So far, Hun Sen has demanded that he be named prime minister and
that his party keep control of the key ministries _ defense,
interior, justice, finance and foreign affairs.
	   Prak Sokhon quoted Hun Sen as saying that if the Sam Rainsy
Party joins the government ``just in order to disturb it, it is
better to leave it as an opposition party.''
	   He added that the suggestion is in line with recommendations by
several donor countries.
	   The Sam Rainsy Party, meanwhile, accused election officials
Tuesday of closing their eyes to irregularities and fraud in the
July 26 polls.
	   In a written statement, it said a decision by the National
Election Committee to stop investigating complaints about election
irregularities further diminished its credibility. The NEC is
stacked with Hun Sen's supporters.
	   ``The ruling party has been permitted to break nearly every rule
in the electoral law without consequence, from bribery to murder,''
the party wrote, adding that the NEC is required by law to resolve
complaints.
	   Ranariddh's party finished first in U.N.-sponsored elections in
1993, but agreed to a co-premiership when Hun Sen threatened civil
war. The arrangement was shattered last year when Hun Sen deposed
his partner in a coup.
	   Last week, the CPP was declared winner of the recent elections,
with 64 of the 122 seats in the National Assembly against 43 for
FUNCINPEC and 15 for the Sam Rainsy Party.
	   The two main opposition parties have alleged hundreds of
irregularities and said they will not recognize the election
results or talk about joining Hun Sen in a coalition government
pending investigations and recounts.
	   They have also appealed to the United Nations for help in
contesting the formula used to allocate seats.
	   The Sam Rainsy Party is the smallest of the three parties and
its support is not necessary for the CPP to form a government. Sam
Rainsy, a former finance minister, has been critical of corruption
in both other parties.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Investigators began to piece together
evidence from last week's U.S. Embassy bombings Tuesday, with a
heroic Kenyan guard's eyewitness account providing possibly
important clues.
	   Twin terrorist bombings in Kenya and Tanzania claimed at least
217 lives and injured nearly 5,000, and the death toll was rising.
	   Another 15 bodies were pulled from the rubble in Nairobi
Tuesday, bringing the death toll here to 207, Red Cross spokeswoman
Nina Galbe said.

Study shows religion keeps blood pressure in elderly low
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GARY D. ROBERTSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RALEIGH, North Carolina (AP) _ Another study has linked good
health with religion. The latest shows lower blood pressure among
older people who have faith.
	   The new Duke University study of 4,000 North Carolinians ages 65
or over found those who participated in religious activities were
40 percent less likely to have high blood pressure, which can
increase the risk of heart disease.
	   While the study doesn't prove a causal relationship between
belief in a higher power and good health, it does provide evidence
of another benefit of religious activity, study co-author Dr.
Harold Koenig said.
	   ``We're becoming more aware that religious beliefs or practices
is not negative for a person's health,'' Koenig said. ``In fact
they could be very positive.''
	   Research has shown that religious people are less depressed,
have healthier immune systems and deal better with addictions than
the nonreligious.
	   In the Duke study, released in this month's issue of the
International Journal of Psychiatry in Medicine, Koenig's team
measured their subjects' blood pressures and adjusted for race,
age, gender and other differences.
	   They found that older residents of the southeastern state who
attended religious services at least once a week had consistently
lower diastolic readings, as did those who read the Bible or prayed
regularly. The diastolic reading measures blood pressure when the
heart relaxes.
	   The average diastolic reading was about 78 millimeters of
mercury for people who attended church regularly and prayed
frequently or read the Bible daily, compared with nearly 81 mm for
those who didn't.
	   High diastolic readings are associated with heart attacks and
strokes.
	   ``There are studies that show if you could reduce the diastolic
reading by 2 to 4 millimeters you could cut cardiovascular
mortality by up to 20 percent,'' said Koenig, a professor at Duke
Medical Center and director of Duke's Center for the Study of
Religion/Spirituality and Health.
	   The effect of religious activities appeared to be strongest in
blacks and people between 65 and 75.
	   Religion may provide the faithful with comfort or a loving
community in their golden years, thereby lowering stress and blood
pressure, Koenig said. The effect may be more marked in blacks
because historically they have closer ties to church.
	   Dr. Herbert Benson, president of the Mind/Body Medical Institute
and associated with Harvard Medical School, said the Duke study
presents further evidence ``that belief is inexorably connected to
body as body is to mind.''
	   ``The documentation has never been as quite effective as in Dr.
Koenig's study,'' Benson said.

Dissident's wife roughed up during detention: report
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with dissidents' petition in grafs 4-7; edits to trim &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Plainclothes police forcibly detained the elderly
mother and wife of a veteran Chinese dissident, but later released
them, a human rights group said Tuesday.
	   Chu Hailan, wife of labor activist Liu Nianchun, and his mother
were walking to a Beijing government office Monday to press demands
that Liu be given better medical treatment when plainclothes agents
of the State Security Bureau forced them into a car, the New
York-based Human Rights in China said.
	   Chu suffered a sprained ankle and bruises during the just over
12 hours she spent in detention, the group said. Her husband, who
has been held in labor camps or prisons without trial for three
years, suffers stomach problems, high blood pressure and other
ailments, according to Chu.
	   Meanwhile, 138 dissidents signed a petition to Chinese leaders
demanding the release of Wang Youcai, an activist detained July 10
in a crackdown on a would-be opposition party.
	   In their petition, dated Monday and addressed to President Jiang
Zemin and Premier Zhu Rongji, the dissidents expressed ``deep
shock'' at authorities' decision last week to charge Wang with
inciting the overthrow the government.
	   Wang and two other dissidents announced the formation of the
China Democracy Party on June 25, the day U.S. President Bill
Clinton arrived for a visit. But Chinese officials refused to let
the group legally register and soon began rounding up its
organizers and their associates.
	   Of the dozen people detained, all but Wang have since been
released.

Israel agrees to join talks on nuclear materials ban treaty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel has agreed to join talks on a proposed
treaty banning the production of material used to make nuclear
weapons, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Tuesday.
	   Israel had been the only member of the 61-nation United Nations
Conference on Disarmament that had not agreed to join negotiations
to ban the manufacture of highly enriched uranium and plutonium.
	   Netanyahu told his Cabinet on Tuesday that U.S. President Bill
Clinton asked Israel not to oppose the establishment of the
committee. Netanyahu said, however, that joining the talks ``does
not imply adoption of a position on the agreement or its
contents,'' according to a statement from his office.
	   Israel is widely believed to have several hundred nuclear
weapons but has never admitted to having the bomb.
	   Iran recently tested a missile capable of reaching Israel and is
widely believed to be trying to achieve a nuclear capability.

U.S. aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk arrives in Japan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos Available &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   YOKOSUKA, Japan (AP) _ The aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk arrived
at a U.S. naval base in Japan Tuesday, beginning a nine-year
mission as the only American aircraft carrier permanently stationed
overseas.
	   The 81,000-ton warship steamed into Yokosuka Naval Base, about
45 kilometers (28 miles) southwest of Tokyo, escorted by the
cruiser Chancellorsville.
	   As red, white and blue balloons were lofted into the air,
thousands of relatives of U.S. sailors gathered by the docks to
greet the incoming ship. One toddler held up a piece of paper
bearing the message: ``I love you Daddy.''
	   The Kitty Hawk replaced the aircraft carrier Independence, which
had been stationed at Yokosuka since 1991.
	   The Chancellorsville, a 9,000-ton warship equipped with the
high-tech Aegis radar and missile system to protect the carrier,
replaces the Bunker Hill, a similar vessel that returned to the
United States with the Independence in July.
	   The Kitty Hawk, 325 meters (1,066 feet) long and carrying a crew
of about 5,500, was commissioned in 1961. It will likely stay at
Yokosuka until its scheduled retirement from service in 2007.

	   MBABANE, Swaziland (AP) _ The U.S. Embassy in Swaziland was
evacuated for several hours Tuesday morning after a caller phoned
in a bomb threat.
	   Sniffer dogs searched the embassy and a nearby building housing
embassy offices and found nothing, a spokeswoman said.
	   The threat caused extra concern after the bombings of U.S.
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed more than 200 people.
	   Swaziland is a tiny mountain kingdom bordering South Africa and
Mozambique.

Teen-agers jailed for up to 20 years for gang rape and murder
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Thirteen teen-agers who gang-raped and
beat a 14-year-old girl to death with clubs and baseball bats were
given prison terms of up to 20 years, news reports said Tuesday.
	   The young people admitted the crime, but said they had not meant
to kill Chien Li-rong last October. Their lack of remorse shocked
Taiwan, which has been rattled by a series of violent youth crimes.
	   Nine boys and four girls were given sentences ranging from 11 to
20 years for raping and killing the girl in Hsinchu County, about
55 kilometers (30 miles) from Taipei, the mass-circulation China
Times reported.
	   The names of the teen-agers and other details about the
sentencing Monday were withheld from the media. Under Taiwanese
law, only immediate family members or guardians are privy to cases
that involve minors.
	   Although the teen-agers said they did not intend to kill the
girl, press reports said prosecutors had demanded the death penalty
for some of them. However, they were given lesser punishment
because of their age.
	   The English-language China Post said prosecutor Lin Li-jia was
considering an appeal to Taiwan's High Court.
	   The teen-agers, mostly junior high school truants or dropouts,
were arrested shortly after locking the girl in a room for five
days, shaving her head, raping her and beating her to death with
clubs and baseball bats. They told police they beat her up because
she stole a jacket and pager from one of them.
	   In recent months, juvenile crime has made Taiwan increasingly
afraid of its own children. While some outraged people are
demanding tougher punishment, others are urging early counseling
and better schooling to straighten out young offenders.
	   In another sensational case, four teen-age boys have been
arrested for allegedly taking turns raping a 15-year-old girl and
torturing her with electric shocks while their girlfriends watched
TV. After their arrest, the boys said the victim deserved what she
got for stealing a pager and being ``a pain.''

German prosecutors close books on alleged Stasi-RAF links
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By THOMAS SCHMOLL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ German authorities closed their books on cases
involving ties between the former East German secret police and
leftist terrorists in the West, saying Tuesday that recent court
decision had made pursuing them pointless.
	   ``We had other views of the law than the Federal Court of
Justice, but they were not shared,'' said chief investigator
Christoph Schaefgen.
	   The high court in March overturned the convictions of three
former officers of the East German secret police, known as the
Stasi. They were the first and only to be tried on the alleged
connection between the Stasi and the Red Army Faction, a leftist
terrorist group active in West Germany in the 1970s and 1980s.
	   Prosecutors said they helped spirit 10 RAF dropouts out of West
Germany in the early 1980s, giving them new identities and helping
them build new lives in East Germany.
	   The three were convicted of obstructing justice in March 1997,
reprimanded by the court and ordered to stay out of trouble for two
years or face fines up to 5,000 marks (dlrs 3,000).
	   But a year later, the Federal Court of Justice overturned the
convictions, saying that East Germany was not obligated under
international law to reveal the whereabouts of RAF terrorists
wanted for arrest in the West.
	   Citing that ruling, a Berlin state court in mid-June refused to
hear a trial against former Stasi boss Erich Mielke's deputy and
the head of the Stasi's anti-terrorism division on similar charges.
	   Schaefgen said he was not aware of any other cases still open,
but said no more would be pursued, since they would probably end
with acquittal.

	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ The U.S. Embassy remained closed for a
second day Tuesday, and Ugandan and U.S. security personnel were on
high alert five days after terrorists bombed American diplomatic
missions in neighboring Kenya and Tanzania, a police spokesman
said.
	   Bob Ngobi said Parliamentary Road where the U.S. mission is
located has been closed to traffic for security reasons.
	   The U.S. Embassy and the British High Commission share a
compound.
	   Radio stations broadcast requests from police to Kampala
residents to be on the alert and report any ``suspicious people.''
	   ``If a bomb goes off, it may not hurt you, but it may hurt
someone you may be your relative,'' said a police statement
broadcast on the private Central Broadcasting System.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The U.S. Embassy in Malaysia has
closed its iron gates for all but emergency services for American
citizens after deadly terrorist bombings at missions in Africa,
embassy officials said Tuesday.
	   Armed guards on 24-hour watch circled the U.S. diplomatic
compound in Kuala Lumpur as President Bill Clinton in Washington
called for heightened security at many of the 280 missions
worldwide that don't meet tough State Department standards.
	   ``As a result of the bombings of American Embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania, the Department of State has ordered the American Embassy
in Kuala Lumpur to curtail its consular services until further
notice,'' read a statement taped to the guard stand outside the
mission.
	   Patrol cars circled the diplomatic compound Tuesday. Guards,
many armed with automatic weapons, were stationed at a nearby gas
station and at various points around the mission, whose razor-wired
gates are just off a busy street in downtown Kuala Lumpur.
	   Extra precautions have been taken at U.S. embassies worldwide,
particularly those without sufficient barriers against roadside
terrorist threats, following the car-bomb explosions Friday that
killed 12 Americans and more than 200 Africans and injured more
than 5,000 people.
	   In neighboring Indonesia, security has been tightened at the
embassy in the capital, Jakarta, due partly to the recent bombings,
but also in expectation of possible violence around Aug. 17,
Indonesia's independence day, embassy staff said.
	   Four officers with semi-automatic weapons guarded the main
entrance at the mission in Jakarta, where security forces have been
kept on various levels of alert since the city was swept with riots
in May, prior to the resignation of longtime President Suharto.
	   In Kuala Lumpur, embassy spokesman James Warren said most staff
had been given permission to work from home and visa operations had
been scaled back until security concerns were relaxed.
	   ``We just have fewer people in the building than before,''
Warren said about the staff of 80 Americans and about 90
Malaysians. He said the embassy was still officially open.
	   However, an American citizen who attempted to enter the mission
Tuesday to pick up tax forms was told by a security guard: ``The
embassy is closed. Nobody is in the consular section. Everybody is
on leave.''
	   According to the sign at the front of the embassy, the consulate
would no longer accept visa applications on a walk-in basis, only
through travel agents and couriers. Visa interview hours had been
suspended and the processing time for visa applications had been
extended from 5 to 10 days.
	   U.S. officials have refused to speculate on who might be
responsible for the almost simultaneous explosions in Kenya and
Tanzania but have said the attacks appeared to have been organized
by a terrorist group. Certain Islamic militants have been
considered possible suspects.
	   Last November, a wave of anti-American sentiment hit Malaysia
and the U.S. Embassy reported receiving terrorism threats. The
hostility erupted after a group of U.S. congressmen demanded that
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad resign over anti-Jewish remarks.
	   Malaysia, whose 22 million people are predominantly Muslim, has
been beset by economic problems, which have been blamed by the
leadership, at least in part, on foreigners.

Forest groups first-half profit up to dlrs 1.0 billion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Europe's largest forest products group,
UPM-Kymmene, increased its first-half pretax profit to 5.57 billion
markkaa (dlrs 1.0 billion), up from 3.5 billion markkaa during the
same period last year.
	   Net sales from January to June fell slightly to 25.5 billion
markkaa (dlrs 4.7 billion) from 26.4 billion markkaa in 1997, but
the drop was mainly because UPM-Kymmene sold off two businesses,
the company said Tuesday.
	   In its outlook for the rest of the year, UPM-Kymmene predicted
continued demand for printing and writing paper in Europe and the
United States.
	   ``Economic growth in Europe and the United States is forecast to
continue, and this is expected to offset the effects of Southeast
Asia's economic crisis,'' a company statement said.
	   UPM-Kymmene was formed in 1996 from the merger of two leading
Finnish forest companies, Kymmene and Repola. It employs 34,000
people in more than 80 countries.

Big fire breaks out in oil facility in India's northeast
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS hundreds of villagers flee area, losses estimated at dlrs
4.7 million. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GAUHATI, India (AP) _ In a case of suspected sabotage, a massive
fire erupted early Tuesday in three oil storage tanks of the
state-owned Indian Oil Corp. in eastern India, forcing hundreds of
villagers to flee. There were no casualties, police said.
	   At least 26 fire engines battled 50-meter (150-feet)-high
flames. The facility stores motor oil and diesel in the Nagaon
district, 60 kilometers (40 miles) east of Gauhati. Fifteen
thousands liters of fuel are believed to be on fire.
	   Initial estimates put the loss at rupees 50 crores (dlrs 4.7
million).
	   Police said they suspected rebels of the United Liberation Front
of Assam, who have stepped up violence as a protest against India's
independence day celebrations this week. But authorities said they
had no conclusive proof.
	   On Monday night, two businessmen were shot and killed by
suspected ULFA militants in Gauhati, the state capital of Assam,
police said . No one claimed responsibility for the attack.
	   In a separate incident blamed on the separatist group over the
weekend, three army soldiers were killed in a land mine explosion
in a central rural district.
	   ULFA seeks full sovereignty for Assam, accusing India of
exploiting the state like a colony by stripping its resources and
failing to invest in its development.
	   Last week, Home Minister Lal Krishna Advani who is responsible
for internal security, met top officials in New Delhi following
intelligence reports that the ULFA was planning to attack oil
installations in the northeast.

Neste six-month profit falls to dlrs 47 million
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Citing lower crude oil prices, the
Neste oil and gas group said Tuesday that its six-month pretax
profit fell to 255 million markkaa (dlrs 47 million) from 460
million markkaa in 1997.
	   Net sales during January to June also dropped, to 19.8 billion
markkaa (dlrs 3.6 billion), from 22.3 billion markkaa during the
same period last year.
	   The company said it expects the pretax profit for 1998 to reach
last year's figures, despite the low prices of crude oil.
	   In 1997, Neste's pretax profit increased by 73 percent to 983
million markkaa (dlrs 182 million).
	   Earlier this year, Neste joined a merger with Finnish power
company IVO, and is now a subsidiary of Helsinki based Fortum.
	   The merger came as an attempt to strengthen the companies'
position in European markets.
	   Neste, which is more than 90-percent state-owned, is active in
oil refining, energy and chemicals. It employs 9,000 people in more
than 30 countries.

Suspected Kurdish rebels attack tourist hotel in northern Turkey
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Gunmen believed to be Kurdish rebels
raided a tourist hotel on Turkey's Black Sea coast, killing the
owner before setting it on fire, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   The guerrillas, armed with Kalashnikov rifles, forced out 35
guests at the inn in the town of Uzungol on Monday, the Milliyet
daily said. The seven gunmen killed the owner when he tried to stop
them from burning the building, Milliyet said.
	   The newspaper said the hotel guests included foreigners. Their
nationalities were not known. The paramilitary police in charge of
the area refused immediate comment.
	   Uzungol is close to scenic lakes and the much-visited Byzantine
Surmene monastery, carved into a rock cliff.
	   Kurdish rebels, fighting for autonomy in Turkey's southeast,
sometimes launch attacks in the Black Sea region when under
pressure from the military. The war between Kurdish guerrillas and
government forces has claimed 37,000 lives since 1984; rebels
occasionally abduct foreign tourists and release them unharmed.
	   Also on Tuesday, the rebels released a mayor they kidnapped at a
roadblock near the southeastern city of Van a week ago, Turkey's
semiofficial Anatolia news agency said.
	   Orhan was apparently unharmed and was being questioned at a
paramilitary police station near Van. The circumstances of his
release were not known.

Japan protests Myanmar military regime's treatment of Suu Kyi
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Myanmar-Suu Kyi &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan joined the United States, Australia and
several other countries Tuesday in condemning Myanmar's military
regime for its recent treatment of opposition leader Aung San Suu
Kyi and called for a dialogue between them, the Foreign Ministry
said.
	   The joint letter was delivered to Myanmar's government Tuesday
in Yangon, said a ministry official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   In the letter, the countries expressed ``grave concerns over the
regime's hostile treatment against ... Aung San Suu Kyi,'' the
ministry said in a news release. ``The travel restrictions, as well
as forcible return to her residence in the latest incident, were a
violation of her rights to travel and hold meetings freely.''
	   Two weeks ago, Suu Kyi, winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize,
left her compound and drove outside the capital to meet provincial
supporters. She was stopped and a six-day standoff with authorities
ensued.
	   The letter also urged Myanmar's military regime to promptly hold
a dialogue with Suu Kyi and supporters of her pro-democracy
movement.
	   Myanmar's various political problems can be settled only through
such a dialogue, it said.
	   The government freed Suu Kyi from six years of house arrest in
1995, but later curtailed the limited freedom she had been given.
	   The ministry said the letter was sent by Japan, the United
States, Australia, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and South Korea.

Detained activists in Myanmar receive visit, reported OK
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES throughout with visits begin for
detainees, Americans don't complain of treatment, other details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Myanmar's military regime began allowing
diplomats Tuesday to visit 18 foreign democracy activists detained
for handing out anti-government leaflets, but there remained no
decision on whether they would be tried.
	   In the first visits, three days after the arrests, U.S.
diplomats were permitted to visit six Americans held at the Yangon
police headquarters. Diplomats from the Philippines, Thailand and
Australia were also being allowed visits.
	   A U.S. Embassy spokeswoman said two consular officers took books
and snacks from the embassy commissary to the 90-minute meeting,
held in an open room.
	   ``Their health is OK,'' said the spokeswoman, speaking on
condition of anonymity. ``They are eating fine. They've been
receiving Chinese vegetarian food. They are not complaining about
their treatment.''
	   One U.S. activist, Nisha Marie Anand, 21, a student, is a
vegetarian and has cited her diet as a health concern.
	   The spokeswoman declined to comment on whether and how the
detainees were being questioned. Myanmar authorities have said the
18 foreigners are being interrogated as part of investigations to
determine if a legal case should be brought.
	   ``The six Americans expressed concern about how the case will be
resolved,'' the spokeswoman said. ``The embassy has been told it's
not been decided yet.''
	   Government officials earlier denied reports that the ruling
State Peace and Development Council had already decided to charge
and try the activists, saying no ruling had been made. Deportation
was still an option.
	   The reports panicked supporters and family members of the
activists meeting in Bangkok, Thailand.
	   The detainees include six Americans, three Thais, three
Malaysians, three Indonesians, two Philippine citizens and an
Australian. It was unclear whether the Malaysians and Indonesians
were getting visits Tuesday.
	   The 18 were apprehended in downtown Yangon and at the airport
Sunday. They were urging people to remember a 1988 uprising against
military rule and to not give up.
	   In Manila, 30 human rights activists, some holding placards
reading ``Democracy for Burma,'' picketed the Myanmar Embassy. They
attempted to deliver a letter but were stopped by guards.
	   ``I'm afraid. I don't know what happened to my son,'' said
Leticia Resuena, mother of detained activist Ponciano Resuena.
	   The Myanmar ambassador to the Philippines told reporters the
detainees were not cooperating with the Myanmar investigators.
	   Forum Asia, a Bangkok-based human rights group, called for the
release of the detainees and was forming a delegation of relatives,
doctors, lawyers and journalists to seek visas to visit them.
	   Kusuma Phundermvong, the mother of a Thai detainee, said she was
worried about the health of her daughter, Chanakarn, 22, who
recently suffered from malaria and thyroid problems.
	   The Myanmar authorities have insisted the detainees are in good
health.
	   Officials said they want to discourage leafleting and that the
activists broke laws, including a printing act and an emergency
law. The catchall emergency law can carry a 10-year sentence and is
frequently used against political opponents.
	   A statement from the Myanmar Embassy in London accused them of
acting at the behest of people ``pushing the country down into
hellish pits.''
	   The reference was to opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, winner
of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, and her National League for
Democracy. They have set an Aug. 21 deadline for the government to
finally convene a parliament elected in 1990.
	   The opposition overwhelmingly won the election, but the
military, which has ruled Myanmar since 1962 and tolerates almost
no dissent, refused to relinquish power.
	   The 18 activists entered Myanmar as tourists on the eve of the
10th anniversary of the Aug. 8, 1988, uprising, which resulted in a
change of leaders but was eventually crushed. An estimated 3,000
people died.
	   No unrest by Myanmar's own people was reported on the
anniversary.

Kabila battles to retake towns seized by rebels

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ The government on Tuesday said forces
loyal to President Laurent Kabila had recaptured the key eastern
city of Bukavu and the western town of Boma near Congo's Atlantic
coastline.
	   Tutsi rebels fighting to topple Kabila's 14-month-old regime,
however, said they have ample troops to push to the capital of
Kinshasa.
	   Kabila, speaking on the state television station, said civilians
were pouring in to help fight the uprising, which he has accused
Rwandan and Ugandan government troops of masterminding.
	   ``I'm very happy that we are responding with indignation to this
aggression,'' Kabila said. ``From east to west, young men and women
are willing to fight for the country. This is a people's war.''
	   State-controlled television said Congolese troops had captured
the eastern Kivu city of Bukavu and a nearby airport not far from
the Rwandan border.
	   ``We have been told that Bukavu and the national airport of
Kavumu have been recaptured by valiant members of our Congolese
army,'' according to the announcement Tuesday morning on state
television.
	   Information Minister Didier Mumengi made no mention of the
reported gains in eastern Congo during a press conference to
discuss fighting in the west.
	   However, he said government troops had driven rebel forces from
the western town of Boma and were pushing toward the key oil port
of Muanda about 80 kilometers (50 miles) away on the Atlantic
coastline.
	   Boma is a strategic point from where the rebels would stage an
advance on Kinshasa to the north.
	   ``We are retaking our territory house by house and piece by
piece,'' Mumengi said.
	   There was no independent confirmation of the minister's comments
or the television report.
	   A senior military commander speaking on condition of anonymity
told The Associated Press that fighting was continuing in the
western region.
	   Tutsi insurgents, including many soldiers from Kabila's army,
revolted nine days ago and quickly captured the cities of Bukavu
and Goma in the far east. After an airlift to the western village
of Kitona they also captured nearby Muanda.
	   Mumengi, clad in camouflage fatiques and flanked by rifle-toting
guards, again accused Rwanda and Uganda of fighting alongside the
rebels.
	   ``A Ugandan plane arrived in Nebbi, which is close to Karobo,
with arms and ammunition,'' Mumengi said. Karobo is in Congo's far
northwest corner near Uganda's border while Nebbi is on the Ugandan
side.
	   Kabila, drumming up nationalist fervor in his capital, has vowed
to take the war to Rwanda. Both Uganda and Rwanda have denied
involvement, a claim echoed by the rebels.
	   A rebel spokesman in Goma said he was sure Kabila would be
driven from power.
	   ``Well, Kabila's going to leave whether he wants to or not, but
it would be better for him if he negotiated his departure at least
in an honorable way,'' rebel information officer Sylvan Biku told
Associated Press Television.
	   ``In Goma we have 19 battalions and in Bukavu we have 12
battalions. What would the Rwandans be doing here?'' Biku said. ``I
think our brigade has more soldiers than Rwanda.''
	   Rebel gunmen attacked the small village of Yumbi, just 40
kilometers (24 miles) south of Kinshasa, state-controlled
television reported on Monday.
	   The scale of the fighting was unclear, but rebel forces withdrew
after the fight, the broadcast said, quoting civilians from the
area.
	   Congo has moved to deploy additional troops to reinforce twin
offensives in the east and west of the country. Militia fighters
have been recruited by the government in the capital.
	   An Organization of African Unity delegation is in Kinshasa to
examine the latest conflict in Congo and search for a peaceful end
to the fighting.

Saudi prince appoints new editor for Asharq Al-Awsat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ New editors were appointed Tuesday to Asharq
Al-Awsat, one of the foremost newspapers in the Arab world, and its
sister magazine.
	   The new editor-in-chief for Asharq Al-Awsat will be Abdel Rahman
al-Rashid, a Saudi journalist and writer who was editor of the
weekly Al-Majallah, said the publisher, Prince Ahmed bin Salman bin
Abdel Aziz.
	   The prince, who is a nephew of Saudi Arabia's King Fahd, said
the new editor of Al-Majallah magazine will be Abdel Aziz
al-Khamis, another Saudi journalist who worked for the papers'
publishing company, Saudi Research and Marketing.
	   Al-Rashid and Al-Khamis take up their posts on September 15.
	   The outgoing editor of Asharq Al-Awsat, Othman al-Omeir, will
become a columnist for the newspaper, the prince said in a
statement.
	   Asharq Al-Awsat, which is edited in London and printed in major
Arab and European capitals, is one of two major Arabic dailies
owned by the Saudi royal family. The other newspaper is Al-Hayat,
which is owned by another of the king's nephews and is considered
The New York Times of the Middle East.
	   The prince did not say why he had reshuffled the editors, but
Arab journalists said he plans to orientate the publications'
editorials and news reports more toward Saudi Arabia.
	   Members of the Saudi royal family and other Saudi businessmen
own most of the major Arab satellite television channels.

Yemen executes convicted murderer in public square

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ A man convicted of murder and attempted
robbery was executed in a public square in northern Yemen, al-Ayam
newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   Saleh al-Hamed was executed Saturday by firing squad in the main
square in the city of Marib, 170 kilometers (105 miles) northeast
of the capital, San`a, the paper said.
	   Al-Hamed shot two men during an attempted robbery last year, the
paper said. It did not name the victims.
	   The execution was attended by a large crowd including the
victims' families.
	   Yemen, an impoverished country at the tip of the Arabian
Peninsula, applies the death penalty for rape and murder. Most
executions are carried out in public to set an example.

Newspaper denies hard evidence of sex slaves in attack on U.N.
</HEADLINE>
report &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Japanese newspaper on Tuesday condemned a United
Nations report on the sexual enslavement of Asian women by the
Japanese military during World War II, saying there was no
conclusive proof that the women were forced into prostitution.
	   The conservative, mass-circulation Yomiuri Shimbun said in an
editorial that the report, which urges Japan to compensate former
sex slaves, was unfair ``not least because it has not yet even been
confirmed that the wartime government forced the comfort women to
provide sexual services.''
	   The newspaper also condemned the report's use of the terms
``rape camp'' and ``rape center'' to describe the brothels, which
were set up by the Japanese military in its invasion of Asian
countries in the 1930s and `40s.
	   The U.N. Subcommittee on Prevention of Discrimination and
Protection of Minorities released its report urging compensation
for the former sex slaves last week.
	   The Yomiuri, Japan's best-selling newspaper, said it was
unreasonable to single out Japan ``as the source of all evil'' when
other nations have also committed war crimes.
	   The paper said the United States had set up ``Recreation and
Amusement Facilities'' that were prostitution centers for Allied
forces during its occupation of Japan after the end of World War
II.
	   Historians say as many as 200,000 Asian women, euphemistically
referred to as ``comfort women,'' were abducted for the brothels
and repeatedly raped by soldiers.
	   Japan has paid some assistance to former sex slaves through a
privately funded body. Many women have refused to accept payments
from the fund, saying it allows Japan to avoid taking full
responsibility for its wartime actions.

Disagreement blocks border festival between two Koreas
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Civic groups blamed both the South and
North Korean governments Tuesday for scuttling what would have been
the first border festival on the divided Korean Peninsula.
	   Civic organizations from both countries had hoped to celebrate
this year's Korean Independence Day, which falls on Saturday,
together at the truce village of Panmunjom inside the 4-kilometer
(2.5-mile)-wide Demilitarized Zone separating the two Koreas.
	   But the plan has been stymied by disagreement between the two
Koreas over whether South Korean student activists should join the
festival.
	   Seoul said it would permit all political parties and civic
groups to join, except the outlawed student group Hanchongryon. It
feared the leftist students might play into the North's anti-Seoul
propaganda.
	   Without Hanchongryon's participation, North Korea said, the
proposed Grand Reunification Festival would be ``meaningless.''
	   ``The South invited serious trouble by excluding Hanchongryon
and thus provoking the North,'' said a joint statement issued by
670 South Korean civic groups. ``North Korea too showed an
unreasonable attitude toward the issue.''
	   The civic groups said they have abandoned plans for the joint
border festival.
	   The Aug. 15 anniversary of Korea's liberation from 36 years of
Japanese colonial rule in 1945 is one of the few holidays both
Koreas celebrate.
	   Hanchongryon supports some of North Korea's key demands,
including the withdrawal of 36,000 U.S. troops from the South and
the abolition of the South's anti-espionage national security law.
	   The Korean Peninsula was a colony of Japan in 1910-45. Soon
after the liberation, the peninsula was divided into communist
North Korea and capitalist South Korea.
	   The two Koreas fought a devastating, three-year war that ended
without a peace treaty in 1953 and mutual distrust remains deep.
Their border is the world's most heavily guarded, with 2 million
men on both sides.

Libyan rebels report killing dozens of security force members
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libyan insurgents have killed or wounded
dozens of security force members in recent attacks, a leading
Arabic-language newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   Most of the clashes occurred in or near Benghazi, Libya's
second-largest city and the site of repeated clashes between
security forces and Muslim fundamentalists seeking to overthrow
Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi, the newspaper Al-Hayat quoted
the Islamic Martyrs Movement as saying.
	   The mountains around Benghazi are believed to be a stronghold of
the Martyrs Movement, which claimed responsibility for several
attacks in the area in 1996.
	   In the first attack on July 8, five security agents and four
insurgents were killed in Baninah, 17 kilometers (11 miles) east of
Benghazi, Al-Hayat said. The statement gave the names of the slain
security personnel.
	   The statement also said that a security force member and two
militants were killed in subsequent clashes in Benghazi.
	   In a fourth clash, three insurgents and about 20 security troops
were killed or wounded in Missah, about 160 kilometers (100 miles)
east of Benghazi, Al-Hayat said. Among the slain was the deputy
commander of the insurgents' unit.
	   A Western diplomat in the Libyan capital of Tripoli told The
Associated Press in Cairo that she had received reports of last
month's attacks, but could not confirm them.
	   In Italy _ the former colonial power and a nation with close
contacts with Libya _ the Foreign Ministry said it knew nothing of
the reported attacks.
	   Libya routinely dismisses such reports, saying either that such
clashes did not take place or that they involved common criminals
rather than dissidents.
	   Gadhafi has not permitted any opposition since seizing power in
1969. Some of his policies, such as the use of female bodyguards,
are resented by conservative Muslims.

2,030 minor incidents recorded at German nuclear plants since 1988
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's 19 atomic power plants logged
2,030 minor problems over the past 10 years, but none involved any
radiation leaks outside the plant, the federal environment ministry
reported Tuesday.
	   All but one of the disturbances were listed as Level 1 _ the
lowest possible on a scale of one to seven, Environment Minister
Angela Merkel said in the report presented to the Cabinet.
	   An incident June 6 at the Unterweser power plant was logged at
Level 2.
	   State officials in Lower Saxony said then a leak in a turbine's
oil system set off the problem. Pressure then built up in the
plant's steam generator because a vent had been wrongly shut and
the key misplaced.
	   Merkel said Germany's nuclear power plants are being constantly
modernized and revamped with the latest technology ``so that in
Germany there's practically no old atomic power plants.''
	   The number of incidents has declined to no more than six a year
since 1994, she added.
	   Based on that, she said there was no safety reason that
justifies demands by the opposition Social Democrats and Greens for
a total withdrawal from nuclear energy.

Israel agrees to join talks on nuclear materials ban treaty
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 8 grafs to UPDATE with more Netanyahu quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel has agreed to join talks on a treaty
banning the production of material used to make nuclear weapons,
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Tuesday.
	   However Netanyahu said Israel had ``fundamental problems'' with
the proposed treaty, which would ban the manufacture of highly
enriched uranium and plutonium.
	   Israel had been the only member of the 61-nation United Nations
Conference on Disarmament that had not agreed to join negotiations
on the proposed treaty.
	   U.S. President Clinton asked Israel not to oppose the
establishment of the committee, Netanyahu told his Cabinet.
	   As a result, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations in
Geneva, Yosef Lamdan, has been authorized to join the working group
that will discuss the treaty and ``the problems of inspection that
it raises,'' said Aviv Bushinsky, Netanyahu's spokesman.
	   Netanyahu told the Cabinet, however, that joining the talks
``does not imply adoption of a position on the agreement or its
contents,'' according to a statement from the prime minister's
office.
	   Netanyahu said he told the United States that Israel has
``considerations of our own which are particular to our situation
in the region.''
	   ``In light of this, we will need clarifications from the U.S.,''
Netanyahu said.
	   Israel opposes international inspection of its nuclear
facilities, said lawmaker Yossi Sarid, a member of the key
parliamentary subcommittee on the secret services.
	   Israel is widely believed to have several hundred nuclear
weapons but has never admitted to having the bomb. Its deterrent
posture has been based on what it calls ``purposeful ambiguity,''
in which a potential enemy could not be certain if Israel possessed
nuclear weapons or not.
	   Lawmaker Ephraim Sneh, a retired general, said Monday it would
be a ``terrible mistake'' for Israel to give up this ``ambiguity''
in the light of the growing potential nuclear threat from Iran.
	   Iran recently tested a missile capable of reaching Israel and is
widely believed to be trying to achieve a nuclear capability.
Iran's Islamic regime has repeatedly called for Israel's
destruction.
	   Israel became the lone holdout to talks on a nuclear materials
``cut off treaty'' after India and Pakistan _ under international
pressure following their test explosions earlier this year _ both
said they are ready to engage in negotiations.

Hundreds of Indonesian troops to leave Aceh by early September
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with withdrawal of combat troops from Irian Jaya,
grafs 13-14; single name for Bachtiar correct, graf 8 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The Indonesian military said Tuesday
it will withdraw hundreds of combat troops from the troubled
northern province of Aceh by early September as two fact-finding
teams collect evidence of alleged atrocities by soldiers.
	   Local military spokesman Lt. Col. Agus Ramadhan said eight
companies, with a total of between 800 and 1,200 troops, would be
withdrawn along with 80 special forces soldiers by Sept. 8.
	   Ramadhan said local and foreign journalists would be invited to
witness the pullout.
	   Last week, Indonesian military commander Gen. Wiranto traveled
to Aceh, on the northern tip of Sumatra Island about 1,750
kilometers (1,100 miles) northwest of Jakarta, to announce the
troop cutback.
	   Large numbers of troops have operated in Aceh for the past
decade to put down secessionists, who have called for the
declaration of an independent Islamic state.
	   Human rights group accuse the military of widespread abuses,
including the arbitrary killing, torture and rape of civilians.
	   Recently, villagers in several remote parts of the province have
said that opponents of the military were executed and buried in
mass graves.
	   Bachtiar, a provincial government official, said Aceh's governor
has formed a 29-member fact-finding team to investigate allegations
of atrocities and to dig up alleged mass grave sites.
	   Additionally, a team from the National Human Rights Commission
was to visit Aceh this week.
	   In Jakarta, the Muslim-oriented United Development Party called
Tuesday for a full state investigation into human rights abuses and
the immediate release of all political detainees and prisoners in
Aceh.
	   The party said the abuses ``have happened for about eight years
without a single effort or stern measure by the leadership and
institution of the military to stop it.''
	   It demanded that those responsible for abuses be put on trial.
	   On Monday, in Irian Jaya at the eastern end of the country, the
military pulled out 270 combat troops from the remote town of
Timika, a center for giant American copper and gold mining company
PT Freeport.
	   Aceh and the former Dutch colony of Irian Jaya are among three
Indonesian provinces where rebel bands have been fighting for
independent states.
	   The other is the former Portuguese colony of East Timor, 2,000
kilometers (1,200 miles) east of Jakarta.
	   Earlier this month, Indonesia withdrew 1,300 combat troops from
East Timor.
	   East Timor has endured civil unrest, guerrilla warfare and human
rights abuses since Indonesia invaded in 1975 and annexed the
territory as its 27th province the following year.
	   The United Nations is currently brokering peace talks on East
Timor's future with Indonesia and Portugal.
	   Changes in the military's attitude toward Indonesia's
troublesome provinces have been made in the wake of the resignation
of longtime ruler Suharto.
	   His successor, President B.J. Habibie, has promised greater
political freedom and respect for human rights.

Serbian Warlord's team faces uphill battle against Bayern
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DUSAN STOJANOVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian warlord Zeljko
Raznatovic-Arkan is not used to losing battles, not even on the
soccer field.
	   But his tiny soccer team may be heading for a major loss when it
meets mighty Bayern Munich in the Champions Cup on Wednesday in
Germany.
	   ``We'll beat Bayern in the middle of Munich,'' Arkan said after
his Obilic Belgrade won the Cup's first qualifying stage by beating
Vestmannaeyja of Iceland 4-1 on aggregate in July.
	   But his optimism faded after Obilic only managed a 0-0 tie
against newly promoted Milicionar (the Policeman) in the opening
round of Yugoslavia's weak premiership Friday.
	   During the match, Arkan lost four of his key players because of
injuries. Captain Zivojin Juskic, midfielder Nenad Grozdic,
defender Kuzman Babeu and main striker Zoran Rankovic are reported
to be out of the match against the Germans.
	   ``The remaining players will have to put their helmets on, and
fight pitched battles on the soccer field if they want to survive
against the mighty Germans,'' Juskic jokingly said before Arkan
imposed a ban on statements to the media.
	   The autocratic Arkan, whose ``Tiger'' paramilitary troops spread
tremendous fear among non-Serbs during Croatian and Bosnian wars,
swiftly sacked his coach after the tie and banned all Obilic
players from giving statements ahead of the game against Bayern.
	   Arkan _ who is wanted by several European countries for armed
robberies and other crimes _ didn't travel to Germany with his
team. Because of the international arrest warrant, he also skipped
the match in Iceland, and a team official had to broadcast the
whole game to him live by cellular telephone.
	   Arkan took over minor league Obilic three years ago. Pumping
money _ his critics say from smuggling and other criminal deals _
into the Belgrade club, he led it to the title last season.
	   Now, Arkan jumps up and down from the bench, shouts at referees,
his and opponents' players during domestic games. Several
well-dressed, black clad, freshly shaven Obilic ``supporters'' _ a
trademark of his paramilitary ``Tiger'' troops _ chant threatening
messages to the opposition. Some draw guns and point at the
players.
	   Arkan's players earn more than 6,000 German marks a month, a
40-time average Serbian salary. He plans to build a covered stadium
for up to 15,000 fans, even though Serb media say Obilic has no
more than 1,000 fans.
	   When Obilic _ named after a Serb hero who defied Turkish rule in
the 14th century _ qualified for the European competition, Arkan
named his wife Ceca, a famous Serbian folk singer, the club's
president and she travels with the team.
	   Arkan, believed to be working on instructions from Serbian
secret police, was once the leader of Red Star's fans who clashed
with the Croatian fans of Dinamo Zagreb on the eve of the Yugoslav
war in 1991. The clashes heralded the start of the war, and Arkan
recruited many of the Red Star fans for his troops.
	   Several German civic groups have urged Bayern not to play the
match against Obilic, and have called for the Serbian team to be
banned from Germany because of Arkan's notorious reputation. But
Bayern ignored the calls, saying Obilic was allowed to play
international matches by the European soccer body, UEFA.

Malaysia and Laos to trade in local currencies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia and Laos agreed Tuesday
to trade in their own currencies to reduce dependence on the U.S.
dollar.
	   ``Malaysia informed Laos of the use of regional currencies as a
new mechanism in trade, and it agreed to this,'' Foreign Minister
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi told reporters while briefing them on talks
between Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and the visiting
Laotian premier, Sisavath Keobounphanh.
	   Malaysia has been urging fellow members in the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations to promote use of regional currencies among
trade partners. Many ASEAN countries, hard-hit by the regional
economic downturn, have faced currency depreciations of between 40
and 80 percent against the dollar over the past year.
	   Thailand and the Philippines have already signed agreements to
implement the plan, and the Malaysian central bank has been
directed to open a regional currency clearing house.
	   The International Monetary Fund has estimated that Laos'
economic growth for 1998 would drop to 6 percent from 7.2 percent
last year, the Laotian leader was quoted as saying at a luncheon
given by the National Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
	   V.K.K. Teagarajan, the chamber's vice president, said Malaysia's
private sector planned to increase investment in Laos, a landlocked
country in the center of the Indochinese Peninsula.
	   He said relations would be enhanced by agreements signed by
representatives of the two countries on trade and tourism, the
government news agency Bernama reported.
	   Malaysia is the fifth largest investor in Laos, with projects
ranging from infrastructure to banking and tourism, Teagarajan
said.
	   Meanwhile, Malaysia's foreign minister said Mahathir offered to
continue Malaysia's help in developing Laos' rural economy.
	   Trade between the two countries totaled 6.5 million ringgit
(dlrs 1.52 million) last year, with Malaysia's imports of Laotian
goods making up 6.2 million ringgit (dlrs 1.46 million) of that.
	   ASEAN comprises Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

Russia prepared to fortify CIS borders with Afghanistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia is ready to fortify the southern borders of
former Soviet republics in Central Asia to guard against any
spillover of the turmoil in neighboring Afghanistan, the Foreign
Ministry said Tuesday.
	   The northbound advance of the fundamentalist Taliban movement
poses ``a real threat'' to the coalition of former Soviet
republics, the Commonwealth of Independent States, Foreign Ministry
spokesman Valery Nesterushkin said.
	   Afghanistan borders three former Soviet republics: Tajikistan,
Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.
	   Russia fears the entrenchment of a radical Islamic state in
Afghanistan would bring an influx of refugees and weapons into the
former Soviet republics of Central Asia.
	   The worries flared up following the Taliban's weekend capture of
the biggest city in northern Afghanistan, Mazar-e-Sharif, which is
just 60 kilometers (37 miles) from the Tajik border.
	   Afghanistan's anti-Taliban coalition also claims control over
the city, but the reports could not be independently confirmed.
	   The 25,000 Russian troops stationed in Tajikistan are already
helping government forces fortify the border, and similar steps are
expected in the two other republics.
	   Russia, ``along with other CIS members, reserves the right to
take all the required measures, including those in line with
international commitments,'' Nesterushkin was quoted as saying by
the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   A Russian border troops commander, Nikolai Reznichenko, said
that Russia is ready to send more troops to Tajikistan if the
situation gets worse, the daily Izvestia reported Tuesday.
	   Tajik officials have said that in some areas the Taliban have
advanced to within 20 to 40 kilometers (12 to 25 miles) of the
Tajik border.

Johnson aims for 10-year record
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Ten years ago, Butch Reynolds broke
the world record in the 400 meters in Zurich. No one has matched
his time of 43.89 seconds since.
	   Michael Johnson will have another shot at the record Wednesday
on the same track at the Weltklasse Golden League meet, the world's
premier one-day track and field competition.
	   Johnson won gold medals in the 200 and 400 meters at the 1996
Atlanta Olympics, shattering the 200 record in the process. The 400
record remains the one missing achievement in his brilliant career.
	   Ranked among the greatest track athletes of all time, Johnson,
who has lost just two 400 races in the last decade, is rounding
into top form after a slow start to the season caused by nagging
injuries.
	   After a shocking third-place finish in Oslo last month, Johnson
quickly re-established himself by winning his next race in Rome and
taking gold at the Goodwill Games in 43.76 seconds. He also ran the
anchor leg as the U.S. team set a world record of 2:54.20 in the
1,600-meter relay at the Goodwill Games.
	   The Weltklasse, with a budget of 5.5 million Swiss francs (dlrs
3.68 million), traditionally attracts the top-flight competitors
from every discipline.
	   Zurich has a fast track, a prime slot in the season's schedule
and dlrs 50,000 bonuses for world records. Last year, the event
produced three world records.
	   Ethiopia's Haile Gebrselassie and Morocco's Hicham El-Guerrouj
will continue their assault on the record books at the Swiss
banking capital.
	   Gebrselassie, already having bettered the 5,000 and 10,000 world
records this season, will once again attempt to add the 3,000 mark
to his collection. The diminutive Ethiopian can expect to be pushed
all the way by Kenya's Paul Tergat, the Olympic and world
championship silver medalist over 10,000.
	   The 1,500 will see El-Guerrouj try to lower the world record of
3:26.00 he set earlier this season at the Golden Gala in Rome. El
Guerrouj will be pursued by a group of Kenyans led by Laban Rotich,
who has the best time behind the Moroccan this season, clocking
3:30.06 in Monte Carlo on Saturday.
	   American sprint sensation Marion Jones, unbeaten in the women's
100 this year, will attempt to improve on her personal best of
10.71, and inch closer to Florence Griffith-Joyner's record of
10.49.
	   Jones, who has run under 11 seconds 11 times this season, will
also compete in the long jump.
	   The men's 100 was expected to be one of the main attractions but
it lost some of its lustre when world champion Maurice Greene of
the United States and Trinidad's Ato Boldon, the fastest man this
season twice clocking 9.86, pulled out over a money dispute with
organizers.
	   The race is now set to come down to a duel between Canada's
resurgent Olympic champion and world record-holder Donovan Bailey
and Namibia's Frankie Fredericks, who has run more sub-10-seconds
100 races than any other sprinter in history.
	   The evening's best chance at a world record is likely to come in
the 3,000 steeplechase, with current holder Bernard Barmasai of
Kenya battling compatriots and former record holders Moses
Kiptanui, Wilson Boit Kipketer and Olympic champion Joseph Keter.
	   Only five athletes remain in the chase for the dlrs 1 million
Golden League jackpot, shared by athletes who remain unbeaten in
their events in the six Golden League meets and the Grand Prix
final in Moscow on September 5. They are El-Guerrouj in the 1,500,
Gebrselassie in the 3,000/5,000, American Bryan Bronson in the 400
hurdles, Jones in the 100 and Nigeria's Charity Opara in the 400.

Kosovo Albanian rebels vow to fight on

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Despite a recent string of losses
against Serb government forces, secessionist Kosovo Albanian rebels
vowed Tuesday to fight on until final victory.
	   Albanian sources reported fighting Tuesday in the Decani region
near the border with Albania. They claimed that a huge column of
110 Yugoslav Army vehicles, including 36 tanks, was seen heading
for the embattled region.
	   In the Albanian capital Tirana, the government said Tuesday that
70 people had fled across the border from Kosovo within the last 24
hours, including two badly wounded guerrillas.
	   Independent media in Belgrade also reported the Kosovo
Liberation Army had regained control of the central village of
Likovac, the rebel headquarters which Serb forces overran last
week. The reports could not be confirmed.
	   In a statement distributed to ethnic Albanian media, the KLA
said the latest Serb offensive ``has only strengthened our resolve
to bravely continue on the road to freedom.''
	   The statement called on Kosovo Albanians, who represent 90
percent of the Serbian province's 2 million people, to ``unite with
the KLA and help us in our just freedom fight.''
	   It also warned NATO not to deploy its troops on the
Albanian-Serbian border _ the main route of arms supply for the KLA
_ ``because we would consider this the second offensive against our
freedom and our national pride.''
	   Despite the war rhetoric, one of the top KLA officials told
local Albanian Koha Ditore daily that the militants might join an
all-Albanian negotiating team in peace negotiations with the
Serbian government.
	   Diplomatic efforts to return ethnic Albanian and Serb leaders to
the negotiating table are inching forward, despite sporadic clashes
in Kosovo province.
	   While U.S. envoy Christopher Hill met with Serb and ethnic
Albanian leaders in Pristina Monday, clashes were reported
elsewhere in the Yugoslav province, particularly in areas still
held by the rebels.
	   Hill has been mediating between pacifist ethnic Albanian leader
Ibrahim Rugova and leading politician Mehmet Hajrizi, who has close
contacts with the secessionist ethnic Albanian rebels, in hopes of
getting the Albanians to rally behind one leader.
	   Hill also met Monday with Yugoslav Vice Premier Nikola Sainovic.
	   For five months, Serb troops have been fighting the KLA, which
seeks independence from Serbia, the dominant republic of
Yugoslavia.
	   But the Albanians remain largely divided between those loyal to
Rugova, and those who support the militants.
	   ``In principle, in its meeting with Hill (earlier this month)
the KLA has agreed to form ... a coalition (Kosovo Albanian)
government,'' rebel spokesman Shaban Sala told Koha Ditore.
	   But Rugova, in his answers to questions on the Internet, said it
was hard to get in touch with the KLA leaders ``because the latest
Serb offensive has isolated them. Their stands will certainly be
heard in our future coalition.''
	   The independent Belgrade-based Beta news agency said that 14
Serb policemen have been killed since their latest offensive
against the rebels started on July 20. It added that 217 ethnic
Albanians are known to have died in the same period.
	   On Tuesday, the Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center said
about 15,000 refugees were trapped in the Decani ``because of an
iron circle'' formed by Serb forces. The bodies of five killed
ethnic Albanians were brought overnight to the nearby Djakovica
morgue, the report added.
	   The government-run Media Center said one more Serb policeman, in
addition to four killed since Sunday, was shot dead late Monday in
fighting near Djakovica.

Shopping center fire kills Asian laborer in Bahrain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ An Asian worker was killed and another
injured in an overnight fire that gutted a shopping center,
officials said Tuesday.
	   Zafarullah Zainul-Abedeen Dewan, a Bangladeshi, died of smoke
inhalation after the fire broke out below his apartment in Naqi
Center in downtown Manama, officials said.
	   Another Bangladeshi, Pannalal Chanda, was admitted to hospital
after jumping to safety from an upstairs apartment in the center.
	   Thick clouds of smoke could still be seen pouring from the
two-story building on Tuesday morning. It took fire fighters
several hours to extinguish the blaze, which began about 9:30 p.m.
(1830 GMT) on Monday night.
	   Witnesses said they heard a series of blasts after the blaze
started in the shopping center, which houses several electronic and
clothing stores.
	   Government officials said the cause of the fire was being
investigated.
	   Numerous arson attacks have occurred in Manama, particularly in
the area of the shopping center. The authorities have blamed Shiite
Muslim activists campaigning for political and social reform.
	   Last month, about 50 anti-government Shiite activists rioted in
the downtown area, hurling stones and starting fires.
	   More than 40 people have died since the campaign began in 1994.
Many of the victims have been Asian workers. Activists have accused
the Asians of taking away jobs from local workers and of being
police informers.
	   Some 17,000 Bangladeshis _ mostly laborers _ work in Bahrain.
	   Shiites form a slight majority of Bahrain's 400,000 citizens,
but the Gulf state is ruled by the Al Khalifa family, which belongs
to the mainstream Sunni sect of Islam.

Lemerre announces French squad for friendly against Austria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France's new soccer coach Roger Lemerre on Tuesday
announced an 18-man squad for a friendly match against Austria, his
first since taking over from World Cup-winning coach Aime Jacquet.
	   The squad features six players based in Italy, one each in
Spain, Germany and England, as well as nine France-based players.
	   Lemerre called up 12 members of the World Cup-winning squad, as
well as four who missed out on the tournament, and two uncapped
players, Frederic Dehu and Tony Vairelles from French champion
Lens.
	   France plays Austria in Vienna on Aug. 19, its first match since
beating Brazil 3-0 to win the World Cup on July 12 for the first
time in the country's history.
	   France then travels to Iceland for a Sept. 5 European
Championship qualifier.
	   Lemerre, Jacquet's number two during the World Cup campaign,
kept the backbone of his predecessor's squad.
	   He was unable to pick defenders Laurent Blanc or Marcel
Desailly, both serving suspensions after receiving red cards at the
World Cup.
	   Lemerre did not pick Arsenal midfield duo Emmanuel Petit and
Patrick Vieira, both set to play a Premier League match the night
of Aug. 17.
	   Lemerre has a two-year contract that takes him through the
European Championships in the year 2000.
	   He played for France six times between 1968 and 1971, before
embarking on an unspectacular coaching career at Red Star, Lens,
Paris FC, Strasbourg and the Tunisian youth team.
	   His main achievement at club level was guiding Lens to promotion
to the first division in 1979.
	   Before joining Jacquet, Lemerre coached the French Army soccer
team for more than a decade, and in 1995 won the World Military
title.
	   The squad:
	   Goalkeepers: Fabien Barthez (Monaco), Lionel Letizi (Metz)
	   Defenders: Vincent Candela (AS Roma), Alain Goma (Paris-Saint
Germain), Christian Karembeu (Real Madrid), Franck Leboeuf
(Chelsea), Bixente Lizarazu (Bayern Munich), Lilian Thuram (Parma).
	   Midfielders: Alain Boghossian (Parma), Frederic Dehu (Lens),
Didier Deschamps (Juventus), Youri Djorkaeff (Inter Milan),
Zinedine Zidane (Juventus).
	   Strikers: Thierry Henry (Monaco), Lilian Laslandes (Bordeaux),
Florian Maurice (Marseille), Robert Pires (Marseille), Tony
Vairelles (Lens).

Activists urge Southeast Asian leaders to pressure Myanmar

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Despite that nation's dismal
record of human rights violations, the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations voted last year to admit military-ruled Myanmar into
the regional group.
	   Now the regime has detained 18 foreign human rights activists
for passing out anti-government leaflets, and Malaysian activists
demanded Tuesday that Southeast Asian governments take action
against their ally.
	   ``The present regime ... has violated human rights of all shapes
and types,'' Syed Husin Ali, leader of the opposition Malaysian
People's Party, told a news conference attended by a half-dozen
human rights activists.
	   ``Despite all that, they were admitted into ASEAN. Now we urge
the Malaysian government and the ASEAN secretariat to take
immediate action so all the people will be released,'' he said.
	   Malaysia's opposition leader in Parliament, Lim Kit Siang, also
called on ASEAN Secretary-General Rodolfo Severino to publicly
condemn those arrests.
	   ``Rodolfo Severino should fly to (Yangon) to demand the
immediate and unconditional release of the 11 Southeast Asian
nationals arrested by the Burmese military junta,'' he said.
	   Those apprehended Sunday by Myanmar, also known as Burma, for
handing out leaflets the government said were aimed at inciting
unrest remained in the custody of the military regime Tuesday,
their fate undecided.
	   The leafleting operation came a day after Myanmar's own people
staged no demonstrations or protests to mark Saturday's anniversary
of Aug. 8, 1988, when simmering discontent against the military
rule erupted into a nationwide uprising.
	   The Southeast Asian activists arrested are three Malaysians,
three Indonesians, three Thais and two Philippine citizens. Six
Americans and an Australian from groups opposed to the military
regime were also detained.
	   Malaysian activists at the news conference said six were
detained at the airport. The rest were arrested while they were
handing out small red-and-yellow cards to passers-by in downtown
Yangon Sunday.
	   ``We are your friends from around the world,'' said the cards
printed in Burmese and English.
	   ``We have not forgotten you. We support your hopes for human
rights and democracy. 8888 - Don't Forget - Don't Give Up,'' the
pamphlet said, alluding to the fateful day in August 1988.
	   Sivarasa Rasiah, a spokesman for the Malaysian human rights
group SUARAM, said the nine-member Association of Southeast Asian
Nations has failed to exert economic and political pressure on
Myanmar through ``constructive engagement.''
	   He called for more open pressure on Myanmar's government to
begin a dialogue with opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi and her
National League for Democracy, landslide winner of parliament
elections in 1990.
	   The military never allowed the parliament to meet.
	   ``Unless there's swift intervention by Malaysia, which is close
to the Myanmar government, these people may be tried and charged,''
said Elizabeth Wong, a SUARAM activist. ``The Malaysian government
should take a firm stand today.''
	   ASEAN comprises Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Trading in Russian stocks was suspended Tuesday
for at least 30 minutes due to sharp losses on the country's main
exchange, the Russian Trading System.
	   A spokesperson for the exchange said trading would be suspended
until at least 4:30 p.m. (1230 GMT), after which officials would
consider re-opening trade.
	   At 4 p.m. (1200 GMT), the stock market's main index had fallen
11.8 percent to 106.61 from 120.91 on Monday. Since the open of
trading, the index had fallen 7.57 percent, slightly above the
daily allowed limit of 7.5 percent.
	   Russian stocks and bonds have plummeted in the past two
sessions, amid widespread flight from emerging markets. Investors
fear that Russian markets especially are too feeble to withstand
another onslaught of such selling.
	   The ruble was a bit weaker, but traders said it was mainly
supported by the heavy intervention of the Russian central bank,
which last week reported sharply lower foreign exchange reserves.
	   The stock market's slide has continued despite a dlrs 300
million installment of a newly approved World Bank loan that Russia
received on Monday, part of a dlrs 22.6 international bailout
package.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ After visiting 20 hospitals and making
daily rounds of mortuaries, Joseph Kaimburi's worst fears were
finally confirmed: One of the bodies crowded on a slab in the
stench-filled city morgue was his beloved older brother.
	   They were supposed to meet at Nairobi Hospital at 11 a.m. Friday
to visit a friend. But David Kaimburi, a 40-year-old businesman
with a wife and three children, never arrived. He had gone to the
American Embassy to pick up visa forms for a visit to America, his
37-year-old brother said.
	   A bomb exploded in the embassy's rear parking lot at 10:35 a.m.
About the same time, a bomb exploded at the U.S. Embassy in
Tanzania. Nearly 5,000 people were injured and more than 200 killed
in the two attacks.
	   For three days, Kaimburi had hoped he would find his brother in
a hospital bed. He had even gone to hospitals outside Nairobi in
his desperate search.
	   As he stood by the slab _ which normally holds one body but now
held two because of the overwhelming number of casualties from the
bombing _ he struggled with his emotions.
	   And as he spoke, he kept looking at his brother, still wearing
green pants, a striped shirt and jacket. His head was battered, but
his face was still recognizable. A metal identification tag, number
3799, hung from his ankle.
	   ``It's very torturing,'' he said quietly.
	   His brother was at the embassy by chance, an innocent victim of
terrorist bombers.
	   ``It's unfortunate that the bombing is coming in an African
country where we are very peaceful, where we have no problems,''
Kaimburi said. ``We have never had any problems with America. ...
The relationship is very good. They are supportive. ... This is a
very unfortunate incident.''
	   While Kaimburi was speaking, dozens of Kenyans walked through
the morgue looking for husbands and wives, brothers, sisters,
parents, children and friends. Some bodies were relatively intact,
some badly burned, some partially or totally decapitated, some
already decomposing.
	   It was a gruesome scene, yet there was almost complete silence _
except for the hysterical wailing of a woman outside.
	   Mary Otieno, 23, had just identified the body of her husband,
Elias Otieno, 30, a clerk at the Ufundi Cooperative building
adjacent to the embassy, which collapsed in the explosion.
	   Overcome with grief, she collapsed near a bench outside, sobbing
uncontrollably.
	   ``I don't understand how people can be so inhuman,'' said
Francesca Atieno, 34, a cousin of the dead man, explaining that he
left three young children, the youngest just 1 month old.
	   ``Maybe the world is too lenient with them. Maybe that's why
they get away with it,'' said Atieno, who has a public relations
business. ``The world has a population of over 4 billion. The
terrorists are just a pocket in the 4 billion. If we all say `no'
to it, it will stop.''
	   At another slab in the mortuary, Maurice O. Orato, 38, had just
identified his wife, Margaret Akinyi, 34, who was an accountant at
the Ufundi Cooperative and the mother of four children ages 3 to
13.
	   ``Since the bombing, I've been to every hospital. I've come to
this mortuary several times but didn't find her. Today, we called
the hot line, and they told us to come here,'' Orato said.
	   Tears welling in his eyes, he said he had identified his wife by
the clothes she wore when she went to work, her shoes and a
necklace.
	   ``I'm an unhappy man because I'm left with no wife,'' said
Orato, who works for the post office. ``It's a very difficult life
now for me and the family. The children are all crying. I have no
peace now. They're asking where their mother is.''
	   He said he didn't know what could be done about the terrorists.
	   For Charles Kamuti, 31, the visit to the morgue was another
exercise in frustration.
	   His younger brother, Lawrence Gitau Kamuti, 29, an assistant
pharmacist in the badly damaged 22-story Cooperative Bank of Kenya
building near the embassy, was still missing. He has a wife and two
children, the youngest just 2 months old.
	   ``I came here in the morning and evening. On Sunday we were here
again. And today we came _ but so far nothing,'' Kamuti said.
	   He complained that relatives still looking for loved ones
weren't getting any help from police or the government.
	   Lists have been posted at hospitals, and at Uhuru Park in the
center of Nairobi, but they are not complete. Medical facilities in
this poor East African country have been overwhelmed.

Grounding of domestic airline will jeopardize expansion plans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ The decision by Taiwan's aviation
authority to ground a domestic airline will affect its plans for a
stock exchange listing, the airline said Tuesday.
	   Citing landing and mechanical problems, the Civil Aeronautics
Administration on Monday grounded UNI airlines' three Dornier 228
planes after one skidded off the runway on Matsu Island on Sunday.
No injuries were reported.
	   UNI airlines, a subsidiary of EVA Air, told Dow Jones Newswires
on Tuesday that the grounding will ``more or less affect'' the
company's plans for a stock exchange listing.
	   The airline did not indicate when it intends to go public.
	   The Civil Aeronautics Administration also grounded three Dornier
planes owned by Formosa Airlines for a brief period Monday for
safety inspections.
	   Formosa Airlines is partially owned by Taiwan's flag carrier,
China Airlines, which itself has come under increasing scrutiny
after one of its Airbus planes crashed on Feb. 16, killing all 202
people on board.
	   That crash was Taiwan's worst aviation disaster.

Kids get school break as Switzerland swelters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Schoolchildren in Switzerland's second
city were released from classes Tuesday as the country sweated
through its hottest weather for three years.
	   Early-morning temperatures over 21 degrees Celsius (69.8
Fahrenheit) and high humidity levels triggered a local law allowing
local education authorities to call a ``heat vacation.''
	   The children narrowly missed out on a free afternoon Monday,
when temperatures in Switzerland climbed as high as 34.9 Celsius
(94.8 Fahrenheit).
	   In nearby Biel, 17 Belgian schoolchildren and two adults
accompanying them were recovering in hospital from heat exhaustion
Tuesday after being evacuated from an overheated train.
	   The group of 235 under-14s was returning from a camping vacation
in the Swiss Alps, and the rest of the group was able to continue
its journey Monday night.
	   Meanwhile, authorities in the alpine resort of Zermatt reported
that more than 400 tourists daily are escaping the heat by skiing
or snowboarding on glaciers over 3,000 meters (9,850 feet) above
sea level.
	   The heat wave is expected to continue through this week,
although storms are forecast for Thursday.

Deputy prime minister dismisses talk of challenging leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Deputy Prime Minister Anwar
Ibrahim said Tuesday he would not challenge Malaysia's prime
minister in the next party elections in 1999, a news report said.
	   Speculation has been rife about Anwar's role in the government
after a series of policy conflicts with Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad, who is president of the ruling United Malays National
Organization party.
	   ``Talk that there will be a contest for the UMNO presidency next
year is baseless and does not make sense at all,'' said Anwar, who
is UMNO vice president. He spoke in his northern home state of
Penang at a party gathering, before Mahathir addressed the crowd.
	   Anwar said all party divisions in Penang would nominate Mahathir
to retain his top post, and that speculation about a contest
between the two was the work of ill-intentioned people out to pit
Mahathir against him.
	   ``I'm together with all others in pursuing the party's struggle
and I'm indebted to Dr. Mahathir,'' Anwar said. ``And I want to
show my loyalty to Dr. Mahathir.''
	   He added, ``Mahathir is a seasoned leader. ... If I compare
myself with him, I'm just a student. I'm aware I can't go against
teachers, what's more against a father.''
	   Mahathir recently appointed Daim Zainuddin, a longtime
confidant, to the Cabinet as special economics minister. The move
was widely interpreted as a political shove to Anwar, who is also
finance minister.
	   Mahathir, when he addressed the crowd afterward, urged UMNO
members to work to strengthen the standing of the party, which is
the chief constituent of 14 component parties in the Barisan
National coalition.
	   ``It is vital for Malaysia as a developing country to have a
strong government because a weak government cannot implement any
program(s),'' Mahathir said, adding that the party had to remain
stable to face the challenges of the current economic downturn.
	   Analysts have speculated that Mahathir will opt to call an early
general election, before the UNMO party internal elections,
allowing him to rule out a leadership challenge before facing the
electorate.
	   UMNO elections are scheduled for mid-1999. General elections
don't have to be called until the current parliament expires in
April 2000.
	   On Friday, Anwar dismissed rumors of his imminent resignation as
finance minister.
	   He said there was ``no basis'' to the resignation rumor, which
he added was being spread by the media and the financial markets.

Dutch striker put on transfer list for 8 million pounds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NOTTINGHAM, England (AP) _ Nottingham Forest has put Dutch World
Cup striker Pierre van Hooydonk on the transfer list _ with an
asking price of 8 million pounds (dlrs 13.2 million).
	   Van Hooydonk has refused to report to the club, so Forest
manager Dave Bassett decided to put him up for sale.
	   ``It was inevitable really that Pierre wasn't going to come
back,'' Bassett said. ``He felt that his decision was right and he
really wants to move, he wants to try and fix himself up with a
club rather quickly.''
	   Van Hooydonk cost Forest 4 million (dlrs 6.4 million) when the
club bought him from Celtic in March 1997. He scored 34 goals in
helping Forest climb back into the Premier League.
	   ``It saddens me greatly that Pierre will not be coming back to
join us,'' Bassett said. ``But these days it is the players who
hold all the aces in the game. It was a case of the tail wagging
the dog and we could not allow that to happen.''

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia is ready to fortify the southern borders of
former Soviet republics in Central Asia to guard against any
spillover of the turmoil in neighboring Afghanistan, the Foreign
Ministry said Tuesday.
	   The northbound advance of the fundamentalist Taliban movement
poses ``a real threat'' to the coalition of former Soviet
republics, the Commonwealth of Independent States, Foreign Ministry
spokesman Valery Nesterushkin said.
	   Afghanistan borders three former Soviet republics: Tajikistan,
Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.
	   Russia fears the entrenchment of a radical Islamic state in
Afghanistan would bring an influx of refugees and weapons into the
former Soviet republics of Central Asia.
	   The worries flared up following the Taliban's weekend capture of
the biggest city in northern Afghanistan, Mazar-e-Sharif, which is
just 60 kilometers (37 miles) from the Tajik border.

Seven critically injured Kenyans arrive at U.S. military hospital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RAMSTEIN AIR BASE, Germany (AP) _ A C-141 cargo plane carrying
seven Kenyans critically injured in the U.S. Embassy bombing in
Nairobi arrived Tuesday at Ramstein Air Base.
	   The seven, all U.S. Embassy employees, were rushed by ambulance
to the U.S. military hospital in Landstuhl, where 13 others injured
in the explosion Friday were being treated.
	   All seven suffered blast injuries _ fractures, broken bones and
head injuries _ and two were on ventilators, said Capt. Annette
Gablehouse, a spokeswoman for the medical team.
	   At least three were scheduled for surgery, Gablehouse said.
	   She said all were in critical condition, and had to be
stabilized before leaving Nairobi for the 9-hour flight accompanied
by a physician, respiratory therapists and other medical personnel.
	   An American embassy employee, identified as Ellen Bomer, who
arrived at Landstuhl hospital on Sunday was transferred overnight
to Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Maryland, said hospital
spokeswoman Leanne Winkler. No hometown for Bomer was given.
	   Doctors were evaluating the other nine Americans to see if any
could be flown to Walter Reed on Wednesday, Winkler said. They
include U.S. Marine Sgt. Daniel Briehl, who commanders say returned
to the scene of the blast despite his injuries to help rescue
others.
	   Four Kenyans who arrived at Ramstein Sunday were in stable
condition at Landstuhl. A fifth Kenyan who suffered critical head
and lung injuries was being treated at the University Medical
Center in nearby Homburg.
	   No immediate word was available on his condition.

Cabinet to vote on bank rescue package Friday

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with announcement to be made Friday, briefings
Saturday in grafs 3-4; picks up 4th graf pvs: `Confusion over... ' &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The Thai Cabinet will hold a special
session Friday to vote on a financial reform package aimed at
easing the crisis of the country's debt-laden banking system.
	   Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai called the meeting to hurry through
the unveiling of the package after wrapping up meetings with a
visiting International Monetary Fund team, a government spokeswoman
said Tuesday.
	   Authorities plan to announce the much-awaited plan, considered a
vital step toward reviving the recession-bound economy, on Friday
after the meeting, Deputy Finance Minister Pisit Lee-atham said
Tuesday.
	   Thailand's central bank will invite foreign embassy
representatives and analysts from brokerages and research houses
Saturday for separate briefings on the plan, he said.
	   Confusion over how the government will deal with the sector,
crippled by non-performing loans, has added to investor pessimism
over recent days. Banking stocks slipped 6.5 percent on the
benchmark Stock Exchange of Thailand index Monday.
	   The majority of Thailand's 15 commercial banks have failed to
raise adequate new capital from the private sector after becoming
laden with bad debt. Many analysts now expect the government to
step in.
	   This could be in the form of a swap of debt for bonds at a
discount. Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda has ruled out a
consolidation of bad assets under state management.
	   Tarrin said Monday that Thailand will lose some of its weaker
banks, possibly through mergers with stronger institutions, but
refused to say that any would be closed outright.
	   Widely expected is the merger of three state-run banks _ Siam
City Bank, First Bangkok City Bank and Bangkok Metropolitan Bank. A
fourth state-run bank, Bangkok Bank of Commerce, may be put up for
sale to foreign investors.
	   An IMF team has been in Bangkok negotiating terms of the latest
quarterly installment of a dlrs 17.2 billion bailout.
	   Thailand's financial system all but collapsed in mid-1998
following political interference in the once independent central
bank, and massive uncontrolled lending and corruption in private
financial institutions.
	   Chuan's government, which came to power after the crisis
erupted, has made financial restructuring a major priority.

Three Cabinet ministers announce visits to controversial war
</HEADLINE>
shrine &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Cabinet minister who questioned evidence that
Japan forced Asian women into prostitution during World War II
announced Tuesday he will pay respects at a controversial shrine
for Japan's war dead.
	   Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Shoichi Nakagawa
will mark the anniversary Saturday of Japan's World War II
surrender by visiting Yasukuni Shrine, said ministry spokesman
Ryoji Ohata.
	   The shrine honors Japanese service people _ including war
criminals _ who died in wars from 1853 until the end of World War
II. It is widely considered a symbol of Japanese militarism.
	   Nakagawa stirred controversy in his first news conference as a
minister by saying that he was unconvinced there was historical
evidence of ``comfort women,'' a euphemism for Asian women who were
forced to work as sex slaves by the Japanese military during the
war. He later backed off from those comments.
	   Two other Cabinet Ministers _ Kichio Inoue, head of the Hokkaido
and Okinawa development agencies, and Hakuo Yanagisawa, the
National Land Agency chief _ also said Tuesday they will attend
annual observances at the shrine.
	   Six other members of Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's newly formed
Cabinet already had said earlier they would visit the shrine.
	   Obuchi has announced he will not pay respects at Yasukuni Shrine
this year, but before becoming prime minister he was an outspoken
supporter of state visits to the shrine.
	   Despite protests by China, South Korea and other countries
invaded by Japan during the war, government officials often visit
the shrine to mark Japan's surrender on Aug. 15, 1945.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The flag-shrouded coffins of 11 Americans
killed in the worst terror attack on a U.S. Embassy were solemnly
loaded onto a military aircraft Monday to begin their final journey
home.
	   The 12th American victim, Jean Dalizu, who was married to a
Kenyan, will be buried in her adopted homeland.
	   The explosion Friday killed more than 200 people, including the
12 Americans and 33 Kenyans who worked at the embassy, and injured
almost 5,000 others. A nearly simultaneous attack on the U.S.
Embassy in neighboring Tanzania killed 10 people, all Africans.

Jakarta military mobilizes ahead of nervous national day
</HEADLINE>
celebrations &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's armed forces will deploy
thousands of troops in the capital ahead of national day
celebrations next Monday amid rumors of possible rioting, a report
said Tuesday.
	   The official Antara news agency said rumors have been
circulating, mainly among ethnic Chinese, that violence will erupt
on Aug. 17, the 53rd anniversary of Indonesia's independence from
Japanese wartime occupation and Dutch colonial rule.
	   Jakarta military chief Maj. Gen. Djadja Suparman urged people
not to believe the rumors, some of which had been printed on
pamphlets that had been distributed in some neighborhoods.
	   ``All personnel of Jakarta military will be involved. We will
fully support the police to safeguard the capital,'' Suparman said.
	   Jakarta Governor Sutiyoso has urged residents to tighten
security ahead of the celebrations.
	   Fears of civil unrest have plagued Jakarta, a city of about 10
million, since May, when riots left about 1,200 people dead and
thousands of buildings and homes burned or damaged.
	   Women's groups claim that more than 150 women and girls were
raped.
	   The riots, which followed a wave of student protests, led to the
resignation of autocratic former President Suharto.
	   Indonesia's ethnic Chinese minority, many of them Christians or
Buddhists, were targeted by mobs.
	   Chinese make up only a fraction of the 202 million population,
but dominate commerce and industry.
	   As such they have been made scapegoats for a deep economic
crisis now gripping the predominantly Muslim nation.
	   Meanwhile, fears of fresh rioting are also rife among ethnic
Chinese in the central Javanese capital of Semarang, where graffiti
were found on Chinese-owned homes and shops, allegedly marking
targets of attack.
	   Municipal workers, however, have scrubbed away the signs.
	   Residents said they had been told that a painted triangle
identifies a building as a target for looters and a circle
symbolizes that women in a building are targets for rape.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Three American companies will participate in
an international trade fair to be held in Iran in October, the
Tehran Times reported Tuesday.
	   It will mark the first time U.S. companies participate in a
trade fair in Iran since 1995 when the United States banned U.S.
firms from engaging in deals with Iran, which it accused of
supporting terrorism and seeking to procure nuclear weapons.
	   The American companies were not identified but the
English-language paper said a total of 207 companies from 68
countries are expected to take part in the Oct. 1-9 trade fair.
	   ___
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ An airliner belonging to a Kazakstan
company is being held at Paphos airport following a court order
handed down after its owners failed to pay local debts.
	   The Tupolev 154 with 87 passengers and 14 crew was barred from
taking off when it made a stop at Paphos on its flight Monday from
Athens to Kazakstan, lawyer Nicos Clerides said.
	   He said he asked for the court detention order on behalf of his
clients, the Cypriot company United Perlite Industries, which
claims it is owed dlrs 300,000 by the plane's owners, Sayakhat
Airlines of Kazakstan.
	   Clerides said most of the passengers continued their journey on
other flights. He and his clients will soon be meeting
representatives of the airline, he added.
	   ___
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanon has signed a dlrs 8.2 million
contract with a Canadian company to computerize and upgrade the
country's land registration system, newspapers reported Tuesday.
	   The deal with the Canadian firm, CRC Sogema, was signed here
Monday in the presence of Lebanese State Minister for Finance, Fuad
Saniora, and Canada's ambassador to Lebanon, Daniel Marchand.
	   Saniora said the agreement is part of ongoing efforts to
modernize Lebanon's administration, which was wrecked during the
1975-90 civil war, and improve its performance.
	   The English-language Daily Star said the deal, to be funded by
the World Bank, will make possible the automatic registration of
property sales title deeds and allow foreigners to verify the
legality of their property purchases within minutes.
	   ___
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Non-Jordanian investment in the Amman
financial market increased during July 1998, compared to the same
period of last year, a stock market report said Tuesday.
	   Non-Jordanian investments amounted to 28.5 million dinars (dlrs
40.1 million), an increase of 22.1 million dinars (dlrs 31.1
million) over July 1997, according to figures released by Michel
Marto, director general of the Jordan Securities Commission.
	   Sales of shares amounted to 12.8 million dinars (dlrs 18
million) last month, compared with 0.8 million dinars (dlrs 1.1
million) for the same month last year, Marto said.

Human rights groups demand release of aging communist spies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SANG-HUN CHOE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Human rights groups urged President
Kim Dae-jung on Tuesday to unconditionally release an estimated 500
political prisoners and make South Korea a truly democratic
society.
	   Kim, the first opposition leader to take power in South Korea,
has said he wants to release ``as many political prisoners as
possible'' to mark the Aug. 15 anniversary of Korea's liberation
from Japanese colonial rule in 1945.
	   But human rights groups say the Kim government continues to
impose an unacceptable condition _ a requirement that the prisoners
first sign a statement swearing to abide by South Korean laws,
including one that makes it a crime to be a communist.
	   South Korea has 17 political prisoners who have been behind bars
for more than 30 years _ often in in solitary confinement _ after
being convicted as North Korean spies in the 1950s and '60s.
	   They have repeatedly rejected past government offers to free
them if they signed a statement swearing to abandon their
ideological beliefs.
	   Amnesty International and other civil rights groups contend the
new condition imposed by Kim's government is little different than
the old one.
	   As of Tuesday, none of the 17 aging political prisoners had
signed the statement, human rights group said.
	   ``It is a direct violation of human rights. Obeying laws is one
thing, and being forced to sign a letter swearing to obey laws is
another,'' said Nam Kyu-sun, secretary-general of the South Korean
human rights group Minkahyup.
	   ``One must have the right to remain silent,'' she added.
	   About 40 long-term and other political prisoners staged a hunger
strike for three days last week to demand unconditional release,
Nam said. Political prisoners have often staged hunger strikes in
the past.
	   ``Some of those old men are so fragile in health that the
effects of the hunger strike could last for months, if not threaten
their very lives,'' said Kim Sam-sok, a spokesman at Seoul's
Sarangbang Group for Human Rights.
	   Among those in protest was Woo Yong-gak, 69, believed to be the
world's longest-serving political prisoner. Woo, convicted as a
North Korean spy, has been held in solitary confinement for 40
years, despite being partially crippled by a stroke.
	   Human rights groups estimate the number of political prisoners
in South Korean at 500. Most are militant student and labor
activists convicted of supporting communist North Korea.
	   Justice Minister Park Sang-chun has said the government would
release no political prisoners who refuse to submit to the
so-called ``law-abiding promise.''
	   Ministry officials refused to disclose how many political
prisoners have signed the letter and were qualified for amnesty.
But local media, quoting government sources, put the number at 103.
	   The same news reports said the planned amnesty will affect some
2,000 ordinary prisoners as well.
	   President Kim, himself a former political prisoner, was
persecuted by past military governments and imprisoned for more
than six years in the 1970s. He freed 74 political prisoners in an
amnesty in March. Critics said those pardons were merely cosmetic.

Taliban says missing Iranians of Mazar-e-Sharif not diplomats
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with statement from Taliban Foreign
Ministry on missing Iranians. TRIMS pvs. No pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By ZAHEERUDDIN ABDULLAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Afghanistan's ruling Taliban captured
the strategic town of Taloqan on Tuesday as it continued to pummel
the northern-based minority opposition.
	   Also Tuesday, the Taliban said 11 missing Iranian diplomats face
arrest because the administration has not been informed of their
presence in Mazar-e-Sharif, northern Afghanistan's biggest city
recaptured last week by the Taliban.
	   A Taliban Foreign Ministry said the Iranians, who could not be
recognized as diplomats, would be tried and punished as agents of a
hostile government. The Taliban claims to be holding 30 Iranians
suspected of arming their enemies in Mazar-e-Sharif, but say they
don't know the whereabouts of the 11 diplomats stationed at Iran's
consulate there.
	   Iran, widely believed to be arming the anti-Taliban alliance,
accuses the Taliban of detaining its envoys. It has called on
neighboring Pakistan, a Taliban supporter, to ensure their safety.
	   Last year, the Taliban closed Iran's embassy in the capital,
Kabul. Iranian diplomats remained in areas held by the anti-Taliban
alliance. Neighboring Iran recognizes Burhanuddin Rabbani, the
president the Taliban ousted from Kabul in 1996, as Afghanistan's
legitimate government.
	   Iran's opposition to the Taliban is believed to stem in part
from a desire to contain the Taliban's form of Islam. The Taliban,
whose name means ``students of Islam,'' control most of
Afghanistan, including Kabul. They have imposed a strict version of
Islam, barring most women from work and girls from school, banning
music and directing men to wear beards.
	   The anti-Taliban coalition has suffered a series of setbacks in
recent weeks, starting with the fall of warlord Rashid Dostum's
stronghold of Shebergan. The Taliban advanced from Shebergan to
take Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   Earlier Tuesday, Taliban and opposition sources confirmed the
Taliban captured Taloqan, some 250 kilometers (about 150 miles)
north of Kabul.
	   Taloqan is the capital of Takhar province, a stronghold of
powerful anti-Taliban commander Ahmed Shah Masood. Taliban sources
said Tuesday an ally of Masood's, former Prime Minister Gulbaddin
Hekmatyar, was shot and killed in Takhar province, but had no
details.
	   But Hekmatyar's son-in-law Ghairad Baheer said the report was
``baseless.''
	   ``I just spoke to him about five minutes ago. He's fine, he's
energetic as always,'' Baheer said in Islamabad, capital of
neighboring Pakistan.
	   Taliban sources said Mazar-e-Sharif was calm Tuesday, with the
Taliban in control and confiscating weapons from residents.
	   Iranian radio reported Tuesday the Taliban attacked the
consulate of Turkmenistan, a former Soviet republic, in
Mazar-e-Sharif and expelled its diplomats. The whereabouts of the
diplomats were not immediately clear.
	   Iranian radio on Tuesday accused the Taliban of a ``large-scale
massacre of civilians'' in Mazar-e-Sharif. Opposition have also
accused the Taliban of killing civilians, particularly Shiite
Muslims. The Taliban adhere to the Sunni sect of Islam.

Four Italian cyclists fail blood test
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: EDITS throughout to CORRECT that riders failed blood test, did
not test positive for banned substances &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ In the latest doping-related incident in
cycling, four Italian members of the Mobilvetta team were
disqualified from the Tour of Portugal on Tuesday after failing
blood tests.
	   Paolo Alberati, Graziano Recinella, Mario Monzoni and Renzo
Tagnetti were tested just before the second leg of the tour in
southern Spain, the Portuguese news agency Lusa said.
	   The four were among 32 racers picked at random for the test by
the medical team from the International Cycling Union.
	   They failed the test because their hematocrit level _ the
proportion of red blood cells to the total volume of blood _ was
above 50 percent, considered a health risk.
	   There is no reliable test for detecting the use of EPO, a
synthetic hormone that stimulates the production of oxygen-carrying
red blood cells.
	   Although a high red blood cell count can indicate the use of
EPO, the UCI describes the blood tests as a safety measure and not
a doping test.
	   Tuesday's disqualifications came in the wake of the doping
scandals which tarnished last month's Tour de France.
	   Festina is among the 18 teams taking part in the 2,177-kilometer
(1,350-mile) Tour of Portugal that began in the southern Spanish
city of Seville on Monday and is due to cross the border into
Portugal on the third leg and finish in Lisbon on Aug. 23.
	   Festina was kicked out of the Tour de France after team
officials and some riders admitted using EPO. Six other teams later
withdrew from the tour, protesting police investigations.

Bicycle rider confesses to about 5,000 counts of burglary
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A 68-year-old man who allegedly roamed residential
streets across Japan by bicycle looking for easy break-ins has been
charged with some 5,000 burglaries, police said Tuesday.
	   Shigeo Taki has confessed that since 1989, he has stolen cash
from thousands of homes between the northern island of Hokkaido and
the southern tip of the main island of Honshu, said a police
spokesman in Saitama, just north of Tokyo.
	   By day, Taki would ride a stolen bicycle to look for houses to
break into at night, said the spokesman, who declined to be named.
	   Taki said he cycled to stay physically fit, and ate pork
intestines and salted fish intestines every day because he thought
they helped him see better in the dark, the spokesman added.
	   He was arrested in May while washing his bike at the parking lot
of a pachinko pinball parlor in Saitama, but his arrest was not
made public until Monday.
	   Police said they were still investigating how much Taki stole in
the 5,000 thefts to which he has confessed. If convicted, Taki
faces up to 10 years in prison.

IAAF ratifies five new world records
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) _ The IAAF Tuesday ratified the
1,500-meter world record of Morocco's Hicham El Guerrouj and also
put four other new marks into the books.
	   El Guerrouj's time of 3 minutes 26.00 seconds, set July 14 in
Rome, was more than a second faster than the old mark of 3:27.37
set by Algerian Noureddine Morceli in Nice, France, three years
ago.
	   The 23-year-old Moroccan is also the defending world champion at
the distance and has replaced Morceli _ the '96 Olympic champion _
as the top man in one of track's glamour events.
	   The IAAF also approved two women's outdoor marks: the pole vault
record of 4.42 meters (14 feet 6 inches) set Feb. 6 by Vala
Flosadottir of Iceland and the hammer record of 73.14 meters
(239-11) set July 16 by Romanian Mihaela Melinte.
	   The IAAF also put two indoor marks into the books _ the 60-meter
standard of 6.39 set by American Maurice Greene Feb. 3 and the
3,000 mark of 7:26.15 set Jan. 25 by Haile Gebrselassie of
Ethiopia.

Australia and China pledge cooperation on human rights
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALAN THORNHILL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ China and Australia have agreed on a
joint program to strengthen their human rights dialogue, Australian
Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer said Tuesday.
	   The program will allow Chinese government officials to attend
courses on human rights law at Australian universities and provides
for the translation of Australian and Chinese studies on human
rights.
	   Under the agreement, Australia will send lecturers to the
National Judges College in Beijing, and a Chinese government
observer will attend next month's meeting of the Asia Pacific Forum
on international human rights.
	   ``These are just some of the concrete measures the Australian
government has taken as part of a constructive dialogue with China
as part of our commitment to protecting the human rights set out in
the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights,'' Downer
said after talks with Chinese officials.
	   On Monday, Downer said human rights in China ``still have a long
way to go'' but that they are at least ``moving in the right
direction.''
	   Department of Foreign Affairs deputy secretary Kim Jones headed
the Australian delegation, while the Chinese delegation was led by
Vice Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi.
	   It is the first visit to Australia for human rights talks by
such a senior delegation, which includes representatives from the
foreign and justice ministries, the State Ethnic Affairs
Commission, the Supreme People's Court and the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences.
	   As the agreement was reached inside Australia's diplomatic
headquarters, a lone protester held vigil outside.
	   Wang Li said her son Wang Jianping has languished in a Beijing
jail for eight years for alleged spying. He is one of four
Australian citizens being held by China.
	   An entertainment promoter, Wang Jianping was jailed shortly
after traveling to Beijing eight years ago, his mother said. She is
appealing to the Australian government to secure his release.
	   ``He is not a spy,'' Wang said. ``He is a businessman.''

Suspected Kurdish rebels attack tourist hotel in northern Turkey
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS final graf to restore first name of mayor. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Gunmen believed to be Kurdish rebels
raided a tourist hotel on Turkey's Black Sea coast, killing the
owner before setting it on fire, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   The guerrillas, armed with Kalashnikov rifles, forced out 35
guests at the inn in the town of Uzungol on Monday, the Milliyet
daily said. The seven gunmen killed the owner when he tried to stop
them from burning the building, Milliyet said.
	   The newspaper said the hotel guests included foreigners. Their
nationalities were not known. The paramilitary police in charge of
the area refused immediate comment.
	   Uzungol is close to scenic lakes and the much-visited Byzantine
Surmene monastery, carved into a rock cliff.
	   Kurdish rebels, fighting for autonomy in Turkey's southeast,
sometimes launch attacks in the Black Sea region when under
pressure from the military. The war between Kurdish guerrillas and
government forces has claimed 37,000 lives since 1984; rebels
occasionally abduct foreign tourists and release them unharmed.
	   Also on Tuesday, the rebels released a mayor they kidnapped at a
roadblock near the southeastern city of Van a week ago, Turkey's
semiofficial Anatolia news agency said.
	   Naci Orhan was apparently unharmed and was being questioned at a
paramilitary police station near Van. The circumstances of his
release were not known.

China sets strict controls on state grain purchases
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ China's government has tightened
restrictions on state grain buying in an attempt to end widespread
theft of government funds and ensure farmers are paid for their
crops, the state-run Futures Herald reported Tuesday.
	   The rules are part of a sweeping reform of the state-run grain
system initiated by Premier Zhu Rongji, who has complained bitterly
about corrupt local officials squandering money destined for
farmers.
	   In China, all grain not sold on the open market is supposed to
be bought by state-run concerns. But funds budgeted for such
purchases often are spent on other investments. The failure to pay
farmers promptly for their crops has undermined efforts to expand
grain production.
	   The new rules announced Monday by China's State Council impose
tighter controls at state grain companies, on loans by the
Agricultural Development Bank and on provincial grain authorities,
the newspaper said.
	   Grain companies, which previously were left mostly unregulated,
now must record all grain purchases and current grain stocks, and
keep profit and loss statements, the paper reported.
	   The companies will only be allowed to open accounts at the
Agriculture Development Bank, one of China's three policy banks,
and money from sales should be redeposited into the same accounts.
Interest on all deposits must be accounted for, the paper said.
	   The grain procurement system has been losing more than dlrs 2.5
billion a year.
	   In a recent audit, provincial grain authorities and grain
companies were found to have diverted grain buying funds into
investments in hotels, real estate, entertainment centers, futures
trading and personal bank accounts.
	   So far, efforts to reimpose state control have failed to ensure
that farmers get paid for their crops. The government has been
closing down independent grain trading companies, while state
companies in some areas have neglected to make purchases, leaving
farmers with unsold crops.
	   China's grain crop is expected to total 492.5 million metric
tons this year, on par with last year's harvest. Hopes for a record
harvest were given up following widespread flooding.

Kosovo Albanian rebels vow to fight on

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Secessionist Kosovo Albanian rebels
vowed Tuesday to fight on in Kosovo province despite a recent
string of losses against Serb government forces.
	   Albanian sources reported fighting Tuesday in the western Decani
region near the Albanian border. They claimed a column of 110
Yugoslav Army vehicles, including 36 tanks, was seen heading for
the embattled region.
	   In the Albanian capital Tirana, the government said Tuesday that
70 people fled across the border from Kosovo within the last 24
hours, including two badly wounded guerrillas.
	   Independent media in Belgrade also reported the Kosovo
Liberation Army regained control of the central village of Likovac,
the rebel headquarters which Serb forces overran last week. The
reports could not be confirmed.
	   In a statement distributed to ethnic Albanian media, the KLA
said the latest Serb offensive ``has only strengthened our resolve
to bravely continue on the road to freedom.''
	   The statement called on Kosovo Albanians, who represent 90
percent of the Serbian province's 2 million people, to ``unite with
the KLA and help us in our just freedom fight.''
	   It also warned NATO not to deploy troops on the Albanian-Serbian
border _ the main route of arms supply for the KLA _ ``because we
would consider this the second offensive against our freedom and
our national pride.''
	   Despite the war rhetoric, one of the top KLA officials told
local Albanian Koha Ditore daily that the militants might join an
all-Albanian negotiating team in peace negotiations with the
Serbian government.
	   Diplomatic efforts to return ethnic Albanian and Serb leaders to
the negotiating table are inching forward, despite sporadic
clashes.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill met with Serb and ethnic Albanian
leaders Monday in the provincial capital Pristina.
	   Hill has been mediating between pacifist ethnic Albanian leader
Ibrahim Rugova and leading politician Mehmet Hajrizi, who has close
contacts with the secessionist ethnic Albanian rebels, in hopes of
getting the Albanians to rally behind one leader.
	   Hill also met Monday with Yugoslav Vice Premier Nikola Sainovic.
	   For five months, Serb troops have been fighting the KLA, which
seeks independence from Serbia, the dominant republic of
Yugoslavia.
	   But the Albanians remain largely divided between those loyal to
Rugova, and those who support the militants.
	   ``In principle, in its meeting with Hill (earlier this month)
the KLA has agreed to form ... a coalition (Kosovo Albanian)
government,'' rebel spokesman Shaban Sala told Koha Ditore.
	   Rugova, in his answers to questions on the Internet, said it was
hard to get in touch with the KLA leaders ``because the latest Serb
offensive has isolated them. Their stands will certainly be heard
in our future coalition.''
	   The independent Belgrade-based Beta news agency said 14 Serb
policemen have been killed since their latest offensive against the
rebels started on July 20. It added that 217 ethnic Albanians are
known to have died in the same period.
	   On Tuesday, the Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center said
about 15,000 refugees were trapped in the Decani ``because of an
iron circle'' formed by Serb forces. The bodies of five killed
ethnic Albanians were brought overnight to the nearby Djakovica
morgue, the report added.
	   The government-run Media Center said one more Serb policeman, in
addition to four killed since Sunday, was shot dead late Monday in
fighting near Djakovica.

New Thai labor law amended to meet employers' concerns
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Responding to local and foreign
investors' concerns about rising costs, Thailand's Cabinet on
Tuesday approved amendments to soften the regulations of a new
labor protection act.
	   One of the amendments allows employers to schedule work of more
than eight hours a day without having to pay their employees
overtime wages, as long as total working hours do not exceed 48 a
week, government spokesman Akapol Sorasuchart said at a news
conference.
	   The normal work week in Thailand is 5 1/2 days.
	   Employers had been concerned that overtime payments would rise
sharply under the daily eight-hour limit.
	   ``The amendments will allow the new law to be implemented
effectively,'' Akapol said. He said the Labor and Social Welfare
Ministry would amend its ministerial regulations before the new act
became effective Aug. 19.
	   Akapol said the regulations also would be amended to allow women
to work in the petroleum and petrochemical industries. The new act
would have barred them from working in the production or
transportation of explosives or inflammable substances.
	   ``The Labor Ministry has found out that these industries have
modern equipment that can protect women from the danger,'' Akapol
said. ``The amendments mean those women will not lose their jobs.''
	   The planned amendments will also allow pregnant employees to
work beyond their regular hours, overtime or holidays, if they
agree to do so. Under the new act, pregnant women would not have
been allowed to work between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m., overtime or
holidays.
	   Employers had said they would avoid hiring women because of
possible complications arising from their pregnancy.

Hoddle describes Gascoigne's reaction to World Cup omission
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A drunken Paul Gascoigne kicked a chair, smashed a
lamp and acted ``like a man possessed'' when coach Glenn Hoddle
told him he had been dropped from England's World Cup squad.
	   The scene was described in Hoddle's new autobiography, excerpts
of which were published in Tuesday's edition of the Sun newspaper.
	   Hoddle recalled how he broke the news to Gascoigne at England's
training camp in Spain on the eve of this summer's World Cup in
France. He said Gascoigne had been drunk the night before and was
drunk again that day.
	   When he called Gascoigne in to tell him he wouldn't be going to
France, the midfielder was ``slurring and unsteady on his feet,''
Hoddle said.
	   At first, Gascoigne cried at the news. Then he shook Hoddle's
hand and started to walk out.
	   ``Then he stopped, turned and flew into a raage, kicking a
nearby chair,'' Hoddle said. ``It was a full-blooded volley and I
was concerned because he had bare feet. The kick was so hard I
thought he must have broken his foot.
	   ``He was a different person now. He had snapped. I stood there
and he turned as if to go again, then came back with a barrage of
abuse.
	   ``He was ranting, swearing and slurring his words, not making
much sense. ... He stormed over to me. He was like a man possessed,
totally different from the person who had been shaking my hand a
minute earlier. By this time I had my arm ready _ I thought he was
going to hit me.
	   ``But there was a large lamp to my left and he viciously smashed
his fist into it. Shards of glass exploded all over the room.''
	   Assistant coaches Glenn Roeder and John Gorman rushed in when
they heard the noise and pulled Gascoigne away.
	   Hoddle said he still holds out a glimmer of hope for Gascoigne,
insisting that his England career is not finished, despite leaving
him out of the working squad for the European Championship
qualifying phase.
	   ``There are five things he needs to do _ stop drinking, get
fitter than ever before, change his diet, learn to control his
emotions and stay injury-free,'' Hoddle said. ``He needs to look
inside himself and ask what he wants, where he is going and how he
is going to get there. If he doesn't, nobody can help him.''

States,'' Estrada said in a statement. ``No cause is so great that
it can justify wanton murder and maiming of the innocent.''

	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Handing over a green and gold
shoulder sash, President Nelson Mandela on Tuesday awarded
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat South Africa's highest honor for
foreigners.
	   Arafat is on a three-day visit to South Africa, aimed at
cementing ties that go back to when the African National Congress
was fighting white rule and Arafat headed the Palestinian
Liberation Organization as an exile.
	   ``Congratulations, Yasser,'' Mandela said as he draped the sash
over Arafat's green army shirt and black and white head scarf.
	   Previous recipients of the Order of Good Hope include other
stalwart allies from the days of the anti-apartheid struggle such
as Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi and former Indonesia President
Suharto.
	   In return Arafat presented Mandela with the Star of Holy
Jerusalem medal while an official read out a statement praising
Mandela's role in bringing democracy to South Africa and support
for creating a Palestinian state.
	   Officials also signed two declarations of intent for closer
links in health and education.
	   It was Arafat's first visit since South Africa and the
Palestinian autonomous government established diplomatic ties in
1995.
	   Aside from meeting Mandela, Arafat spent 50 minutes with Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki for discussions about the stalled Middle East
peace process, among other issues, officials said.
	   In a scene unthinkable under white rule, Arafat also held talks
with Marthinus van Schalkwyk, leader of the opposition National
Party which ruled during apartheid. Posing for photographers, the
two men shook hands and smiled broadly.
	   Arafat described the meeting as having gone ``very positively,''
while van Schalkwyk said: ``It shows that things can change.''
	   Accorded the formal welcome of a full head of state, Arafat
earlier inspected a military parade at the President's official
Tuynhuys offices in parliament and stood to attention as a band
struck up the Palestinian national anthem.

Government of Guinea-Bissau says rebels broke cease-fire
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Guinea-Bissau's government has accused
rebels of violating a two-week-old cease-fire, the Portuguese news
agency Lusa reported Tuesday.
	   A government statement issued Monday in the West African country
said rebels had attacked loyalist forces near Bafata, about 140
kilometers (85 miles) northeast of the capital Bissau.
	   The former Portuguese colony was plunged into conflict after a
renegade military faction staged a coup attempt two months ago.
	   A July 26 cease-fire calmed the situation, although there were
reports of sporadic gunfire in the week that followed.
	   Both sides reaffirmed the truce in a second round of talks last
week, despite rebel claims that the government had already broken
it.
	   They are due to meet for a third round of talks brokered bry chief
for allegedly running arms to Senegal's Casamance separatists.
	   Fierce fighting in Bissau between the rebels and Vieira's forces
_ backed by reinforcements from Senegal _ triggered an exodus from
the capital.
	   With relief agencies warning of a possible humanitarian crisis,
Senegalese troops and bureaucratic red tape have repeatedly
hindered shipments of food and medicine to some 300,000 displaced
people, according to Lusa.
	   No numbers are available on how many have been killed in the
fighting in this country of 1 million people.
	   Vieira and Mane fought side by side in a 14-year guerrilla war
against Portugal before independence in 1975. Vieira himself led a
coup in 1980 and was elected president in 1994.

Russian company uses own funds to build component for new space
</HEADLINE>
station &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A struggling Russian space company is building a
duplicate for a key component of the international space station,
even though both the Russian and American governments have refused
to pay for it.
	   The Khrunichev space engineering company built the original
cargo module for the space station under a dlrs 190 million
contract with Boeing.
	   The module, which will house fuel tanks and gyroscopes and be
attached to the station's solar batteries, has been taken to the
Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakstan in preparation for launching in
November.
	   The launch was originally scheduled for June, but has been
pushed back because of the Russian government's failure to finance
other parts of the work on the international station on time.
	   The Khrunichev company offered to build a backup cargo module _
``in case of failure'' _ and asked the United States to finance it,
said Khrunichev spokesman Sergei Zhiltsov.
	   ``But we have found little understanding,'' he said.
	   The company decided to build the backup module itself, using
revenues from other contracts, Zhiltsov said. He provided no
reasons for the company's eagerness to do this.
	   Zhiltsov said he did not know how much the construction would
cost. But he said it would be less than the original, because the
company can use the same blueprints and technologies that have
already been developed.
	   Khrunichev also built the living quarters for the international
space station. That was to have been financed by Russia, but the
government was chronically late with payments so the company took
out bank loans to finish the work on time, Khrunichev said.
	   The living quarters were to have been sent into orbit in
December, but the launch has been postponed until next August.
Russia's RKK Energiya company still has to furnish some equipment
for the living quarters, Zhiltsov said, warning that the work may
be jeopardized by the government's failure to pay.
	   The dlrs 21 billion international space station is a joint
project of 16 countries, including Russia, the United States, the
European Space Agency, Canada and Japan.
	   The station's segments will be assembled in orbit. The first
American-led crew is expected to board the station in July 1999,
more than a year later than originally planned.

U.S. Congressmen tell Palestinians to wait for statehood
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IMAD MUSA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ The head of a visiting U.S.
congressional delegation said Tuesday it would be ``premature'' for
the Palestinians to declare statehood in May 1999.
	   Rep. Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y., and seven other congressmen visited
the Palestinian legislature and met with its speaker, Ahmed Qureia,
to discuss developments in the Mideast peace process.
	   Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat has repeatedly
said he will declare Palestinian statehood in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip on May 4, 1999 _ the deadline for the PLO and Israel to
reach a final peace treaty, under the Israel-Palestinian peace
accords.
	   Such a declaration ``would be premature because it depends on
how much progress we have made toward peace,'' Solomon said.
	   Qureia said the decision of whether to declare statehood was
``still being studied'' and would depend on whether progress was
made in the peace process before then.
	   Qureia said the United States should publicly blame Israel for
the stalling of the peace process, an idea rejected by Solomon.
	   ``The United States wants to be as helpful as it can without
dictating,'' he said.
	   Qureia said progress on the Palestinian track would lead to
progress in peacemaking with Lebanon and Syria.
	   The meeting was part of a congressional exchange program
initiated by Rep. Newt Gingrich during his May visit. Last month,
Qureia headed a delegation of Palestinian legislators to
Washington.
	   Solomon said the meeting was ``extremely important because the
U.S. Congress needs to understand the Palestinian problem.''
	   The congressional delegation will also travel to Turkey and
central Asia to discuss NATO expansion and to China and South Korea
to discuss the financial situation in Southeast Asia.

Police arrest two suspected of spreading riot rumors over Internet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with 2nd arrest, edits to conform &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian authorities on Tuesday
arrested two people suspected of using the Internet to spark rumors
of violence that frightened people throughout the Southeast Asian
nation last week.
	   Abdul Rahim Noor, inspector-general of police, said authorities
arrested a Malaysian man and woman, both in their 20s, after
enlisting Internet service providers and technology experts to
track their online activities.
	   ``They picked up the rumors, which spread like wildfire
throughout the country,'' said Abdul Rahim.
	   He said the two would be detained for up to 60 days during an
investigation that would determine whether their crime was
punishable by the Internal Security Act, which allows jail without
trial for up to two years.
	   The police chief was quoted as saying by the government news
agency Bernama that several other suspects had been identified and
more arrests were imminent, ``to end the rumor-mongering once and
for all.''
	   The Malaysian capital has been rife with rumors, spread via the
Internet and then by word of mouth, that Indonesians have been
amassing knives and machetes.
	   On Friday evening, word spread through the capital that
Indonesian illegal immigrants in a downtown neighborhood had begun
to riot in protest against a Aug. 15 deadline to deport foreigners
who had not applied to renew their work permits.
	   Panicked workers left their downtown offices early, stocking up
on staples before securing themselves in their homes. Police were
forced to open a hot line.
	   The rumors have infuriated the Malaysian government. Officials
said instigators would be punished under the harsh security act.
	   Abdul Rahim dismissed speculation raised by the government
Monday that ``outsiders'' were spreading the rumors to sabotage
Malaysia.
	   ``So far our investigations did not show any indications that
the rumors originated from outside (the country),'' he said.
	   Indonesia's embassy on Tuesday implored its citizens to ignore
the rumors that their compatriots were scheming to lead riots in
Malaysia.
	   ``Indonesians come to Malaysia only to work and not to create
trouble for Malaysians,'' said Indonesian Ambassador Muhammad Yacob
Dasto. ``Rumors on the Internet about Indonesians rioting in Kuala
Lumpur were just rumors.''
	   Malaysia has deported more than 30,000 Indonesians since the
Asian economic crisis worsened this year. Authorities said they
intended to deport 200,000 Indonesians by Aug. 15.
	   Aseh Che Mat, the director-general of the Immigration
Department, said some 100,000 foreign workers had yet to apply for
renewal of their work permits.
	   Aseh told a news conference Monday that some 2,000 Indonesians
were leaving voluntarily each day because they refused to work on
plantations or in manufacturing, as the government has encouraged
them to do.
	   He said the immigration department had received numerous
``negative calls'' warning authorities there would be riots Friday
staged by Indonesian workers who want to stay.
	   ``All these rumors are not true,'' he said, but added, ``We will
try our best to contain any problems.''
	   Still, thousands of Indonesians don't want to go home, where
authorities expect half of the 202 million population to fall below
the poverty line by the end of the year.
	   A predawn roundup of illegal Indonesians at a detention camp
outside of Kuala Lumpur in March led to rioting and at least eight
deaths.

Negotiators agree to set up talks on nuclear-weapons material
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Israel-Nuclear &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Disarmament negotiators in Geneva agreed Tuesday
to set up talks on a treaty banning the production of material used
to make nuclear weapons.
	   The necessary consensus became possible after Israel, the last
remaining holdout on the talks, agreed to join in, although with
reservations.
	   The chairman of the 61-nation Conference on Disarmament, Mykola
Maimeskoul of Ukraine, had delayed from Friday a meeting to discuss
the proposal that a committee be set up to discuss a treaty on
so-called ``fissile materials,'' plutonium and highly enriched
uranium.
	   Delegates applauded loudly as the committee's establishment was
accepted with no nation raising any objections.
	   Maimeskoul thanked them for their ``spirit of compromise.''
	   Delegates at the conference expect substantive negotiations to
start next year.
	   Talks are likely to progress slowly, with countries at the
conference divided on whether they should aim to ban future
production of nuclear-weapons material or also address existing
stockpiles.
	   Pakistan said last week it wants negotiations to deal with
India's stocks. Others, including China, believe the treaty should
address future production.
	   Action on fissile material is referred to by arms negotiators as
the ``cut off'' treaty because it would stop the production of
nuclear weapons.
	   The Geneva conference is the world's main multilateral
disarmament body. Past successes include treaties to ban chemical
weapons and to halt test explosions of nuclear bombs.

Indonesian court lifts ban on political party
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ An Indonesian court has lifted a ban
against a political party, but its jailed leader say that is not
enough to fulfill government promises of democratic reform.
	   Paulus Mahulette, a lawyer representing the People's Democratic
Party, or PRD, said Tuesday that the Jakarta Administrative Court
on Monday overturned the ban imposed by the government of former
President Suharto last year.
	   Mahulette said the court ruled that the ban contravened
government rules on political parties as well as constitutional
guarantees of freedom of speech and assembly.
	   Suharto quit in May after a wave of riots and protests against
his authoritarian 32-year rule.
	   His successor, President B.J. Habibie, has pledged to
democratize Indonesia's rigid political system.
	   PRD leader Budiman Sudjatmiko, leader who is serving a 13-year
prison term for subversion, dismissed the importance of the lifting
of the ban.
	   He said Habibie's government had yet to demonstrate that it was
truly reforming Indonesian politics.
	   He said the government must strip Indonesia's powerful military
of its constitutional political role and abolish strict political
laws.
	   ``These are more important than the revocation of the ban,'' he
said in a statement.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Trading in Russian stocks was suspended for 45
minutes Tuesday due to sharp losses on the country's main exchange,
the Russian Trading System.
	   The timeout signaled a continuing lack of investor confidence in
Russian markets in spite of a dlrs 22.6 billion international
bailout package.
	   At 4 p.m. (1200 GMT), when trading was suspended, the stock
market's main index had fallen 11.8 percent to 106.61 from 120.91
on Monday. Trading resumed at 4:45 p.m. (1245 GMT).
	   Russian bonds plummeted on local and international markets amid
widespread flight from emerging markets. Investors fear that
Russian markets are too feeble to withstand another onslaught of
such selling.
	   The ruble was also a bit weaker Tuesday, but traders said it was
supported by heavy intervention by the Russian Central Bank, which
last week reported sharply lower foreign exchange reserves.
	   Before the suspension of trading was announced, Deputy Prime
Minister Viktor Khristiyenko tried to calm the jittery markets by
announcing that the government was able to service its foreign
debt.
	   ``Default is not an issue here,'' Khristiyenko said, adding that
the government has no plans to borrow on international bond markets
for the next two months.
	   As a condition for the international bailout, the World Bank and
International Monetary Fund are insisting that Russia carry out
economic reforms, especially improving its weak tax collection
system.
	   President Boris Yeltsin's government will ask parliament to
approve seven new bills implementing the reforms at a special
legislative session next week.
	   The government was able to push through only part of its
austerity program last month because the Communists and other
hard-liners in parliament rejected a number of tax-raising
measures.
	   The new bills include rescheduling debts of insolvent
enterprises and a measure that would raise fines on enterprise
directors accused of administrative abuses, the ITAR-Tass and
Interfax news agencies reported.
	   Meanwhile, the government continued to concentrate on collecting
taxes. Tax chief Boris Fyodorov has said that 5,000 companies owe a
total of dlrs 50 billion in taxes and fines.
	   Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko said Tuesday that it would be
impossible to call in all the old debts, some of which have been
piling up for years. The government mainly wants to see timely
payments of current taxes, Kiriyenko said, according to Interfax.
	   He urged the tax service to work efficiently so that it could
collect 13 billion rubles (dlrs 6 billion) in taxes this month.
	   The tax service's achievements will ``determine the future of
our country and the implementation of the stabilization program,''
Kiriyenko was quoted as saying by Interfax.
	   ``If we prove that Russian can collect taxes, we shall gradually
begin to restructure the state debt,'' he said.
	   The government has made countless promises to improve tax
collection. But it has consistently failed to raise the revenues
needed to provide basic services and pay millions of state workers
on a timely basis.

Negotiators agree to set up talks on nuclear-weapons material
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Israel-Nuclear &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Disarmament negotiators in Geneva agreed Tuesday
to set up talks on a treaty banning the production of material used
to make nuclear weapons.
	   The necessary consensus became possible after Israel, the last
remaining holdout on the talks, agreed to join in, although with
reservations.
	   The chairman of the 61-nation Conference on Disarmament, Mykola
Maimeskoul of Ukraine, on Friday had delayed a meeting to discuss
the proposal that a committee be set up to discuss a treaty on
so-called ``fissile materials,'' plutonium and highly enriched
uranium.
	   Delegates applauded loudly as the committee's establishment was
accepted with no nation raising any objections.
	   Maimeskoul thanked them for their ``spirit of compromise.''
	   Delegates at the conference expect substantive negotiations to
start next year.
	   Talks are likely to progress slowly, with countries at the
conference divided on whether they should aim to ban future
production of nuclear-weapons material or also address existing
stockpiles.
	   Pakistan said last week it wants negotiations to deal with
neighboring India's stocks. Others, including China, believe the
treaty should address future production.
	   Action on fissile material is referred to by arms negotiators as
the ``cut off'' treaty because it would stop the production of
nuclear weapons.
	   The Geneva conference is the world's main multilateral
disarmament body. Past successes include treaties to ban chemical
weapons and to halt test explosions of nuclear bombs.

Philippine official: rejecting military accord could strain
</HEADLINE>
relations with U.S. &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with senator saying debate on accord won't start until
next year in 6th graf, activists staging protest in 13th graf;
trims &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon said
Tuesday that Manila's ties with the United States could be strained
if the Philippine Senate rejects an accord allowing the resumption
of joint military exercises in the country.
	   Siazon said the Manila government will submit the proposed
Visiting Forces Agreement to the Philippine Senate for ratification
in October.
	   Early this year, Philippine and U.S. officials signed the pact,
which governs the conduct of the exercises and provides some legal
protection to U.S. soldiers while on duty in the country. It must
be ratified by the 23-member Philippine Senate before it can take
effect.
	   Siazon told Filipino senators in a meeting that ``when relations
sour in one sector of the relationship, they tend to impinge
negatively on all aspects of the relationships.''
	   He said without elaborating that trade between the two countries
could be particularly vulnerable. The United States is the
Philippines' largest trading partner.
	   Sen. Franklin Drilon said debate on the accord may be delayed
until January because senators will be busy tackling the
government's proposed 1999 budget.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen and Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright separately met President Joseph Estrada and
other Philippine officials in recent weeks to seek support for the
accord, which is opposed by Catholic Church leaders and many
left-wing groups.
	   Critics say the accord infringes on Philippine sovereignty
because it limits the Manila government's right to prosecute
American soldiers who commit crimes here.
	   They say the presence of foreign troops could also promote
prostitution.
	   Estrada has said the country needs the accord to boost its weak
military.
	   Siazon and Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado were asked to
appear before the Senate committees on defense and foreign affairs
Tuesday to explain why Estrada, Mercado and other senior officials
were not informed in advance by the military of a live-fire war
exercise by the Philippine and U.S. navies last week in
international waters.
	   Siazon said Estrada was not informed of the exercise because it
was just one of several minor military exercises staged by the two
countries yearly.
	   While the meeting went on, about 30 activists protested outside
the Senate building, holding placards that read ``VFA, No Way.''
	   The United States halted major joint exercises in the
Philippines and visits by U.S. military ships in December 1996,
when the Manila government ended a legal loophole that had shielded
U.S. military personnel from prosecution by the Philippines for
crimes committed here.
	   Military ties with the United States have remained a sensitive
issue since a nationalist Philippine Senate forced the closure of
the last U.S. base in the country in 1992, ending close to a
century of American military presence in its former colony.

Mandela, new bride, say they married under pressure
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) _ Three weeks after their surprise
wedding, South African President Nelson Mandela and his new wife,
Graca Machel, said they married under ``unbearable'' pressure from
friends.
	   ``Even in Parliament in my country, deputies told me I should
get married,'' Mandela told reporters Monday in the Mozambican
capital. ``The pressure became unbearable.''
	   The couple's open two-year relationship drew fire from South
African clergy, who complained it set a bad example for younger
people.
	   While Mandela was ready to tie the knot long before, Machel
delayed because she did not want to give up her work and her status
in her native Mozambique as the widow of another president, the
late Samora Machel.
	   Machel has campaigned extensively for children suffering from
war and for eradication of landmines, causes she knew intimately
before Mozambique's 15-year-long civil war ended in 1992.
	   When they finally married on Mandela's 80th birthday, July 18,
even their children and families had only short notice of the
ceremony.
	   Mandela said they kept the affair secret because they would not
have known whom to invite among the ``numerous friends'' who have
helped South Africa and to avoid clogging the streets with traffic.
	   Graca Machel, 52, plans to keep her surname and her life in
Mozambique, a move that some women praise for its example of female
independence.

Report: New airport still troubled by baggage system
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's glittering new airport
is operating smoothly, except for glitches in its baggage-handling
system and a tenacious pack of rats.
	   Two weeks ago, the airport's baggage system would mysteriously
swallow up to four pieces of luggage on every domestic flight to
Pahang state, 260 kilometers (156 miles) from the capital, the New
Straits Times reported Tuesday.
	   ``If you compare this with the number of baggage handled by the
airport every day, which is about 25,000, it is only a small
percentage,'' Transport Minister Ling Liong Sik told reporters
while visiting the airport.
	   Some of the check-in luggage failed to reach the aircraft
because items accidentally rolled off the conveyor belt system, he
said.
	   Meanwhile, Ling said the airport's staff has been scampering to
kill rats cloistered in the new airport, reputed to have the
world's biggest terminal and hangar.
	   Ling said they trapped 600 rats in two weeks.
	   Most new airports experience teething problems. A week after the
Malaysian airport opened, Hong Kong's Chek Lap Kok airport also
opened to a host of serious computer and mechanical glitches.

U.S. denies violent clashes in disruptive strike at U.S. bases in
</HEADLINE>
Turkey &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ The United States sought to calm tensions
Tuesday in a 3-week-old strike that has disrupted life at U.S.
military bases across Turkey, denying reports of violent clashes
between Americans and the 1,400 striking Turkish workers.
	   Turkish media have reported several confrontations between U.S.
servicemen and women and Turks since the strike started July 23,
including physical and verbal attacks by Americans at the Incirlik
air base in southern Turkey.
	   ``All allegations of violent actions by U.S. servicemen at
Incirlik, such as assaults, have been thoroughly investigated, and
have proven to be unfounded,'' the United States said in a
statement released by its consulate in Adana, 10 kilometers (6
miles) from Incirlik.
	   Incirlik is the base for U.S. and British patrol flights over
the no-fly zone in northern Iraq.
	   The strike has shut down the commissary, gas station, dining
halls and other facilities at Incirlik. Services at bases in the
cities of Ankara and Izmir also have been interrupted.
	   ``The U.S. Air Force has made a very generous offer regarding
wages, benefits and working conditions,'' the consulate said,
saying Americans were offering double the average wages in the
area.
	   The strikers are demanding that salaries be raised every three
months in line with inflation, now running around 70 percent, as
well as compensation for earlier pay cuts and fringe benefits. They
rejected the latest U.S. offer last week and negotiations have been
deadlocked since.

Hamas leader: whoever bombed US embassies acted in `self-defense'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By IBRAHIM BARZAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ The spiritual leader of the radical
Islamic group Hamas said Tuesday he does not know who was behind
the bombing of two U.S. embassies in East Africa, but that whoever
was responsible acted in ``self-defense.''
	   ``America has placed itself by the side of Israel against the
Arab and Muslim world,'' Sheik Ahmed Yassin told The Associated
Press in an interview. ``So it should be no surprise when people
seek revenge against this unjust American policy.''
	   Friday's nearly simultaneous attacks on American embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania claimed at least 217 lives _ including 12
Americans _ and injured nearly 5,000. The bombing in Nairobi was
the deadliest attack ever on a U.S. embassy.
	   Asked about the bombings, the 62-year-old sheik said: ``I
consider what happened self-defense by someone who was seeking
revenge for the injustice of American policy and the destruction it
has brought on their country.''
	   There has been no claim of responsibility in the attacks, but
Israeli and U.S. officials have said they were looking into
possible involvement by exiled Islamic militant and Saudi financier
Osama bin Laden.
	   Yassin said Hamas knew nothing of the bombers' identity.
	   ``We have no information if bin Laden stands or does not stand
behind these bombings,'' he said. ``We have nothing to do with
Osama...He is not in our country.''
	   The sheik scoffed at U.S. investigators, saying ``American
intelligence is deluded _ they do not know who their enemy is.''
However, he explicitly denied any Hamas involvement in the attacks.
	   ``We are not willing to open fire on America,'' he said. ``Our
battle is on the land of Palestine and we will not take it outside
... because it does not serve our cause or our people.''
	   Hamas is an implacable opponent of the Oslo peace accords and
demands the handover of all Israel to the Palestinians.
	   Yassin, who was freed from Israeli prison nearly a year ago,
returned to Gaza in June after a 3 1/2-month fundraising tour in
the Middle East. During the trip, he called repeatedly for a return
to the armed struggle against Israel.
	   The last suicide bombing in Israel was nearly a year ago. Yassin
said Hamas has not carried out any attacks lately not because of
any ideological change but ``due to circumstances in the field ...
the fighters are facing.''
	   ``This is because the Israeli, Palestinian and American
intelligence are all working together against the activities of our
sons,'' Yassin said. Hamas, he said, ``will continue its jihad...It
had not laid down its weapons.''

Neste six-month profit falls to dlrs 47 million
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Citing lower crude oil prices, the
Neste oil and gas group said Tuesday that its six-month pretax
profit fell to 255 million markkaa (dlrs 47 million) from 460
million markkaa in 1997.
	   Net sales during January to June also dropped, to 19.8 billion
markkaa (dlrs 3.6 billion), from 22.3 billion markkaa during the
same period last year.
	   The company said it expects the pretax profit for 1998 to reach
last year's figures, despite the low prices of crude oil.
	   In 1997, Neste's pretax profit increased by 73 percent to 983
million markkaa (dlrs 182 million).
	   Earlier this year, Neste joined a merger with Finnish power
company IVO, and is now a subsidiary of Helsinki based Fortum.
	   The merger came as an attempt to strengthen the companies'
position in European markets.
	   Neste, which is more than 90 percent state-owned, is active in
oil refining, energy and chemicals. It employs 9,000 people in more
than 30 countries.

Doctors in Vladivostok may join ambulance strike
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS 8th graf to UPDATE with miners' standoff against police
in Chelyabinsk. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   VLADIVOSTOK, Russia (AP) _ Hospital workers in Russia's Far East
threatened Tuesday to join local ambulance staff in a strike that
has already drastically cut emergency medical services in the port
city of Vladivostok.
	   More than 300 doctors and other employees from the city's
Infectious Disease and Psychiatric Hospitals said they would walk
out by the end of the week if they don't get months of back wages.
	   They would join ambulance workers, who stopped work Aug. 4 and
reduced emergency help in Vladivostok, a city of 800,000 people, to
four ambulance crews. The city normally has 30 working ambulances.
	   ``We don't want to terrorize the city,'' said Dr. Lyudmila
Lebedeva, chairwoman of the Infectious Disease Hospital. ``However,
the damage to the morale of our staff is too much. They expect us
to heal our patients only with kind words and no medications.''
	   She said funding for basic medical equipment and supplies at the
hospital was non-existent, and staffing has been cut by more than
one-third over the past year.
	   Regional Gov. Yevgeny Nazdratenko and Mayor Victor Cherepkov,
who have been locked in a long-standing political feud for years,
both say the other should pay for emergency medical services.
	   Millions of workers receive their salaries months late in
Russia, part of a cycle of non-payments that plagues the Russian
economy.
	   Meanwhile, more than 1,000 police kept striking miners in the
central Siberian region of Chelyabinsk from halting traffic on the
Trans-Siberian railroad Tuesday. The 100 miners had a daylong
standoff with police, who were armed only with truncheons, the
Interfax news agency said. No violence was reported.
	   Meanwhile, striking workers at a motor works in the central city
of Yaroslavl have forced the plant's main assembly line to shut
down. Three plants in the city and four in Belarus may have to halt
work because of the stoppage, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   And leaders at a major strip mine in the Far Eastern Chita
region threatened Tuesday to stop shipping coal to a number of
power plants power plants that have not paid debts now totaling
over 500 million rubles (dlrs 80 million), ITAR-Tass said.

Police identify substance in tea poisoning case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The poison that sickened 10 Japanese company
employees after they drank tea brewed from the same water pot was a
toxic sodium compound that affects the central nervous system,
police said Tuesday.
	   Police still had no clues to who might have put the chemical in
the pot, which had been filled with water between Friday night and
Monday, they added.
	   The 10 workers at Xyence Co., a wood preservative company in
Niigata, 256 kilometers (159 miles) northwest of Tokyo, were
hospitalized Monday after suffering nausea and numbness during
their morning tea break.
	   The case gave Japan another shock two weeks after curry laced
with cyanide and arsenic killed four people at a festival in
southwestern Japan. It also raised fears of copycat attacks.
	   Lab tests on the tea revealed traces of sodium azide, a chemical
used in many industrial products, including air-bag mechanisms,
said police spokesman Masashi Toma.
	   The victims of the poisoning were in stable condition, but three
suffered mild liver disorders Tuesday, said Yasuo Hirose, an
official at the Niigata City Hospital.
	   The March 1995 nerve gas attack on Tokyo subways carried out by
the Aum Shinri Kyo religious cult has made Japan particularly wary
of poisoning incidents. The subway gassing killed 12 people.

Four policemen killed in Georgia's breakaway province
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with Russian Foreign Ministry's calls for Georgia and
Abkhazia to uphold peace agreements in grafs 3-5, Abkhazian
estimates on number of people killed by Georgians in 7th graf.

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Gunmen loyal to Georgia's government
ambushed a patrol vehicle in the country's breakaway Abkhazia
region Tuesday, killing four policemen, a news agency said.
	   The attackers fired automatic rifles at the Abkhazian police
car, which was patrolling the restive Ghali district. One policeman
was also seriously wounded in the ambush, Interfax reported.
	   A Russian Foreign Ministry statement released after the attack
called on Georgia and Abkhazia to uphold peace agreements drafted
after their 1993 war, in which separatist in Abkhazia drove out
Georgian troops and ethnic Georgian civilians.
	   Russia is ``particularly concerned by the growing number of
sabotages and terrorist acts against Abkhazian policemen,'' the
statement said, according to Interfax.
	   ``Such actions may provoke a retaliation by Abkhazia and a new
breakout of violence in the conflict zone,'' the statement said.
	   Violence has occurred sporadically since the 13-month struggle
in Abkhazia, located on the northwest coast of the Black Sea,
despite the presence of Russian peacekeepers in the region.
	   Abkhazia's Interior Ministry said in a statement Tuesday that
Georgian militants have killed 24 people this summer in the Ghali
district, among them 13 Abkhazian soldiers, five Russian
peacekeepers, and six civilians, Interfax reported.
	   Earlier in the day, Abkhazian gunmen opened fire at residential
homes, wounding one person, officials said.
	   Ten Abkhazian separatists crossed into the Zugdidi region under
the cover of darkness and rained down grenades and automatic weapon
fire on surrounding homes, said Dali Dzhodzhua, a spokeswoman for
Abkhazia's pro-Georgian government-in-exile.
	   Georgian troops returned fire, forcing the gunmen to flee. Five
houses were burned down in the skirmish, Dzhodzhua said.

Leading Acropolis restorer dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Alekos Papanikolaou, one of the architects
who led major restoration works on the Acropolis, has died, the
government announced Tuesday. He was 49.
	   Papanikolaou died Monday of pneumonia, but he also had been
suffering from cancer, the culture ministry said.
	   Papanikolaou led the nearly nine-year restoration of the
Erechtheion, a temple atop the Acropolis dedicated to the goddess
Athena and the god Poseidon. The restoration, completed in 1987,
won two international awards.
	   For the next six years, he concentrated on the restructuring of
the visitors' entrance to the Acropolis, while also participating
in research on other ancient sites.
	   He also organized exhibitions concerning the Acropolis around
Europe between 1983 and 1993.
	   Born in the far northeastern town of Komotini, Papanikolaou
studied architecture at Athens Polytechnic. He graduated in 1972
and was hired three years later at the Acropolis technical office.
	   He is survived by his wife and three children.
	   Funeral arrangements were not immediately available.

Young princes won't be involved in Diana's charity trust
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prince William and Prince Harry will not become
involved in running a charity set up by Princess Diana, Buckingham
Palace said Tuesday.
	   Newspapers had speculated that Diana's sons would be asked to
become patrons of the little publicized charity, worth about 1
million pounds (dlrs 1.63 million).
	   A palace spokeswoman, speaking on customary anonymity, said she
could not confirm whether the charity trustees had written to
William, 16, and Harry, 13, to ask them to become patrons.
	   But she added, ``They are not going to be running the Princess
of Wales Charities' Trust. That is completely wrong.''
	   Members of the royal family choose not to personally benefit
from fees that might normally be paid to them for such things as
speeches, written articles and book royalties. The proceeds go into
trusts and are distributed to charities.
	   Diana's trust, set up in 1981, the year she married Prince
Charles, gave to more than 100 charities, including Great Ormond
Street Hospital, a domestic violence assistance project and a
women's center.
	   Nearly a year after her death, trustees are trying to determine
how the fund should now be run.

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Investigators began to piece together
evidence from last week's U.S. Embassy bombings Tuesday, with a
Kenyan guard's eyewitness account providing possibly important
clues and 14 arrests in Tanzania.
	   Twin terrorist bombings in Kenya and Tanzania claimed at least
217 lives and injured nearly 5,000, and the death toll was rising.
	   Another 15 bodies were pulled from the rubble in Nairobi
Tuesday, bringing the death toll here to 207, Red Cross spokeswoman
Nina Galbe said.
	   The stench of rotting flesh seeped from the heaped concrete and
steel in which Kenyan Maj. Gen. George Agoi said he spotted another
six bodies, which are not included in the tally.
	   In Tanzania, 14 foreigners were arrested in connection with the
bombing of the Dar es Salaam embassy that claimed 10 Africans'
lives, said police spokesman Aden Mwanunyange.
	   Those arrested include six Sudanese, six Iraqis, one Somali and
Turk, he said without elaborating. The Home Ministry, which
oversees police, said all together 30 people have been detained for
questioning.
	   The East African Standard said guard Joash Okindo and his
colleagues, armed only with short wooden clubs, confronted five
men, stopping them at a barrier to the embassy's front parking lot,
and forcing them to turn into the rear parking lot.
	   The attackers then jumped from the truck and opened fire with
automatic rifles. At least one Marine returned fire and one of the
attackers threw a hand grenade. Moments later, the truck exploded,
Okindo told the Kenya Television Network Monday.
	   ``We saved people's lives by sending it to the rear entrance,''
Okindo told the Standard. ``If we hadn't done that, I don't think I
would be alive and talking to you now.''
	   The Standard said it talked to Okindo before he was taken out of
the country on a U.S. medical evacuation flight to Germany for
treatment of serious wounds.
	   ``He resisted heroically,'' U.S. State Department spokesman
James Foley said in Washington.
	   At the wreckage of the Dar es Salaam embassy, a dozen FBI
agents, some wearing blue caps with FBI on the visors, swept and
raked Laibon Road in front of the embassy building, collecting and
sifting through debris in their search for evidence.
	   Israel army radio also signaled a possible break in the cases.
In a report from Nairobi, it said investigators suspect the bombers
used the sophisticated plastic explosive Semtex.
	   Capt. Rhyl Jones, garrison engineer of the British Army in Kenya
who has surveyed the wreckage, estimated the bomb could have
contained up to 250 kilograms (550 pounds) of explosives, depending
on what type was used.
	   ``My opinion is that it was defininitely a commercial explosive.
This wasn't a homemade device,'' said Jones, who has investigated
bombings by the Irish Republican Army in Britain.
	   The FBI says finding out what kind of explosives were used and
how would be critical to the investigation.
	   So would an informant, and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
on Monday offered a dlrs 2 million reward for information leading
to the capture of the ``cowards that committed this act.''
	   Meanwhile, Israeli soldiers, the first professional
search-and-rescue team to reach Nairobi after the bombing,
continued to dig for a woman named Rose.
	   Her voice fell silent Sunday, but they heard a tapping noise
Monday morning that spurred them on. At nightfall, however, there'd
been nothing but silence for hours.
	   Brig. Gen. Ilan Harari, chief of the Israeli rescue team, told
Israel radio chances were slim that there are other survivors,
``but we are acting on the premise that there might be someone
alive, otherwise we would just bring in bulldozers and simply
remove that building.''
	   No one has been pulled alive out of the rubble since Saturday.
	   The bombing in Nairobi was the deadliest attack ever on a U.S.
Embassy. A dozen Americans at the embassy died.
	   The bodies of 11 of them began their last journey home on Monday
when their flag-draped coffins were loaded onto a military
transport plane headed for Germany. Albright is expected to
accompany the dead back to the United States on Thursday.
	   The 12th, who was married to a Kenyan, will be buried in her
adopted homeland.
	   The vast majority of victims were in Nairobi, where university
students marched to the bomb site Monday in a candlelight vigil.
	   ``Go Fight Americans in America,'' said one sign.
	   The United States is a favorite target of militant Islamic
fundamentalists and many ordinary people here feel Kenya got caught
in the cross fire of a battle that isn't theirs.
	   ``We will not confirm or deny the existence of evidence in this
criminal inquiry,'' said an American diplomat in Dar es Salaam,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   In Nairobi, the head of the Kenyan side of the investigation,
Agoi, said he hadn't even talked to the FBI.
	   ``The Americans are here handling their side, and we are
handling our side,'' he said.
	   The rescue efforts _ haphazard at first _ may have destroyed
evidence at the two bomb sites, but U.S. officials said it was
inevitable because the victims came first.
	   ``Obviously, the first priority is finding people alive and then
to recover bodies,'' said U.S. Embassy spokesman Chris Scharf.
	   The United States is bringing in a Navy Seabees construction
battalion in the next few days to help with the recovery.
	   ``If there are still missing victims, that will be their first
priority,'' said Navy Cmdr. Gordon Hume.
	   The Seabees are part of a 200-strong U.S. military task force
deployed in Nairobi. The task force includes a 20-person medical
team and a crisis response team to counsel people, Hume said.

<TEXT>
	   NEUVILLE SAINT-VAAST, France (AP) _ A British military officer
died of asphyxiation Tuesday while trying to find the entrance to a
World War I underground tunnel.
	   The victim, a lieutenant colonel in his 40s, was crawling
through a hole in the ground that he had dug when the earth above
him gave way, local firemen said.
	   His name was not released.
	   The accident occurred in Neuville Saint-Vaast, near Arras in
northern France.
	   The victim was accompanied by another British military official,
who was unharmed.

Northern Territory will become Australia's seventh state, says
</HEADLINE>
Howard &QL; 
 &UR; By ROHAN SULLIVAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australia will gain a seventh state at
the turn of the millennium under a plan to upgrade the Northern
Territory, announced Tuesday by Prime Minister John Howard.
	   If the plan is approved at a referendum by its 190,000
residents, the territory will become the first Australian state
created since 1901, when six self-governing colonies federated,
becoming states in a unified country, creating the national
Parliament and adopting a federal constitution.
	   The states retained their own parliaments and constitutions.
	   Under Howard's plan, the Northern Territory, a 1.3
million-square-mile (3.3 million-square-kilometer) patch of Outback
stretching from Australia's central deserts to its tropical north
coast, would be granted the full rights of a state under the
constitution by an act of the federal Parliament.
	   The existing Northern Territory parliament would be given
greater legislative powers and the new state would have greater
weight in national referenda.
	   But because it has a population much smaller than the other
states, the new state would have only three representatives in the
national Parliament's upper house, the Senate, compared to 12
guaranteed to the other states by the constitution.
	   Details of the plan involving the transfer of legislative powers
in controversial areas such as uranium mining and Aboriginal land
rights, where the federal government currently retains control, are
yet to be disclosed.
	   Howard's timetable would have the Northern Territory become a
state on the 100th anniversary of federation, Jan. 1, 2001.
	   ``I have no doubt that this will help to revitalize and
reinvigorate the Australian federation,'' Howard said Tuesday. ``I
regard today's announcement as a very, very important investment in
the future of Australia into the new millennium.
	   ``It is a historic decision by the commonwealth government.''
	   The Northern Territory became known around the world when the
local parliament passed the world's first euthanasia laws, under
which four people committed medically assisted suicide before the
laws were overridden by the federal Parliament.
	   If the statehood deal includes withdrawal of the federal
Parliament's power to override territory legislation, the Northern
Territory may be able to reinstate, or reintroduce to parliament,
its euthanasia laws. While inactive, they have never been removed
from the statute books.
	   Australia has one other territory, the District of Colombia-like
Australian Capital Territory. Both were created after federation,
but are self-governing and have a fiscal relationship with the
federal government similar to that of the states.

Detained activists in Myanmar receive visit, reported OK
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with visits by Thai and Malaysian diplomats,
trims &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Foreign democracy activists detained by
Myanmar's military regime for handing out anti-government leaflets
are faring well, diplomats said Tuesday, but it remained undecided
whether the 18 would be tried.
	   Visits to the detainees were allowed Tuesday, three days after
the arrests, by diplomats from the United States, the Philippines,
Thailand, Malaysia and Australia.
	   A U.S. Embassy spokeswoman said two consular officers took books
and snacks from the embassy commissary to the 90-minute meeting
with six Americans held at the Yangon police headquarters.
	   ``Their health is OK,'' said the spokeswoman, speaking on
condition of anonymity. ``They are eating fine. They've been
receiving Chinese vegetarian food. They are not complaining about
their treatment.''
	   One U.S. activist, Nisha Marie Anand, 21, a student, is a
vegetarian and has cited her diet as a health concern.
	   A Thai Foreign Ministry spokesman said one of its diplomats
visited for an hour with the three Thais in detention, who said
they were being treated well.
	   The three were being kept in separate rooms that had served as
offices, with beds added along with mosquito nets, said Kobsak
Chutikul.
	   Because one of the Thais had complained of back pains and
another was running out of medicine for a thyroid condition,
Myanmar authorities agreed to allow the Thai Embassy to send a
doctor to them Wednesday, he said.
	   He said questioning of the three had been concluded, but there
was no indication of what authorities planned to do with them.
	   The U.S. Embassy spokeswoman declined to comment on whether and
how the detainees were being questioned. Myanmar authorities have
said the 18 foreigners are being interrogated as part of
investigations to determine if a legal case should be brought.
	   ``The six Americans expressed concern about how the case will be
resolved,'' the spokeswoman said. ``The embassy has been told it's
not been decided yet.''
	   Government officials earlier denied reports that the ruling
State Peace and Development Council had already decided to charge
and try the activists, saying no ruling had been made. Deportation
was still an option.
	   The reports panicked supporters and family members of the
activists meeting in Bangkok, Thailand.
	   Aside from the Americans and Thais, the detainees include three
Malaysians, three Indonesians, two Philippine citizens and an
Australian. It was unclear whether the Indonesians were getting
visits Tuesday.
	   The 18 were apprehended in downtown Yangon and at the airport
Sunday. They were urging people to remember a 1988 uprising against
military rule and to not give up.
	   In Manila, 30 human rights activists, some holding placards
reading ``Democracy for Burma,'' picketed the Myanmar Embassy. They
attempted to deliver a letter but were stopped by guards.
	   The Myanmar ambassador to the Philippines told reporters the
detainees were not cooperating with the Myanmar investigators.
	   Officials said they want to discourage leafleting and that the
activists broke laws, including a printing act and an emergency
law. The catchall emergency law can carry a 10-year sentence and is
frequently used against political opponents.
	   A statement from the Myanmar Embassy in London accused them of
acting at the behest of people ``pushing the country down into
hellish pits.''
	   The reference was to opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, winner
of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, and her National League for
Democracy. They have set an Aug. 21 deadline for the government to
finally convene a parliament elected in 1990.
	   The opposition overwhelmingly won the election, but the
military, which has ruled Myanmar since 1962 and tolerates almost
no dissent, refused to relinquish power.
	   The 18 activists entered Myanmar as tourists on the eve of the
10th anniversary of the Aug. 8, 1988, uprising, which resulted in a
change of leaders but was eventually crushed. An estimated 3,000
people died.
	   No unrest by Myanmar's own people was reported on the
anniversary.

Branch of One Nation being investigated for fraud, police say
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ Right-wing populist Pauline Hanson's One
Nation party is being investigated for fraud after complaints from
several expelled members, police said Tuesday.
	   The Major Fraud Squad of Western Australia state's police, the
state Director of Public Prosecutions and the Australian Electoral
Commission are assessing a complaint by disgruntled members that
they were defrauded of membership fees, a police spokeswoman said.
	   The complaint was lodged last Wednesday by a One Nation member
on behalf of several party colleagues, she said. Exact details of
the complaint are not clear.
	   Detective Inspector Gary Budge said a decision was likely later
this week on whether the allegations were strong enough to justify
a full investigation, leading to the possible laying of charges.
	   ``The major fraud squad are currently assessing a number of
documents which have been supplied ... to determine if they have a
legitimate case of fraud,'' Budge told the Australian Broadcasting
Corp.
	   The allegations relate to funds from a One Nation branch in
Mandurah, south of Perth.
	   Two months ago, One Nation deregistered, then re-established the
branch after internal dissent.

Hundreds of illegal immigrants to be released

 &UR; EDS: ADDS background graf after 8th graf, Under the etc, on reasons

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Hundreds of illegal immigrants will likely be
released from detention centers this week, despite a rush Tuesday
to try to complete their processing for expulsion and a new law
meant to avoid exactly such a development.
	   ``In Italy you make a law, and right away you find a loophole,''
one police officer says to another in a front-page editorial
cartoon in Tuesday's Corriere della Sera, a Milan daily.
	   The looming release over the next three days of more than 600
arrivals, most of them Africans, has prompted the center-right
opposition to accuse Premier Romano Prodi's government of failing
to crack down on illegal immigration.
	   And the release, which virtually gives the immigrants a green
light to wander through Italy and northern Europe in search of
black-market jobs or relatives, was likely to only confirm northern
European partners' fears that Schengen members just can't depend on
Rome.
	   Schengen Treaty members have open borders among them, which is
why the treaty requires that external borders be properly
patrolled.
	   It was anger from Germany and other northern European nations
last fall, after hundreds of Kurds made it to Italian shores, that
led to the new law, which was supposed to tighten controls on
illegal arrivals.
	   Under the new legislation, clandestine immigrants were to kept
in detention centers for up to 30 days while their identity and
nationality were ascertained. Then those with no legal grounds for
staying in Italy, such as eligibility for political asylum or a
confirmed job, were to be shipped or flown back to their home
countries.
	   Under the old system, there were no detention centers.
Immigrants were merely given papers ordering them to leave the
country in 15 days, a virtual ticket to wander freely.
	   The new system started having problems after some of the home
countries, especially Tunisia, balked at taking back the
immigrants.
	   After more than 3,000 illegal immigrants sailed aboard
smugglers' boats from northern African since July, Rome rushed to
sign accords with Tunisia and other countries giving development
aid in exchange for promptly taking arrivals back.
	   Complicating deportation is the widespread practice by the
immigrants of deliberately arriving without documents to make
processing longer.
	   The first illegal immigrants likely to be released starting
Wednesday from the centers in Sicily and the southern mainland were
88 people being held in Trapani, western Sicily.

Police arrest 14 in Tanzanian embassy bombing

<TEXT>
	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ Police, working with the FBI,
arrested 14 foreigners in connection with the terrorist bombing of
the U.S. Embassy in Tanzania, a police spokesman said Tuesday.
	   Arrested were six Sudanese, six Iraqis, one Somali and Turk,
said police spokesman Aden Mwanunyange, citing ``dubious characters
and intelligence information that they may have taken part in the
incident.''
	   They are being questioned to see if they were involved in the
terrorist car-bomb attack on the U.S. Embassy in Dar es Salaam
Friday that killed 10 Africans, he said.
	   Including those arrested, 30 people have been detained, said
Home Minister Ali Ameir Mohamed, who oversees police work.
	   ``We cannot say we have got somebody who is really
responsible,'' Ameir told The Associated Press, adding that no
charges have been fired.
	   Nonetheless, ``we think we are doing well,'' he said.
	   More than 200 people were killed in a nearly simultaneous attack
on the U.S. Embassy in neighboring Kenya. Officials have not
commented publicly on whether anyone has been arrested in
connection with the Nairobi bombing, the worst attack on a U.S.
Embassy.
	   Tanzanian police and a team of FBI and counter-terrorism experts
who flew in from the United States were both interrogating the
suspects in Dar es Salaam, Ameir said.
	   U.S., Kenyan and Tanzanian investigators have refused to discuss
any evidence they may have recovered from the blast sites, and have
not pinpointed any one group. U.S. officials have said, however,
that the exiled Saudi financier Osama bin Laden is one potential
suspect.
	   The FBI began investigating the bomb site Tuesday after two days
of studying the bodies and autopsy reports, Ameir said.
	   Ameir said local people could have helped foreigners carry out
such an attack, but he did not believe that Tanzanians were fully
responsible ``for such a horrible thing.''
	   Police have tightened security at the country's exit points in
case the bombers are still in the country and try to leave, he
said.
	   A German man was detained briefly trying to leave the country
with pieces of metals from the site of Friday's blast, Ameir said.
He was released after convincing police he bought the fragments as
souvenirs from a Tanzanian boy, Ameir said.

England moves up world rankings after test series triumph
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HEREFORDSHIRE, England (AP) _ The English cricket team moved up
one place to No. 6 in the unofficial world test cricket rankings
after its 2-1 series victory over South Africa.
	   England won the fifth and deciding test against South Africa at
Headingley on Monday and overtook Sri Lanka on the Wisden World
Championship.
	   The world-famous cricket almanac started its test rankings in
1996 and published a revised list Tuesday.
	   The Wisden rankings are based on the most recent test series,
home and away, between each pair of countries.
	   Australia is a long way ahead in No.1 spot, followed by the West
Indies, South Africa, Pakistan, India and England.
	   Sri Lanka, Zimbabwe and New Zealand fill the last three places.
	   However, England could still drop back to seventh place if it
draws or loses its one-off test to Sri Lanka at the Oval in late
August.

Ukrainian officials deny Ukrainian mafia links with the Taliban
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian officials on Tuesday denied
allegations that the country's criminal groups were supplying
weapons to Taliban troops in Afghanistan.
	   ``It's a very serious statement, which has no serious grounds,''
said Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuriy Yarmylko.
	   Yarmylko was responding to recent statements by Afghanistan's
ambassadors to the United Nations and Russia that the Ukrainian
``mafia'' was supplying aircraft, tanks and other weapons to the
Taliban fighters through Pakistan.
	   The Taliban Islamic militia is fighting for the last 15 percent
of Afghanistan not already under its control. It has imposed a
strict version of Islam, barring most women from work and girls
from school, banning music and directing men to grow beards.

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ The head of a visiting U.S.
congressional delegation said Tuesday it would be ``premature'' for
the Palestinians to declare statehood in May 1999.
	   Rep. Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y., and six other congressmen visited
the Palestinian legislature and met with its speaker, Ahmed Qureia,
to discuss developments in the Mideast peace process.
	   Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat has repeatedly
said he will declare Palestinian statehood in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip on May 4, 1999 _ the deadline for the PLO and Israel to
reach a final peace treaty, under the Israel-Palestinian peace
accords.
	   Such a declaration ``would be premature because it depends on
how much progress we have made toward peace,'' Solomon said.
	   Qureia said the decision of whether to declare statehood was
``still being studied'' and would depend on what happened in the
peace process before then.
	   Qureia said the United States should publicly blame Israel for
the stalling of the peace process, an idea rejected by Solomon.
	   ``The United States wants to be as helpful as it can without
dictating,'' he said.
	   Qureia said progress on the Palestinian track would lead to
progress in peacemaking with Lebanon and Syria.
	   The meeting was part of a congressional exchange program
initiated by Rep. Newt Gingrich during his May visit. Last month,
Qureia headed a delegation of Palestinian legislators to
Washington.
	   Solomon said the meeting was ``extremely important because the
U.S. Congress needs to understand the Palestinian problem.''
	   The congressional delegation will also travel to Turkey and
central Asia to discuss NATO expansion and to China and South Korea
to discuss the financial situation in Southeast Asia.
	   In addition to Solomon, the delegation included Esteban Torres,
D-Calif., Paul Gilmor, R-Ohio, Dan Miller, R-Fla., Vito Fossella,
R-N.Y., Peter Deutsch, D-Fla., and Alcee Hastings, D-Fla.

Slovak opposition assails ruling party
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Slovakia's largest opposition group
accused the ruling party of trying to remove its competition in
next month's elections with its court bid to strip its party
registration.
	   The move this week by Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar's Movement
for a Democratic Slovakia was a desperate ``cry in the dark,''
Ernest Valko, legal expert for the opposition Slovak Democratic
Coalition (SDK), said Tuesday.
	   The opposition group, which has the best chance of beating
Meciar in Sept. 25-26 parliamentary elections and ousting the
authoritarian ruler from power, is made up of five parties.
	   On Monday, Meciar's party appealed to the Slovak Supreme Court
to overturn the group's party registration, calling it unlawful and
saying it should be registered as a coalition instead.
	   Such a ruling would hurt the opposition's chances of getting all
five of its parties into parliament. Under an amended new election
law established this year at the ruling party's urging, a party
must get 5 percent of the vote in order to enter parliament. One
opposition party, the Social Democratic Party of Slovakia, is
unlikely to reach that number.
	   ``The fact that they have appealed for SDK's change into a
coalition is unlawful in itself,'' said Valko, the last chairman of
the Czechoslovak Constitutional Court. ``The court can take the
registration away, but it cannot register the political party as
something else.''
	   The court has until the end of the week to make a decision.
	   Recent polls showed the opposition gaining on Meciar's party and
running almost even.

Hamas leader: whoever bombed US embassies acted in `self-defense'
</HEADLINE>

discounted, sted no claim of responsiblity &QL;

 &UR; By IBRAHIM BARZAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ The spiritual leader of the radical
Islamic group Hamas said Tuesday he does not know who was behind
the bombing of two U.S. embassies in East Africa, but that whoever
was responsible acted in ``self-defense.''
	   ``America has placed itself by the side of Israel against the
Arab and Muslim world,'' Sheik Ahmed Yassin told The Associated
Press in an interview. ``So it should be no surprise when people
seek revenge against this unjust American policy.''
	   Friday's nearly simultaneous attacks on American embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania claimed at least 217 lives _ including 12
Americans _ and injured nearly 5,000. The bombing in Nairobi was
the deadliest attack ever on a U.S. embassy.
	   Asked about the bombings, the 62-year-old sheik said: ``I
consider what happened self-defense by someone who was seeking
revenge for the injustice of American policy and the destruction it
has brought on their country.''
	   Authorities so far have discounted claims of responsibility from
previously unknown groups, including one from the Army for the
Liberation of Islamic Shrines and another statement bearing the
name of the Islamic Army for the Liberation of Holy Shrines.
	   Israeli and U.S. officials have said they were looking into
possible involvement by exiled Islamic militant and Saudi financier
Osama bin Laden.
	   Yassin said Hamas knew nothing of the bombers' identity.
	   ``We have no information if bin Laden stands or does not stand
behind these bombings,'' he said. ``We have nothing to do with
Osama...He is not in our country.''
	   The sheik scoffed at U.S. investigators, saying ``American
intelligence is deluded _ they do not know who their enemy is.''
However, he explicitly denied any Hamas involvement in the attacks.
	   ``We are not willing to open fire on America,'' he said. ``Our
battle is on the land of Palestine and we will not take it outside
... because it does not serve our cause or our people.''
	   Hamas is an implacable opponent of the Oslo peace accords and
demands the handover of all Israel to the Palestinians.
	   Yassin, who was freed from Israeli prison nearly a year ago,
returned to Gaza in June after a 3 1/2-month fundraising tour in
the Middle East. During the trip, he called repeatedly for a return
to the armed struggle against Israel.
	   The last suicide bombing in Israel was nearly a year ago. Yassin
said Hamas has not carried out any attacks lately not because of
any ideological change but ``due to circumstances in the field ...
the fighters are facing.''
	   ``This is because the Israeli, Palestinian and American
intelligence are all working together against the activities of our
sons,'' Yassin said. Hamas, he said, ``will continue its jihad...It
had not laid down its weapons.''

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ An Indonesian newspaper urged
Myanmar's military regime Tuesday to release one of its
correspondents and two other Indonesians being detained in Myanmar.
	   Jakarta Post reporter R. Fadjri and the two others _ Sulaiman
Haikal and Christian Evert _ were detained Sunday in Yangon along
with 15 other foreigners for handing out leaflets promoting human
rights and democracy.
	   In a letter to Myanmar's ambassador to Indonesia, Nyi Nyi Than,
the Jakarta Post said the presence of Fadjri in Myanmar was to
promote the universally accepted freedom of expression as a
prerequisite for democracy.
	   ``Through this letter, we appeal to you to do your utmost to
ensure the release of Mr. Fadjri and the two other Indonesians at
the first opportunity,'' it added.
	   It said a prolonged detention of the activists ``can cause
irreparable damage to the reputation'' of Myanmar's government, and
``undermine the relations between Burma and the rest of the
world.'' Myanmar also is known as Burma.
	   The other detainees include six Americans, three Thais, three
Malaysians, two Filipinos and an Australian.

Hezbollah guerrilla infiltrates Israeli base in south Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's army is investigating an incident in
which a Hezbollah guerrilla successfully infiltrated a base in
south Lebanon held by Israeli paratroopers.
	   The guerrilla, armed with an automatic rifle and two grenades,
slipped into the base at Sujoud unnoticed on Sunday, then got into
a fistfight with a paratrooper who encountered him, the army
spokesman's office said Tuesday.
	   After the paratrooper called for help, a second paratrooper shot
and wounded the guerrilla, who threw down the rifle and grenades
and fled.
	   The army was investigating how the paratroopers failed to notice
the guerrilla as he approached in broad daylight, and how the
infiltrator got away.
	   Israel occupies a strip of land in south Lebanon to prevent
attacks on its northern border by Hezbollah and other guerrilla
groups. The guerrillas are trying to oust Israeli forces from the
strip.

on Tuesday accused Israel of stalling in the Middle East peace
process.
	   ``It seems to us that all that (Israeli President Benjamin)
Netanyahu is doing is to try to buy time to implement his programs,
rather than to work for peace for the whole Middle East region,''
Deputy President Thabo Mbeki was quoted as saying in an interview
with the South African Press Association.
	   Mbeki is the anointed successor to President Nelson Mandela who
plans to retire before next year's elections.
	   Arafat's three-day state visit began with a meeting with
Mandela, who awarded him South Africa's highest honor for
foreigners _ the Order of Good Hope.
	   Since apartheid ended with 1994's first all-race elections,
Mandela has rewarded other stalwart allies from the days of the
anti-apartheid struggle such as Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi and
former Indonesia President Suharto.
	   Arafat presented Mandela with the Star of Holy Jerusalem medal
while an official read a statement praising Mandela's role in
bringing democracy to South Africa and support for creating a
Palestinian state.
	   After their meeting, Arafat said he envisaged a role for Mandela
in the faltering Middle East peace process, but declined to expand
on his idea, SAPA reported.
	   Officials signed two declarations of intent for closer links in
health and education.
	   It was Arafat's first visit since South Africa and the
Palestinian autonomous government established diplomatic ties in
1995.
	   In a scene unthinkable under white rule, Arafat also held talks
with Marthinus van Schalkwyk, leader of the opposition National
Party which ruled during apartheid. Posing for photographers, the
two men shook hands and smiled broadly.
	   Arafat described the meeting as having gone ``very positively,''
while van Schalkwyk said: ``It shows that things can change.''
	   Accorded the formal welcome of a full head of state, Arafat
earlier inspected a military parade at the President's official
Tuynhuys offices in Parliament and stood to attention as a band
struck up the Palestinian national anthem.

Court rules against Jehovah's Witnesses seeking medical

reimbursement

<TEXT>
	   BARCELONA, Spain (AP) _ A court refused Tuesday to reimburse the
medical costs of a Jehovah's Witness couple who sought private
health care for their prematurely born son after turning down a
blood transfusion proposed by a state-run hospital.
	   Blood transfusions are prohibited in the Jehovah's Witness faith
on grounds that blood is sacred.
	   The Supreme Court of Catalonia in northeast Spain ruled that
while the state had to recognize religious beliefs, it did not have
to pay for specialized medical care necessitated by such beliefs,
the national news agency Efe reported.
	   The dispute began last year when the couple in the northeastern
Catalan town of Lleida had a prematurely born son with respiratory
trouble. Doctors asked for permission to carry out a blood
transfusion if it became necessary but the parents said no.
	   The couple, whose were not identified in the ruling, moved the
child to a private clinic where it was cared for without a
transfusion.
	   The court said the couple could have found a state hospital that
offered alternative treatment but they failed to look for one.

	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Riders' representatives met Tuesday
with top officials of cycling's international governing body to
discuss the sport's growing drug crisis.
	   Retired stars Miguel Indurain of Spain and Tony Rominger of
Switzerland were among eight representatives at an all-day meeting
held at Lausanne's lakeside Olympic Museum.
	   Also present were France's world champion Laurent Jalabert and
Luc Leblanc, both of whom pulled out of this year's scandal-plagued
Tour de France in protest at police investigations.
	   Duing the Tour, the Festina team was thrown out of the race and
six more teams withdrew protesting the investigations.
	   The International Cycling Union (UCI) met last Thursday in Paris
``to elaborate a number of ways to fight (doping) more
efficiently.''
	   That meeting produced no decisions, but the UCI is expected to
provide details of the meetings and announce new strategies to
combat doping Wednesday.
	   UCI President Hein Verbruggen and vice presidents Agostino Omini
and Daniel Baal attended Tuesday's meeting, along with Leon
Schattenberg, president of its anti-doping commission.
	   The other cyclists who attended were Italian Maurizio Fondriest,
French rider Stephen Heulot, Switzerland's Pascal Richard and Johan
Bruyneel of Belgium.

Russia hopes to make arms deals in Latin America
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's state arms exporter hopes to negotiate
large contracts with a number of Latin American countries, a news
agency reported Tuesday.
	   Moscow's arms sales fell in the region after the collapse of the
Soviet Union, but Russia has been regaining ground since, said Yuri
Khozyainov, deputy general director of Rosvooruzheniya.
	   Russia is particularly interested in selling helicopters and
fighter planes in the region, Khozyainov said, according to
Interfax.
	   ``We are interested in demonstrating our aviation opportunities
to Latin America and are looking forward to securing lavish
contracts on the Latin American market, which is worth billions of
dollars, Khozyainov said.
	   Russia expects to export about dlrs 3.5 billion of weapons this
year and hopes to increase that figure to dlrs 8 billion by 2005,
Khozyainov said.

reimbursement
 &UR; Eds: FIXES typo in 5thgraf

<TEXT>
	   BARCELONA, Spain (AP) _ A court refused Tuesday to reimburse the
medical costs of a Jehovah's Witness couple who sought private
health care for their prematurely born son after turning down a
blood transfusion proposed by a state-run hospital.
	   Blood transfusions are prohibited in the Jehovah's Witness faith
on grounds that blood is sacred.
	   The Supreme Court of Catalonia in northeast Spain ruled that
while the state had to recognize religious beliefs, it did not have
to pay for specialized medical care necessitated by such beliefs,
the national news agency Efe reported.
	   The dispute began last year when the couple in the northeastern
Catalan town of Lleida had a prematurely born son with respiratory
trouble. Doctors asked for permission to carry out a blood
transfusion if it became necessary but the parents said no.
	   The couple, who were not identified in the ruling, moved the
child to a private clinic where it was cared for without a
transfusion.
	   The court said the couple could have found a state hospital that
offered alternative treatment but they failed to look for one.

Freeport workers in Indonesia strike for higher pay
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ About 5,000 workers of a huge gold and
copper mine in the Indonesian part of New Guinea have gone on
strike to demand higher pay.
	   The workers of Freeport Indonesia, a unit of the New
Orleans-based Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold Inc., were
disappointed over a recent 10 percent raise, the Antara news agency
reported Tuesday.
	   It quoted sources at the company in Timika, 3,452 kilometers
(2,157 miles) northeast of Jakarta, as saying the company
management in New Orleans had earlier promised an increase of 50
percent. It said the workers blamed company officials in Jakarta
and Timika for the smaller raise.
	   The strike began Monday at the production unit at its Grasberg
mining site and at its port in Amampare, about 90 kilometers (56
miles) from the production and mining center of Tembagapura.
	   Antara said thousands of other workers the company's contractors
and sub-contractors were expected to join the strike.
	   It quoted Deksi Peranginangin, an official at the regional
office of the Ministry of Manpower in Jayapura, the Irian Jaya
provincial capital, as saying a team from his office would leave
Wednesday for Timika to mediate in the dispute.
	   Last month, Adrianto Macribie, president-director of Freeport
Indonesia, denied claims that it had benefited from corruption,
collusion and cronyism under the regime of former President
Suharto.
	   Suharto quit on May 21 after a wave of riots and protests
against his 32-year authoritarian rule.
	   Freeport Indonesia, which pays Indonesia's largest tax bill and
has been active in Irian Jaya since the 1960s, has long been dogged
by controversy and allegations of collusion with Suharto.
	   Freeport McMoRan owns 81.28 percent of Freeport Indonesia and
the Indonesian government owns 9.36 percent. A minority stake in
the company is controlled by a charitable foundation headed by
Suharto.

Indian scientists modify furnaces to cut emissions that harm Taj
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By JAIDEEP MAZUMDAR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUCKNOW, India (AP) _ Scientists have designed a new type of
furnace that will help some 200 iron foundries near the Taj Mahal
cut gas emissions that make the mausoleum's white marble turn
yellow, an official said Tuesday.
	   The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, the premier
government research organization, found in a test that the
redesigned furnaces and the use of natural gas instead and water
sprinklers drastically cut emissions of sulfur dioxide, which
causes acid rain, said CSIR director-general R.A. Mashelkar.
	   In recent years, the Supreme Court has issued a series of orders
ranging from moving the foundries out of the area to planting more
trees to combat pollution in Agra, the city where the Taj Mahal is
located. The Taj Mahal is about 200 kilometers (125) miles south of
New Delhi.
	   Mashelkar said although foundry owners will have to spend more
money to convert their coal-burning furnaces, it will be cheaper
than moving out of Agra or shutting down.
	   The state and federal governments have agreed to pay some of the
money for buying the new equipment.
	   The new furnace and the associated technology were developed by
the state-run Indian National Metallurgical Laboratory.
	   The government hopes to install the new furnaces by the end of
the year, said S.N. Gupta, a CSIR scientist.
	   In April, the Archaeological Survey of India, UNESCO and the
Paris-based Rhone-Poulenc Foundation jointly launched a three-year
dlrs 236,000 preservation project to polish the once-white marble.
	   The waterproofing will use silicone-based products which should
help prevent the growth of algae and fungi.
	   Experts say the marble of the Taj Mahal has been stained by
pollution and its stones have been chipped, but the 17th-century
edifice is structurally sound.
	   The Taj Mahal was built by Mogul emperor Shah Jahan as a tomb
for his queen, Mumtaz Mahal, who died giving birth to their 14th
child. One of the Seven Wonders of the World, it draws three
million tourists annually.

Detained activists in Myanmar receive visit, reported OK
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with photos of detainees on state television in grafs
3-4; picks up 3rd graf pvs: `A U.S. Embassy... ' &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Foreign democracy activists detained by
Myanmar's military regime for handing out anti-government leaflets
are faring well, diplomats said Tuesday, but it remained undecided
whether the 18 would be tried.
	   Visits to the detainees were allowed Tuesday, three days after
the arrests, by diplomats from the United States, the Philippines,
Thailand, Malaysia and Australia.
	   State television on Tuesday night showed still photos of two
groups of detainees, looking smiling and relaxed over a meal. One
group was identified as Thais, and the people in the other were
unidentified.
	   The news reader said they were being ``treated well on
humanitarian grounds.''
	   A U.S. Embassy spokeswoman said two consular officers took books
and snacks from the embassy commissary to the 90-minute meeting
with six Americans held at the Yangon police headquarters.
	   ``Their health is OK,'' said the spokeswoman, speaking on
condition of anonymity. ``They are eating fine. They've been
receiving Chinese vegetarian food. They are not complaining about
their treatment.''
	   One U.S. activist, Nisha Marie Anand, 21, a student, is a
vegetarian and has cited her diet as a health concern.
	   A Thai Foreign Ministry spokesman said one of its diplomats
visited for an hour with the three Thais in detention, who said
they were being treated well.
	   The three were being kept in separate rooms that had served as
offices, with beds added along with mosquito nets, said Kobsak
Chutikul.
	   Because one of the Thais had complained of back pains and
another was running out of medicine for a thyroid condition,
Myanmar authorities agreed to allow the Thai Embassy to send a
doctor to them Wednesday, he said.
	   He said questioning of the three had been concluded, but there
was no indication of what authorities planned to do with them.
	   The U.S. Embassy spokeswoman declined to comment on whether and
how the detainees were being questioned. Myanmar authorities have
said the 18 foreigners are being interrogated as part of
investigations to determine if a legal case should be brought.
	   ``The six Americans expressed concern about how the case will be
resolved,'' the spokeswoman said. ``The embassy has been told it's
not been decided yet.''
	   Government officials earlier denied reports that the ruling
State Peace and Development Council had already decided to charge
and try the activists, saying no ruling had been made. Deportation
was still an option.
	   The reports panicked supporters and family members of the
activists meeting in Bangkok, Thailand.
	   Aside from the Americans and Thais, the detainees include three
Malaysians, three Indonesians, two Philippine citizens and an
Australian. It was unclear whether the Indonesians were getting
visits Tuesday.
	   The 18 were apprehended in downtown Yangon and at the airport
Sunday. They were urging people to remember a 1988 uprising against
military rule and to not give up.
	   In Manila, 30 human rights activists, some holding placards
reading ``Democracy for Burma,'' picketed the Myanmar Embassy. They
attempted to deliver a letter but were stopped by guards.
	   The Myanmar ambassador to the Philippines told reporters the
detainees were not cooperating with the Myanmar investigators.
	   Officials said they want to discourage leafleting and that the
activists broke laws, including a printing act and an emergency
law. The catchall emergency law can carry a 10-year sentence and is
frequently used against political opponents.
	   A statement from the Myanmar Embassy in London accused them of
acting at the behest of people ``pushing the country down into
hellish pits.''
	   The reference was to opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, winner
of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, and her National League for
Democracy. They have set an Aug. 21 deadline for the government to
finally convene a parliament elected in 1990.
	   The opposition overwhelmingly won the election, but the
military, which has ruled Myanmar since 1962 and tolerates almost
no dissent, refused to relinquish power.
	   The 18 activists entered Myanmar as tourists on the eve of the
10th anniversary of the Aug. 8, 1988, uprising, which resulted in a
change of leaders but was eventually crushed. An estimated 3,000
people died.
	   No unrest by Myanmar's own people was reported on the
anniversary.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Investigators began to piece together
evidence from last week's U.S. Embassy bombings Tuesday, with a
Kenyan guard's eyewitness account providing possibly important
clues and 14 arrests in Tanzania.
	   Twin terrorist bombings in Kenya and Tanzania claimed at least
230 lives and injured nearly 5,000, and the death toll continued to
rise.
	   More bodies were pulled from the rubble in Nairobi Tuesday,
bringing the death toll here to 220, the National Disaster
Operation Center said.
	   In Tanzania, 14 foreigners were arrested in connection with the
bombing of the Dar es Salaam embassy that claimed 10 Africans'
lives, said police spokesman Aden Mwanunyange.
	   Arrested were six Sudanese, six Iraqis, one Somali and Turk,
said police spokesman Aden Mwanunyange, citing ``dubious characters
and intelligence information that they may have taken part in the
incident.''
	   In Nairobi, the East African Standard said guard Joash Okindo
and his colleagues, armed only with short wooden clubs, confronted
five men, stopping them at a barrier to the embassy's front parking
lot, and forcing them to turn into the rear parking lot.

Calvin Klein is allowed to stage show at ancient amphitheater
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Fashion is art.
	   That's the verdict by Greece's culture minister, Evangelos
Venizelos, to overrule a committee that blocked designer Calvin
Klein from holding a fashion show in the 1,800-year-old Herodion
theater below the Acropolis.
	   The decision, made late Monday, had Venizelos and archeologists
bickering about the overlap of modern commerce and ancient sites.
	   ``Fashion is one of the designated elements of aesthetic and
daily cultural life,'' Venizelos said.
	   Last week, the Central Archeological Committee snubbed Klein's
request to stage September shows at two 2nd century sites: the
Roman Agora, or marketplace, and at the Herodion, constructed in
honor of Herod's wife Regilla.
	   The committee, which is in charge of archeological sites, ruled
a fashion show is not a cultural event. But Venizelos, who can
overrule the committee, said the show can go on at the Herodion but
not the Agora.
	   ``If the committee could stop it, it would. The committee is
against having fashion shows at the Herodion. It is not right to
have a fashion show at a monument,'' complained committee member
Yiannis Tzedakis, director of prehistoric and classical
archeological sites.
	   The show _ a modern dance performance with costumes designed by
Klein _ is intended to launch the European division of Calvin Klein
Jeans, said Costis Akritidis, general manager of Zoobidon, Klein's
public relations representative in Greece.
	   Proceeds of the event will go towards funding the construction
of a new museum at the Acropolis, Venizelos said.
	   ``We are in a tight spot. We have to take care of the ancient
monuments, and we have to take care of the development of art,''
Evgenios Yiannakopoulos, general secretary of the culture ministry.
	   The marble and stone Herodion amphitheater is used for events
such as concerts and dance performances.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Despite that nation's dismal
record of human rights violations, the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations voted last year to admit military-ruled Myanmar into
the regional group.
	   Now the regime has detained 18 foreign human rights activists
for passing out anti-government leaflets, and Malaysian activists
demanded Tuesday that Southeast Asian governments take action
against their ally.
	   ``The present regime ... has violated human rights of all shapes
and types,'' Syed Husin Ali, leader of the opposition Malaysian
People's Party, told a news conference attended by a half-dozen
human rights activists.
	   ``Despite all that, they were admitted into ASEAN. Now we urge
the Malaysian government and the ASEAN secretariat to take
immediate action so all the people will be released,'' he said.
	   Malaysia's opposition leader in Parliament, Lim Kit Siang, also
called on ASEAN Secretary-General Rodolfo Severino to publicly
condemn those arrests.
	   ``Rodolfo Severino should fly to (Yangon) to demand the
immediate and unconditional release of the 11 Southeast Asian
nationals arrested by the Burmese military junta,'' he said.
	   Those apprehended Sunday by Myanmar, also known as Burma, for
handing out leaflets the government said were aimed at inciting
unrest remained in the custody of the military regime Tuesday,
their fate undecided.
	   The leafleting operation came a day after Myanmar's own people
staged no demonstrations or protests to mark Saturday's anniversary
of Aug. 8, 1988, when simmering discontent against the military
rule erupted into a nationwide uprising.
	   The Southeast Asian activists arrested are three Malaysians,
three Indonesians, three Thais and two Philippine citizens. Six
Americans and an Australian from groups opposed to the military
regime were also detained.
	   The military regime began allowing diplomats Tuesday to visit
their citizens detained in Myanmar.
	   Malaysian Ambassador Abdul Wahab Harun said senior embassy
officials were allowed to meet the three Malaysians Tuesday evening
after having been denied access Monday, the Bernama news agency
reported. No further details were available.
	   Diplomats from the United States, the Philippines, Thailand and
Australia were also being allowed visits.
	   Malaysian activists at the news conference said six were
detained at the airport. The rest were arrested while they were
handing out small red-and-yellow cards to passers-by in downtown
Yangon Sunday.
	   ``We are your friends from around the world,'' said the cards
printed in Burmese and English.
	   ``We have not forgotten you. We support your hopes for human
rights and democracy. 8888 - Don't Forget - Don't Give Up,'' the
pamphlet said, alluding to the fateful day in August 1988.
	   Sivarasa Rasiah, a spokesman for the Malaysian human rights
group SUARAM, said the nine-member Association of Southeast Asian
Nations has failed to exert economic and political pressure on
Myanmar through ``constructive engagement.''
	   He called for more open pressure on Myanmar's government to
begin a dialogue with opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi and her
National League for Democracy, landslide winner of parliament
elections in 1990.
	   The military never allowed the parliament to meet.
	   ``Unless there's swift intervention by Malaysia, which is close
to the Myanmar government, these people may be tried and charged,''
said Elizabeth Wong, a SUARAM activist. ``The Malaysian government
should take a firm stand today.''
	   ASEAN comprises Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks fell for the fourth
straight session Tuesday as worries over deteriorating regional
currencies, led by the Japanese yen, prompted investors to unload
more of their portfolio investments, traders said.
	   The peso, meanwhile, closed higher against the U.S. dollar after
speculative pressure on the peso was eased by an increase in the
central bank's overnight lending rates, dealers said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index plunged 54.47
points, or 3.8 percent, to 1,373.19, following a 21.06-point, or
1.5 percent, loss Monday.
	   The index has lost nearly 10 percent of its value over the past
four sessions.
	   ``Everyone is looking at the yen at this point,'' said
Fitzgerald Aklan, assistant vice president for institutional sales
of Orion-Squire Securities Inc.
	   Dealers said they fear that a further fall in the yen against
the dollar could trigger a devaluation in the Chinese yuan and
eventually lead to a fresh round of regional currency weakness.
	   Aklan said the main stock index broke two support levels Tuesday
_ 1,400 and 1,380 points _ as the assault on regional stocks
continued.
	   The decision of the central bank to lift its overnight borrowing
rate to 15 percent from 13 percent and its overnight lending rate
to 17 percent from 15 percent further fueled the sell-down, said
Aklan.
	   The overnight rates are used by the central bank to siphon off
excess liquidity from the system while curbing speculative activity
in the foreign exchange market.
	   With no positive developments in the offing and regional
economies still hard-hit by the Asian currency turmoil, Aklan said
Manila shares are expected to weaken further.
	   ``What's scary is if the main index hits 1,350 points. That will
be real jeopardy and it could happen if the dollar hits 150 yen,''
he said.
	   Gainers trailed behind decliners 12 to 94 while 21 issues were
unchanged.
	   In currency trading, the dollar averaged 43.968 pesos for the
day, down from 44.135 pesos on Monday.
	   It reached a day-high of 44.450 pesos, below Monday's intraday
high of 44.790 pesos, which set a fresh seven-month high for the
U.S. currency.
	   A trader with a foreign bank said the central bank's interest
rate increases had an immediate impact on banks, which quickly
reduced their offer rates for the dollar.

Philippine officials ask for dlrs 580 million annual budget for
</HEADLINE>
rice &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Department of Agriculture has
requested a 25 billion peso (dlrs 580 million) annual budget for
the next five years to boost the country's rice production, an
official said Tuesday.
	   Agriculture Secretary William Dar said the budget will allow the
irrigation of more rice land and ensure national rice
self-sufficiency by 2003.
	   He said the money will be used in part for the digging of deep
wells, distribution of high-yielding seeds, and increased rice
planting.
	   ``We need this budget in the next five years so that by the
sixth year, we no longer need to import rice,'' Dar said.
	   This year, the department has a 14 billion peso (dlrs 325
million) budget.
	   Dar said the department is closely monitoring the possible
effects of a La Nina weather phenomenon on fourth-quarter rice
production.
	   He said La Nina, a weather anomaly that brings strong rains and
floods, may be good for rice production in the first quarter of
next year.
	   Last month, the National Food Authority said rice imports this
year will hit a record 2.1 million tons, with both La Nina and the
opposite phenomenon, El Nino, hurting rice production.

Forest groups first-half profit up to dlrs 1.0 billion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Europe's largest forest products group,
UPM-Kymmene, increased its first-half pretax profit to 5.57 billion
markkaa (dlrs 1.0 billion), up from 3.5 billion markkaa during the
same period last year.
	   Net sales from January to June fell slightly to 25.5 billion
markkaa (dlrs 4.7 billion) from 26.4 billion markkaa in 1997, but
the drop was mainly because UPM-Kymmene sold off two businesses,
the company said Tuesday.
	   In its outlook for the rest of the year, UPM-Kymmene predicted
continued demand for printing and writing paper in Europe and the
United States.
	   ``Economic growth in Europe and the United States is forecast to
continue, and this is expected to offset the effects of Southeast
Asia's economic crisis,'' a company statement said.
	   UPM-Kymmene was formed in 1996 from the merger of two leading
Finnish forest companies, Kymmene and Repola. It employs 34,000
people in more than 80 countries.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A bus overturned after swerving to avoid a
mushroom-picker who suddenly appeared on a slippery, winding road
in Russia's Far East, but none of its 20 passengers was seriously
hurt, a news agency said Tuesday.
	   The bus driver turned sharply to avoid hitting the
mushroom-picker, but turned upside down on the rain-slicked road
between Vladivostok and Nakhodka, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Doctors from an ambulance traveling the same road examined the
passengers who suffered only slight scratches, ITAR-Tass said.
Drivers of other vehicles detained the mushroom-gatherer.

End of boom in sight for German auto industry?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Despite record production and extra shifts at
German auto plants, industry types are worried that the end of the
boom is near.
	   Two weeks after BMW chairman Bernd Pischetsrieder first sounded
alarms by saying he thought the good times had peaked, the
president of the German Automobile Industry Association added his
own ill tidings Tuesday.
	   ``Behind the facade of booming business, a row of risks and
difficulties are hidden,'' Bernd Gottschalk told Die Welt
newspaper.
	   The strong export market is distracting attention from shaky
domestic demand, he said, which could threaten the ability of
German automakers to sustain the current upswing.
	   The pessimism in the industry runs counter to the optimistic
forecasts of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who is counting on the auto
industry to help him meet his election year promise of cutting
chronically high unemployment.
	   Opposition challenger Gerhard Schroeder also has touted the
dramatic turnaround in companies like Volkswagen _ where he sits on
the supervisory board _ in recent years as evidence that German
companies can be flexible and succeed in a global market.
	   Since recovering from the downturn of the early 1990s, German
automakers have been logging higher sales and record profits year
after year.
	   Daimler-Benz last month reported record earnings of 3.8 billion
marks (dlrs 2.1 billion) for the first six months of 1998, more
than double last year's first half results.
	   The upswing has been carried mostly by exports, which Gottschalk
described as having reached ``dizzying heights.'' The first quarter
saw sales outside Germany climb 12 percent to 52 billion marks
(dlrs 29 billion), and experts expect the year to end with a new
record.
	   But BMW chairman Bernd Pischetsrieder was quoted by the
Sueddeutsche Zeitung, a Munich-based newspaper, as saying that
business was slowing. German auto manufacturers registered 9
percent fewer incoming orders in the first half of 1998 than in the
year-earlier period.
	   He forecast that the U.S. auto industry will see declining unit
sales before 2000. ``If we are lucky, the crisis won't hit Europe
before 2000,'' he added in comments that sent shivers through the
Frankfurt stock market. BMW stock retreated 3.7 percent the day
Pischetsrieder's comments were published, after having made strong
gains in recent trading.
	   German automakers have slimmed down considerably since the last
bust cycle in the early 1990s. More than 125,000 jobs have been
lost and wage costs as a percentage of sales have dropped from 20.7
percent in 1995 to 16.5 percent now.
	   Last year was the first in which new jobs were added, some
25,000.
	   But analysts warn the extra capacity added recently to meet
demand could hurt if people stop buying so many cars.
	   Gottschalk views with skepticism a 5 percent increase in new
passenger car registrations during the first six months of 1998, as
well as a rise in production of passenger and commercial vehicles
in that period.
	   ``This is no indication of a robust domestic industry,'' he
said, noting that more than 90 percent of new registrations in
Germany are for replacing old models.
	   ``Up to now, exports have carried the boom,'' Gottschalk said.
But, he added, ``we would be well advised to take a closer look at
the situation'' in Germany should domestic demand continue to fall.

Catholic church calls for halt in new crosses at Auschwitz

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 8-9 with comment from the Simon Wiesenthal
center in Israel &QL; 
 &UR; By BEATA PASEK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Poland's top Catholic figure reversed
himself Tuesday and called for followers to stop putting up crosses
outside the former Nazi death camp at Auschwitz.
	   The strongly worded statement by Cardinal Jozef Glemp was a
conciliatory move in the escalating controversy over dozens of
crosses erected in the past three weeks on property adjoining
Auschwitz, outside Krakow in southern Poland.
	   The Israeli government and Jewish groups, including the Simon
Wiesenthal Center, have formally protested to Poland's government
about the newly erected crosses near Auschwitz and Birkenau camps,
where more than 1 million Jews died in World War II.
	   Glemp appealed to Catholic bishops in Poland to ``try to
restrain the growth of that non-church action,'' referring to the
smaller crosses put up by conservative Catholics near a larger
cross that has stood at the site since 1988.
	   A loose group of Catholic followers, inspired by a former
Solidarity activist and author of anti-Semitic pamphlets, intend to
erect 152 crosses at the site to commemorate the 152 Poles killed
at that spot by the Nazis.
	   But Glemp said `irresponsible groups'' were putting up the new
crosses, which he said diminished ``the meaning of the
cross-symbol.''
	   His statement followed comments by top government figures Monday
about a possible compromise in the dispute, which has touched on
one of the most emotional remnants of the war _ how to preserve the
camp that symbolized Nazi brutality and calculated killing.
	   Efraim Zuroff, director of the Simon Wiesenthal center in
Israel, called Glemp's statement a ``positive development - long
overdue.''
	   ``If the extremists in Poland feel they have the support of the
Catholic church, or leading clerics in the Catholic church, that
will only prolong and exacerbate the conflict,'' Zuroff said.
	   The cross controversy began with the eight-meter (26-foot)
brown, wooden cross erected a decade ago at a Carmelite nunnery
that adjoined Auschwitz. The cross, used in a mass celebrated by
Pope John Paul II at nearby Birkenau in 1979, honors Polish victims
of the Nazis, particularly the 152 slain at the site.
	   Jewish groups say the cross, which can be seen from one part of
Auschwitz, violates the memory of Jews who died there. They also
say it adds a religious element to the property, which is a UNESCO
heritage site and protected from changes that alter its character.
	   Because of the cross, Jewish groups have refused to sign a dlrs
93.5 million development deal for the Auschwitz property reached
last year with Polish authorities.
	   The Jewish protest over the cross prompted conservative
Catholics to begin putting up the additional, smaller crosses.
	   Last week, Glemp blamed the dispute on what he called
``continuous and increasing harassment by the Jewish side.'' His
statement Tuesday admitted that ``pronouncements by the Israeli
side did not have the character attributed to them originally,''
but added that ``the wave of emotions rises.''
	   Poland's biggest daily newspaper, Gazeta Wyborcza, which
reported Glemp's turnaround on Tuesday, praised the statement as
``the voice of a Christian who has the courage to admit he wrongly
estimated the situation.''
	   Roman Catholic bishops will meet Aug. 26 at Poland's holiest
shrine, the Black Madonna monastery in Czestochowa, to discuss the
issue and seek a solution.

Scaffolding down from ancient wonder in Berlin museum

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ The scaffolding is gone and the tourists poured in
Tuesday for a look at Berlin's partially restored Pergamon Altar, a
masterpiece of Hellenistic art dating from the 2nd century B.C.
	   Despite two years of work, only a third of the imposing marble
structure dedicated to Zeus and Athena has been finished, Pergamon
Museum officials said.
	   The western third _ a 113 meter (370 feet) long and 2.3 meter
(7.5 feet) tall frieze depicting the battle of the gods and giants
_ was cleaned, repaired in places and put back together.
	   Italian sandstone, modern epoxies and stainless steel were used
to replace the cement, iron clamps and animal-based glues the East
Germans used to repair extensive damage the monument suffered in
World War II.
	   Museum officials plan to finish the work over the next three
years at a total cost of 5 million marks (dlrs 2.8 million). But
they said the rest could be done without covering the main altar
again with scaffolding.
	   The Pergamon altar was excavated in Asia Minor by a German
archeologist between 1878 and 1886 and shipped piecemeal to Berlin,
which built a museum just for it.
	   It suffered serious damage in World War II bombing raids, and
the victorious Red Army took parts of it back to the Soviet Union
after the war. Moscow returned them, however, to their East German
client state in 1958.

OAU team expected for talks on Congo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ A team of African diplomats attempting to
mediate a spreading rebellion in the Congo was expected in Uganda
Tuesday but had not arrived by early evening, a Foreign Ministry
spokesman said.
	   Diplomats from Zimbabwe, Zambia, Tanzania and Namibia were in
Kinshasa Monday under the auspices of the Organization of African
Unity to talk with the government of President Laurent Kabila about
a peaceful solution to the revolt by Tutsi-led rebels that broke
erupted at the beginning of the month in eastern Congo along the
Ugandan and Rwandan borders.
	   ``They want peace to return to our region particularly regarding
the situation in the Congo and follow up what they were supposed to
achieve,'' said Edward Kwisensonyi.
	   In a statement, the Foreign Ministry disputed Congolese charges
that Ugandan troops have been pouring into the volatile Kivu region
of eastern Congo.
	   ``The baseless and unfortunate claims by the Congolese minister
(Information Minister Didier Mumenge) are intended to hoodwink and
contradict Uganda's principled policy of good neighborliness and
non-interference in the internal affairs of other states,'' the
statement said.
	   Uganda and its southern neighbor, Rwanda, were early backers of
Kabila when he led an eight-month drive to topple dictator Mobutu
Sese Seko in May 1997.
	   It is widely believed that Rwandan troops are again helping the
rebels in eastern Congo.
	   Uganda, under an agreement with the Congolese, has had a
military detachment several kilometers inside the Congolese border
in the foothills of the Rwenzori Mountains in an attempt to flush
out rebels that are attacking western Uganda.

	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Riders' representatives met Tuesday
with top officials of cycling's international governing body to
discuss the sport's growing drug crisis.
	   Retired stars Miguel Indurain of Spain and Tony Rominger of
Switzerland were among eight representatives at an all-day meeting
held at Lausanne's lakeside Olympic Museum.
	   Also present were France's world champion Laurent Jalabert and
Luc Leblanc, both of whom withdrew from this year's scandal-plagued
Tour de France in protest of police investigations into the doping
allegations.
	   Duing the Tour, the Festina team was disqualified from the race
and six more teams withdrew in protest.
	   The International Cycling Union (UCI) met last Thursday in Paris
``to elaborate a number of ways to fight (doping) more
efficiently.''
	   That meeting produced no decisions, but the UCI was expected to
provide details of the meetings and announce new strategies to
combat doping on Wednesday.
	   UCI President Hein Verbruggen and vice presidents Agostino Omini
and Daniel Baal attended Tuesday's meeting, along with Leon
Schattenberg, president of its anti-doping commission.
	   Other cyclists who attended were Italian Maurizio Fondriest,
French rider Stephen Heulot, Switzerland's Pascal Richard and Johan
Bruyneel of Belgium.

BayStars beat Giants 4-1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Takashi Saito struck out 11 batters in eight
innings Tuesday as the Central League's front-running Yokohama
BayStars beat the Yomiuri Giants 4-1 at Yokohama.
	   With his six-hitter, Saito improved to 7-3.
	   Takuro Ishii hit a solo homer in the first inning and Takahiro
Saeki doubled home two runs in the sixth for the BayStars.
	   At Nagoya, Takeshi Yamasaki hit his 14th home run of the season,
a solo shot, in the bottom of the seventh inning, lifting the
Chunichi Dragons to a 2-1 victory over the Hanshin Tigers.
	   Dragons left-hander Shigeki Noguchi (11-5) gave up eight hits
and struck out six in 8 1/3 innings, tying the Yakult Swallows'
Kenjiro Kawasaki for the league lead in victories at 11. Korean
pitcher Sun Dong-yol picked up his 19th save.
	   Meanwhile, Tigers outfielder Alonzo Powell, formerly of the
Seattle Mariners, was to return home to the United States at the
request of his club because of his poor performance this season,
Kyodo News reported. Powell, who led the lead in batting in
1994-1997, was down to .255 this year.
	   At Hiroshima, Tomonori Maeda hit a two-run homer in the bottom
of the sixth inning as the Hiroshima Toyo Carp beat the Swallows
5-1, ending the Swallows' winning streak at four. Maeda now has 20
homers.
	   In the Pacific League, the first-place Nippon Ham Fighters and
the Orix BlueWave ended in a 4-4 tie at Tokyo Dome in 12 innings,
the maximum allowed by the league.
	   The Buffaloes tied the game in the bottom of the third inning on
a three-run homer by Yukio Tanaka and a sacrifice fly by Katsuhiro
Nishiura, and neither team could score after that.
	   At Seibu Stadium, the Chiba Lotte Marines rapped out 15 hits and
beat the Seibu Lions 9-5.
	   The Marines scored five runs in the fifth inning with help from
a tie-breaking double by Kiyoshi Hatsushiba and a sacrifice fly by
Julio Franco, formerly of the Milwaukee Brewers.
	   At Fukuoka Dome, catcher Tetsuya Matoyama singled home the
tie-breaking run in the top of the second inning and the Kintetsu
Buffaloes beat the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks 5-1.
	   The Hawks suffered their third loss in a row.

Turkish authorities detain 52 would-be refugees from Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EDIRNE, Turkey (AP) _ Turkish border patrols on Tuesday detained
52 Iraqis who were waiting to cross illegally into Greece, Turkey's
Anatolia news agency said.
	   A Turkish bus driver who had brought the Iraqis to the region
was also detained, the news agency said.
	   The would-be refugees were preparing to cross the Meric River,
which marks the border between Turkey and Greece in Thrace. Greeks
know the river as the Evros.
	   Each year, thousands of illegal immigrants try to sneak across
the river to make their way into northern European countries.

Russian stock trading suspended due to sharp losses

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's stock exchange temporarily suspended
trading Tuesday after share prices plummeted in panic-selling
sparked by fears the Russian government is too broke to cope with
another run on the market.
	   The government, trying to prove otherwise, reiterated that it
had the resources to pay its debts and urged tax collectors to keep
up the pressure on companies that owe billions in unpaid taxes and
fines.
	   A more efficient tax collection system is among the economic
reforms being demanded by the International Monetary Fund and
others who put together a dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package for
Russia this summer.
	   The tax service's achievements will ``determine the future of
our country and the implementation of the stabilization program,''
Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko said, according to the Interfax
news agency.
	   The Russian Trading System Index sank 9.1 percent to close at
109.9 points, down from 120.91 points Monday. Traders blamed losses
in Asia and an an anticipated drop in U.S. trading.
	   Trading was suspended for 45 minutes late in the session, when
losses exceeded those allowed under trading rules. After trading
reopened there was a slight rebound.
	   Russian bond prices plummeted on local and international
markets, and the ruble also closed lower. The Central Bank was
forced to dip into its dwindling foreign exchange reserves to keep
the currency from falling further.
	   Before the suspension of trading was announced, Deputy Prime
Minister Viktor Khristenko tried to calm the jittery markets by
announcing that the government was able to service its foreign
debt.
	   ``Default is not an issue here,'' Khristenko said, adding that
the government has no plans to borrow on international bond markets
for the next two months.
	   Kiriyenko kept up the government's campaign to reel in tax
delinquents, telling tax collectors that the country's future
depends on their ability to get debtors to pay up.
	   ``If we prove that Russian can collect taxes, we shall gradually
begin to restructure the state debt,'' he said.
	   The government has promised repeatedly to improve tax collection
yet failed consistently to raise the revenues needed to provide
basic services and pay millions of state workers on a timely basis.
	   Five thousand companies owe a total of dlrs 50 billion in taxes
and fines, according to tax chief Boris Fyodorov.
	   Kiriyenko said Tuesday that it would be impossible to call in
all the old debts, some of which have been piling up for years.
	   The government is hoping mainly for timely payments of current
taxes, Kiriyenko said, according to Interfax.
	   He urged the tax service to work efficiently so that it could
collect 13 billion rubles (dlrs 6 billion) in taxes this month.

Sudan raises exchange rate for setting duties
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudanese customs authorities have
announced that imports will be valued at a rate of 2,023 Sudanese
pounds to the dollar, up from 1,960.
	   The decision will result in higher duties on imports and,
probably, higher costs of goods to consumers.
	   The decision was announced by Brig. Maajoub el-Hadi, chief of
information at the Sudan Customs Authority, and reported Tuesday by
the Alwan newspaper.
	   El-Hadi said the increase was necessary because the customs rate
was significantly below both official and ``parallel market''
rates. Rates in the parallel, or black, market are currently about
2,255-2,260 pounds to the dollar. The official rate is slightly
lower.
	   El-Hadi warned that further adjustment of the customs rate could
be necessary.
	   ``We are expecting yet another increase in the coming two months
until our exchange rate equals that of the exchange bureaus and of
the parallel market,'' he was quoted by Alwan as saying.
	   The pound has weakened significantly since June 1989, when Lt.
Gen. Omar el-Bashir took power in a military coup and installed an
Islamic regime. Most Western governments have cut aid to Sudan,
except for emergency relief, and foreign investment has stalled.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Investigators began to piece together
evidence from last week's U.S. Embassy bombings Tuesday, with a
Kenyan guard's eyewitness account providing possibly important
clues and 14 arrests in Tanzania.
	   Twin terrorist bombings in Kenya and Tanzania claimed at least
230 lives and injured nearly 5,000, and the death toll continued to
rise.
	   More bodies were pulled from the rubble in Nairobi Tuesday,
bringing the death toll here to 220, the National Disaster
Operation Center said.
	   In Tanzania, 14 foreigners were arrested in connection with the
bombing of the Dar es Salaam embassy that claimed 10 Africans'
lives, said police spokesman Aden Mwanunyange.
	   Arrested were six Sudanese, six Iraqis, one Somali and Turk, he
said, citing ``dubious characters and intelligence information that
they may have taken part in the incident.''
	   In Nairobi, the East African Standard said guard Joash Okindo
and his colleagues, armed only with short wooden clubs, confronted
five men, stopping them at a barrier to the embassy's front parking
lot, and forcing them to turn into the rear parking lot.
	   The attackers then jumped from the truck and opened fire with
automatic rifles. At least one Marine returned fire and one of the
attackers threw a hand grenade. Moments later, the truck exploded,
Okindo told the Kenya Television Network Monday.
	   ``We saved people's lives by sending it to the rear entrance,''
Okindo told the Standard. ``If we hadn't done that, I don't think I
would be alive and talking to you now.''
	   The Standard said it talked to Okindo before he was taken out of
the country on a U.S. medical evacuation flight to Germany for
treatment of serious wounds, but a U.S. official said he remained
in Kenya.
	   ``We called the FBI agent and he said no. It's a similar name
apparently. The guard we're talking about is still down there in
Nairobi, and has been,'' U.S. Col. Robert Harvey, commander at
Landstuhl, a U.S. military hospital near Ramstein Air Base, 160
kilometers (100 miles) southeast of Frankfurt.
	   Okindo ``resisted heroically,'' U.S. State Department spokesman
James Foley said in Washington.
	   At the wreckage of the Dar es Salaam embassy, a dozen FBI agents
swept and raked Laibon Road in front of the embassy building,
collecting and sifting through debris in their search for evidence.
	   Israel army radio also signaled a possible break in the cases.
In a report from Nairobi, it said investigators suspect the bombers
used the sophisticated plastic explosive Semtex.
	   Capt. Rhyl Jones, garrison engineer of the British Army in Kenya
who has surveyed the wreckage, estimated the bomb could have
contained up to 250 kilograms (550 pounds) of explosives, depending
on what type was used.
	   ``My opinion is that it was definitely a commercial explosive.
This wasn't a homemade device,'' said Jones, who has investigated
bombings by the Irish Republican Army in Britain.
	   The FBI says finding out what kind of explosives were used and
how would be critical to the investigation.
	   So would an informant, and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
on Monday offered a dlrs 2 million reward for information leading
to the capture of the ``cowards that committed this act.''
	   Meanwhile, Israeli soldiers, the first professional
search-and-rescue team to reach Nairobi after the bombing,
continued to dig for a woman named Rose.
	   Her voice fell silent Sunday, but they heard a tapping noise
Monday that spurred them on. Three times Tuesday, Israelis dropped
a microphone into the crevice where Rose was believed to be
trapped, but heard nothing.
	   No one has been pulled alive out of the rubble since Saturday.
	   The bombing in Nairobi was the deadliest attack ever on a U.S.
Embassy. A dozen Americans at the embassy died.
	   The bodies of 11 of them began their last journey home on Monday
when their flag-draped coffins were loaded onto a military
transport plane headed for Germany. Albright is expected to
accompany the dead back to the United States on Thursday.
	   The 12th, who was married to a Kenyan, will be buried in her
adopted homeland.
	   The vast majority of victims were in Nairobi, where university
students marched to the bomb site Monday in a candlelight vigil.
	   ``Go Fight Americans in America,'' said one sign.
	   The United States is a favorite target of militant Islamic
fundamentalists and many ordinary people here feel Kenya got caught
in the cross fire of a battle that isn't theirs.
	   ``We will not confirm or deny the existence of evidence in this
criminal inquiry,'' said an American diplomat in Dar es Salaam,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The rescue efforts _ haphazard at first _ may have destroyed
evidence at the two bomb sites, but U.S. officials said it was
inevitable because the victims came first.
	   ``Obviously, the first priority is finding people alive and then
to recover bodies,'' said U.S. Embassy spokesman Chris Scharf.
	   The United States is bringing in a Navy Seabees construction
battalion in the next few days to help with the recovery.
	   ``If there are still missing victims, that will be their first
priority,'' said Navy Cmdr. Gordon Hume.
	   The Seabees are part of a 200-strong U.S. military task force
deployed in Nairobi. The task force includes a 20-person medical
team and a crisis response team to counsel people, Hume said.

As end for state church nears, membership falling just slightly
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Sweden's state Lutheran church on
Tuesday released figures showing church attendance and membership
continues to fall, but not as fast as had been expected when the
church and state decided to gradually separate.
	   When plans were announced in 1995 for the Church of Sweden to
denationalize by 2000, it was widely expected that huge numbers of
Swedes would leave the church. Before 1996, all children
automatically became church members if one of their parents was a
member.
	   But in 1997, 84.8 percent of Swedes were church members, only a
slight drop from the previous year's 85.3 percent, the Swedish news
agency TT said.
	   Despite the high membership in one of the world's oldest state
churches, fewer than 5 percent of Swedes attend church services
regularly.
	   The total number of people attending services in 1997 was
21,871,000, or less than three times a year for each of the
church's 7,506,000 members.
	   One growth area for the church was in the number of choir
members _ 13,000 more than in 1996, for a total of 208,000.
	   The church for centuries had charge of registering births, new
residents and burials, but those duties are being shed as
denationalization approaches.

Poland's premier sets date for local elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Elections for new local government bodies
to replace the communist-era system will take place Oct. 11 under a
decree signed Tuesday by Interior Minister Janusz Tomaszewski.
	   Voters will choose a three-level local government system to
succeed the current two-level system and its strong central
administration in Warsaw, the capital. The date has been known for
several weeks, and Tuesday's proclamation began the formal process
leading up to the vote.
	   Local government reform is the final step to overhauling the
communist-era administrative system. The new system will give more
power to local governments and create fewer but stronger provinces
in line with much of Europe.
	   Voters will choose 52,000 municipal representatives, 9,000
county officials and 1,000 provincial administrators.
	   After months of wrangling with opposition groups on the scope
and shape of reforms, the Solidarity-dominated government voted
into power last September can reach its Jan. 1, 1999 deadline for
completing the reforms.
	   ``We are putting local government, its financing and the
accompanying powers into the hands of the people,'' said
Tomaszewski, who also is deputy prime minister.

Government announces reward for information on arsonists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ In an effort to combat Greece's worst
season of forest fires, the government Tuesday posted a reward for
information leading to the arrest of any arsonists.
	   Officials have repeatedly said they suspect many of the
thousands of wildfires which raged across the country in July were
deliberate.
	   In July, more than 2,800 wildfires were reported compared with
3,100 from April to October last year, the government said.
	   The government has come under increasing pressure during the
past month to crack down on arsonists it has claimed are
responsible for many of the fires.
	   In the past, fires are believed to have been started by people
hoping to dodge legislation that forbids building in forest areas.
	   Opposition parties have blamed government ministers for
encouraging arsonists by proposing a law which they fear could lead
to the legalization of buildings constructed without permits on
burnt forest land. That legislation is still to be debated in
Parliament.
	   According to the public order ministry announcement, anyone
providing information leading to the arrest of an arsonist
responsible for any wildfire from July 1, 1998, will be eligible
for a reward from five million drachmas (dlrs 17,000) to 20 million
drachmas (dlrs 67,000).
	   The amount of the reward will depend on whether any deaths were
caused by the blaze, its size, the importance of the land burnt and
the amount of damage caused. The government has promised anonymity
for people providing information.
	   The government has also allowed local officials to ban public
access to forests, and both cars and pedestrians are being
routinely searched in these areas.
	   A number of people have been arrested on suspicion of arson

Turkish authorities detain 52 would-be refugees from Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EDIRNE, Turkey (AP) _ Turkish border patrols on Tuesday detained
52 Iraqis who were waiting to cross illegally into Greece, Turkey's
Anatolia news agency said.
	   A Turkish bus driver who had brought the Iraqis to the region
was also detained, the news agency said.
	   The would-be refugees were preparing to cross the Meric River,
which marks the border between Turkey and Greece in Thrace. Greeks
know the river as the Evros.
	   Each year, thousands of illegal immigrants try to sneak across
the river to make their way into northern European countries.

China urges perseverance in flood fight
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with government ordering dikes to be
fortified &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JIUJIANG, China (AP) _ China ordered exhausted flood fighters
Tuesday to fortify sodden dikes that threaten to give way to the
raging Yangtze River, which is suffering its heaviest flooding in
44 years.
	   Millions of soldiers and civilians have struggled for weeks to
repair leaking embankments.
	   Flooding nationwide has killed more than 2,000 people and
destroyed more than 17 million houses this summer, leaving millions
homeless and often bereft of clean drinking water, food, medicine
and other necessities in brutally hot and humid weather.
	   At a meeting Tuesday, the government's flood control
headquarters said major dikes along the Yangtze that protect cities
and rich farmland must be strengthened, raised and patrolled
round-the-clock.
	   ``Now is the critical moment in the decisive engagement in the
fight against floods on the Yangtze,'' the state-run Xinhua News
Agency said in a report on the meeting. ``As long as we grit our
teeth, persevering and persevering again, final victory will be
achieved.''
	   The flood miseries have also affected northeast China, with the
Nenjiang River rising Tuesday to record highs. A 600-meter-
(2,000-foot-) long dike along the river collapsed Tuesday,
stranding 2,300 people, Xinhua said. It said no casualties had been
reported but gave no details.
	   In the southeast, along the Yangtze, a flood crest surged
through Jiujiang city, threatening to burst sodden dikes that
protect its 500,000 people.
	   ``The situation here is serious,'' said a Jiujiang official, who
gave only his surname, Huang. ``Today is clear and hot, but that
doesn't mean we can relax.''
	   Factories and homes were flooded to first floor ceilings in
low-lying parts of the city. Scores of military police patrolled
flooded streets in boats.
	   Two dikes about 10 kilometers (six miles) from the city were
most at risk, Huang said. He said the water level near the city
rose slightly Tuesday, but was below the peak recorded July 31.
	   In southwestern Guizhou province, at least 25 people died and
three were missing after the bus they were riding became stuck and
then was swept away by a flooding river, the official newspaper
Beijing Evening News reported.
	   Torrential rains and floods also killed 34 people and seriously
injured 69 others in neighboring Sichuan province in the past 10
days, Xinhua said.
	   Authorities on Tuesday ordered extra efforts to maintain public
order in flood-hit areas. Police were told to frequently patrol
areas where flood victims are concentrated and severely punish
crime, Xinhua said.
	   Many of the millions of people flooded out are camped in
makeshift shelters atop dikes where exposure and poor hygiene are
taking a toll. No serious outbreaks of disease have been reported,
but the threat of illnesses will grow in coming weeks before the
Yangtze subsides, said Jim Robertson, a Red Cross specialist who
toured flooded provinces last week.
	   On Tuesday, a U.S. Air Force cargo plane delivered a shipment of
relief supplies, such as tents, plastic sheeting, blankets and
drinking water containers to southern Hunan province, one of the
worst hit areas. A second shipment was scheduled for Wednesday.
	   The government also has stepped up efforts to raise donations
for flood victims, opening a hotline for phone pledges and
encouraging efforts to raise money.
	   Southern Guangdong province, meanwhile, braced for Tropical
Storm Penny, which was expected to batter the area Tuesday with
violent winds and torrential rains.
	   Unlike other areas, much of Guangdong has suffered drought this
summer, making the storm not entirely unwelcome.

Poland sets date for local elections

Ministry runs elections in last graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Elections for new local government bodies
to replace the communist-era system will take place Oct. 11 under a
decree signed Tuesday by Interior Minister Janusz Tomaszewski.
	   Voters will choose a three-level local government system to
succeed the current two-level system and its strong central
administration in Warsaw, the capital. The date has been known for
several weeks, and Tuesday's decree began the formal process
leading up to the vote.
	   Local government reform is the final step to overhauling the
communist-era administrative system. The new system will give more
power to local governments and create fewer but stronger provinces
in line with much of Europe.
	   Voters will choose 52,000 municipal representatives, 9,000
county officials and 1,000 provincial administrators.
	   After months of wrangling with opposition groups on the scope
and shape of reforms, the Solidarity-dominated government voted
into power last September can reach its Jan. 1, 1999 deadline for
completing the reforms.
	   ``We are putting local government, its financing and the
accompanying powers into the hands of the people,'' said
Tomaszewski, whose ministry runs elections. He also is deputy prime
minister.

Rival group in Indonesian Muslim organization plans own party
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A discontented faction within
Indonesia's largest Muslim organization plans to set up its own
political party as a rival to one formed earlier by the
organization's chairman.
	   Abdurrahman Wahid, chairman of the 30 million-member Nahdlatul
Ulama, set up the National Awakening Party last month to contest
elections scheduled for next year. He said membership would be open
to all despite the party's Muslim roots, and the party would act
independently of Nahdlatul Ulama.
	   On Tuesday, his father-in-law, Yusuf Hasyim, said his faction
was setting up a party to be called Nahdlatul Ummah. It would be
aimed at preventing the country from becoming another Turkey under
secular political elites, he said.
	   ``Frankly, we think Gus Dur has not properly served NU's
aspirations,'' the official Antara news agency quoted Hasyim as
saying. Wahid is popularly known as Gus Dur.
	   ``We are very disappointed by him,'' said Hasyim.
	   Hasyim, head of the Tebu Ireng Islamic Boarding School in East
Java, accused Wahid of becoming too close to secular political
elites that might lead Indonesia to ``become another Turkey'' if
they rise to power.
	   In Turkey, he said, the government had banned religious
education in schools.
	   Wahid is known as an ardent supporter of pro-democracy leader
Megawati Sukarnoputri, who was ousted from the Indonesian
Democratic Party by party rivals backed by the government of former
President Suharto.
	   Suharto, a retired army general who replaced Megawati's father
Sukarno as Indonesia's leader in 1966, quit in May amid protests
against his 32-year authoritarian rule.
	   He had strictly controlled Indonesia's political system and
allowed only three parties, but his successor, President B.J.
Habibie, has promised to end the ban on creating new parties.
	   Several other Muslim groups have also announced the
establishment of Islamic parties.
	   About 90 percent of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslims,
making it the world's most populous Muslim nation.

Baggio ready to fire for Inter Milan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN PYE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Inter Milan is without its Brazilian superstar
Ronaldo but is unveiling Roberto Baggio in its Champions League
qualifier against Skonto Riga.
	   Baggio, one of the biggest names in Italian soccer, will debut
for Inter against the Latvian club _ playing its biggest game ever
_ in the first leg of the second-round qualifier.
	   The 31-year-old international, who transferred to Inter in the
summer from Bologna, has been plagued by a series of injuries in
the last four years but says he is ready to play a full 90 minutes.
	   ``This game really means a lot to me,'' Baggio said. ``(Winning)
the Champions League is an important objective and it's important
to start well _ both for me and Inter.''
	   Baggio, expected to line up behind forwards Ivan Zamorano of
Chile and newcomer Nicola Ventola, steps into the spotlight because
Ronaldo is still vacationing in Brazil after his disappointing
performance in the 3-0 defeat to France in the World Cup final.
	   Wednesday's game is being played in Pisa because the San Siro
field in Milan is being relaid with new grass.
	   Injuries and suspensions have depleted Inter Milan's squad, with
Youri Djorkaeff, Aron Winter, Nwanko Kanu, Francesco Moriero, Paolo
Sousa and Taribo West among those missing.
	   The Latvian media's coverage of the series highlights
Wednesday's match as the country's biggest sporting event in years.
	   Skonto president Guntis Indriksons said his side was looking to
get through the first leg with no worse than a 3-1 or 2-0 defeat.
	   He said a worse result could break the confidence of the team
and discourage Latvian fans before the teams play in Riga on Aug.
26.
	   ``In Italy, we should prove to Inter Milan that we can play,''
Indriksons said. ``We want them to feel like they have to be
careful when they come to Riga.''
	   English Premier League giants Manchester United will meet Polish
champions LKS Lodz in a match which almost didn't happen.
	   The match was thrown into doubt when FIFA threatened to ban
Polish teams from international competitions unless a domestic
dispute between the government and soccer authorities was settled
by an Aug. 7.
	   LKS received the go-ahead for the game when the Polish
government met the FIFA deadline.
	   LKS Lodz chairman Andrzej Ptak said Manchester United played
``lousy soccer'' during its 3-0 loss to Arsenal in the Charity
Shield exhibition game at Wembley on Sunday.
	   ``I have heard that we have already one foot among the best
teams of the Champions League,'' he said. ``The English presented
lousy soccer and we stand a huge chance to be better than them.''
	   About 500 Polish fans are expected to travel to Old Trafford to
watch the match.
	   Swiss team Grasshoppers is fielding its strongest team in a
decade against Turkish champions Galatasary in Istanbul, the club's
sports director Erich Vogel said Tuesday.
	   Vogel said the Grasshoppers had its best ever chance of reaching
the Champions League this year, but Galatasary officials have other
ideas.
	   Veteran Romanian player Gheorghe Hagi scored two spectacular
goals from outside the penalty area for Galatasary in its opening
domestic league game and goes into the game in top form.
	   ``It is time to give our fans the victory they deserve,'' coach
Fatih Terim said. ``We have no intention of waiting until the
return leg for victory. We shall advance to the second round here
in Istanbul.''
	   Bayern Munich, three-time Champions Cup winner, takes on
Yugoslav team Obilic.
	   Bayern, with 16 internationals on its roster, goes into the
match in Munich as an overwhelming favorite against the Belgrade
side.
	   New coach Ottmar Hitzfeld steered Bayern to a 4-0 win over
Stuttgart in its German League cup match over the weekend, with
three goals by Brazilian striker Giovane Elber.
	   ``This is probably our most important game of the season,''
Hitzfeld said. ``We have to get into the Champions League.''
	   Obilic goes into the game with four injuries and a new coach
after a disastrous start to its domestic league campaign.
	   Obilic managed only a 1-1 tie in its first league game last
Friday against Miulicionar, leading to the firing of coach Dragan
Okuka. He was replaced by Mioljub Ostojic.
	   During the match, Obilic lost four key players through injury,
captain Zivojin Juskic, midfielder Nenad Grozdic, defender Kuzman
Babeu and striker Zoran Rankovic.
	   Dynamo Kiev, Champions Cup quarterfinalists last year, has an
impressive record against Czech teams as it prepares to host Sparta
Prague.
	   The Ukraine team has played five Czech teams in various European
tournaments and won all five. In the 1991-92 Champions League,
Dynamo lost 2-1 in Prague and won 1-0 at home in Kiev to clinch the
series.
	   Fuelled by the success of the national team at the World Cup,
Croatia Zagreb will enter its match against Scottish side Celtic
full of confidence.
	   The side boasts six players from the Croatian team which
finished third at the World Cup and will start the match at full
strength.
	   Celtic, which boasts 11 World Cup players, got off to a slow
start in the Champions Cup with a 2-0 first round win over
Ireland's St. Patrick's Athletic.

City Bird Scraps Vegas Route To Push Sabena Alliance with LA
</HEADLINE>
travelers &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ No-frills airline City Bird said
Tuesday it will scrap its Brussels-Las Vegas route as of Oct. 25
and instead operate nonstop Brussels-Los Angeles flights.
	   City Bird said this will enable U.S. passengers to connect
better to flights of Sabena, the national Belgian carrier, with
which it has a cooperation agreement.
	   Though Las Vegas is popular with travelers from Belgium, ``as a
launch pad from the United States it doesn't work very well,'' said
City Bird Director General Alain Skowronek.
	   City Bird believes the flights from Los Angeles will work better
to ferry American passengers onto the Sabena network out of
Brussels. Sabena serves 50 European destinations.

Floods in eastern region strand 6,500; aid delivered
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Floods in the eastern Russian region of Chita,
near the border with China, have stranded more than 6,500 people, a
news agency reported Tuesday.
	   A state of emergency was declared Monday night in three of the
region's districts when the water level in rivers rose by 20
centimeters (eight inches), the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Regional emergency officials estimate that 2,000 houses in 45
settlements have been damaged by the floods.
	   Rising waters have also washed out a number of bridges and
ruined most potato and grain crops for this year in the region,
about 4700 kilometers (3,000 miles) east of Moscow, ITAR-Tass
reported.
	   A northern region that was hit by severe flooding in May has
received some 3,300 tons of humanitarian aid from Russian regions
and abroad, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   More than 200 villages were flooded in the Yakutia region, about
4800 kilometers (3,000 miles) east of Moscow, in the spring. About
16,000 homes and 400 factories were under water, 240 bridges were
destroyed, and highways were washed out.

Government commission condemns existing Australian tax system
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Two days before releasing its plans
for a major overhaul of the Australian tax system, a government
agency on Tuesday issued a report condemning aspects of the
existing system.
	   With national elections looming, conservative Prime Minister
John Howard has pegged his political future to a tax reform package
due to be released Thursday.
	   The package is widely expected to include simplification of
Australia's complicated indirect tax system, the introduction of a
broad-based consumption tax and big personal income tax cuts.
	   The way the public receives the tax plan is considered crucial
to the timing and result of the elections, which Howard can call at
any time up to May 1999.
	   The last time the conservative coalition proposed the
introduction of a consumption tax, in 1993, it lost national
elections despite the unpopularity of the incumbent Labor
government.
	   The loss prompted Howard to promise that a consumption tax, also
known as a goods and services tax, would ``never, ever'' again be
his government's policy.
	   Despite keeping the exact details a secret, Howard and senior
government ministers have already begun selling the benefits of the
package.
	   On Tuesday, the government released a report by its Productivity
Commission that found that many indirect taxes increase costs to
industry and exporters, detracting from economic performance.
	   Many business inputs are subject to indirect taxes, the study
found.
	   ``The result is a cascading of taxes through the production
process, or the so-called taxes-on-taxes problem,'' the report
said. ``This increases business costs, discourages investment and
generally detracts from Australia's economic performance.''
	   Treasurer Peter Costello said indirect taxes impose a
``significant cost burden on manufacturing and other exports and
that many of these costs occur well back in the production chain
and are therefore hidden from exporters.''
	   The report provides ``compelling evidence that our present
system of indirect taxes is penalizing exporters and putting a
brake on economic growth,'' he said.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Share prices on the London Stock Exchange were

<TEXT>
	   JIUJIANG, China (AP) _ China ordered exhausted flood fighters
Tuesday to fortify sodden dikes that threaten to give way to the
raging Yangtze River, which is suffering its heaviest flooding in
44 years.
	   Millions of soldiers and civilians have struggled for weeks to
repair leaking embankments.
	   Flooding nationwide has killed more than 2,000 people and
destroyed more than 17 million houses this summer, leaving millions
homeless and often bereft of clean drinking water, food, medicine
and other necessities in brutally hot and humid weather.
	   At a meeting Tuesday, the government's flood control
headquarters said major dikes along the Yangtze that protect cities
and rich farmland must be strengthened, raised and patrolled
round-the-clock.
	   ``Now is the critical moment in the decisive engagement in the
fight against floods on the Yangtze,'' the state-run Xinhua News
Agency said in a report on the meeting. ``As long as we grit our
teeth, persevering and persevering again, final victory will be
achieved.''
	   The flood miseries have also affected northeast China, with the
Nenjiang River rising Tuesday to record highs. A 600-meter-
(2,000-foot-) long dike along the river collapsed Tuesday,
stranding 2,300 people, Xinhua said. It said no casualties had been
reported but gave no details.
	   In the southeast, along the Yangtze, a flood crest surged
through Jiujiang city, threatening to burst sodden dikes that
protect its 500,000 people.
	   ``The situation here is serious,'' said a Jiujiang official, who
gave only his surname, Huang. ``Today is clear and hot, but that
doesn't mean we can relax.''
	   Factories and homes were flooded to first floor ceilings in
low-lying parts of the city. Scores of military police patrolled
flooded streets in boats.
	   Two dikes about 10 kilometers (six miles) from the city were
most at risk, Huang said. He said the water level near the city
rose slightly Tuesday, but was below the peak recorded July 31.
	   In southwestern Guizhou province, at least 25 people died and
three were missing after the bus they were riding became stuck and
then was swept away by a flooding river, the official newspaper
Beijing Evening News reported.
	   Torrential rains and floods also killed 34 people and seriously
injured 69 others in neighboring Sichuan province in the past 10
days, Xinhua said.
	   Authorities on Tuesday ordered extra efforts to maintain public
order in flood-hit areas. Police were told to frequently patrol
areas where flood victims are concentrated and severely punish
crime, Xinhua said.
	   Many of the millions of people flooded out are camped in
makeshift shelters atop dikes where exposure and poor hygiene are
taking a toll. No serious outbreaks of disease have been reported,
but the threat of illnesses will grow in coming weeks before the
Yangtze subsides, said Jim Robertson, a Red Cross specialist who
toured flooded provinces last week.
	   On Tuesday, a U.S. Air Force cargo plane delivered a shipment of
relief supplies, such as tents, plastic sheeting, blankets and
drinking water containers to southern Hunan province, one of the
worst hit areas. A second shipment was scheduled for Wednesday.
	   The government also has stepped up efforts to raise donations
for flood victims, opening a hotline for phone pledges and
encouraging efforts to raise money.
	   Southern Guangdong province, meanwhile, braced for Tropical
Storm Penny, which was expected to batter the area Tuesday with
violent winds and torrential rains.
	   Unlike other areas, much of Guangdong has suffered drought this
summer, making the storm not entirely unwelcome.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Floods in the eastern Russian region of Chita,
near the border with China, have stranded more than 6,500 people, a
news agency reported Tuesday.
	   A state of emergency was declared Monday night in three of the
region's districts when the water level in rivers rose by 20
centimeters (eight inches), the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Regional emergency officials estimate that 2,000 houses in 45
settlements have been damaged by the floods.
	   Rising waters have also washed out a number of bridges and
ruined most potato and grain crops for this year in the region,
about 4700 kilometers (3,000 miles) east of Moscow, ITAR-Tass
reported.
	   A northern region that was hit by severe flooding in May has
received some 3,300 tons of humanitarian aid from Russian regions
and abroad, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   More than 200 villages were flooded in the Yakutia region, about
4800 kilometers (3,000 miles) east of Moscow, in the spring. About
16,000 homes and 400 factories were under water, 240 bridges were
destroyed, and highways were washed out.

Indonesia to go ahead with ambitious bridge plan despite crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Grim economic times in Indonesia have
not halted plans to build a 26.9-kilometer (16.6-mile) toll bridge
to link the islands of Java and Sumatra, news reports said Tuesday.
	   ``It must go into service by the year 2006,'' the official
Antara news agency quoted President B.J. Habibie as saying Monday.
	   The Java-Sumatra bridge project was originally proposed in 1997
by businessman Ari Sigit, a grandson of former President Suharto,
who quit in May when the economic crisis triggered riots and
protests.
	   Critics claim that during his 32-year rule, Suharto improperly
used political influence to secure government projects for his
family.
	   Foreign contractors have often complained that government
infrastructure projects were awarded to companies with connections
to relatives of Suharto.
	   Indonesia's construction industry is one of the worst damaged
sectors of the national economy, which is predicted to contract by
at least 15 percent in 1998.
	   Indonesia is battling its worst economic crisis in 30 years.
	   Millions of people have sunk below the poverty line.
Unemployment is growing fast as companies go bankrupt and rampant
inflation pushes prices sky high. There are regular reports of food
shortages and big food price increases.
	   Several major infrastructure projects in Indonesia have been
abandoned because of the financial meltdown.
	   Despite the economic gloom, Habibie said the Java-Sumatra bridge
project remained an important part of a ``national vision'' of
recovery.
	   ``We must not be hopeless, much less feel unable to face all
these challenges that cripple our nation,'' he said.
	   Habibie made the comments when he opened a dlrs 26.4 million
six-bridge project that linked islands in Riau province adjacent to
Singapore.
	   The Java-Sumatra bridge will allow traffic to pass between some
of the world's most densely populated areas in Java and wealthy
oil, gas and rubber fields in Sumatra.
	   The Antara report did not say how much the bridge would cost to
construct.
	   Last year, the project was shelved because of the crisis.
	   The bridge will span the Sunda Strait between the two islands
and pass through an earthquake-prone zone near the giant Krakatau
volcano.
	   Some critics say the plan is not feasible due to seismic
instability.

Iran to create new economic policy group headed by Khatami
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran will create a new policy group, to be
headed by President Mohammad Khatami, to reform the nation's
economy, state-run Iranian television reported Tuesday.
	   The National Economic Restructuring Program will assist the
government in drawing up Iran's third, five-year development plan,
the broadcast quoted Economy Minister Hossein Namazi as saying.
	   The program will focus on reforming the tax system, the
employment law and the law on foreign investment, it said.
	   ``Among the program's important points is the establishment of
economic security and stability,'' Namazi was quoted as saying.
	   He added that the government is determined to keep the official
exchange rate of 3,000 rials per dollar steady until the end of the
second, five-year plan, in the year 2000, he said.
	   He disclosed that the Central Bank was drawing up regulations
for the implementation of interest-free banking within a month, but
did not provide further details.
	   Last week, Khatami outlined his economic aims. He called for
reducing government monopolies on goods and services, eliminating
the red tape holding back foreign investment and cutting the
country's reliance on oil revenues.
	   He described the economy as ``sick'' and said high unemployment
and inflation had cut into the public's purchasing power.
	   Iran and other Gulf oil producers have been grappling with
rising budget deficits because of low world prices for oil, a main
source of government revenues.

South Korea firm sells self-cooling can technology to Canada
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A South Korean company said Tuesday it
has signed a contract to sell a newly developed self-cooling can
technology to a Canadian company for dlrs 100 million.
	   Will-Bes and Co. Ltd. of Seoul said the contract, signed in
Vancouver over the weekend, will give Canada's BTI Holdings Ltd.
exclusive rights to the technology in Canada, the United States and
Mexico.
	   A self-cooling can has a small container of liquid coolant on
the bottom. When the container is opened, the coolant evaporates
and cools the can's contents.
	   Self-cooling cans were developed by British and American
companies last year, using hydro-fluorocarbons as coolants.
Environmentalists protested that the hydrocarbons could contribute
to global warming.
	   ``What is different about our technology is that we use an
environment-friendly coolant that we've newly developed,'' said
Choi Chang-hyok, a spokesman for the South Korean company.
	   He said the company has applied for patent rights in the United
States and some 80 other countries.
	   The Canadian company, Choi said, is considering manufacturing
the cans itself or selling the manufacturing license to a beverage
company.
	   The contract calls for the Canadian company to pay dlrs 100
million in several installments over the next year. It also is to
pay dlrs 10 million in annual royalties if the technology is fully
commercialized.
	   Vancouver-based BTI specializes in trading meat and buying and
selling licenses for new technology.
	   Founded in 1973, Will-Bes specializes in garment trading. It
entered the cooling-can business last year.

Karadzic supporters pull out of election campaign
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Citing an alleged ``witch
hunt'' against their activists, supporters of Bosnian Serb war
crimes suspect Radovan Karadzic announced Tuesday they would halt
their election campaign ahead of Bosnia's vote in September.
	   The Serb Democratic Party, a key rival of the Bosnian Serb
reformist alliance led by President Biljana Plavsic, accused its
opponents of intimidating and harassing their people in what has
increasingly turned into a mud-slinging campaign before the Sept.
13-14 ballot.
	   ``A witch hunt against the SDS members has started in the past
month,'' declared Dragan Kalinic, the party leader, at a news
conference in Banja Luka, northwestern Bosnia. But he said his
party will take part in the nationwide elections considered crucial
for the future of Bosnia.
	   Kalinic said the SDS pullout from the campaign was prompted by a
statement late Monday from Plavsic's Interior Minister Milovan
Stankovic, who accused the top SDS member and Serb member of the
Bosnian three-men presidency, Momcilo Krajisnik of orchestrating
the killing of Srdjan Knezevic, the police chief in Pale, a
hardliners' stronghold east of Sarajevo.
	   Knezevic, who led a Bosnian Serb paramilitary unit during the
war, also used to be a Karadzic loyalist but switched sides last
year.
	   Western officials in Bosnia, who support Plavsic, believe the
victory of her alliance at the election is crucial for the survival
of Bosnia as a united country as envisaged by the 1995 Dayton peace
accords. The Karadzic loyalists want to split the Serb half of the
country from the Muslim-Croat one.
	   Tensions are running high in the Serb half of Bosnia, where
Karadzic loyalists and reformists led by President Biljana Plavsic
are deeply divided in two camps. The September vote is expected to
further undermine the hardliners' position.
	   Plavsic supporters won a Bosnian Serb election last fall,
pushing the hard-liners from power and forming a reformist
government.

Japan to send officials to Tajikistan over peacekeeper's slaying
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Three Japanese government officials will visit
Tajikistan to urge an investigation into the killing of a Japanese
United Nations peacekeeper in the former Soviet republic, the
Foreign Ministry said Tuesday.
	   Parliamentary Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs Keizo Takemi and
two ministry officials will leave for Tajikistan Wednesday to
discuss the killing of Japanese peacekeeper Yutaka Akino with Tajik
officials, the ministry said in a statement.
	   Akino was shot in the head while on a mission east of the Tajik
capital of Dushanbe on July 24. Two other U.N. military observers _
Ryszard Szcwczyk of Poland and Adolfo Sharpegue of Uruguay _ and
Tajik interpreter Jourajon Mahramov were also killed in the attack.
	   The Japanese mission will also discuss ways to build peace in
Tajikistan, the statement said. The officials will return to Japan
on Monday.
	   About 70 U.N. observers are stationed in Tajikistan to monitor
last year's peace deal, which ended five years of civil war in the
impoverished Central Asian country.
	   There are periodic clashes between the hard-line government and
the mostly Islamic opposition.

Bavarian court blocks deportation of delinquent minor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ A Bavarian court on Tuesday blocked the
deportation to Turkey of a 14-year-old juvenile delinquent and his
parents, who have lived in Germany more than 30 years.
	   The state administrative court ruled that there were ``serious
doubts about the legality of the decision'' to send the parents
back along with their son. The court said it will issue its own
ruling in the case as early as September.
	   A Munich court last month approved the deportation of the boy
because of his criminal record. His parents, accused of failing to
properly raise the boy, were also ordered expelled.
	   But because of the seriousness of the case, Munich Mayor
Christian Ude gave the family a chance to appeal to a higher court
before acting on the order.
	   The ruling came amid a growing election-year clamor in Germany
to crack down on foreigners who commit crimes here.
	   The boy, known as Mehmet, has committed more than 60 offenses.
He has been in police custody in Munich since allegedly committing
another robbery in July.
	   The Munich court that ordered the deportation ruled that the
teen-ager's ``years-long serious criminal behavior'' and the public
security interest justified expelling him, despite his age. It said
private counseling the boy received through a church had apparently
been ``completely unsuccessful.''
	   It also saw nothing wrong with expelling his parents with him.
	   While the decision was welcomed by Ude and other city and state
officials, the liberal Greens Party accused the state of trying to
make an entire family liable for the crimes of one member.

Se Ri Pak bidding for third major
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LYTHAM ST. ANNES, England (AP) _ Se Ri Pak holds her backswing
at halfway and coach David Leadbeater turns her wrist slightly to
teach her the best way to attack the ball.
	   With four wins _ including two majors _ already this year, the
rookie phenomenon from South Korea is getting ready to tackle a
tricky, windy links course at the Women's British Open.
	   ``It's very different for her. She's never seen a golf course
like this before,'' Leadbeater, who has helped Nick Faldo and Nick
Price to major triumphs, said of his 20-year-old pupil.
	   ``It's another shock to the system.''
	   Pak, winner of the LPGA championship and U.S. Women's Open in
her rookie year, as well as two more tournaments out of 10 starts,
finds something new every day she goes out onto the golf course.
	   ``I'm learning from all the other players,'' Pak said as she
walked off the practice green Tuesday at sunny but windy Lytham.
``I watch to see how they deal with situations on and off the
course and see how they experience all kinds of things.
	   ``I know that all sorts of things are going to happen to me so
that seeing as much of all these different courses will help me.
	   ``But I haven't made a bad start so far,'' she said, stifling a
giggle.
	   Pak's amazing form on the U.S. Tour has eclipsed even Tiger
Woods' accomplishments in men's competition. He's only won one
major.
	   After winning the LPGA in May, Pak became the first woman under
age 21 to win two majors when she beat amateur Jenny Chausiriporn
in a 20-hole playoff in the U.S. Open.
	   Pak then set two LPGA scoring records at the Jamie Farr Kroger
Classic _ a 10-under 61 in the second round and a four-round total
of 261. Then she made it four wins in nine tournaments with a
triumph at the Giant Eagle Classic.
	   Now she takes on one of the courses which has frustrated some of
the biggest names in men't golf but now hosts the Women's British
Open for the first time.
	   ``This course is really narrow and the bunkers and the rough are
so different,'' Pak said. ``The greens are not so smooth and fast
and they don't spin so much. I think I've got to become more smart
to play them. And then there's the wind.''
	   For the first time since 1986, the tournament has returned to
the coastal, links-type course associated with the men's Open. That
means even if there's isn't a cloud in the sky, the wind from the
sea can play tricks with the line of flight.
	   That's where Leadbeater comes in.
	   Daughter of a Korean amateur champion, Pak, who only took up
golf seriously at age 14, was sent to Orlando to gain some of the
expertise of one of the biggest names in golf coaching.
	   ``She's starting to learn about all kinds of golf courses,''
said Leadbeater. ``But she has so much great natural talent. Her
dad was a really good player and she has got all the fundamentals.
	   ``As a youngster, she was a hurdler and a shot putter so that
she also has great strength, especially in her legs, and great
flexibility,'' Leadbeater said. ``And she has an unbelieveable
temperament. She never gets flustered.''
	   Pak's father, Toon Chul Pak, will be here to watch her this
week. With Leadbetter as her coach and former Faldo caddie Andy
Podger carrying her bag around a course he knows well, Pak is well
equipped to pick up yet another big trophy and a first prize of
100,000 pounds (dlrs 165,000).

	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Zimbabwean police Tuesday dragged away
30 women seeking to demonstrate during President Robert Mugabe's
annual speech honoring those who fought white rule.
	   ``These are sacred places and we shall ensure in the future that
no demonstrators will be allowed in these shrines,'' a visibly
angered Mugabe said.
	   Last year he was forced to cut his Heroes' Day speech short by
jeering ex-guerrillas who demanded that 55,000 war veterans receive
pay outs similar to politicians with dubious combat records.
	   They received the pensions, one of a series of government
pay-outs over the past year that have nearly bankrupted the
government.
	   The women, wearing T-shirts saying ``Wives of Fallen Heroes,''
were on Tuesday also demanding payouts and pensions.
	   The War Veterans' chairman, Chenjerai Hitler Hunzwi, ordered his
members to boycott the ceremony to protest the presence of tribal
chiefs who supported Ian Smith's Rhodesian security forces during
the 1972-80 bush war.
	   Mugabe charged that former supporters of Smith's white rule are
threatening democracy in Zimbabwe, as the former Rhodesia is known.
	   -----
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria's new military ruler is probing
fraud charges against two former cabinet ministers in the inner
circle of the late dictator Gen. Sani Abacha, press reports said
Tuesday.
	   Ex-foreign minister Tom Ikimi and ex-minerals minister Kaloma
Ali allegedly stole government funds worth more than dlrs 1
million, the weekly Tell magazine reported, citing unnamed
government sources.
	   An independent investigator has been appointed to look into the
charges, several other newspapers said.
	   Both Ikimi and Ali were fired last month by Abacha's successor,
Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, who has promised a transition to civilian
rule by the end of May next year and purged the government of many
of Abacha's former allies.
	   The new military ruler has vowed to crack down on corruption and
reportedly seized the bank accounts of several relatives of Abacha.
	   -------
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ Foreign ministers and diplomats from
seven West African countries met Tuesday with mediators from
Portuguese-speaking states to discuss a future round of peace talks
between Guinea-Bissau's warring sides.
	   The foreign ministers from the Economic Community of West
African States, ECOWAS, met with delegates of the Community of
Portuguese Speaking Countries, CPLP, which mediated weekend talks
between Joao Bernardo Vieira's government and the rebel faction
loyal to Brig. Ansumane Mane.
	   ECOWAS and CPLP will try to ``harmonize'' their efforts to end
their conflict, Ivory Coast Foreign Minister Essy Amara said in a
brief statement before the delegates went into discussions behind
closed doors.
	   The last round of peace talks were held Saturday on a Portuguese
ship anchored off the coast of Guinea-Bissau's capital.
	   Participants in the two-month conflict agreed to abide by a
cease-fire until another round of talks on Aug. 18 and 19 in Cape
Verde.
	   ------
	   BRAZZAVILLE, Republic of Congo (AP) _ Soldiers in the Republic
of Congo have begun the harrowing task of clearing land mines in
open fields surrounding the international airport in the capital of
Brazzaville.
	   Residents awoke to the sound of four loud explosions near the
airport and were only told later by military officials in a radio
message on Sunday that the mines were being destroyed.
	   The airport was a key stronghold of former president Pascal
Lissouba, who was ousted by his main rival Denis Sassou-Nguesso
last October following a five-month war that killed an estimated
10,000 people.
	   Mines were also planted in several neighborhoods of Brazzaville,
parts of which were completely destroyed in the fighting.

Military accused of wrongdoing _ again _ in Bosnia in 1995
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JENIFER CHAO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ First it was blamed for doing
little, if anything, to stop some of the Bosnian war's worst
bloodshed.
	   Now the Dutch military is reeling under new accusations that it
intentionally destroyed film that allegedly showed some of its U.N.
peacekeepers helping the Bosnian Serbs separate Muslim men from
women for deportation.
	   The fresh allegations rekindled debate Tuesday over the role of
Dutch soldiers during the fall of the northeastern Bosnia enclave
of Srebrenica in 1995. Lawmakers called for an investigation.
	   At the center of the controversy are several rolls of film taken
during the siege of Srebrenica, a U.N.-declared ``safe haven'' that
became a killing field where thousands of Muslims were slain and
buried in mass graves.
	   A Dutch peacekeeper who took the pictures told the respected
Dutch television program Nova last weekend that he had captured
images showing Bosnian Serbs committing atrocities, as well as
Dutch soldiers helping with the selection of Muslim men for
deportation.
	   It was not clear exactly how many peacekeepers were involved.
	   The film was turned over to the Defense Ministry but was
accidentally destroyed during processing in 1995, officials have
said previously. They have also repeatedly denied that any attempts
were made to cover up possible Dutch wrongdoings in Srebrenica.
	   In a statement to Nova, the photographer _ who was not
identified _ said he didn't believe the loss of the film was an
accident. He also said there were other peacekeepers who witnessed
Dutch cooperation with the Serbs were ignored by the ministry and
left out of an official report.
	   Dutch military police investigators asked the Defense Ministry
in 1995 to investigate possible instances of Dutch cooperation and
misconduct, but the ministry ignored the request, an official told
Nova on Monday.
	   Defense Ministry officials were not immediately available for
comment Tuesday.
	   The latest accusations have renewed Dutch doubts about what
their troops did and didn't do at Srebrenica.
	   The 300 Dutch troops stationed at the enclave did not stop the
Serbs from overrunning the town, and they were widely blamed for
permitting the slaughter of Muslim refugees. Their commanders said
later that their U.N. mandate was too weak.
	   Four Dutch medics claimed they were ordered not to treat Muslim
civilians wounded during Srebrenica's fall. The Defense Ministry
denied it, but suffered another credibility blow when the top
commander, Lt. Col. Ton Karremans, was photographed glass in hand
with Serb Gen. Ratko Mladic after the town's capture.
	   Immediately after the fall of Srebrenica, the Defense Ministry
conducted an internal investigation which officially absolved the
Dutch unit in question of any wrongdoing.
	   Another investigation by the prominent Netherlands State
Institute for War Documentation is still in progress.

Hanson damaging Australia's tourism image, industry leader warns
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australia's reputation as friendly to
Asian tourists is being threatened by the rise of right-wing
populist politician Pauline Hanson, a tourism industry leader
warned Tuesday.
	   ``There's been a perception in parts of Asia that Australia is
not as friendly as it used to be,'' said John Schaap, chairman of
Tourism Council of Australia. ``Of course that's very far from the
truth.''
	   Schaap told a lunch meeting of tourism industry leaders that the
industry must make sure all Australians recognize the importance of
tourism to the economy, and that Australia's friendly image
continues overseas.
	   ``This negative sentiment in a major market is a real concern,
one we must recognize and one we must reverse,'' Schaap said.
	   At a time when the Australian tourism industry is under pressure
because of the Asian financial crisis, the nation's image abroad
had been changed by negative perceptions stemming from Pauline
Hanson and her One Nation party, Schaap said.
	   Hanson made headlines throughout Asia when One Nation won about
23 percent of the vote in a Queensland state election in June.
Hanson is controversial for warning that Australia is in danger of
being ``Asianized'' and advocating policies including drastic cuts
to immigration numbers, an end to special welfare benefits for
Aborigines and economic protectionism.
	   In the 12 months to the end of April, Asian visitors to
Australia dropped almost 9 percent to 1.18 million, Schaap said.
Numbers of visitors from the Americas and Europe grew by around 10
percent.
	   The latest figures, for May, show Asian visitors down by 23
percent from the same month last year.
	   Schaap said tourism forecasters were pointing to some growth in
overall numbers next year.
	   ``I think some of the markets are at the bottom of their down
cycle and are starting to stabilize,'' he said.

BRAZZAVILLE ... in the fighting.

	   ------
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ The U.N. refugee agency has begun
airlifting returning Sierra Leonean refugees from a town in
southwestern Guinea to Sierra Leone's capital of Freetown, U.N. and
government officials said Tuesday.
	   Two aircraft carrying 115 Sierra Leoneans were the first of 10
flights per week the agency expects to use to return some 3,000
Sierra Leoneans from the Guinean town of Kissidougou, a spokesman
for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said in
Geneva.
	   The flights were organized to avoid a long cross-country trip to
Guinea's capital of Conakry followed by a boat ride to Freetown.
Travelling by land across Sierra Leone is risky because rebels
continue to terrorize towns in the interior.
	   Tens of thousands of Sierra Leoneans have fled their country as
a result of revenge attacks by rebels and former junta forces
ousted in March by a West African intervention force.
	   -----
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ One of the principal clerical lawyers
in an Islamic court in southwestern Somalia was shot dead by
gunmen, witnesses said Tuesday.
	   Sheik Abdurahman Sayid Sheik Hassan, who served at Belet Huen,
and one of his bodyguards were killed when he left his office for
home Monday.
	   Belet Huen is 300 kilometers (187 miles) north of Mogadishu on
the Ethiopian border.
	   The killing is likely related to a dispute between two sub-clans
that had fought over land near the Ethiopian border where several
people were killed and more than 200 heads of cattle were stolen,
sources said.
	   Since the central administration in Somalia collapsed in 1991,
Islamic courts have become the only judicial system in the country.
	   -----
	   NAIROBI, Kenya _ The U.N World Food Program has sent a convoy of
seven barges carrying 2,125 tons of relief food on a six-week trip
up the Nile River to feed starving people in southern Sudan, the
agency said Tuesday.
	   ``We have been sending barges up the Nile and other rivers in
Sudan for the past six years. It is one of the most cost-effective
ways of reaching large numbers of people in isolated areas,'' said
Tesema Negash, WFP deputy director for Africa in charge of the
agency's northern operation.
	   The WFP crew will discharge food at 34 locations along the
1,500-kilometer (937 mile) route to Juba, the last government
stronghold in southern Sudan.
	   A 15-year civil war between government troops and southern
rebels has resulted in widespread famine and displacement of
people.
	   The barge convoy originated in Kosti, south of the capital,
Khartoum.
	   -----
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ After months of dithering over a price for
the state-owned Consolidated Copper Mines, the government expects
to make a major announcement on the sale in the near future, a
presidential press aide said Tuesday.
	   ``A lot of work is currently going on in the background to
dispose of Zambia's premier mines,'' said Richard Sakala. ``A major
announcement will be made soon, possibly this weekend or next
week.''
	   Last month, Zambian officials said the British mining firm Metal
Resources was negotiating to buy the Nchanga and Nkana mines, which
have been losing money.
	   The government is under donor pressure to privatize the mines as
a condition for release of dlrs 350 million in funds.
	   The delayed sale of the mines has caused havoc in financial and
stock markets, plunging the economy into uncertainty.
	   The state copper mines account for 10 percent of the economy and
earn 90 percent of Zambia's foreign currency holdings.

Chirac, Jospin chided for leaving country behind on vacation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DENIS BOULARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ They left on foreign vacations as millions of
French do in August. But it was the first time in at least four
decades the president and prime minister were both abroad, and
critics say that leaves France as a ship without a rudder.
	   ``But who is at the controls?'' headlined the Tuesday edition of
the daily France-Soir, with photos of a tieless President Jacques
Chirac on Mauritius and sun-drenched Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
on a Greek island.
	   Even former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing said he was
irritated.
	   President Charles de Gaulle ``set the rule that one of the two
figures of state had to remain constantly present on national
territory to face an emergency situation,'' Giscard told
France-Soir.
	   ``This rule has been respected continuously since 1958,'' he
said, referring to the year France's Fifth Republic was
established.
	   At Chirac's Elysee Palace and Jospin's Hotel Matignon offices in
Paris, officials assured that the government was humming along just
fine, thank you. France quickly issued reactions to last week's
U.S. Embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania, they argued.
	   An Elysee spokesman noted that Chirac was, as usual, traveling
with all the necessary communications to stay in touch with Paris.
His two top aides -- Chief of Staff Bertrand Landrieu and
Secretary-General Dominique de Villepin -- were watching the store.
	   At Matignon, officials also assured that Jospin was in contact
several times a day with his assistant chief of staff, Jean-Pierre
Joyet, and could return from the island of Antiparos within three
hours.
	   Chirac and Jospin are to return to France next week for the
first post-vacation Council of Ministers meeting Aug. 19.

Lockheed wins Australian defense contract
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ U.S. aerospace company Lockheed
Martin has won contracts worth U.S. dlrs 74 million (125 million
Australian dollars) for four new air defense radar systems for the
Australian Defense Forces, the government announced Tuesday.
	   Australian Defense Minister Ian McLachlan said the new radar
systems would replace systems operated by the Royal Australian Air
Force at Williamtown, in New South Wales state, and Darwin, in the
Northern Territory.
	   Lockheed Martin teamed up with Australian company Tenix Defense
Systems and RLM Systems, a joint venture between Lockheed and
Tenix, to offer the new TPS-117 tactically mobile long-range air
defense radar systems, McLachlan said.
	   Under the contract, Lockheed will supply the radar systems and
support services for five years.
	   ``The new radar systems will contribute to the overall
surveillance and control of Australian air space,'' McLachlan said.
	   ``The enhanced performance of the TPS-117 radars will provide
improved detection of aircraft even in adverse weather conditions.
They can be relocated by air, rail, sea or road, including tactical
cross-country deployments by all-wheel-drive vehicles.''
	   McLachlan said the first radar was expected to be delivered for
evaluation by December 2000.

Annan: failure to monitor Kosovo arms embargo has eroded peace
</HEADLINE>
chances &QL; 
 &UR; By RON KAMPEAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ International agencies have failed to make
good on promises to monitor an arms embargo on Kosovo, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan told the Security Council on Tuesday,
and the influx of arms has eroded chances for compromise.
	   The Security Council is considering Annan's written report on
the Kosovo situation. At least three member countries _ Britain,
France and Slovenia, the council's current president _ hope to get
the council to announce action against Yugoslavia.
	   Annan notes that soon after the conflict between Serbian
authorities and ethnic Albanian separatists broke earlier this
year, he had recommended that organizations such as NATO and the
European Union set up a regime to monitor the arms embargo.
	   The organizations expressed a willingness to do so, he says, but
so far nothing has materialized.
	   ``The continuing infiltration from outside the borders of the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia of weapons and fighting men is a
source of continuing widespread concern,'' Annan's report says,
referring the flow of Albanians into the province.
	   That has led to ``a particularly dangerous element,'' he writes:
``the move in certain quarters away from a willingness to search
for compromise.''
	   Also of concern, Annan writes, is a ``dramatic increase in
internally displaced persons in Kosovo and Montenegro.'' He quotes
the U.N. refugee agency as saying that 100,000 people have been
driven from their homes by the conflict.
	   Serb forces have recently pushed the secessionists from most of
the strategic central region in the Serbian province, an offensive
that has killed hundreds.
	   Reports of violence against civilians have prompted some Western
nations to warn Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic of strong action
if he does order his forces to back down.
	   Two permanent Security Council members, China and Russia, have
resisted sanctions against Yugoslavia, but their position might
have been eroded by the violence.
	   The Russians, particularly, have been disappointed that
Milosevic has not made good on pledges to pursue a peaceful
compromise.
	   The Clinton administration has said that NATO has approved
contingency plans to use military action against Serb forces in
Kosovo.
	   Kosovo is a province in southern Serbia, where ethnic Albanians,
who demand independence, represent 90 percent of the population.
Serbia and the smaller republic of Montenegro make up what is left
of Yugoslavia.

Dysentery outbreak reported in central Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ An outbreak of dysentery has sickened 126 people,
half of them children, in the central Russian republic of Udmurtia,
the ITAR-Tass news agency said Tuesday.
	   Local emergency officials blamed contaminated drinking water.
They said artesian wells in the region were in disrepair and some
had not been cleaned for a long time.
	   Tons of garbage were found in a water reservoir and a village
pond where children swam contained waste from a cattle farm,
ITAR-Tass said.
	   Dysentery is an intestinal infection, whose symptoms include
abdominal pain and severe diarrhea.

Tanjug: six Serb policemen wounded in Decane fighting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslavia's official Tanjug news
agency reported Tuesday fighting in Kosovo's Decane region, close
to the border with Albania, saying six Serb policemen were wounded
in the clashes.
	   It said fighting was concentrated along Decane-Djakovica road,
in western Kosovo, in the villages of Prilep and Glodjane, known to
be strongholds of the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army
fighting for secession of the province from Serbia and Yugoslavia.
It said the police were gaining ground against the KLA.
	   The Tanjug report was the first Serb confirmation of the
fighting in the border region in recent days.
	   Ethnic Albanian sources have reported that Serbs launched an
offensive against KLA forces in the area on Sunday. The Decane
region has seen some of the worst fighting in the past several
months of the Kosovo conflict.
	   Tanjug claimed large groups of KLA fighters were attacking
police patrols along the strategic road with an aim to keep Serb
forces away from the village of Junik, the biggest KLA stronghold
in western Kosovo, which has been encircled by police for three
weeks.
	   Tanjug said several hundred KLA men were firing at police from
Junik Tuesday, but the police did not fire back on the village.
	   Ethnic Albanian sources also reported fighting Tuesday in the
Decane region and claimed that a huge column of 110 Yugoslav Army
vehicles, including 36 tanks, was seen heading for the embattled
region.

King Hussein tries to still rumors about succession
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ King Hussein, in an apparent attempt to
quiet rumors that have risen with his illness, said Tuesday that
his brother, Crown Prince Hassan, would become king as long planned
once Hussein's rule has ended.
	   Hussein made the comments in an interview with Radio Monte
Carlo, a Arabic-language station in France that is widely listened
to in the Arab world. He spoke from the United States where he is
undergoing treatment for lymphatic cancer.
	   With the illness of the 63-year-old king, persistent rumors of
dissension in the royal family over the succession to the throne
have increased. But Hussein stressed he had not changed his mind
since choosing his brother as crown prince in 1965.
	   ``The heir to the throne is my brother, whom I have chosen over
many others in the past years, and he has proved to be up to the
responsibility and has been performing his duties to the utmost,''
Hussein said.
	   Hussein, the longest-reigning ruler in the Middle East, marked
46 years on the throne Tuesday. He is known as a classic survivor
who has escaped repeated assassination attempts and ridden out the
Middle East's turbulent politics.
	   Fears have long been expressed that Hassan, 51, who is viewed as
far less charismatic than his older brother, would have a harder
time in the regional rough and tumble.
	   Much speculation also has been dedicated to who would follow
Hassan as ruler _ his son or one of Hussein's _ and lately the talk
has been that a change in succession could be made even before
Hassan came to power.
	   But Hussein described rumors on possibly changing the heir as
``baseless and unjustified.''
	   The Jordanian monarch entered the Mayo Clinic in Rochester,
Minnesota, on July 14 complaining of persistent fever. He was
diagnosed with lymphatic cancer and is undergoing chemotherapy.
	   He publicly announced his illness to his people in an interview
on Jordan television July 28, saying he expected to survive and
continue to rule.
	   Hussein underwent surgery to remove cancer from his ureter and
left kidney at the Mayo Clinic in 1992 and has had regular medical
checkups at the clinic since.

Azerbaijan's opposition calls weekend rallies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Two Azerbaijani opposition parties plan rallies
around the country on Saturday to protest preparations for the
country's October presidential elections, the Interfax news agency
reported Tuesday.
	   The National Front and the Musavat Party said that the rallies
were called to ``protest the anti-democratic situation in the
country prior to the presidential elections,'' Interfax said.
	   Both parties are opposed to the rule of President Geidar Aliev,
who was Azerbaijan's Soviet-era Communist Party boss and came to
power in a bloodless military coup in June 1993. He is running for
re-election.
	   Officials in the capital Baku have refused to give permission
for the rally, which is planned for a central square. Baku Mayor
Rafael Allakhverdiyev said the square would be ``closed for
reconstruction for the next few days,'' Interfax reported.

Se Ri Pak bidding for third major
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: fixes spelling of Leadbetter throughout
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LYTHAM ST. ANNES, England (AP) _ Se Ri Pak holds her backswing
at halfway and coach David Leadbetter turns her wrist slightly to
teach her the best way to attack the ball.
	   With four wins _ including two majors _ already this year, the
rookie phenomenon from South Korea is getting ready to tackle a
tricky, windy links course at the Women's British Open.
	   ``It's very different for her. She's never seen a golf course
like this before,'' Leadbetter, who has helped Nick Faldo and Nick
Price to major triumphs, said of his 20-year-old pupil.
	   ``It's another shock to the system.''
	   Pak, winner of the LPGA championship and U.S. Women's Open in
her rookie year, as well as two more tournaments out of 10 starts,
finds something new every day she goes out onto the golf course.
	   ``I'm learning from all the other players,'' Pak said as she
walked off the practice green Tuesday at sunny but windy Lytham.
``I watch to see how they deal with situations on and off the
course and see how they experience all kinds of things.
	   ``I know that all sorts of things are going to happen to me so
that seeing as much of all these different courses will help me.
	   ``But I haven't made a bad start so far,'' she said, stifling a
giggle.
	   Pak's amazing form on the U.S. Tour has eclipsed even Tiger
Woods' accomplishments in men's competition. He's only won one
major.
	   After winning the LPGA in May, Pak became the first woman under
age 21 to win two majors when she beat amateur Jenny Chausiriporn
in a 20-hole playoff in the U.S. Open.
	   Pak then set two LPGA scoring records at the Jamie Farr Kroger
Classic _ a 10-under 61 in the second round and a four-round total
of 261. Then she made it four wins in nine tournaments with a
triumph at the Giant Eagle Classic.
	   Now she takes on one of the courses which has frustrated some of
the biggest names in men't golf but now hosts the Women's British
Open for the first time.
	   ``This course is really narrow and the bunkers and the rough are
so different,'' Pak said. ``The greens are not so smooth and fast
and they don't spin so much. I think I've got to become more smart
to play them. And then there's the wind.''
	   For the first time since 1986, the tournament has returned to
the coastal, links-type course associated with the men's Open. That
means even if there's isn't a cloud in the sky, the wind from the
sea can play tricks with the line of flight.
	   That's where Leadbetter comes in.
	   Daughter of a Korean amateur champion, Pak, who only took up
golf seriously at age 14, was sent to Orlando to gain some of the
expertise of one of the biggest names in golf coaching.
	   ``She's starting to learn about all kinds of golf courses,''
said Leadbetter. ``But she has so much great natural talent. Her
dad was a really good player and she has got all the fundamentals.
	   ``As a youngster, she was a hurdler and a shot putter so that
she also has great strength, especially in her legs, and great
flexibility,'' Leadbetter said. ``And she has an unbelieveable
temperament. She never gets flustered.''
	   Pak's father, Toon Chul Pak, will be here to watch her this
week. With Leadbetter as her coach and former Faldo caddie Andy
Podger carrying her bag around a course he knows well, Pak is well
equipped to pick up yet another big trophy and a first prize of
100,000 pounds (dlrs 165,000).

Military accused of wrongdoing _ again _ in Bosnia in 1995
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JENIFER CHAO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ First it was blamed for doing
little, if anything, to stop some of the Bosnian war's worst
bloodshed.
	   Now the Dutch military is reeling under new accusations that it
intentionally destroyed film that allegedly showed some of its U.N.
peacekeepers helping the Bosnian Serbs separate Muslim men from
women for deportation.
	   The fresh allegations rekindled debate Tuesday over the role of
Dutch soldiers during the fall of the northeastern Bosnia enclave
of Srebrenica in 1995. Lawmakers called for an investigation.
	   At the center of the controversy are several rolls of film taken
during the siege of Srebrenica, a U.N.-declared ``safe haven'' that
became a killing field where thousands of Muslims were slain and
buried in mass graves.
	   A Dutch peacekeeper who took the pictures told the respected
Dutch television program Nova last weekend that he had captured
images showing Bosnian Serbs committing atrocities, as well as
Dutch soldiers helping with the selection of Muslim men for
deportation.
	   It was not clear exactly how many peacekeepers were involved.
	   The film was turned over to the Defense Ministry but was
accidentally destroyed during processing in 1995, officials have
said previously. They have also repeatedly denied that any attempts
were made to cover up possible Dutch wrongdoings in Srebrenica.
	   In a statement to Nova, the photographer _ who was not
identified _ said he didn't believe the loss of the film was an
accident. He also said other peacekeepers who witnessed Dutch
cooperation with the Serbs were ignored by the ministry and left
out of an official report.
	   Dutch military police investigators asked the Defense Ministry
in 1995 to investigate possible instances of Dutch cooperation and
misconduct, but the ministry ignored the request, an official told
Nova on Monday.
	   Defense Ministry officials were not immediately available for
comment Tuesday.
	   The latest accusations have renewed Dutch doubts about what
their troops did and didn't do at Srebrenica.
	   The 300 Dutch troops stationed at the enclave did not stop the
Serbs from overrunning the town, and they were widely blamed for
permitting the slaughter of Muslim refugees. Their commanders said
later that their U.N. mandate was too weak.
	   Four Dutch medics claimed they were ordered not to treat Muslim
civilians wounded during Srebrenica's fall. The Defense Ministry
denied it, but suffered another credibility blow when the top
commander, Lt. Col. Ton Karremans, was photographed glass in hand
with Serb Gen. Ratko Mladic after the town's capture.
	   Immediately after the fall of Srebrenica, the Defense Ministry
conducted an internal investigation which officially absolved the
Dutch unit in question of any wrongdoing.
	   Another investigation by the prominent Netherlands State
Institute for War Documentation is still in progress.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 4-5 with search for Rose and body of woman
named Rose being found &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Investigators began to piece together
evidence from last week's U.S. Embassy bombings Tuesday, with a
Kenyan guard's eyewitness account providing possibly important
clues and 14 arrests in Tanzania.
	   Twin terrorist bombings in Kenya and Tanzania claimed at least
230 lives and injured nearly 5,000, and the death toll continued to
rise.
	   More bodies were pulled from the rubble in Nairobi Tuesday,
bringing the death toll here to 220, the National Disaster
Operation Center said.
	   Israeli soldiers continued to dig for a woman named Rose. Her
voice fell silent Sunday, but they heard a tapping noise Monday
that spurred them on. Three times Tuesday, Israelis dropped a
microphone into the crevice where Rose was believed to be trapped,
but heard nothing.
	   ``We have retrieved a name of Rose amongst the dead,'' said Army
Maj. Gen. George Agoi, head of the Kenyan search and rescue
operation. ``But at the moment it's very difficult for me to
confirm whether it was the Rose we were speaking to earlier, or
whether there is another Rose.''
	   In Tanzania, 14 foreigners were arrested in connection with the
bombing of the Dar es Salaam embassy that claimed 10 Africans'
lives, said police spokesman Aden Mwanunyange.
	   Arrested were six Sudanese, six Iraqis, one Somali and Turk, he
said, citing ``dubious characters and intelligence information that
they may have taken part in the incident.''
	   In Nairobi, the East African Standard said guard Joash Okindo
and his colleagues, armed only with short wooden clubs, confronted
five men, stopping them at a barrier to the embassy's front parking
lot, and forcing them to turn into the rear parking lot.
	   The attackers then jumped from the truck and opened fire with
automatic rifles. At least one Marine returned fire and one of the
attackers threw a hand grenade. Moments later, the truck exploded,
Okindo told the Kenya Television Network Monday.
	   ``We saved people's lives by sending it to the rear entrance,''
Okindo told the Standard. ``If we hadn't done that, I don't think I
would be alive and talking to you now.''
	   The Standard said it talked to Okindo before he was taken out of
the country on a U.S. medical evacuation flight to Germany for
treatment of serious wounds, but a U.S. official said he remained
in Kenya.
	   ``We called the FBI agent and he said no. It's a similar name
apparently. The guard we're talking about is still down there in
Nairobi, and has been,'' U.S. Col. Robert Harvey, commander at
Landstuhl, a U.S. military hospital near Ramstein Air Base, 160
kilometers (100 miles) southeast of Frankfurt.
	   Okindo ``resisted heroically,'' U.S. State Department spokesman
James Foley said in Washington.
	   At the wreckage of the Dar es Salaam embassy, a dozen FBI agents
swept and raked Laibon Road in front of the embassy building,
collecting and sifting through debris in their search for evidence.
	   Israel army radio also signaled a possible break in the cases.
In a report from Nairobi, it said investigators suspect the bombers
used the sophisticated plastic explosive Semtex.
	   Capt. Rhyl Jones, garrison engineer of the British Army in Kenya
who has surveyed the wreckage, estimated the bomb could have
contained up to 250 kilograms (550 pounds) of explosives, depending
on what type was used.
	   ``My opinion is that it was definitely a commercial explosive.
This wasn't a homemade device,'' said Jones, who has investigated
bombings by the Irish Republican Army in Britain.
	   The FBI says finding out what kind of explosives were used and
how would be critical to the investigation.
	   So would an informant, and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
on Monday offered a dlrs 2 million reward for information leading
to the capture of the ``cowards that committed this act.''

Germany's stock market drops along with rest of Europe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Activity on the Frankfurt Stock
Exchange reflected the continued slide in global markets Tuesday,
with Wall Street setting off a selling wave that dropped the DAX 30
points in late trading.
	   The electronic index settled down 3.2 percent from Monday's
close, at 5285.78, after wavering between 5300 and 5400 points
during trading.
	   Traders said turmoil in Russian financial markets, including the
11.8 percent drop in the Russian Trading System before trade was
suspended, also weighed on the German market.
	   Auto stocks bore the brunt of the losses, but managed to keep a
grip on their retreats. Daimler settled down 2.3 percent at 174
marks and a late rally nudged BMW into positive territory at the
close of the session, up 0.1 percent at 1,574 marks.
	   The recent poor performance of Volkswagen stock guaranteed its
continued plunge, as it closed down nearly 8 percent at 140.85
marks.
	   Software maker SAP was also a big loser in Tuesday's trading
session, closing down 7.4 percent at 1,047 marks.

OAU team expected for talks on Congo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with call from Kenya's Daniel arap Moi for
international community to ``take measures'' to contain current
violence &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ A team of African diplomats attempting to
mediate a spreading rebellion in the Congo was expected in Uganda
Tuesday but had not arrived by early evening, a Foreign Ministry
spokesman said.
	   Diplomats from Zimbabwe, Zambia, Tanzania and Namibia were in
Kinshasa Monday under the auspices of the Organization of African
Unity to talk with the government of President Laurent Kabila about
a peaceful solution to the revolt by Tutsi-led rebels that broke
erupted at the beginning of the month in eastern Congo along the
Ugandan and Rwandan borders.
	   ``They want peace to return to our region particularly regarding
the situation in the Congo and follow up what they were supposed to
achieve,'' said Edward Kwisensonyi.
	   In neighboring Kenya, President Daniel arap Moi said he
considered it ``prudent'' for the international community to take
measures to contain the violence in Congo ``so as to allow the
people ... to redirect their energies and resources towards the
political and economic reconstruction of their country.''
	   Moi was close to Mobutu Sese Seko, the longtime dictator ousted
by Kabila's rebellion in May 1997.
	   In a statement, Moi emphasized that he had previously expressed
fears ``that the underlying problems in the 1996/97 crisis had not
been properly addressed and that the crisis would recur. These
facts have turned out to be true.''
	   The Ugandan Foreign Ministry disputed Congolese charges that
Ugandan troops have been pouring into the volatile Kivu region of
eastern Congo.
	   ``The baseless and unfortunate claims by the Congolese minister
(Information Minister Didier Mumenge) are intended to hoodwink and
contradict Uganda's principled policy of good neighborliness and
non-interference in the internal affairs of other states,'' the
statement said.
	   Uganda and its southern neighbor, Rwanda, were early backers of
Kabila when he led an eight-month drive to topple dictator Mobutu
Sese Seko in May 1997.
	   It is widely believed that Rwandan troops are again helping the
rebels in eastern Congo.
	   Uganda, under an agreement with the Congolese, has had a
military detachment several kilometers inside the Congolese border
in the foothills of the Rwenzori Mountains in an attempt to flush
out rebels that are attacking western Uganda.

`Bigger is Better' motto driving trans-Atlantic mergers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ What drives British Petroleum to buy Amoco,
British Telecom to hook up with AT&AMP;T, or steers Daimler toward
Chrysler?
	   Analysts looking to explain this year's tidal wave of
trans-Atlantic deals pointed Tuesday to factors ranging from the
advent of European monetary union to fear of being left behind in
an increasingly tough, global marketplace.
	   ``It's become a much more competitive environment,'' says Jeremy
Hawkins, chief economist for Europe at Bank of America in London.
``To survive in many ways you've simply got to be big.''
	   BP and Amoco echoed that view in announcing their dlrs 48
billion stock deal _ potentially the biggest industrial merger in
history.
	   ``We are uniting two excellent portfolios of assets and people
to create a group that will have the financial resources, scale and
global reach to compete effectively in the 21st century,'' their
statement said.
	   Amoco, based in Chicago, has been struggling recently to catch
up with other American oil companies that have moved away from the
maturing U.S. marketplace.
	   Because of the size of the U.S. economy, U.S. firms could grow
to become giants simply by focusing mainly on their domestic
market. That also gave them an edge in competing overseas, since
their local rivals were usually much smaller.
	   But with the strengthening of trading blocs like the European
Union, European firms especially have been expanding and
consolidating to a size where they can more easily take on the
American giants.
	   The planned Jan. 1 introduction of a single European currency in
11 countries has accelerated the trend _ and woken up many U.S.
companies to the new competition.
	   ``It's not possible any longer for the United States to remain
so inward looking,'' Hawkins said.
	   There's also savings to be derived from economies of scale.
	   In a conference call with analysts, BP and Amoco executives said
the merger of the two oil giants should save the combined company
dlrs 2 billion a year by the end of 2000.
	   BP deputy chief executive Rodney Chase said consolidation in the
oil industry is ``long overdue,'' and suggested this was but the
first merger among major oil companies.
	   Hawkins said he also expected the buying spree to continue for
several years.
	   ``For most players, dealing in everyday type goods and services,
it's simply the case you've got to be up there with the biggest in
order to survive,'' he said.

Art historian Michael Kitson dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Michael Kitson, a leading art historian and
professor at universities in Britain and the United States, has
died at age 72.
	   He died Aug. 7 at home in London, his family announced. No cause
of death was given.
	   Kitson was one of the leading experts on Claude Lorraine, the
17th century French landscape painter, and on English artist J.M.W.
Turner. But he also wrote authoritative books on Rembrandt and
Caravaggio, as well as Baroque art and romanticism.
	   He taught from 1955 to 1985 at the Courtauld Institute of Art in
London University, where he was a distinguished lecturer, then
professor, and by 1980, deputy director.
	   In 1986 he was appointed director of the Paul Mellon Centre for
Studies in British Art, in London, which is affiliated to Yale
University in New Haven, Connecticut. He was adjunct professor at
Yale.
	   Michael William Lely Kitson was born Jan. 30, 1926, a
clergyman's son and a descendant of the Sir Peter Lely, the 17th
century portrait painter in the court of King Charles II.
	   Kitson was educated at King's College of Cambridge University
and at the Courtauld Institute.
	   After army service in intelligence in Egypt, Kitson was
appointed in 1952 as assistant lecturer in history of art at the
Slade School of Art in London.
	   In 1955 he began his 30-year career at Courtauld.
	   The Times paid tribute in its obituary to Kitson's literary
approach to art history.
	   ``The quiet ease of his style allowed him to convey an
astonishing amount of information with no didactic straining, and
to evoke, even for those who have never drawn or painted, something
of the mysterious power of making.''
	   Kitson's marriage to Annabella Leslie Cloudsley was dissolved.
He is survived by two sons of the marriage and by Judith Colton, an
art scholar who was his close companion of many years.
	   A memorial service is to be held in London at a date to be
announced.

Annan: failure to monitor Kosovo arms embargo has eroded peace

 &UR; Ed: UPDATES with Annan describing Kosovo as ``scorched earth''
policy; higher UNHCR figure &QL; 
 &UR; By RON KAMPEAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ International agencies have failed to make
good on promises to monitor an arms embargo on Kosovo, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan told the Security Council on Tuesday,
and the influx of arms has eroded chances for compromise.
	   The Security Council is considering Annan's written report on
the Kosovo situation. At least three member countries _ Britain,
France and Slovenia, the council's current president _ hope to get
the council to announce action against Yugoslavia.
	   Annan notes that soon after the conflict between Serbian
authorities and ethnic Albanian separatists broke earlier this
year, he had recommended that organizations such as NATO and the
European Union set up a regime to monitor the arms embargo.
	   The organizations expressed a willingness to do so, he says, but
so far nothing has materialized.
	   ``The continuing infiltration from outside the borders of the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia of weapons and fighting men is a
source of continuing widespread concern,'' Annan's report says,
referring the flow of Albanians into the province.
	   That has led to ``a particularly dangerous element,'' he writes:
``the move in certain quarters away from a willingness to search
for compromise.''
	   In a separate statement released Tuesday, Annan expressed his
dismay with both sides, but reserved his harshest language for
Yugoslavia, describing its actions in Kosovo as a ``scorched
earth'' policy.
	   In his report, Annan notes ``dramatic increase in internally
displaced persons in Kosovo and Montenegro.''
	   The latest figures from the UNHCR, the U.N. refugee agency _
published Tuesday, after Annan released his report _ put the total
figure of refugees at around 240,000.

Heat wave abates in Cyprus, still hot in Switzerland, Austria

 &UR; Eds: Incorporates BC-Austria-Heat Wave, BC-Cyprus-Heat Wave. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ The worst heat wave in decades in Cyprus
abated Tuesday after killing 56 people over the past week. But
Europe was still sweating under temperatures so high they caused
the closure of schools and sent thousands to hospital.
	   Eight people died overnight Monday in Cyprus after temperatures
hit 43C (110F), the highest in 40 years, the Health Ministry said.
The heat wave began Friday.
	   Most of the dead were elderly people who suffered from
respiratory and other ailments, the ministry said. Hospitals were
stretched to the limit with the admission of some 3,200 patients
suffering from heat-related illnesses, it said.
	   But on Tuesday, temperatures dropped to 39 C (102 F), said
Andreas Philaniotis, director of the Weather Bureau.
	   They were expected to fall closer to the monthly average of 37 C
(99 F) by Thursday, he said.
	   In Switzerland, accustomed to normally mild summers,
schoolchildren in Basel were released from classes Tuesday as the
country sweated through its hottest weather in three years.
Temperatures Monday climbed as high as 35 C (95 F).
	   In nearby Biel, 17 Belgian schoolchildren and two adults were
recovering in a hospital from heat exhaustion. They were part of a
group on a camping vacation in the Swiss Alps.
	   The heat wave in Switzerland is expected to last through this
week, although storms are forecast for Thursday.
	   Temperatures were also high in Austria, which has experienced
one of its hottest summers in years.

Panel to probe why funds withheld from Holocaust survivors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A government-appointed committee will
investigate disclosures that the government refused to release
German reparation funds to improve living conditions of Holocaust
survivors in mental hospitals.
	   The committee, set up by the ministries of justice and health,
will investigate both the conditions of the Holocaust survivors who
because of their mental illness are wards of the state, and the
workings of the court-appointed Fund for the Care of Dependents
that administers their bank accounts, a statement from the Justice
Ministry said Tuesday.
	   Avner Elitsur, director of the psychiatric ward of the Abarbanel
Hospital near Tel Aviv, said government trustees had refused to
approve spending the money on televisions, air conditioners,
holiday parties and other quality-of-life improvements.
	   Elitsur said the hospital was denied the funds on the grounds
that other patients in the room would also benefit, not just the
patient whose money was being used.
	   ``It's an ethical problem,'' Elitsur told The Associated Press,
``We need to do all we can to improve their lives.''
	   About half of Abarbanel's 120 patients that are Holocaust
survivors live in bleak conditions, sharing overcrowded rooms and
suffering in the intense summer heat without air conditioning.
	   About 900 of the 360,000 Holocaust survivors in Israel are
believed to be living in mental hospitals, suffering from manic
depression, schizophrenia and other illnesses, some as a result of
their experiences in Nazi death camps. Many are in their 80s.
	   Some have accumulated large sums of money in reparations from
the German government, receiving as much as several hundred dollars
a month for the past four decades.
	   No official figure was available for the value of their
accounts. But according to the daily Maariv newspaper, the total is
in the millions, money that reverts to the state if the patients
die without heirs.

Government submits bill to outlaw Nazi materials to parliament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The government has sent its bill outlawing Nazi
symbols and literature to parliament, the Interfax news agency
reported Tuesday.
	   The legislation would prohibit the import, manufacturing and
distribution of Nazi symbols, literature and videos. People could
keep Nazi materials at home, but giving them to others would be
illegal under the law.
	   Nazi Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union during World War II
caused tremendous suffering. Yet since the Soviet collapse in 1991,
Russia has seen the rise of ultranationalist movements that have
appropriated Nazi slogans and symbols.
	   Human rights groups and neo-Nazi organizations estimate that
there are about 4,000 neo-fascists in Moscow. Most are young
skinheads who are openly racist and call for driving ethnic
minorities out of Russia.
	   If the bill submitted to parliament on Monday becomes law,
violators would be fined for a first offense and possibly jailed
for repeat offenses.

Social democrat PM says Sweden can consider health privatization
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Social Democratic Prime Minister Goeran
Persson said in an interview published Tuesday that he is willing
to consider some privatization of the country's health care system.
	   Under the Social Democrats, who have governed for most of the
century, Sweden developed an extensive and widely admired social
services system, including prestigious hospitals.
	   But the system has also been costly and services have declined
in the 1990s as the government was forced to cut back funding.
	   The deterioration of services, including overcrowded wards and
months-long waits for some elective surgery, has been a large issue
in the campaign for national elections Sept. 20.
	   Conservative party leader Carl Bildt, seeking a return to the
prime ministership he held in 1990-94, argues that privatization
could improven services and reduce waits.
	   Persson had been critical of privatization proposals, but said
in an interview with the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet that ``it is
good if you have private entrepreneurs, or main figures, that test
other ways of giving care. But the starting point must be to bring
a new method to the work.''
	   Persson said any private care-giving must be accompanied by
strict regulatory control and the possibility that local
governments could take over facilities if private operators did not
meet standards.
	   In a late July opinion poll, the Social Democrats got the
support of about 39 percent of the respondents, with Bildt's
Moderates the next highest at about 26 percent.

Crystal Palace players prisoners to technology
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Crystal Palace soccer players will come under
heavy scrutiny this year. Their movements may even be tracked by
transmitting devices in their shoes and uniforms.
	   The London-based club, desperate to earn promotion to the
Premier League, is introducing a range of hi-tech strategies to
improve its performance.
	   Coach Terry Venables will have professional observers keying his
players' every move into a computer program which, along with video
of the game, will be scrutinized for post-match analysis.
	   The transmitting devices are expected to be introduced later in
the season.
	   The second-by-second analysis was the concept of Crystal Palace
chairman Mark Goldberg.
	   ``(Venables) can look at every move within a 90-minute period,
recapture it within seconds, and show the players where they are
going wrong, with statistics that demonstrate what each of them was
doing for the whole of the 90 minutes,'' he said.
	   ``It's really our own software that we've devised, and it's
tailored to every pass or move that a player makes.
	   ``If he's supposed to man-mark a player, we're able to see how
far away he was from that player for the whole of the 90 minutes so
we can tell individual players where they went wrong so they can
improve for the next match.''
	   Goldberg said the new technology would benefit coaches working
out weak points.
	   ``There's only so much that a manager can see when he's there
watching. He will always miss out on certain individuals and
therefore not be able to provide the necessary direction to get it
right,'' he said.
	   ``I've seen players over the years do the same thing every
single week, and I believe that if only they'd been shown where
they were going wrong, they would have improved.
	   ``I think it's that element of monitoring and redirection by
Terry that will give us an edge, and there's no question that you
do need that edge.''

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Two-time national champion coach
Wanderley Luxemburgo was appointed the new manager of four-time
World Cup champion Brazil on Tuesday, taking over for Mario Zagallo
who was much-maligned in the wake of the France 98 final.
	   Luxemburgo won the Brazilian national title in 1993 and 1994
with Palmeiras, the highlight of a 16-year coaching career that
followed a lackluster 11-year playing career. The 46-year-old
sideline boss of Corinthians will remain with his club, atop the
standings by two points, through the end of the Brazilian national
championship in December.
	   After unremarkable stints as a player for Flamengo, Botafogo and
Internacional from 1971-1982, Luxemburgo started his coaching
career at Rio's Vasco da Gama as an assistant.
	   He rose to his first head coaching job in 1983 with Rio's Campo
Grande and went on to manage different 14 teams, including Saudi
Arabia's Ittihad and Shabab.
	   He first gained national attention in 1990 as coach of
Bragantino, taking the small club to the Paulista, or Sao Paulo
state title.
	   He moved on to Palmeiras, where he won the Paulista again in
1993 and 1994, in addition to the national titles.
	   After coaching Flamengo in 1995, he returned to Palmeiras to
once more reclaim the Paulista in 1996.
	   He coached Santos in 1997 before moving to Corinthians this
season.
	   Luxemburgo takes over a team that advanced unconvingly to the
World Cup final in Paris, where a game-day illness to Ronaldo shook
the squad and resulted in a 3-0 loss to France.
	   Zagallo, criticized during the tournament for what some called
the team's uninspired play, was severely condemned for using
Ronaldo in the final and the resulting loss.
	   The first players for the new national team should be named some
time in September for the three or four exhibition matches
remaining this year.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Investigators began to piece together
evidence from last week's U.S. Embassy bombings Tuesday, with a
Kenyan guard's eyewitness account providing possibly important
clues and 14 arrests in Tanzania.
	   Twin terrorist bombings in Kenya and Tanzania claimed at least
230 lives and injured nearly 5,000, and the death toll continued to
rise.
	   More bodies were pulled from the rubble in Nairobi Tuesday,
bringing the death toll here to 220, the National Disaster
Operation Center said.
	   Israeli soldiers continued to dig for a woman named Rose. Her
voice fell silent Sunday, but they heard a tapping noise Monday
that spurred them on. Three times Tuesday, Israelis dropped a
microphone into the crevice where Rose was believed to be trapped,
but heard nothing.
	   ``We have retrieved a name of Rose amongst the dead,'' said Army
Maj. Gen. George Agoi, head of the Kenyan search and rescue
operation. ``But at the moment it's very difficult for me to
confirm whether it was the Rose we were speaking to earlier, or
whether there is another Rose.''
	   But early Tuesday evening, the Israelis informed the Red Cross
that there might be two survivors, and medical teams were standing
by, said Red Cross spokeswoman Nina Galbe.

Market turmoil: stocks slide around world on Asia jitters
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Worries about Asia's economic crisis sent stocks
tumbling on exchanges across the world on Tuesday.
	   From Tokyo to Frankfurt, from Brazil to Paris, equity markets
were slumping. Perhaps the most dramatic action took place in
Russia, where trading was suspended for a time and stocks were
nearly 10 percent below Monday's levels.
	   Concerns about impact of a sliding yen drove Hong Kong's stocks
down 3.6 percent. European stocks slid further, down another 2
percent, on Tuesday, after Wall Street opened sharply lower.
	   Russian stocks plummeted again in panic selling Tuesday, amid
fears that the Russian government is too broke to cope with another
emerging market selloff.
	   The Russian Trading System Index sank 9.1 percent in all, to
close at 109.9 points, down from 120.91 points Monday.
	   Trading was suspended for 45 minutes late in the session, when
losses exceeded those allowed under trading rules. After trading
reopened there was a slight rebound, but traders did not expect
much more of a climb.
	   Hong Kong stocks closed at a five-year low. The blue-chip Hang
Seng Index fell 3.6 percent, or 254.67 points, to 6779.95, its
lowest level since July 23, 1995.
	   The Hong Kong market's plunge was blamed on the weakening yen
and the fear that a weaker yen will force China to devalue the
yuan, which in turn will crush the Hong Kong dollar's peg to the
U.S. dollar, analysts said.
	   But these fears aren't new, said Vincent Cheung, a trader at
Sassoon Securities.
	   ``Bad news is just haunting the Hong Kong market in general,''
he said.
	   London's FTSE 100, which was given a boost in mid-afternoon
trade from the proposed merger of British Petroleum and Amoco Corp,
closed Tuesday's session at a low level not seen since late January
as a fall in U.S. stocks sent the index into free-fall.
	   The FTSE 100 closed Tuesday's session down 154.8 points, or 2.8
percent, at 5432.8 points. The index had earlier touched a low of
5403.3 points.
	   The French stock market tumbled Tuesday, as local investors got
caught in the mood of panic that swept other European exchanges.
The CAC 40 dropped 93.47 points Tuesday, or 2.4 percent, to close
at 3845.98 points. That is only 28 percent higher than at the
beginning of the year compared with 47 percent higher 3 1/2 weeks
ago when it topped out at a record 4,404.94 points.
	   In Germany, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange echoed the continued
slide in global equities markets late afternoon Tuesday, and the
Xetra DAX lost another 30 points in late trading.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Investigators began to piece together
evidence from last week's U.S. Embassy bombings Tuesday, with a
Kenyan guard's eyewitness account providing possibly important
clues and 14 arrests in Tanzania.
	   Twin terrorist bombings in Kenya and Tanzania claimed at least
230 lives and injured nearly 5,000, and the death toll continued to
rise.
	   More bodies were pulled from the rubble in Nairobi Tuesday,
bringing the death toll here to 220, the National Disaster
Operation Center said.
	   Israeli soldiers continued to dig for a woman named Rose. Her
voice fell silent Sunday, but they heard a tapping noise Monday
that spurred them on. Three times Tuesday, Israelis dropped a
microphone into the crevice where Rose was believed to be trapped,
but heard nothing.
	   ``We have retrieved a name of Rose amongst the dead,'' said Army
Maj. Gen. George Agoi, head of the Kenyan search and rescue
operation. ``But at the moment it's very difficult for me to
confirm whether it was the Rose we were speaking to earlier, or
whether there is another Rose.''
	   But early Tuesday evening, the Israelis informed the Red Cross
that there might be two survivors, and medical teams were standing
by, said Red Cross spokeswoman Nina Galbe.

Negotiators agree to set up talks on nuclear-weapons material

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Disarmament negotiators agreed Tuesday to set up
talks on a treaty banning the production of material used to make
nuclear weapons.
	   The necessary consensus became possible after Israel, the last
remaining holdout on the talks, agreed to join in, although with
reservations.
	   The chairman of the 61-nation Conference on Disarmament, Mykola
Maimeskoul of Ukraine, had delayed from Friday a meeting to discuss
the proposal that a committee be set up to discuss a treaty on
so-called ``fissile materials,'' plutonium and highly enriched
uranium.
	   Delegates applauded as the committee's establishment was
accepted without objections. Maimeskoul thanked them for their
``spirit of compromise.'' But many sounded a note of caution.
	   Delegations must elect a chairman for the committee before it
can start work, with substantive negotiations expected next year.
	   Under international pressure following their test explosions
earlier this year, neighbors Pakistan and India both said they were
ready to engage in negotiations. Last week Israel, considered an
undeclared nuclear power, was left as the only holdout.
	   In a brief statement Tuesday, Israeli Ambassador Yosef Lamdan
said that ``we of course reserve our position on the substance of
the issues involved.''
	   Talks are likely to progress slowly, with conference members
divided on whether they should aim to ban future production of
nuclear-weapons material or also address existing stockpiles.
	   Pakistani Ambassador Munir Akram noted those ``fundamental
differences'' and restated the country's position that negotiations
should deal with India's stocks. The treaty shouldn't be ``a
measure for nuclear non-proliferation alone,'' he said.
	   Others, including China and France, believe the treaty should
only address future production.
	   ``I think it's going to be a long and tedious negotiation'' of
between two and five years, the U.S. representative, Ambassador
Robert Grey, told reporters later.
	   In a statement on behalf of some 27 non-aligned countries,
Algerian Ambassador Mohamed-Salah Dembri said the agreement to
talks should be ``reciprocated by others'' with an agreement to set
up another committee to discuss nuclear disarmament.
	   But Grey stressed that ``the first thing to negotiate is the
cut-off issue.'' In his statement to the conference, he called for
a ``nondiscriminatory, multilateral and internationally and
effectively verifiable treaty.''
	   Action on fissile material is referred to by arms negotiators as
the ``cut off'' treaty because it would stop the production of
nuclear weapons.
	   The Geneva conference is the world's main multilateral
disarmament body. Past successes include treaties to ban chemical
weapons and to halt test explosions of nuclear bombs.
	   Tuesday's move breaks a long deadlock that has prevented work on
any accords ranging from nuclear issues to a global ban on land
mines.
	   ``Now that we have decided to move forward ... I hope that we
can also reach a decision to negotiate a transfer ban on
anti-personnel land mines,'' Grey said.

Media group urges Jordan to amend press law
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ A Paris-based journalists' group on Tuesday
urged the Jordanian parliament to reconsider a press law widely
criticized as limiting press freedoms.
	   The group, Reporters Sans Frontieres, said in a letter to
Jordan's 80-member parliament that the law ``will be in total
contradiction with the democratization process undertaken by
Jordan.''
	   The group urged the parliament ``to reconsider the press law and
to amend the articles which restrict press freedom.''
	   The letter said that vaguely defined provisions of the press law
could lead the government to abuse its powers against journalists.
	   Parliament on Sunday endorsed the press law, which is to replace
a 1993 law. The government says it will put an end to free-wheeling
media it accuses of violating the norms and ethics of professional
journalism.
	   The law will not go into effect until it is endorsed by King
Hussein. He has said he supports the legislation.
	   The law is believed aimed at Jordan's 22 tabloids, many of which
are affiliated with Muslim fundamentalists and other hard-line
groups opposed to Hussein's policies.
	   The parliament discussed the new law behind closed doors, and
full details have not been made public.
	   Deputies have described what they say are minor amendments,
including a dlrs 50,000 fine on journalists convicted of reporting
that harms national security or monetary stability.
	   The law also is expected to ban reports considered disparaging
to King Hussein, his family, head of states or the Jordanian army.
	   It also would strengthen the government's ability to withdraw
reporters' credentials and close down newspapers or radio stations.

Russians don't expect increase in oil prices
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The president of Russia's fourth-largest oil
company, AO Sidanko, said Tuesday that he does not expect world oil
prices to recover this year.
	   ``The attractiveness of the Pacific-Asian region to investors
dropped and led to a sharp fall in demand (for oil) there, and
until the attractiveness returns, demand won't return,'' Boris
Volkov said.
	   ``We don't expect that any changes for the better will take
place in 1998.''
	   Volkov said Russian oil companies and the government are
drafting an agreement to ``share the burden'' of the drop in world
oil prices. The agreement is due to be signed in September, Volkov
said.
	   World crude oil prices have been fluctuating between dlrs 13 to
dlrs 14 a barrel, down from dlrs 19 at the start of the year.
	   Russia has promised to cut crude oil exports by 81,000 barrels a
day, but exports actually increased by 10 percent in the first half
of 1998 to 437.4 barrels (62.5 million metric tons).

Heat wave abates in Cyprus, still hot in Switzerland, Austria

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ The worst heat wave in decades in Cyprus
abated Tuesday after killing 56 people over the past week. But
searing temperatures struck much of Europe, canceling school
classes and sending the young to the hospital with heat exhaustion.
	   Eight people died overnight Monday in Cyprus after temperatures
hit 43 degrees Celsius (110 Fahrenheit), the highest recorded in 40
years, the Health Ministry said. The heat wave began Friday.
	   Most of the dead were elderly people who suffered from
respiratory and other ailments, the ministry said. Hospitals were
stretched to the limit with the admission of some 3,200 patients
suffering from heat-related illnesses, it said.
	   But on Tuesday, temperatures dropped to 39 C (102 F), said
Andreas Philaniotis, director of the Weather Bureau.
	   They were expected to fall closer to the monthly average of 37 C
(99 F) by Thursday, he said.
	   Elsewhere in Cyprus, a fire near a British base destroyed the
commander's villa and the houses of 10 other senior officers.
	   The fire, which began Monday in the brush near Episkopi Base in
southwestern Cyprus, damaged three more houses at the base as well
as storerooms and vehicles, base spokesman Capt. Jon Brown said.
	   The fire continued Tuesday. There were no injuries, but Brown
said it would cost an estimated 2 million Cypriot pounds (dlrs 4.4
million) to repair the damage.
	   In Switzerland, accustomed to normally mild summers,
schoolchildren in Basel were released from classes Tuesday as the
country sweated through its hottest weather in three years.
Temperatures Monday climbed as high as 35 C (95 F).
	   In nearby Biel, 17 Belgian schoolchildren and two adults were
recovering in a hospital from heat exhaustion. They were part of a
group on a camping vacation in the Swiss Alps.
	   The heat wave in Switzerland is expected to last through this
week, although storms are forecast for Thursday.
	   Temperatures were also high in France and Austria, which has
experienced one of its hottest summers in years.
	   ``It's part of the experience,'' said Jack Bargaheiser, 36, an
architect from Columbus, Ohio, who was sitting in the shade on a 34
C (93 F) day in Paris. ``Just like the rude waiters and the good
food, it's part of the experience.''

Seven Italians detained for Rolex robberies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALICANTE, Spain (AP) _ Police have arrested seven Italians who
allegedly specialized in snatching Rolex watches off people's
wrists in the eastern tourist towns of Benidorm and Alicante.
	   The seven, whose names were not released, formed part of two
organized gangs who stalked people they spotted wearing the
expensive watches and then assaulted them as they entered their
houses or cars, a police spokesman said Tuesday.
	   The gangs are suspected of having robbed at least 10 watches,
valued at some 15 million pesetas (dlrs 100,000), in the past six
weeks.
	   In Spain, Rolex watches cost between 280,000 pesetas and to 2.5
million pesetas (dlrs 2,000-dlrs 16,500).

Nigerian leader defies trail of broken promises
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GILBERT DA COSTA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria's new military leader on Tuesday
vowed to break a precedent set by army forbearers who backed down
from their pledges to allow a democratic transition to civilian
rule in this sprawling West African country.
	   Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar said he would not budge from his
timetable to hand over power to an elected government by the end of
May next year.
	   ``Time is not on our side,'' Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar said. ``To
this administration, the 29th of May is a sacrosanct hand-over date
... It is a great national responsibility.''
	   Abubakar, the successor of the late dictator Gen. Sani Abacha
who died of an apparent heart attack in early June, has drawn
cautious applause from critics since announcing his democratic
transition plan last month.
	   Nigerians are accustomed to military rulers breaking their
promises to allow democratic change.
	   In the 38 years since independence from Britain, only 10 years
have been marked by civilian rule. Abacha, who was widely condemned
for human rights abuses, promised to step aside in favor of a
civilian but was instead believed to be maneuvering himself as the
sole candidate in civilian elections before he died.
	   An earlier military leader, Maj. Gen. Ibrahim Babangida who
ruled Nigeria from 1985 to '93, made several promises of democracy
without fulfilling them.
	   Abubakar, who on Tuesday attended the swearing in of a new
14-member electoral commission to oversee national election early
next year, implored on the commission to work ``extremely hard'' to
ensure a free and fair poll.
	   Democracy is the ``greatest expectation of our people today,''
Abubakar added.
	   The man who is leading the electoral body, former judge Ephraim
Akpata, said he would resign if the government meddled in the
commission's affairs.
	   ``If I disagree with the government on fundamental issues, I
will have to resign if I can't have my way when I know I'm right,''
the 71-year-old Akpata said.
	   One of the first tasks of the electoral panel is to register new
political parties in this ethnically-divided West African country
of more than 100 million people.
	   Already, at least two opposition coalition groups have said
they're ready to contest the elections.

	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ Belarus has used the death penalty 33
times so far this year, the country's deputy prosecutor general
said Tuesday.
	   Most of those put to death were convicted in 1997, Alexander
Ivanovsky told reporters.
	   Prisoners are executed in Belarus, like most former Soviet

As temperatures soar, two states ban cars without catalytic
</HEADLINE>
converters &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ As temperatures soared and ozone
levels reached dangerous levels, two German states on Tuesday
banned all vehicles without catalytic converters from the roadways.
	   The bans, proscribed by a 3-year-old federal law, are
unprecedented in the land of BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen.
	   Two hallowed factions of German society _ commuters and
vacationers _ were exempted from the ban, which takes effect
Wednesday in Baden-Wuerttemberg and Hesse states, when no other
reasonable means of transportation exist.
	   The bans, aimed at poorly equipped local traffic, cover an area
encompassing Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Heidelberg. Temperatures in
the region hit record highs of 37.5 degrees Celsius (99.5 degrees
Fahrenheit) in Mannheim and 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees
Fahrenheit) in Wiesbaden.
	   Federal rules adopted in 1995 proscribe state-wide bans on older
models without catalytic converters when ozone levels exceed 240
micrograms per cubic meter at three or more stations at least 50
kilometers (35 miles) distant from one another.
	   In Baden-Wuerttemberg state, ozone measured as high as 280
micrograms per cubic meter near Stuttgart, headquarters of
Daimler-Benz.
	   Warning levels of 180 micrograms were measured at 51 stations.

Rights watchdog criticizes Belarus for rights violations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ The International Helsinki Federation for
Human Rights sent an open letter on Tuesday to the Belarusian
Foreign Ministry to protest human rights violations in the former
Soviet republic.
	   Also Tuesday, a human rights group reported that Belarusian
customs officers had detained two Czech students for eight hours on
the border with Ukraine and confiscated materials on human rights
issues in Belarus.
	   The two Prague university students, Lubos Veseli and Michal
Cerny, were released Monday after being held for eight hours.
However, the customs officers held on to the materials the students
had received from Belarusian rights activists, said Oleg Bebenin, a
spokesman for the Minsk-based Charter-97 human rights group.
	   The director of the Vienna, Austria-based federation Aaron
Rhodes and his colleague Vladimir Weissman released the letter at
the end of a three-day fact-finding trip to the capital Minsk. They
urged the Foreign Ministry to help bring Belarus into compliance
with international human rights standards.
	   In particular, the letter criticized the refusal by judicial
authorities to investigate violence against journalists, the
persecution of university students for political activities, and
unreasonably high fines for participants in unsanctioned public
protests.
	   The letter also expressed concern over the conditions of
pre-trial detention cells and the cessation of benefits to victims
of Soviet-era political repression.
	   Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has stifled press
freedoms and cracked down on the nationalist opposition, tightly
controlling their activities.

2,030 minor incidents recorded at German nuclear plants since 1988
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS 2 grafs with Greenpeace protest &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's 19 atomic power plants logged
2,030 minor problems over the past 10 years, but none involved any
radiation leaks outside the plant, the federal environment ministry
reported Tuesday.
	   All but one of the disturbances were listed as Level 1 _ the
lowest possible on a scale of one to seven, Environment Minister
Angela Merkel said in the report presented to the Cabinet.
	   An incident June 6 at the Unterweser power plant was logged at
Level 2.
	   State officials in Lower Saxony said then a leak in a turbine's
oil system set off the problem. Pressure then built up in the
plant's steam generator because a vent had been wrongly shut and
the key misplaced.
	   Merkel said Germany's nuclear power plants are being constantly
modernized and revamped with the latest technology ``so that in
Germany there's practically no old atomic power plants.''
	   The number of incidents has declined to no more than six a year
since 1994, she added.
	   Based on that, she said there was no safety reason that
justifies demands by the opposition Social Democrats and Greens for
a total withdrawal from nuclear energy.
	   Spokesmen for both parties criticized the report, and Greenpeace
staged an anti-nuclear protests by erecting a bright-red, 8-meter
(26 foot) tall ``off-switch'' on the cooling tower of the Stade
plant near Hamburg.
	   Fifteen activists climbed the tower to erect the switch, made of
inflated plastic. Officials later brought them down without
incident.

Roma coach questioned by Olympic Committee officials
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photos &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italian Olympic Committee officials on Tuesday began
questioning the coach of AS Roma about his allegations that a
number of top league Italian soccer players may use
performance-enhancing drugs.
	   The officials summoned Zemen following his remarks last week to
the newsweekly Espresso in which he said he was amazed by the quick
muscular development of players including Alessandro Del Piero and
Gianluca Vialli.
	   Zeman, a Czech, did not refer specifically to doping substances,
but said the players used ``medicines.'' The Olympic Committee
officials want Zemen to back up his claims.
	   Juventus of Turin and Del Piero, the club's star player, both
said they would sue Zemen for libel.
	   Vialli, a former player of Juventus and currently Chelsea's
player-coach in the English Premier League, called Zeman a
``terrorist trying to destabilize the soccer world.''
	   Turin prosecutor Raffaele Guariniello, who has been
investigating doping in sports and other health-related issues for
several years, also wants to question Zemen. The meeting is
expected to take place Wednesday morning in Turin.
	   Italian news reports said the prosecutor has also summoned Del
Piero and Vialli.
	   Italy's first division soccer league, known as the serie A,
kicks off in mid-September.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ After a recent string of losses
against Serb government forces, secessionist Kosovo Albanian rebels
and Serb forces Tuesday were locked in fighting in Kosovo's Decani
border region.
	   Albanian sources, who first reported the clashes, claimed that a
huge column of 110 Yugoslav Army vehicles, including 36 tanks, was
seen heading for the embattled region.
	   Later Yugoslavia's official Tanjug news agency confirmed the
fighting close to the border with Albania, saying six Serb
policemen were wounded in action. Neither side gave a casualty
figure on the Albanian side.
	   But the Albanian state-run ATA news agency in Tirana said that
five men arrived dead at the Djakovica hospital Monday night. It
did not provide other details.
	   Tanjug said fighting was concentrated along the Decani-Djakovica
road, in western Kosovo, in the villages of Prilep and Glodjane,
known to be strongholds of the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation
Army. It said the police were gaining ground against the KLA.
	   Tanjug claimed large groups of KLA fighters were attacking
police patrols along the strategic road with the aim to keep Serb
forces away from the village of Junik, the biggest KLA stronghold
in western Kosovo, which has been encircled by police for three
weeks.
	   Tanjug said several hundred KLA men were firing at police from
Junik Tuesday, but the police did not fire back on the village.
	   Elsewhere, the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Information Center
reported two Albanians, aged 2 and 15, were killed in Serb shelling
of the village Petrovo, some 30 kilometers (18 miles) south of
Pristina Monday evening.
	   Earlier Tuesday, the Albanian government said that 70 people had
fled across the border from Kosovo within the last 24 hours,
including two badly wounded guerrillas.
	   Independent media in Belgrade also reported the Kosovo
Liberation Army had reentered the central village of Likovac, the
rebel headquarters which Serb forces overran last week. The reports
could not be confirmed.
	   In a statement distributed to ethnic Albanian media, the KLA
said the latest Serb offensive ``has only strengthened our resolve
to bravely continue on the road to freedom.''
	   The statement called on Kosovo Albanians, who represent 90
percent of the Serbian province's 2 million people, to ``unite with
the KLA and help us in our just freedom fight.''
	   Despite the war rhetoric, one of the top KLA officials told
local Albanian Koha Ditore daily that the militants might join an
all-Albanian negotiating team in peace negotiations with the
Serbian government.
	   In Geneva, U.N. human rights spokesman Jose Diaz said members of
the U.N. Human Rights Committee on the Elimination of Racial
Discrimination will send a letter next week to the Yugoslav
government in Belgrade to express concern about the displacement of
people in Kosovo.
	   The latest figure from the U.N. refugee agency put the total
figure of Kosovo refugees at around 240,000.
	   Diplomatic efforts to return ethnic Albanian and Serb leaders to
the negotiating table are inching forward. U.S. envoy Christopher
Hill met with Serb and ethnic Albanian leaders in Pristina Monday.
	   For five months, Serb troops have been fighting the KLA, which
seeks independence from Serbia, the dominant republic of
Yugoslavia.
	   But the Albanians remain largely divided between those loyal to
pacifist ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova, and those who
support the militants.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ England's Rugby Football Union has shelved plans
to start a cross-border club competition embracing teams from
England, Wales and Scotland this season.
	   RFU management board chairman Brian Baister announced the
decision Tuesday, saying time constraints and logistics ruled out a
proposed British League for the 1998-99 season.
	   The proposed competition was expected to embrace all 14 English
first division teams, Welsh clubs including Cardiff and Swansea,
plus Scottish super districts Edinburgh and Glasgow.
	   Baister said the RFU was disappointed the new cross-border
competition had to be shelved.
	   Last week the RFU and England's first division clubs agreed to
work in partnership to set up the competition by October.
	   The competition, designed to replace the existing European
tournament, received mixed reaction from the rugby governing bodies
in Scotland, Ireland and Wales.
	   The concept was the latest development in a battle between the
first division clubs and the RFU which has been ongoing since the
top 14 English clubs withdrew from the Europan tournament in
January.
	   Leading English club Bath won the European title in before the
English clubs shunned the tournament.
	   The top nine clubs in France also decided to pull out of the
tournament in favor of forming a new championship with the English
clubs but then rejoined at the insistence of the FRU.
	   Top English clubs must now produce a premiership roster for the
new season scheduled to start Sept. 5.
	   Also in doubt is a series of friendly matches between English
clubs and Welsh sides Cardiff and Swansea.
	   The RFU is refusing to sanction the matches on dates set aside
for premiership matches.
	   Cardiff now has until 5 p.m. Wednesday to settle its differences
with the Welsh Rugby Union or face expulsion from the Welsh
domestic competition.

Arab League condemns bombings of American embassies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The Arab League on Tuesday condemned the
bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania and called for an
international conference to fight terrorism.
	   ``The Arab League condemns the terrorist acts in Nairobi and Dar
es Salaam and expresses its condolences to the victims' families in
Kenya, Tanzania and the United States,'' the 22-member organization
said in a statement.
	   The statement noted that Arab countries signed an anti-terrorism
pact in Egypt last April calling for regional and international
cooperation to combat terrorism.
	   ``The Arab League supports the convening of an international
conference to fight this dangerous phenomenon,'' it said.

Military accused of wrongdoing _ again _ in Bosnia in 1995
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Defense Ministry launching investigation. &QL; 
 &UR; By JENIFER CHAO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ First it was blamed for doing
little, if anything, to stop some of the Bosnian war's worst
bloodshed.
	   Now the Dutch military is reeling under new accusations that it
intentionally destroyed film that allegedly showed some of its U.N.
peacekeepers helping the Bosnian Serbs separate Muslim men from
women for deportation.
	   The fresh allegations rekindled debate Tuesday over the role of
Dutch soldiers during the fall of the northeastern Bosnia enclave
of Srebrenica in 1995.
	   In response, Dutch Defense Minister Frank de Grave promptly
launched a wide-ranging investigation.
	   ``The minister has no reason to doubt the integrity of defense
personnel. However, the upcoming investigation is necessary to
provide clarity and can clear the Defense Ministry from all
blames,'' according to a statement from the ministry.
	   At the center of the controversy are several rolls of film taken
during the siege of Srebrenica, a U.N.-declared ``safe haven'' that
became a killing field where thousands of Muslims were slain and
buried in mass graves.
	   A Dutch peacekeeper who took the pictures told the respected
Dutch television program Nova last weekend that he had captured
images showing Bosnian Serbs committing atrocities, as well as
Dutch soldiers helping with the selection of Muslim men for
deportation.
	   It was not clear exactly how many peacekeepers were involved.
	   The film was turned over to the Defense Ministry but was
accidentally destroyed during processing in 1995, officials have
said previously. They have also repeatedly denied that any attempts
were made to cover up possible Dutch wrongdoings in Srebrenica.
	   In a statement to Nova, the photographer _ who was not
identified _ said he didn't believe the loss of the film was an
accident. He also said his testimony on Dutch cooperation with the
Serbs was ignored by the ministry and left out of an official
report.
	   Dutch military police investigators asked the Defense Ministry
in 1995 to investigate possible instances of Dutch cooperation and
misconduct, but the ministry ignored the request, an official told
Nova on Monday.
	   The latest accusations have renewed Dutch doubts about what
their troops did and didn't do at Srebrenica.
	   The 300 Dutch troops stationed at the enclave did not stop the
Serbs from overrunning the town, and they were widely blamed for
permitting the slaughter of Muslim refugees. Their commanders said
later that their U.N. mandate was too weak.
	   Four Dutch medics claimed they were ordered not to treat Muslim
civilians wounded during Srebrenica's fall. The Defense Ministry
denied it, but suffered another credibility blow when the top
commander, Lt. Col. Ton Karremans, was photographed glass in hand
with Serb Gen. Ratko Mladic after the town's capture.
	   Immediately after the fall of Srebrenica, the Defense Ministry
conducted an internal investigation which officially absolved the
Dutch unit in question of any wrongdoing.
	   Another investigation by the prominent Netherlands State
Institute for War Documentation is still in progress.

Heat wave abates in Cyprus, still hot in Switzerland, Austria

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ The worst heat wave in decades in Cyprus
abated Tuesday after killing 56 people over the past week. But
Europe was still sweating under temperatures so high they caused
the closure of schools and sent thousands to hospital.
	   Eight people died overnight Monday in Cyprus after temperatures
hit 43C (110F), the highest in 40 years, the Health Ministry said.
The heat wave began Friday.
	   Most of the dead were elderly people who suffered from
respiratory and other ailments, the ministry said. Hospitals were
stretched to the limit with the admission of some 3,200 patients
suffering from heat-related illnesses, it said.
	   But on Tuesday, temperatures dropped to 39 C (102 F), said
Andreas Philaniotis, director of the Weather Bureau.
	   They were expected to fall closer to the monthly average of 37 C
(99 F) by Thursday, he said.
	   In Switzerland, accustomed to normally mild summers,
schoolchildren in Basel were released from classes Tuesday as the
country sweated through its hottest weather in three years.
Temperatures Monday climbed as high as 35 C (95 F).
	   In nearby Biel, 17 Belgian schoolchildren and two adults were
recovering in a hospital from heat exhaustion. They were part of a
group on a camping vacation in the Swiss Alps.
	   The heat wave in Switzerland is expected to last through this
week, although storms are forecast for Thursday.
	   Temperatures were also high in Austria, which has experienced
one of its hottest summers in years.
	   For an American in Paris, the heat was no big deal.
	   ``It's part of the experience,'' said Jack Bargaheiser, 36, an
architect from Columbus, Ohio, who was sitting in the shade on a 34
C (93 F) day in Paris. ``Just like the rude waiters and the good
food, it's part of the experience.''

	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ The worst heat wave in decades in Cyprus
abated Tuesday after killing 56 people over the past week. But
searing temperatures struck much of Europe, canceling school
classes and sending the young to the hospital with heat exhaustion.
	   Eight people died overnight Monday in Cyprus after temperatures
hit 43 degrees Celsius (110 Fahrenheit), the highest recorded in 40
years, the Health Ministry said. The heat wave began Friday.
	   Most of the dead were elderly people who suffered from

Andreas Philaniotis, director of the Weather Bureau.
	   They were expected to fall closer to the monthly average of 37 C
(99 F) by Thursday, he said.
	   Elsewhere in Cyprus, a fire near a British base destroyed the
commander's villa and the houses of 10 other senior officers.
	   The fire, which began Monday in the brush near Episkopi Base in
southwestern Cyprus, damaged three more houses at the base as well
as storerooms and vehicles, base spokesman Capt. Jon Brown said.
	   The fire continued Tuesday. There were no injuries, but Brown
said it would cost an estimated 2 million Cypriot pounds (dlrs 4.4
million) to repair the damage.
	   Lebanon on Tuesday reported its first death from the heat wave.
The state-run National News Agency said Abdullah Khaled al-Halabi,
40, had died after being hospitalized three days earlier for heat
stroke.

Iran to create new economic policy group headed by Khatami
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran will create a new policy group, to be
headed by President Mohammad Khatami, to reform the nation's
economy, state-run Iranian television reported Tuesday.
	   The National Economic Restructuring Program will assist the
government in drawing up Iran's third, five-year development plan,
the broadcast quoted Economy Minister Hossein Namazi as saying.
	   The program will focus on reforming the tax system, the
employment law and the law on foreign investment, it said.
	   ``Among the program's important points is the establishment of
economic security and stability,'' Namazi was quoted as saying.
	   He added that the government is determined to keep the official
exchange rate of 3,000 rials per dollar steady until the end of the
second, five-year plan, in the year 2000, he said.
	   He disclosed that the Central Bank was drawing up regulations
for the implementation of interest-free banking within a month, but
did not provide further details.
	   Last week, Khatami outlined his economic aims. He called for
reducing government monopolies on goods and services, eliminating
the red tape holding back foreign investment and cutting the
country's reliance on oil revenues.
	   He described the economy as ``sick'' and said high unemployment
and inflation had cut into the public's purchasing power.
	   Iran and other Gulf oil producers have been grappling with
rising budget deficits because of low world prices for oil, a main
source of government revenues.

Russia prepared to fortify CIS borders with Afghanistan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Tajik appeal for aid in new final graf. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia is ready to fortify the southern borders of
former Soviet republics in Central Asia to guard against any
spillover of the turmoil in Afghanistan, the Foreign Ministry said
Tuesday.
	   The northward advance of the fundamentalist Taliban movement
poses ``a real threat'' to the coalition of former Soviet
republics, the Commonwealth of Independent States, Foreign Ministry
spokesman Valery Nesterushkin said.
	   Afghanistan borders three former Soviet republics: Tajikistan,
Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.
	   Russia fears the entrenchment of a radical Islamic state in
Afghanistan would bring an influx of refugees and weapons into the
former Soviet republics of Central Asia.
	   The worries flared following the Taliban's weekend capture of
the biggest city in northern Afghanistan, Mazar-e-Sharif, which is
just 60 kilometers (37 miles) from the Tajik border.
	   The 25,000 Russian troops stationed in Tajikistan are already
helping government forces fortify the border, and similar steps are
expected in the two other republics.
	   Russia, ``along with other CIS members, reserves the right to
take all the required measures, including those in line with
international commitments,'' Nesterushkin was quoted as saying by
the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   A Russian border troops commander, Nikolai Reznichenko, said
that Russia is ready to send more troops to Tajikistan if the
situation gets worse, the Izvestia newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   Tajik officials have said that in some areas the Taliban have
advanced to within 20 to 40 kilometers (12 to 25 miles) of the
Tajik border.
	   The Tajik Military Council, chaired by President Emomali
Rakhmonov, appealed to Russian President Boris Yeltsin and other
leaders of former Soviet republics to help strengthen the CIS'
southern borders, and called on the United Nations to act urgently
to end the fighting in Afghanistan, Russian news agencies reported.
	   The appeal said that there was a large number of Afghan refugees
concentrated along the Tajik border, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   Meanwhile, Afghanistan's ambassador to Moscow called on Afghans
to fight ``foreign invaders,'' Interfax said.
	   Ambassador Abdul Waha Assefi, who represents the anti-Taliban
Northern Alliance, said that Afghanistan was ``virtually occupied
by Pakistan.'' He called for international pressure on Pakistan to
stop helping the Taliban.
	   Pakistan is widely believed to be the force behind the
fundamentalist movement.

Corinthians' Luxemburgo appointed new Brazilian manager
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with quotes. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Two-time national championship
coach Wanderley Luxemburgo was appointed the new manager of
four-time World Cup titlist Brazil on Tuesday, taking over for
Mario Zagallo who was much-maligned in the wake of the France 98
final.
	   Luxemburgo won the Brazilian national title in 1993 and 1994
with Palmeiras, the highlight of a 16-year coaching career that
followed a lackluster 11-year playing career. The 46-year-old
sideline boss of Corinthians will remain with his club, atop the
standings by two points, through the end of the Brazilian national
championship in December.
	   ``I am very satisfied,'' Wanderley told reporters who mobbed him
at the Brazilian confederation's headquarters in downtown Rio. ``To
be part of the national team is the objective of any soccer
professional, be he a coach or a player.''
	   After unremarkable stints as a player for Flamengo, Botafogo and
Internacional from 1971-1982, Luxemburgo started his coaching
career at Rio's Vasco da Gama as an assistant.
	   He rose to his first head coaching job in 1983 with Rio's Campo
Grande and went on to manage different 14 teams, including Saudi
Arabia's Ittihad and Shabab.
	   He first gained national attention in 1990 as coach of
Bragantino, taking the small club to the Paulista, or Sao Paulo
state title.
	   He moved on to Palmeiras, where he won the Paulista again in
1993 and 1994, in addition to the national titles.
	   After coaching Flamengo in 1995, he returned to Palmeiras to
once more reclaim the Paulista in 1996.
	   He coached Santos in 1997 before moving to Corinthians this
season.
	   Luxemburgo takes over a team that advanced unconvingly to the
World Cup final in Paris, where a game-day illness to Ronaldo shook
the squad and resulted in a 3-0 loss to France.
	   Zagallo, criticized during the tournament for what some called
the team's uninspired play, was severely condemned for using
Ronaldo in the final and the resulting loss.
	   The first players for the new national team should be named some
time in September for the three or four exhibition matches
remaining this year.
	   Luxemburgo said it would be premature to talk about his plans
for the team until ``the technical commission is chosen and
priorities are established.''
	   He did say he may have two or three assistant coaches.

U.N. to investigate reports of fresh fighting in Angola
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CASIMIRO SIONA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The United Nations mission in Angola said
Tuesday it was aware of fresh reports of heavy fighting between
government troops and the former rebel group UNITA but was so far
unable to confirm them.
	   ``We are trying to find out what has been going on but for the
moment we don't know whether it was massacres or fighting or what
has happened,'' U.N. spokesman Ahmadou Toure said.
	   News of weekend fighting in northeastern Malanje has been mixed
with other state radio reports blaming UNITA for the massacre of
150 people in the remote and unstable diamond-rich province.
	   A previous massacre blamed on UNITA had heightened fears that
the southwest African nation was sliding back into civil war.
	   The latest reports just days after a special U.N. envoy left
Angola optimistic that the threat of a return to full-scale
violence had receded.
	   Speaking Tuesday, Toure said it was difficult to verify what was
happening.
	   ``We do not have personnel there for security reasons and only
go there (Malanje) accompanied by representatives from UNITA and
the government,' he said.
	   The spokesman said the U.N. had asked both sides to authorize a
trip to the area to investigate the reports as soon as possible.
	   A government official from Malanje said Tuesday that 100 heavily
armed UNITA fighters killed 150 people when they attacked the
municipality of Kunda-Dya-Base, some 250 miles (400 kilometers)
east of Luanda.
	   Joaquim Antonio Marta said UNITA was on a full scale offensive
in the province.
	   UNITA spokesman Horacio Junjuvili denied the accusations which
he said stemmed from an anti-UNITA propaganda campaign orchestrated
through government-controlled media.
	   Junjuvili said he did not know what, if anything, had happened
in Malanje.
	   Reports of a military build up on both sides and the previous
massacre in the neighboring province of Lunda Norte prompted an
emergency visit by top U.N. official Lakhdar Brahimi with a mission
to rescue Angola's fragile peace.
	   About 500,000 people died in a civil war between UNITA and
government troops that broke out immediately after independence
from Portugal in 1975. It raged for nearly two decades before a
U.N.-brokered accord established a fragile peace in 1994.
	   Brahimi left Angola last Saturday announcing that the dialogue
between UNITA and the government had been reestablished.
	   Toure said he was still optimistic.
	   ``You feel sad as a human being when massacres happen, but for
the time being the dialogue is on,'' he said.

German students re-create synagogues on the internet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOGNE, Germany (AP) _ Fifteen German synagogues destroyed by
the Nazis will be reconstructed by a group of architecture students
_ not in the original stone and wood, but as three-dimensional
computer models.
	   Students at Darmstadt Technical University on Tuesday announced
the project to recreate the synagogues from blueprints and photos
where existing, as well as the descriptions of worshipers who
remember the structures.
	   The finished computer reconstructions will be posted on the
internet.
	   ``The students who are reconstructing what their fathers have
burned are displaying the better possibilities of German history,''
said Salomon Korn, a representative of the Central Council of
German Jews, which is supplementing the federal government's
100,000 mark (dlrs 56,000) grant for the project.
	   The students proposed the project as a gesture against rising
anti-foreigner violence in Germany, said their professor, Manfred
Korb.
	   The response to a pilot project, the reconstruction of three
Frankfurt synagogues, eased the students' concerns that the project
would not be well-received by Jewish organizations, Korb said.
	   Among the queries from as far away as the United States, Latin
America, and Israel was one from an American who said he was moved
to see a model of the synagogue where his father had worshipped.
	   Synagogues that once stood in Berlin, Hamburg, Dresden, Leipzig,
Munich and Stuttgart are among the 15 that will be digitally
reconstructed _ a small portion of the more than 1,000 synagogues
that were destroyed in Germany in 1938 alone.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with third state joining ban &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ As temperatures soared and ozone
levels reached dangerous levels, three German states on Tuesday
banned all vehicles without catalytic converters from the roadways.
	   The bans, proscribed by a 3-year-old federal law, are
unprecedented in the land of BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen.
	   Two hallowed factions of German society _ commuters and
vacationers _ were exempted from the ban, which takes effect
Wednesday in Baden-Wuerttemberg, Rhineland-Palatinate and Hesse
states, when no other reasonable means of transportation exist.
	   The bans, aimed at poorly equipped local traffic, cover an area
encompassing Mainz, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Heidelberg.
Temperatures in the region hit record highs of 41 degrees Celsius
(106 degrees F) in the Moselle valley, 37.5 degrees Celsius (99.5
degrees F) in Mannheim and 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees F) in
Wiesbaden.
	   Federal rules adopted in 1995 proscribe state-wide bans on older
models without catalytic converters when ozone levels exceed 240
micrograms per cubic meter at three or more stations at least 50
kilometers (35 miles) distant from one another.
	   In Baden-Wuerttemberg state, ozone measured as high as 280
micrograms per cubic meter near Stuttgart, headquarters of
Daimler-Benz.
	   Warning levels of 180 micrograms were measured at 51 stations.

Kofi Annan concludes 5-day visit to Portugal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan left
Portugal on Tuesday after a five-day visit during which he held
talks on conflicts in the country's former colonies.
	   Prior to taking a plane to London en route to a vacation in his
native Ghana, the U.N. leader wrapped up the visit by being
interviewed by former Portuguese President Mario Soares for a
documentary series on world figures.
	   The series _ titled ``Conversations with Mario Soares'' _ is to
be broadcast later this year on state television RTP. Other figures
interviewed include Morocco's King Hassan II, Brazilian President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso and his Mexican counterpart Ernesto
Zedillo.
	   Annan arrived in Portugal last Friday to attend a U.N-sponsored
international conference on youth policy.
	   During his stay he also held meetings with officials close to
peacemaking efforts in the former Portuguese colonies of Angola,
Guinea-Bissau and East Timor.
	   With Soares, he discussed the recent U.N. mission to investigate
political violence in Algeria that was headed by the Portuguese
statesman. The mission's report has not yet been released.
	   As well as his scheduled agenda, the U.N. chief also met with
his special envoy to Iraq, Prakash Shah, on Monday and gave him a
letter to deliver to the Iraqi government in which he called for
``common sense,'' in the latest crisis over Iraq's refusal to fully
cooperate with weapons inspectors.

	   HARROGATE, England (AP) _ Australia scored 306 for three before
declaring its first innings closed and sending England in to bat on
the first day of the second womens Ashes cricket test on Tuesday.
	   Australia won the toss and elected to bat first at Harrogate.
	   Australian openers Lisa Keightley (43) and Belinda Clark (76)
put on 125 for the first wicket before they both fell to
leg-spinner Charlotte Edwards within the space of five runs.
	   Joanne Broadbent, who scored 200 in the drawn first test at
Guildford, continued to bat with Karen Rolton to take Australia to
272 before Rolton was dismissed for 82.
	   Broadbent remained 63 not out when Australia declared after 92
overs.
	   Edwards took 2-28 off 11 overs.
	   In reply, England was 14 without loss at stumps.

Gingrich lays a brick for peace, prosperity in Belfast
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Donning blue jeans and work
gloves, U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich helped lay the foundation
for a Protestant family's new home Tuesday on his first visit to
Northern Ireland, one of President Clinton's foreign policy
successes.
	   The Republican from Georgia, his wife Marianne and six
congressional colleagues _ four Democrats, two Republicans _ hefted
grey cinderblocks into place in support of a Georgia-based charity,
Habitat for Humanity, which is helping people build their own homes
in a working-class Protestant district of west Belfast.
	   Earlier, they met politicians from several parties that struck
April's agreement on how Northern Ireland should be governed.
	   Two senior figures from the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party, chairman
Mitchel McLaughlin and vice president Pat Doherty, were first on
the list, then a mixed delegation from four parties _ including
representatives of the province's two major pro-British
paramilitary groups.
	   Gingrich had all politicians come to the elegant rural Culloden
Hotel rather than visit their individual party headquarters, and
didn't make any joint appearances with them.
	   ``The major groups need to keep the agreement. That's the most
important step,'' Gingrich said at the building site, where he
posed with a local Protestant child.
	   ``There will be a lot of maneuvering and posturing and arguing
on the way through. That's the nature of politics. But the
agreement is very clear, it is very inclusive, and over time I
think every group has to show good faith and help implement that
agreement.''
	   Referring to Clinton's expected visit to Northern Ireland in
early September, he said: ``I think you'll hear the president say
exactly the same thing when he comes.''
	   Gingrich shrugged off heckling from about a dozen protesters
calling themselves Queer Action Belfast, who chanted: ``Newt, Newt,
you're anti-gay _ Belfast says go away!''
	   Habitat for Humanity has helped build homes for needy families
in more than 50 countries worldwide. Gingrich lauded its work as
``teaching people to work with each other.''
	   While the project gives local Protestants and Catholics the
chance to labor together, the segregated realities of Belfast mean
that only Protestants will feel safe enough to move into the four
duplexes.
	   ``Northern Ireland doesn't really suffer from a low-income,
substandard housing problem like in other parts of the world. Here
the project's more about building a community _ and it feels good
to see the results of your work,'' said Melody McCormick, a Los
Angeles city planner who was one of 15 American volunteers on site.
	   On Wednesday, Gingrich will meet leading members of the two
biggest Protestant parties _ the Ulster Unionists, who support the
agreement, and the Rev. Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionists, who
oppose it. He travels then to Ireland's Donegal northwest to see
moderate Catholic leader John Hume and to explore his own Irish
ancestry.

Minister says tax law change could hurt Russian investments
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Moscow's request to change its reciprocal
tax agreement with Cyprus could affect billions of dollars of
investments in Russia, the Cypriot finance minister warned Tuesday.
	   ``Twenty to 25 billion dollars are moved through Cyprus and
invested in Russia every year,'' Finance Minister Christodoulos
Christodoulou said.
	   He added that ``Russian businessmen based in Cyprus also promote
sales of Russian products worth dlrs 500-600 million annually
through the island.''
	   Christodoulou said that Cyprus was the center of this activity
because of its reciprocal tax agreement with Russia, which give
tax-free status to investments routed through Cyprus.
	   He spoke reporters after conferring with the acting Russian
ambassador, Sergei Rogoff, on Moscow's demand request to amend the
agreement.
	   Russia, which is trying to work its way out of a financial
crisis, wants to be able to tax earnings on the investments. It is
under pressure from the International Monetary Fund to increase tax
revenues.
	   ``We are not against an amendment,'' Christodoulou said. ``But
we are anxious to ensure that this does not result in Cyprus
finding itself at a disadvantage compared with competing nations.''
	   He called for ``equal treatment'' on the rate of taxation and
timing of the levy.
	   ``There are other big states which are in competition with
Cyprus and which wish and strive to replace the role played by
Cyprus in this important sector of investments in Russia,'' he
added.
	   He did not name the other nations.
	   The reciprocal tax agreement has attracted more than 2,000
Russian companies to set up offices on the island as offshore
businesses, which enjoy additional Cypriot tax advantages.
	   Christodoulou said that while the local economy would suffer if
the tax law was changed, ``in our view the Russian economy would
suffer more because this huge volume of investment carried out
through Cyprus is made at a critical time for the improvement of
the Russian economy.''

Unbowed secessionists say Caribbean island cause is on the map
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By JAMES ANDERSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHARLESTOWN, St. Kitts and Nevis (AP) _ Nevis failed to become
one of the world's smallest countries Tuesday, but it did force the
world to take its self-determination drive seriously, the Caribbean
island's premier said.
	   Nevis, a mountainous patch of green with 9,000 people, needed a
67 percent vote in a Monday referendum to secede from neighboring
St. Kitts, population 32,000. It got 62 percent, with 2,427 people
voting for secession and 1,498 against.
	   The outcome was a blow to Nevis Premier Vance Amory, who led an
independence campaign based on islanders' resentment of their
treatment by the St. Kitts-based federal government.
	   Secession failed in part ``because change sometimes is so
difficult to accept,'' Amory said in an interview.
	   But, he added, ``What is important is that 62 percent indicated
support.''
	   That wasn't lost on Denzil Douglas, prime minister of the
embattled twin-island federation. Douglas immediately offered to
seek constitutional reforms that would grant Nevis more control
over its own affairs.
	   ``We have had our difficulties. We have had our differences,''
Douglas said. ``I want the people of Nevis to give us the
opportunity, to give us the chance, to work with them.''
	   Two leading issues _ a constitution many see as flawed, and
money _ provoked Monday's close vote.
	   When the islands became independent from Britain in 1983, Nevis
insisted on a secession clause. The federation will be unstable as
long as that clause exists, Douglas' Labor Party says.
	   The document also gave Nevis a local assembly with limited
autonomy, while concentrating power on the larger St. Kitts, where
the central government oversees both federal and local affairs on
the larger island.
	   Douglas' party has proposed creating two island administrations
to oversee local affairs within a greater confederation. An
independent commission, meanwhile, is completing a report on
improving the constitution.
	   But Nevis also is short-changed in federal spending, Amory said.
The island contributes nearly 40 percent of federal tax revenues
but gets 21 percent, its people pay higher prices for goods
imported through St. Kitts, and at least Eastern Caribbean dlrs 12
million each year in federal taxes paid by Nevis-based companies is
lost, he said.
	   ``That is a sore point,'' Amory said. ``We can't not talk very
quickly on those matters.''
	   Change won't come easily. A new constitution would need a
two-thirds vote in the national assembly and an equal percentage
from voters on both islands. And as long as the 1983 document
remains, secession is possible.
	   ``I would think that somewhere down the road it could be
reactivated,'' Amory said.
	   Monday's vote triggered concern from Caribbean officials, the
British Commonwealth and the United States that a Nevisian
micro-state could be victimized by global trade currents or
powerful drug cartels.
	   Nevisians went about their business Tuesday, some disappointed,
others expressing relief.
	   ``Clearly there is a strong sentiment for secession. But I still
do feel that Nevisians don't understand the full implications of
secession in 1998,'' said Nevis opposition leader Joseph Parry.

Russians: Clinton to visit Moscow Sept. 1-3
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton will visit Russia from
Sept. 1-3 for a summit with Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president's
press service said Tuesday.
	   The announcement, carried by Russian news agencies, gave no
other details.
	   U.S. Vice President Al Gore was in Moscow last month to work on
the agenda for the summit with Russian Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko.
	   The U.S. administration originally wanted the summit held after
the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament, ratified
the START II nuclear arms reduction treaty.
	   The treaty, which has already been approved by the U.S. Senate,
has faced strong opposition and repeated delays in the Duma, which
now is expected to vote on the issue sometime this fall.
	   Many lawmakers in the Communist-dominated Duma oppose the
treaty, arguing it would put Russia at a strategic disadvantage and
would be costly to implement fully. The hard-liners also argue that
Russia cannot reduce its nuclear arsenal when NATO is expanding
eastward.
	   START II would cut Russian and American nuclear arsenals roughly
in half.
	   The White House has said that Clinton will visit Ireland and
Northern Ireland after his trip to Russia.

German, American teen-agers take water prize honors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Swedeen (AP) _ German and American high school
students took top honors Tuesday in the annual International
Stockholm Junior water Prize competition.
	   Robert Franke of Berlin won the dlrs 5,000 prize for designing a
solar-driven reactor for decontaminating industrial wastewater. The
reactor uses semiconductors to degrade ``persistent chemicals'' _
those that cannot be broken down by microbial or chemical
processes.
	   Brent De Poister of Reading, Pennsylvania, received the
honorable mention for a study of the effect of pollutants on the
development of frog embryos, focusing on the effects of zinc and
the pesticide diazinon.
	   The prize is given in conjunction with the Stockholm Water
Symposium, an annual gathering of world water experts.

Security Council to consider resolution on terrorist attacks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Condemning the recent bombings of two U.S.
embassies in East Africa as ``despicable and barbarous terrorist
attacks,'' the Security Council said it plans to consider a
resolution on the issue.
	   The nearly simultaneous bombings in Kenya and Tanzania claimed
at least 230 lives _ including 12 Americans _ and injured nearly
5,000.
	   Some U.N. staff members were among the wounded, said Danilo
Turk, president of the Security Council.
	   ``Those were despicable and barbarous terrorist attacks, which
have resulted in numerous casualties among innocent civilians,''
said Turk, the Slovene delegate to the council.
	   ``Such outrageous and cowardly acts of terrorism are intolerable
and call for strongest condemnation,'' he said.
	   A senior European diplomat said the resolution, sponsored by
Kenya, will be considered this week.

Roma coach questioned by Olympic Committee officials
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with Zemen meeting over; Juventus doctor denying
charges of doping &QL; 
 &UR; With AP Photos &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italian Olympic Committee officials on Tuesday
questioned the coach of AS Roma about his allegations that a number
of top league Italian soccer players may use performance-enhancing
drugs.
	   The officials summoned Zemen following his remarks last week to
the newsweekly Espresso in which he said he was amazed by the quick
muscular development of players including Alessandro Del Piero and
Gianluca Vialli.
	   Zeman, a Czech, did not refer specifically to doping substances,
but said the players used ``medicines.'' The Olympic Committee's
doping experts, who met with Zemen for two hours, want him to back
up his claims.
	   The head of Juventus' medical team, Riccardo Agricola, denied
administering steriods or other banned substances to his players
and said he doubted other teams used them.
	   ``To use steriods would be counter productive in soccer,'' said
Agricola. ``They could cause muscle problems and threaten the
athletes' health.''
	   The Turin club and Del Piero, its star player, have said they
would sue Zemen for libel.

Taliban says missing Iranians of Mazar-e-Sharif not diplomats
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INSERTS new grafs 5-7 with Iranian comment. &QL; 
 &UR; By ZAHEERUDDIN ABDULLAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Afghanistan's ruling Taliban captured
the strategic town of Taloqan on Tuesday as it continued to pummel
the northern-based minority opposition.
	   Also Tuesday, the Taliban said 11 missing Iranian diplomats face
arrest because the administration has not been informed of their
presence in Mazar-e-Sharif, northern Afghanistan's biggest city
recaptured last week by the Taliban.
	   A Taliban Foreign Ministry said the Iranians, who could not be
recognized as diplomats, would be tried and punished as agents of a
hostile government. The Taliban claims to be holding 30 Iranians
suspected of arming their enemies in Mazar-e-Sharif, but say they
don't know the whereabouts of the 11 diplomats stationed at Iran's
consulate there.
	   Iran, widely believed to be arming the anti-Taliban alliance,
accuses the Taliban of detaining its envoys. It has called on
neighboring Pakistan, a Taliban supporter, to ensure their safety.
	   Iran also disputed the Taliban's statement that the 11 were not
diplomats.
	   In Tehran, Iran's deputy foreign minister, Alaeddin Boroujerdi,
told state-run radio that ``all 11 people arrested in
Mazar-e-Sharif were members of Iran's political representative
office, and they are considered diplomats according to
international law.''
	   ``We hold the Taliban responsible for their lives,'' Boroujerdi
said.

Lebanon to reopen embassy in Iraq for consular activities
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ In a step toward restoring diplomatic
ties with Iraq, Lebanon has decided to reopen its embassy in
Baghdad for consular and trade activities, an Iraqi official said
Tuesday.
	   The announcement by Nouri Ismail al-Wayis, the Iraqi ambassador
to Jordan, came after he met with Lebanon's foreign minister, Faris
Bweiz.
	   Al-Wayis said Bweiz ``informed me of Lebanon's decision to
appoint an administrative employee at the closed Lebanese embassy
in Baghdad.'' He said the employee ``will run consular and trade
affairs in Baghdad.''
	   Lebanon's National News Agency also quoted al-Wayis as saying
Bweiz urged Iraq to appoint a similar employee to reopen the Iraqi
embassy in Beirut.
	   Diplomatic ties between the two countries were severed in 1994
over the murder of an Iraqi dissident in Beirut.
	   Still, relations have warmed in recent months with officials and
trade delegations exchanging visits.
	   Under an agreement signed last month, Iraq will import goods
worth dlrs 50 million from Lebanon under the current phase of the
U.N.-approved oil-for-food program, which allows Baghdad to sell
limited quantities of oil to buy needed food and medicine for its
people.
	   The program is an exception from punishing U.N. trade sanctions
imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Lebanon, which is struggling to rebuild from the devastating
1975-90 civil war, is keen to maintain good relations with Saudi
Arabia and Kuwait, both of which have given Lebanon aid for its
reconstruction efforts.
	   Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have firmly rejected Arab calls to
normalize relations with Iraq.

Corinthians' Luxemburgo appointed new Brazilian manager
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: CORRECTS spelling of Luxemburgo's first name to Vanderley;
subs fourth graf to show Luxemburgo was defender in playing
career. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Two-time national championship
coach Vanderley Luxemburgo was appointed the new manager of
four-time World Cup titlist Brazil on Tuesday, taking over for
Mario Zagallo who was much-maligned in the wake of the France 98
final.
	   Luxemburgo won the Brazilian national title in 1993 and 1994
with Palmeiras, the highlight of a 16-year coaching career that
followed a lackluster 11-year playing career. The 46-year-old
sideline boss of Corinthians will remain with his club, atop the
standings by two points, through the end of the Brazilian national
championship in December.
	   ``I am very satisfied,'' Luxemburgo told reporters who mobbed
him at the Brazilian confederation's headquarters in downtown Rio.
``To be part of the national team is the objective of any soccer
professional, be he a coach or a player.''
	   After unremarkable stints as a defender for Flamengo, Botafogo
and Internacional from 1971-1982, Luxemburgo started his coaching
career at Rio's Vasco da Gama as an assistant.
	   He rose to his first head coaching job in 1983 with Rio's Campo
Grande and went on to manage different 14 teams, including Saudi
Arabia's Ittihad and Shabab.
	   He first gained national attention in 1990 as coach of
Bragantino, taking the small club to the Paulista, or Sao Paulo
state title.
	   He moved on to Palmeiras, where he won the Paulista again in
1993 and 1994, in addition to the national titles.
	   After coaching Flamengo in 1995, he returned to Palmeiras to
once more reclaim the Paulista in 1996.
	   He coached Santos in 1997 before moving to Corinthians this
season.
	   Luxemburgo takes over a team that advanced unconvingly to the
World Cup final in Paris, where a game-day illness to Ronaldo shook
the squad and resulted in a 3-0 loss to France.
	   Zagallo, criticized during the tournament for what some called
the team's uninspired play, was severely condemned for using
Ronaldo in the final and the resulting loss.
	   The first players for the new national team should be named some
time in September for the three or four exhibition matches
remaining this year.
	   Luxemburgo said it would be premature to talk about his plans
for the team until ``the technical commission is chosen and
priorities are established.''
	   He did say he may have two or three assistant coaches.

Russians: Clinton to visit Moscow Sept. 1-3

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton will visit Russia from
Sept. 1-3 for a summit with Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president's
press service said Tuesday.
	   The brief, one-sentence announcement gave no other details.
	   U.S. Vice President Al Gore was in Moscow last month to work on
the agenda for the summit with Russian Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko.
	   The U.S. administration originally wanted the summit held after
the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament, ratified
the START II nuclear arms reduction treaty.
	   The treaty, which has already been approved by the U.S. Senate,
has faced strong opposition and repeated delays in the Duma, which
now is expected to vote on the issue sometime this fall.
	   Many lawmakers in the Communist-dominated Duma oppose the
treaty, arguing it would put Russia at a strategic disadvantage and
would be costly to implement fully. The hard-liners also argue that
Russia cannot reduce its nuclear arsenal when NATO is expanding
eastward.
	   START II would cut Russian and American nuclear arsenals roughly
in half.
	   The White House has said that Clinton will visit Ireland and
Northern Ireland after his trip to Russia.

Sir John Browne: The man who will lead newly merged BP and Amoco
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: LEADS with 6 grafs to add quote from Browne &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-US-BP-Amoco &QL; 
 &UR; By MARA BELLABY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Sir John Browne, who takes the helm of the newly
merged British Petroleum PLC and Amoco, likes to venture into new
territory _ and isn't afraid of criticism when he does.
	   The BP chief executive angered oil companies worldwide when he
became one of the first industry leaders to speak about the need to
limit carbon emissions and address the issue of global warming.
	   And he braved the wrath of environmental activists by doing what
few, if any, big oil bosses have done before _ addressing a
Greenpeace event.
	   Now Browne, 50, who followed his father into BP and has never
worked anywhere else, will head one of the world's top
international oil producers, created Tuesday in the largest
industrial merger ever.
	   ``In the 32 years I've been working with BP, this is the most
exciting of them all,'' Browne said at a news conference announcing
the deal.
	   ``The thing about BP was that it had a unique and unusual
balance. BP was top of the second division, but there were limits
to what we could do. Today's deal changes the game and pushes us
into the super league.''
	   Browne, a compact man with thick brown hair and deep-set eyes,
joined BP in 1966 as a university apprentice. He holds a physics
degree from Cambridge University and a master's in business from
Stanford University in California. In his early BP days, he worked
in exploration and production, holding posts throughout North
America and in London.
	   In 1984, he became group treasurer and chief executive of BP
Finance International, where he was noted for developing new ways
to manage financial risk. That kicked off his quick rise through
the company, culminating in his appointment as chief executive in
July 1995.
	   Alan Sinclair, an oil analyst with Charterhouse Tilney
Securities in London, said Browne's tenure at the top of BP speaks
for itself. ``All you have to do is look at the total shareholder
return, and that says it,'' Sinclair said.
	   In the past five years, the shareholder return increased 90
percent relative to the market, he said. That compares to Shell Oil
Co. at under 40 percent.
	   Browne has received much praise recently. Last year, BP was
named one of Fortune magazine's Most Admired Companies. Browne was
also named Petroleum Executive of the Year by oil industry
executives.
	   A bachelor, Browne lives with his mother, who was a Romanian
linguist when she met Browne's father during World War II. She is
now in her mid-80s. British newspapers have portrayed him as a

pre-Columbian artifacts in the rare times he is not at his desk.

Aliev to seek re-election as Azerbaijan's president
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) _ Azerbaijan's leader, Geidar Aliev,
confirmed Tuesday he will seek re-election in presidential
elections scheduled for Oct. 11.
	   Aliev has until now said he would not seek another term unless
there was widespread popular support for his candidacy. He
announced his decision on television, saying four political parties
had appealed to him to run.
	   Aliev, who was Azerbaijan's Soviet-era Communist Party boss,
came to power in a bloodless military coup in June 1993.
	   He has recently been trying to improve his democratic
credentials and last week issued a decree abolishing most forms of
censorship in the oil-rich former Soviet republic of 7 million
people on the Caspian Sea.

Social democrat PM says Sweden can consider health privatization
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Leads with five grafs to CLARIFY that some private health-care
facilities already operating. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Social Democratic Prime Minister Goeran
Persson said in an interview published Tuesday that he believes
Sweden's social-welfare system should be more open for
privatization.
	   Under the Social Democrats, who have governed for most of the
century, Sweden developed an extensive and widely admired social
services system, including prestigious hospitals.
	   But the system has also been costly and services have declined
in the 1990s as the government was forced to cut back funding.
	   The deterioration of services, including overcrowded wards and
months-long waits for some elective surgery, has been a large issue
in the campaign for national elections Sept. 20.
	   Conservative party leader Carl Bildt, seeking a return to the
prime ministership he held in 1990-94, argues that privatization
could improven services and reduce waits. A small number of private
hospitals and clinics already exist in the country.
	   Persson had been critical of privatization proposals, but said
in an interview with the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet that ``it is
good if you have private entrepreneurs, or main figures, that test
other ways of giving care. But the starting point must be to bring
a new method to the work.''
	   Persson said any private care-giving must be accompanied by
strict regulatory control and the possibility that local
governments could take over facilities if private operators did not
meet standards.
	   In a late July opinion poll, the Social Democrats got the
support of about 39 percent of the respondents, with Bildt's
Moderates the next highest at about 26 percent.

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ A complete face-lift may be what is
needed to save the sport of cycling, racers told the International
Cycling Union Tuesday at a doping crisis meeting.
	   Cycling's world governing body invited some of the sport's elite
_ including the retired five-time Tour de France champion Miguel
Indurain, Olympic champion Pascal Richard, former-world champion
Luc Leblanc and current world No. 1 Laurent Jalabert _ to discuss
the sport's future in the wake of the drug-hit Tour de France last
month.
	   ``We are basically here to discuss the problem of doping
following the catastrophy at the Tour de France,'' said Leblanc.
``We've been fighting doping for a long time and this year it
exploded. But it's a blessing in disguise. It got things moving. It
will be good for our future.''
	   Scrambling to come to grips with the sport's growing drug
crisis, UCI opened the series of meeting with the cycling's top
officials last Thursday in Paris.
	   The sport's ongoing drug-scandal was aggravated on Tuesday
following reports that four Italian racers were kicked out of the
Tour of Portugal after testing positive.
	   While no absolute decisions were taken, cyclists and UCI
officials were confident the tarnished image of the sport could be
salvaged _ along with the health of the racers.
	   An over-haul of the season's gruelling schedule along with the
long-disputed regular medical check-ups were at the top of the
agenda.
	   ``It isn't only a problem of doping,''said French cyclist
Jalabert, who, along with the entire ONCE team, quit the Tour de
France before the start of the 17th stage, protesting police
investigations. ``It's a lot of other things.
	   ``The length of the races; maybe the bigger tours are too long,
too difficult,'' Jalabert suggested. ``Maybe the season is too
long, too complicated. Maybe we have to review the entire system to
avoid inciting certain racers to resort to doping.''
	   UCI officials admitted the loaded calendar will need to be
re-examined.
	   ``The cyclists told us about their lives as racers,'' said UCI
president Hein Verbruggen, after the all-day meeting held at
Lausanne's lakeside Olympic Museum. ``The difficulties and the
weight of the race circuit.
	   ``We must now launch a scientific study to see if the races and
their requirements are too demanding.''
	   Optimistic, Leblanc promised ``things will be shaken up on the
calendar,'' and likely in time for next season.
	   Frequent and regular medical check-ups, long-contested by the
racers, now seem readily accepted by all.
	   ``The cyclists understand it better now than when we suggested
it at the Tour de France,'' said UCI Vice-president Daniel Baal.
``Now that we've properly explained it to them we all agree on the
principle of medical follow-ups. We know we cannot guarantee there
will be no cheaters, but we can guarantee the health of the
riders.''
	   In the end, the racers appeared to agree.
	   ``The current tests are quite good but there are certain
lacks,'' said Leblanc. ``This is where the check-ups come in, four
times a year, to allow us to be more vigilent.''
	   Though the meeting did not touch upon possible punishment or
amnesty with regards to racers kicked out of the Tour de France,
the topic of sanctions briefly came up.
	   ``We talked a little about the toughness of certain sanctions,''
said Leblanc. ``Certain sanctions are too tough for certain
products. For instance, you can't have the same sanctions for
anabolic steroids as for cafeines.''
	   Festina riders, including Armin Meier, Alex Zuelle and Laurent
Dufaux, remain free to compete, despite confessions they
systematically used banned substances and were kicked out of the
Tour de France.
	   The UCI will meet with race representatives on Wednesday and is
expected to provide details of the meetings and announce new
strategies to combat doping on Thursday.
	   The sport's growing drug crisis has sparked other emergency
meetings. The International Olympic Committee has scheduled a
doping conference for January and will gather on August 20 to
prepare for the meeting.

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ FBI investigators used cotton swabs to
sweep up traces of explosives from the bombed-out wreckage of the
U.S. Embassy in Nairobi as Israeli search teams neared the bottom
of the rubble and reported that there might be two survivors.
	   Four days after twin terrorist bombings in Kenya and Tanzania
claimed 234 lives and injured nearly 5,000, a collapsed building
adjacent to the embassy was a beehive of activity with cranes,
bulldozers and rescue workers engaged in a frentic search for signs
of life.
	   In Tanzania, police working with the FBI arrested 14 foreigners
including six Sudanese, six Iraqis, a Somali and a Turk. Tanzania's
Ambassador to Washington, Mustafa Salim Nyang'anyi, said his
government believes some ``may have had a hand'' in the attack and
they had been turned over to the FBI for interrogation.
	   At the wreckage of the Dar es Salaam embassy, a dozen FBI agents
swept and raked Laibon Road in front of the embassy building,
collecting and sifting through debris in their search for evidence.
	   In Nairobi, FBI agents in civilian clothes used cotton balls to
swab fences, walls and metal fragments at the bomb site to sweep up
traces of explosives, which could give them clues to the identity
of the bombers. They worked behind a shroud of black fabric.
	   Other agents labeled pieces of metal from cars mangled in the
blast. The suspected car bomb was shrouded beneath a huge red and
white plastic sheet. A Marine stood guard, aiming his gun and
shouting hostile warnings at journalists who considered taking
photos.
	   Capt. Rhyl Jones, garrison engineer of the British Army in Kenya
who brought a team of British soldiers to work at the bomb site
about 90 minutes after the blast, said nobody knows for sure
whether that vehicle which is smashed against the embassy's back
wall carried the bomb.
	   ``The vehicle that carried the bomb may be only a two-inch
(5-centimeter) piece of metal somewhere,'' he said.
	   Jones, a demolition expert who has investigated Irish Republican
Army bombings in Northern Ireland, estimated the bomb could have
contained up to 250 kilograms (550 pounds) of explosives, depending
on what type was used.
	   ``My opinion is that it was definitely a commercial explosive.
This wasn't a homemade device,'' he told The Associated Press.
	   In a report from Nairobi, Israeli Army Radio said investigators
suspect the bombers used the sophisticated plastic explosive
Semtex.
	   The bomb left a crater in the rear of the embassy, with about a
4-meter (13-foot) diameter, Jones said.
	   ``Obviously, a certain amount of (explosive) charge would have
gone in there early on, but not an awful lot,'' he said. ``There
was an awful lot of rubble from the explosion that ended up in
there. There was also a damaged water pipe, because it was all full
of water Friday night.''
	   Kenyan Television on Tuesday night quoted a source as saying an
engine block had been found in the crater.
	   Immediately after the bomb, there was chaos at the bomb site as
thousands of injured people sought help and good samaritans search
through the rubble for survivors. As a result, U.S. investigators
said, the crime scene ``is a mess.''
	   The bags of debris collected by the FBI were being taken to a
parking lot where they were laid out in piles for further
investigation.
	   The FBI says finding out what kind of explosives were used and
how would be critical to the investigation.
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on Monday offered a dlrs 2
million reward for information leading to the capture of the
``cowards that committed this act.''
	   A Kenyan guard at the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi who told the East
African Standard that he witnessed the embassy attack provided the
most detailed published account yet of the bombing.
	   Joash Okindo was quoted as saying he and his colleagues, armed
only with short wooden clubs, stopped five Arab-looking men at a
barrier to the embassy's front parking lot and forced them to turn
into the rear parking lot.
	   The attackers then jumped from the truck and opened fire with
automatic rifles, shooting a guard and then hurling a grenade into
the compound. At least one Marine returned fire. Moments later, the
truck exploded, Okindo told the paper.
	   ``We saved people's lives by sending it to the rear entrance,''
Okindo told the Standard. ``If we hadn't done that, I don't think I
would be alive and talking to you now.''
	   Okindo ``resisted heroically,'' U.S. State Department spokesman
James Foley said in Washington.
	   Okindo, whose legs and left arm were almost severed according to
the paper, was flown to Germany for treatment and was in Hamburg
Hospital waiting to be be transferred to Landstuhl Army Hospital,
U.S. Embassy spokesman Chris Scharf said Tuesday night.
	   Early Tuesday evening, the Israelis informed the Red Cross that
there might be two survivors, and medical teams were standing by,
said Red Cross spokeswoman Nina Galbe.
	   Israeli soldiers, the first professional search-and-rescue team
on the scene, had been spurred on by a woman named Rose who spoke
to Kenyan Red Cross workers on Sunday, and by a tapping noise heard
Monday morning.
	   But nothing had been heard from Rose for more than 48 hours, and
late Tuesday the head of the Kenyan search and rescue operation
said: ``We have retrieved the name of Rose amongst the dead.''
	   ``But at the moment it's very difficult for me to confirm
whether it was the Rose we were speaking to earlier, or whether
there is another Rose,'' said Army Maj. Gen. George Agoi.
	   No one has been pulled alive out of the rubble since Saturday.
	   And the mountain of twisted steel and concrete chunks is rapidly
diminishing.
	   Agoi said he expects the search teams to reach the bottom by
late Wednesday or early Thursday.
	   At the bomb scene, Scouts from all over Africa interrupted a
jamboree to help sweep and debris from the streets. Red Cross
volunteers gathered eyeglasses, pens, torn ID papers and other
personal items from the wreckage in the hope of helping identify
the dead, said Galbe, the Red Cross spokeswoman.
	   ``We will put everything in envelopes, labeled with where found
and when, so that at the end of the day we can piece as much of the
puzzle together as possible,'' she said.
	   It was not known who was behind the blasts. News media received
claims of responsibility in the name of the ``Islamic Army for the
Liberation of Holy Shrines'' and the ``Army for the Liberation of
Islamic Shrines.'' The claims could not be confirmed and may have
come from the same source.

UEFA Cup: Slavia Prague wins 4-0

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Robert Vagner scored two goals as
Slavia Prague beat Slovakia's Inter Bratislava 4-0 in the the first
leg of the UEFA Cup second qualifying round Tuesday.
	   Vagner got the first in the 23rd minute off a pass from Ivo
Ulich. Lubos Kozel made it 2-0 in the 55th minute.
	   In the 72nd minute, Karim Adippe passed to Jiri Skala who scored
on a header, giving Slavia a 3-0 lead. Vagner notched his second
goal in the final minute of the match.
	   In the last minute of the first half, Slavia lost Ulich to an
elbow injury suffered in a collision with Inter's Marian Suchancok.
Ulich is unlikely to play in the second leg in Bratislava later
this month.
	   ``The result is very cruel for us,'' Inter's coach Jozef Bubenko
said after the match.

Ukrainian premier takes unusual steps against reluctant tax
</HEADLINE>
debtors &QL; 
 &UR; By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ With government coffers almost empty,
Ukraine's prime minister has been using some unusual methods to
persuade tax debtors to pay up.
	   Last week, he gathered more than 1,000 executives from debtor
companies in a Kiev meeting hall and told them they would have to
make due on their debts before they would be allowed to leave. Most
of them complied.
	   And this week, Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko plans to
bring about 1,000 executives to a tent camp for civil defense
training, the government's press service said Monday. But
Pustovoitenko's real motivation appears to be his desire to clamp
down on tax evaders.
	   Pustovoitenko describes the steps as part of a larger plan aimed
at squeezing money from the debtors.
	   ``The situation is really critical,'' he said last week.
	   Ukraine's budget is short about dlrs 3.5 billion in revenues. In
addition, the state Pension Fund is owed about dlrs 1.5 billion,
according to official figures.
	   There's no disputing Ukraine's financial problems _ the country
has been in economic decline since the 1991 Soviet breakup _ but
some newspapers have said the premier's tactics are too
heavy-handed.
	   Pustovoitenko began his campaign last week by bringing
executives from the debtor companies and organizations to the
capital, Kiev.
	   After government leaders admonished the executives,
Pustovoitenko told them that no one would be leaving Ukraina Palace
until at least some of the debts were paid.
	   Ukrainian newspapers said the comments touched off general
confusion at the meeting hall, with some participants standing in
line to sign the required papers while others rushed to find a
telephone. Reporters said no one was forcibly prevented from
leaving.
	   Many executives did agree to pay a large portion of their debts
within days and the rest by the end of August.
	   However, only dlrs 36.5 million has arrived for the Pension Fund
and dlrs 31.5 million for the budget since last week, the Interfax
news agency reported.
	   The Cabinet has warned the state tax service and Pension Fund
chiefs that they would be held personally responsible for
collecting the payments.
	   Pustovoitenko said he would require executives from debtor
companies to appear at a two-day tent camp this week in
Pereyaslav-Khmelnytsky, 30 miles (50 kms) outside Kiev, in his
capacity as head of the country's Civil Defense system. Many of the
executives also are civil defense officials. The session was
expected to start Wednesday.
	   The premier told the executives last week that people have
started to tell stories about teachers ``being paid with manure''
instead of money.
	   Pustovoitenko said if tax payments don't start arriving, the
executives who come to the civil defense course may receive
``training in transporting manure.''

Johnson aims for 10-year record
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: CORRECTS time in lead to 43.29 seconds. &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Ten years ago, Butch Reynolds broke
the world record in the 400 meters in Zurich. No one has matched
his time of 43.29 seconds since.
	   Michael Johnson will have another shot at the record Wednesday
on the same track at the Weltklasse Golden League meet, the world's
premier one-day track and field competition.
	   Johnson won gold medals in the 200 and 400 meters at the 1996
Atlanta Olympics, shattering the 200 record in the process. The 400
record remains the one missing achievement in his brilliant career.
	   Ranked among the greatest track athletes of all time, Johnson,
who has lost just two 400 races in the last decade, is rounding
into top form after a slow start to the season caused by nagging
injuries.
	   After a shocking third-place finish in Oslo last month, Johnson
quickly re-established himself by winning his next race in Rome and
taking gold at the Goodwill Games in 43.76 seconds. He also ran the
anchor leg as the U.S. team set a world record of 2:54.20 in the
1,600-meter relay at the Goodwill Games.
	   The Weltklasse, with a budget of 5.5 million Swiss francs (dlrs
3.68 million), traditionally attracts the top-flight competitors
from every discipline.
	   Zurich has a fast track, a prime slot in the season's schedule
and dlrs 50,000 bonuses for world records. Last year, the event
produced three world records.
	   Ethiopia's Haile Gebrselassie and Morocco's Hicham El-Guerrouj
will continue their assault on the record books at the Swiss
banking capital.
	   Gebrselassie, already having bettered the 5,000 and 10,000 world
records this season, will once again attempt to add the 3,000 mark
to his collection. The diminutive Ethiopian can expect to be pushed
all the way by Kenya's Paul Tergat, the Olympic and world
championship silver medalist over 10,000.
	   The 1,500 will see El-Guerrouj try to lower the world record of
3:26.00 he set earlier this season at the Golden Gala in Rome. El
Guerrouj will be pursued by a group of Kenyans led by Laban Rotich,
who has the best time behind the Moroccan this season, clocking
3:30.06 in Monte Carlo on Saturday.
	   American sprint sensation Marion Jones, unbeaten in the women's
100 this year, will attempt to improve on her personal best of
10.71, and inch closer to Florence Griffith-Joyner's record of
10.49.
	   Jones, who has run under 11 seconds 11 times this season, will
also compete in the long jump.
	   The men's 100 was expected to be one of the main attractions but
it lost some of its lustre when world champion Maurice Greene of
the United States and Trinidad's Ato Boldon, the fastest man this
season twice clocking 9.86, pulled out over a money dispute with
organizers.
	   The race is now set to come down to a duel between Canada's
resurgent Olympic champion and world record-holder Donovan Bailey
and Namibia's Frankie Fredericks, who has run more sub-10-seconds
100 races than any other sprinter in history.
	   The evening's best chance at a world record is likely to come in
the 3,000 steeplechase, with current holder Bernard Barmasai of

Sean Connery says he's unsure what 'Avengers' will be like
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Sean Connery says he is unsure what 'The Avengers'
will be like, because the film is entirely in the hands of the
producer and director.
	   ``At this stage they know more about it than I do,'' said
Connery, who plays the villain Sir August De Wynter in the film,
which will be released Friday.
	   At a news conference on Tuesday, Connery said he couldn't
predict whether the film would be a success.
	   ``I've been proven wrong so many times,'' he said.
	   ``I hope it's a success for Warner Brothers because they could
use one. I think you are addressing the wrong person, you should be
asking the director and producer because they finally put together
their movie.''
	   Asked if he was worried about the film's fortunes, Connery said:
``Not entirely.''
	   ``It's a massive piece of my life. It's two years of my life _
but it's not going to flop,'' Weintraub said in an interview
broadcast on BBC radio.
	   He added: ``I've got nothing to be scared about. My life is in
order. I'm 60 years old and I've had a huge amount of success _
more than most people have in 25 lifetimes. I've got plenty of
money.''

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A Sardinian prosecutor undergoing questioning on
charges he and two others extorted one billion lire (dlrs 550,000)
from the family of a kidnapping victim committed suicide Tuesday in
his office.
	   Luigi Lombardini shot himself in the head just minutes after he
emerged from a five-hour long interrogation session by a team of
prosecutors looking into the kidnapping of Silvia Melis.
	   Italian news reports said Lombardini slipped away from police
who were escorting him, locked himself in his office, and fired the
shot. The room where Lombardini was questioned and his office are
just a few floors apart in the prosecutors' building in Cagliari,
on Sardinia's southern coast.
	   Melis was abducted in February 1997 while her 4-year-old son
slept in her car. She was released unharmed nine months later after
payment of an undisclosed amount of money.
	   Investigators suspect Lombardini, together with a Sardinian
lawyer, Antonio Piras, and industrialist, Nicola Grauso, told
Melis' family that the bandits had demanded an extra one billion
lire (dlrs 550,000), and then kept the money.
	   Lombardini had repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. He had
scheduled a news conference Wednesday morning to tell his side of
the story.
	   After Melis was freed, her family expressed immense gratitude to
Grauso, a family friend, for helping resolve the case.
	   Kidnappings by professional gangs have long plagued Sardinia. At
least 500 cases have been reported in the past six years. Often
victims are held for many months, and several are missing since
1993.

Overdose death toll spurs Canada to consider prescribing heroin
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos planned &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) _ Dismayed by a horrific death
toll from drug overdoses, Vancouver authorities are nudging Canada
steadily closer to breaking a North American taboo by supplying
heroin to addicts.
	   So far this year, 224 people in British Columbia _ mostly from
Vancouver's skid-row areas _ have died of overdoses, up 40 percent
from last year.
	   The deaths, blamed on an influx of cheaper and more potent
heroin, prompted the provincial health officer, Dr. John Millar, to
recommend last month that health workers provide heroin to certain
addicts on a trial basis.
	   The aim would be to reduce the risk of overdose and restore some
stability to the addicts' lives by freeing them from the daily
scavaging for money to buy their next fix.
	   Such programs have been tried on a limited basis in Western
Europe, but never in North America. Many experts believe heroin
trials are unlikely to take place in the United States anytime soon
because of firm opposition among many lawmakers, while Canadian
officials and politicians are considered more receptive.
	   Vancouver's chief coroner has endorsed the plan. Even the city
police chief has expressed cautious interest because of the
prospects of reducing addiction-related crime.
	   The federal health agency, Health Canada, says it would be
willing to authorize clinical trials in which doctors could
prescribe heroin to addicts.
	   On Tuesday, the lawmaker who represents Vancouver's worst
skid-row neighborhood in Parliament introduced a motion urging the
federal government to launch such trials immediately.
	   ``People are dying in the streets because we have failed to
act,'' said Libby Davies.
	   Her district includes the Downtown Eastside, a pocket of rundown
rooming houses, pawn shops and bars a few blocks from Vancouver's
posh cruise-ship pier. Rampant intravenous drug use has saddled the
neighborhood with one of the highest rates of HIV infection in the
developed world.
	   The most ambitious experiment with prescribed heroin has been in
Switzerland, where 1,146 addicts received thrice-daily injections
in 1994-1996. The program's researchers said crimes committed by
those addicts dropped sharply, and many were able to find jobs and
decent housing.
	   But critics questioned the accuracy of the findings, while
others say any plan condoning drug use sends a bad message to young
people.
	   In the United States, the Swiss program has received little
serious consideration, according to Ethan Nadelmann, director of a
New York-based drug-policy think tank, the Lindesmith Institute.
	   ``There's been a de facto self-censoring of any discussion of
this,'' he said. ``There's a reluctance to keep people on drugs
they might like.''
	   One of the few U.S. jurisdictions to openly contemplate
Swiss-style heroin maintenance is Baltimore, but officials there
say it could be two years before anything is in place even if
federal approval is granted. Davies hopes Canada can act more
swiftly and perhaps provide ammunition for Americans seeking to
modify U.S. policy.
	   Dr. David Lewis, director of the Center for Alcohol and
Addiction Studies at Brown University, is one of the leading
American experts in the field. He believes heroin prescription
tests have a better chance of getting launched in Canada.
	   ``The ideological barriers to doing a pilot program are less in
Canada... it's a little less edgy in terms of the moral crusade
aspect,'' he said.
	   Among law enforcement officials, there are sharp divisions over
heroin prescription programs.
	   ``It sends us down a path,'' said Inspector Richard
Barszczewski, a drug specialist with the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police. ``Would we then be suggesting for the cocaine addicts we
should give them cocaine? For alcoholics, should we give them
alcohol?''
	   But for Vancouver policeman Gil Pudar, heroin prescription makes
sense in terms of crime-fighting and economics. He says 90 percent
of property crime in his district is committed to support
addictions.
	   ``The criminal justice system is the most expensive method of
intervention,'' he said. ``Why are we spending millions of dollars
chasing our tail when all we're doing is making the problem
worse?''

Congo accuses Rwanda, Uganda of coordinating overthrow effort
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RON KAMPEAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Congo accused the governments of Rwanda
and Uganda on Tuesday of coordinating an attempt to overthrow
Laurent Kabila's government and offered to restart an inquiry into
possible atrocities committed last year by Tutsi troops.
	   Tutsi rebels fighting to topple Kabila's 14-month-old regime
were headed towards Kinshasa, the capital, on Tuesday, while
government forces say they have recaptured key Congolese cities
from the rebels.
	   Andre Mwamba Kapanga, Congo's ambassador to the United Nations,
dismissed claims that the rebels were principally Banyamulenge _
Congolese Tutsis _ and outlined what he said was a three-pronged
``destabilizing exercise'' coordinated by the Ugandan and Rwandan
governments, and backed by their troops.
	   ``It is clear that the aggression against the Democratic
Republic of Congo is the work of a coalition between Rwanda and
Uganda,'' he told reporters at U.N. headquarters in New York.
	   He said the Ugandan/Rwandan plan was to rally Congolese troops
to the rebel side; to starve Kinshasa by controlling nearby ports;
and to control energy resources.
	   ``We will use every means possible to put an end to this
aggression,'' Kapanga said. ``We're fighting for the survival of
our country.''
	   Uganda and its southern neighbor, Rwanda, were early backers of
Kabila when he toppled dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in May 1997.
	   In recent months, they have expressed anger at Kabila's failure
to contain attacks on their territory by rebels based in eastern
Congo _ the principal reason they backed his fight against Mobutu.
	   Kabila ordered Rwandan troops out last month, responding to
growing resentment among the Congolese at the Rwandans' power. Nine
days ago, fighting broke out.
	   Rwanda has dismissed claims that it is involved in the fighting,
although it has said it will retaliate if Congo ventures into
Rwandan territory.
	   Uganda has called claims of its involvement ``baseless.''
	   Kapanga said that Congo has no plans to venture outside its
territory.
	   He appeared eager to assuage international concerns that
Congolese troops would target the Banyamulenge, saying that Congo
recognized them as a Congolese minority.
	   Asked about mass arrests in Banyamulenge centers, he said that
was ``to neutralize an outbreak of complicity.''
	   He called on the United Nations to back Congo's attempts to
maintain its territorial integrity.
	   Kapanga also expressed a new willingness to investigate the
alleged massacre of Hutu refugees by Rwandan and Congolese forces
during Kabila's 1997 victory against Mobutu.
	   ``We are ready and willing to do that and we have even asked the
international community to help us reform the judicial system,'' he
said.
	   Until now, Congo, out of apparent loyalty to Rwanda, had stymied
attempts to investigate the killings and U.N. investigators were
attacked earlier this year.
	   Hutu militants were responsible for the 1994 genocide of more
than 500,000 minority Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus in
Rwanda. The killing ended when Tutsi-led forces won power in July
1994, sending thousands of Hutu fighters and refugees across the
border into Congo.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ After a string of recent losses,
secessionist ethnic Albanian rebels battled Serb government forces
Tuesday in Kosovo province's border with Albania.
	   Albanian sources, who first reported the clashes, claimed a
column of 110 Yugoslav army vehicles, including 36 tanks, was seen
heading for the embattled Decani region.
	   Yugoslavia's official Tanjug news agency confirmed the fighting
close to the border with Albania, saying six Serb policemen were
wounded. Neither side gave a casualty figure for the ethnic
Albanians.
	   Tanjug said fighting was concentrated along the road connecting
Decani and Djakovica, in western Kosovo, in the villages of Prilep
and Glodjane, known to be strongholds of the ethnic Albanian Kosovo
Liberation Army. It said the police were gaining ground against the
KLA.
	   Tanjug claimed large groups of KLA fighters were attacking
police patrols along the strategic road to try to keep Serb forces
out of the village of Junik, the biggest KLA stronghold in western
Kosovo, which has been encircled by Serb police for three weeks.
	   Tanjug said several hundred KLA men were firing at police from
Junik on Tuesday, but the police did not fire back on the village.
	   Elsewhere, the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Information Center
reported two ethnic Albanians, age 2 and 15, were killed late
Monday in Serb shelling of the village of Petrovo, about 18 miles
south of Pristina, Kosovo's provincial capital.
	   And the Albanian state-run ATA news agency in Tirana said the
bodies of five men were bought to the hospital in Djakovica on
Monday night. It did not provide other details.
	   The Albanian government said Tuesday that 70 people had fled
across the border from Kosovo within the last 24 hours, including
two badly wounded guerrillas.
	   Independent media in Belgrade also reported the Kosovo
Liberation Army had re-entered the central village of Likovac, the
rebel headquarters Serb forces overran last week. The report could
not be confirmed.
	   In a statement distributed to ethnic Albanian media, the KLA
said the latest Serb offensive ``has only strengthened our resolve
to bravely continue on the road to freedom.''
	   It called on Kosovo Albanians, who represent 90 percent of the
Serbian province's 2 million people, to ``unite with the KLA and
help us in our just freedom fight.''
	   Despite the war rhetoric, a top KLA official told the Albanian
Koha Ditore newspaper the militants might join an all-Albanian
negotiating team in peace negotiations with the Serbian government.
	   In Geneva, U.N. human rights spokesman Jose Diaz said the U.N.
Human Rights Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination
would send a letter next week to the Yugoslav government to express
concern about the displacement of people in Kosovo.
	   The latest figure from the U.N. refugee agency put the number of
Kosovo refugees at around 240,000.
	   For five months, Serb troops have been fighting the KLA, which
seeks independence from Serbia, the dominant republic of
Yugoslavia. Kosovo's ethnic Albanians remain largely divided
between those loyal to pacifist ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova and those who support the militants.

Sudanese opposition leaders meet in Cairo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Sudanese opposition leaders held talks
Tuesday with Egypt's deputy prime minister on the situation in
Sudan after last week's failed peace talks.
	   Egypt's Middle East News Agency said Youssef Waly, deputy prime
minister and minister of agriculture, assured the Sudanese of
Egypt's keenness to ``support and strengthen the historic ties
between Egypt and Sudan.''
	   President Hosni Mubarak was to meet the Sudanese opposition
leaders on Wednesday.
	   The Sudanese are members of the National Democratic Alliance, an
opposition group headquartered in Eritrea that has vowed to
overthrow the Islamic regime installed in Khartoum after the 1989
coup by Lt. Gen. Omar el-Bashir.
	   Talks last week between the John Garang's rebel Sudan People's
Liberation Army and the Sudanese government in the Ethiopian
capital Addis Ababa failed to make headway.
	   In addition to Garang, the Sudanese opposition leaders in Cairo
include Mohammed Osman al-Mirgani, head of the alliance, and Sadiq
el-Mahdi, the Sudanese prime minister ousted by el-Bashir and
leader of the outlawed Umma Party.
	   They were invited by the Egyptian government, which fears that
the civil war in southern and eastern Sudan could lead to a
division of the country and affect control of the Nile River, the
source of Egypt's water.
	   Al-Mirgani thanked Egypt for its ``support for the struggle of
the Sudanese people to achieve democracy, peace and stability,''
MENA said.
	   Garang _ whose forces have led the 15-year insurgency in
southern Sudan _ assured the Egyptian side that his group does not
seek the division of Sudan.
	   ``We are all with the unity of Sudan, based on new foundations
of justice and equality,'' MENA quoted him as saying.
	   The rebels have been fighting since 1983 for greater autonomy
for the Christians and animists in the south from the Islamic
north. More than 1.5 million people have died in the fighting and
related famines.
	   The Sudanese government on Aug. 3 declared a unilateral
cease-fire, expanding a limited truce designed to get international
aid to famine-stricken regions.
	   Aid workers estimate that about 1.5 million people are facing
starvation in southern Sudan, mainly in Bahr al-Ghazal province, as
a result of drought and the fighting.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Sean Connery says he is unsure what 'The Avengers'
will be like, because the film is entirely in the hands of the
producer and director.
	   ``At this stage they know more about it than I do,'' said
Connery, who plays the villain Sir August De Wynter in the film,
which will be released Friday.
	   At a news conference on Tuesday, Connery said he couldn't
predict whether the film would be a success.
	   ``I've been proven wrong so many times,'' he said.
	   ``I hope it's a success for Warner Brothers because they could
use one. I think you are addressing the wrong person, you should be
asking the director and producer because they finally put together
their movie.''
	   Asked if he was worried about the film's fortunes, Connery said:
``Not entirely.''
	   A man who is much more concerned is producer Jerry Weintraub,
who elected to open the film without letting critics see it first.
	   ``It's a massive piece of my life. It's two years of my life _
but it's not going to flop,'' Weintraub said in an interview
broadcast on BBC radio.
	   He added: ``I've got nothing to be scared about. My life is in
order. I'm 60 years old and I've had a huge amount of success _
more than most people have in 25 lifetimes. I've got plenty of
money.''

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Still strutting and sneering, Mick Jagger brought
the Rolling Stones to their first concert in Russia, and the band
played through a driving rain before an appreciate crowd of tens of
thousands.
	   The Stones first applied to perform in Moscow more than 30 years
ago, but never received permission until Tuesday night's concert at
Moscow's Luzhniki sports stadium.
	   The band came on stage playing their classic ``Satisfaction,''
and mixed other old standards such as ``Honky Tonk Woman'' and
``Start Me Up'' with recent material such as ``Anybody Seen My
Baby?'' and ``You'll Never Make a Saint Out of Me.''
	   The crowd was made up mostly of young Russians, but also
included plenty of middle-aged fans and Russian boys who sang along
with every song in English.
	   A steady, heavy rain started shortly after the concert began,
drenching the fans as well as the Stones in the partly covered
stadium. The only concession to the weather came when Jagger and
Ron Wood put on hats.
	   Jagger pranced from one end of the stage to the other, full of
mischievous energy, at one point removing a shoe and sucking on the
toe of a female backup singer in the middle of ``Miss You.''
	   The ITAR-Tass news agency estimated more than 70,000 people
attended the concert. Russian TV showed fans who said they had come
from as far as Siberia just to attend the show, part of the Stones'
``Bridges to Babylon'' tour.
	   ``It's our youth,'' pop singer Alla Pugachova, Russia's most
famous contemporary entertainer, said before entering the stadium.
``It's a wonderful time.''
	   The Stones first applied for permission to play in the Soviet
Union in 1967. Soviet officials went to watch them play a concert
in Warsaw, but didn't like what they saw.
	   ``They thought the show was so awful, so decadent, that they
said this show would never happen in Moscow,'' band leader Mick
Jagger said at a news conference on Monday.
	   ``Anyway, things have changed,'' he added. ``We're thankful to
be here at last.''

Brazil's Vasco meets Ecuador's Barcelona de Guaiaquil in

Libertadores Cup final
 &UR; By ALEX DUFF &QC;

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Reigning national champions Vasco
da Gama will play their first Libertadores Cup final against
Ecuador's Barcelona de Guayaquil on Wednesday night.
	   The game will be a chance for both teams to swing around their
lagging fortunes.
	   Neither of the two teams has ever won the Latin American title
and both have suffered through unimpressive starts in their
respective national championships.
	   After a number of key players were injured out, Vasco lags in
tenth place after four games, despite thrashing Atletico Minas
Gerais 5-1 last Wednesday.
	   The club also suffered a disappointment when after failing to
bring Brazilian international striker Edmundo back from an unhappy
stay at Fiorentina, Italy where he is bound to a contract. It was
hoped he would start the season back in Brazil.
	   Barcelona of Guayaquil, which disputed the Libertadores Cup
final only to lose in 1990, has performed badly in a national
tournament, endangering their chance to qualify for next year's
Libertadores Cup even as they compete for this year's final.
	   And star player, Anthony de Avila, has not turned up for
training with the club after a wage dispute.
	   Vasco, on the other hand, is just getting back to full strength
with goalkeeper Carlos Germano and midfielder Ramon, back training
this week after injury.
	   Coach Antonio Lopes said the young team, captained by veteran
Mauro Galvao, 37, would play cautiously.
	   ``We will have our feet firmly on the ground. Barcelona is a
team we will treat with respect,'' he told reporters.
	   Managed by Argentinian Ruben Dario Insua, Barcelona is hoping to
field their strongest team, including striker Agustin Delgado, even
though he has signed with Mexico's Cruz Azul.
	   The return leg of the tie will be played in Ecuador on August
12.
	   Probable lineups:
	   Vasco: Carlos Germano, Vagner, Mauro Galvao, Odvan, Felipe,
Luisinho, Nasa, Juninho, Pedrinho, Donizete and Luizao.
	   Barcelona: Luis Gomez, Jimmy Montanero, Hilger Quisnez, Luis
Capurro, Fricson George, Anthony de Avila, Marcelo Morales,
Washington Aires, Nicol Asencio, Augustin Delgado, Julio Rosero.

South Africa to investigate Lesotho election fraud
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ A committee sponsored by South
Africa will investigate allegations of election fraud in Lesotho, a
tiny mountain kingdom surrounded by South Africa.
	   Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo said Tuesday that Lesotho's Prime
Minister Pakalitha Mosisili and his ruling Lesotho Congress for
Democracy Party have agreed to step down if the committee finds
that May's elections were seriously flawed.
	   Nzo said the committee hoped to produce a report within two
weeks and would consult with Botswana and Zimbabwe as ``guarantors
of Lesotho's democracy.''
	   Nzo and Deputy President Thabo Mbeki tried to mediate the
dispute in Lesotho on Monday while demonstrators were injured in
the streets of the capital, Maseru.
	   The dispute centers on May's elections, when the Lesotho
Congress for Democracy won all but one of the Parliamentary seats.
Three main opposition parties failed in their attempt to get the
courts to postpone the elections after they claimed irregularities
in voter registration.
	   The main opposition group, the Basotho National Party, won all
parliamentary seats in the 1993 election. It ruled until last year,
when former Prime Minister Ntsu Mokhehle broke away and formed the
LCD, taking most members of Parliament with him.
	   ``Both parties -- the government and opposition parties --
undertook to respect the result of those investigations,'' Nzo
said.
	   Lesotho's tiny mountain kingdom of 2 million has long been
plagued by political upheaval that has seen power pass back and
forth between military and elected governments, and the royal
family take opposite sides in the struggles.

Dockers strike leaves bananas to rot and shops short of food
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GUY REGISTE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   POINTE-A-PITRE, Guadeloupe (AP) _ Bananas are rotting and
shopkeepers running out of food on the 15th day Tuesday of a strike
by dock workers at the main port of Guadeloupe, a French Caribbean
island dependent on imports.
	   The union of business owners warned Tuesday that shopkeepers had
only a week's supply of perishable goods and two week's worth of
non-perishable goods.
	   By next Monday, there could be no more milk on the island, which
produces little more than sugar and bananas, they warned.
	   The nearly 100 dock workers at Jarry, the principle port,
stopped working July 28 to make several demands including one that
would affect pay scales, that is the years of seniority apportioned
when they won a 1995 decision to be paid as monthly salaried
workers instead of daily.
	   Dock workers currently gross between 12,000 and 37,640 francs
(about dlrs 2,000 and 6,380) a month.
	   Last week, the two banana producers' associations announced that
160 tons of bananas worth 7 million francs (dlrs 1.1 million) had
rotted at the dock.
	   Ships laden with produce and other goods, most coming from
continental France, have been rerouted to nearby Martinique and
other islands.
	   This week, authorities tried to use Guadeloupe's second port at
Basse-Terre, where dockers are not striking. But loading and
unloading there has proved a tedious task since the port does not
have the machinery to deal with containers.

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ A complete facelift may be what is
needed to save the sport of cycling, racers told the International
Cycling Union Tuesday at a doping crisis meeting.
	   Cycling's world governing body invited some of the sport's elite
_ including the retired five-time Tour de France champion Miguel
Indurain, Olympic champion Pascal Richard, former-world champion
Luc Leblanc and current world No. 1 Laurent Jalabert _ to discuss
the sport's future in the wake of the drug-hit Tour de France last
month.
	   ``We are basically here to discuss the problem of doping
following the catastrophy at the Tour de France,'' said Leblanc.
``We've been fighting doping for a long time and this year it
exploded. But it's a blessing in disguise. It got things moving. It
will be good for our future.''
	   Scrambling to come to grips with the sport's growing drug
crisis, UCI opened the series of meeting with the cycling's top
officials last Thursday in Paris.
	   The sport's ongoing drug-scandal was aggravated on Tuesday
following reports that four Italian racers were kicked out of the
Tour of Portugal after testing positive.
	   While no absolute decisions were taken, cyclists and UCI
officials were confident the tarnished image of the sport could be
salvaged _ along with the health of the racers.
	   An over-haul of the season's gruelling schedule along with the
long-disputed regular medical check-ups were at the top of the
agenda.
	   ``It isn't only a problem of doping,''said French cyclist
Jalabert, who, along with the entire ONCE team, quit the Tour de
France before the start of the 17th stage, protesting police
investigations. ``It's a lot of other things.
	   ``The length of the races; maybe the bigger tours are too long,
too difficult,'' Jalabert suggested. ``Maybe the season is too
long, too complicated. Maybe we have to review the entire system to
avoid inciting certain racers to resort to doping.''
	   UCI officials admitted the loaded calendar will need to be
re-examined.
	   ``The cyclists told us about their lives as racers,'' said UCI
president Hein Verbruggen, after the all-day meeting held at
Lausanne's lakeside Olympic Museum. ``The difficulties and the
weight of the race circuit.
	   ``We must now launch a scientific study to see if the races and
their requirements are too demanding.''
	   Optimistic, Leblanc promised ``things will be shaken up on the
calendar,'' and likely in time for next season.
	   Frequent and regular medical check-ups, long-contested by the
racers, now seem readily accepted by all.
	   ``The cyclists understand it better now than when we suggested
it at the Tour de France,'' said UCI Vice-president Daniel Baal.
``Now that we've properly explained it to them we all agree on the
principle of medical follow-ups. We know we cannot guarantee there
will be no cheaters, but we can guarantee the health of the
riders.''
	   In the end, the racers appeared to agree.
	   ``The current tests are quite good but there are certain
lacks,'' said Leblanc. ``This is where the check-ups come in, four
times a year, to allow us to be more vigilent.''
	   Though the meeting did not touch upon possible punishment or
amnesty with regards to racers kicked out of the Tour de France,
the topic of sanctions briefly came up.
	   ``We talked a little about the toughness of certain sanctions,''
said Leblanc. ``Certain sanctions are too tough for certain
products. For instance, you can't have the same sanctions for
anabolic steroids as for cafeines.''
	   Festina riders, including Armin Meier, Alex Zuelle and Laurent
Dufaux, remain free to compete, despite confessions they
systematically used banned substances and were kicked out of the
Tour de France.
	   The UCI will meet with race representatives on Wednesday and is
expected to provide details of the meetings and announce new
strategies to combat doping on Thursday.
	   The sport's growing drug crisis has sparked other emergency
meetings. The International Olympic Committee has scheduled a
doping conference for January and will gather on August 20 to
prepare for the meeting.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The German journalist who reported
he had seen alleged mass graves in Kosovo has been declared persona
non grata in Yugoslavia, a top government official said Tuesday.
	   Erich Rathfelder reported from Serbia's southern Kosovo province
for Germany's Tageszeitung (TAZ) and the Austrian daily Die Presse.
In a recent article, written after Serb forces took control of the
Kosovo town of Orahovac, Rathfelder cited a witness as saying
hundreds of ethnic Albanians had been buried in a mass grave near
the town.
	   A European Union observer team later visited the area and said
there was no evidence of the existence of mass graves.
	   Radmila Visic, deputy information minister in the Serbian
government, said that Rathfelder will no longer be allowed into
Yugoslavia. Visic said that the government had lodged a protest
with the Tageszeitung and Rathfelder about the article, the Beta
news agency reported.
	   The Serb government and independence-seeking ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo have been fighting for control of the province for five
months.

Gallardo to stay with River Plate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ For now, Marcelo Gallardo, one of
the top players in Argentina's first division, will continue with
his River Plate club team.
	   Gallardo's representative, Antonio Caliendo, recently travelled
to Europe to discuss offers for the gifted midfielder from several
European clubs, including Newcastle and Arsenal of England and
Paris Saint Germain of France.
	   ``Gallardo remains, there are no offers,'' Cesar Traversone, one
of River Plate's directors, told the Buenos Aires sports daily Ole.
	   River Plate, one of South America's most successful teams over
the past year, is seeking dlrs 12 million dollars in transfer fees
for Gallardo, one of the highest-paid players in the Argentine
league.
	   With the European leagues soon getting underway, it appears his
possible transfer will have to wait until the end of the year.

Rebels are outgunned but vow to fight on for independence

<TEXT>
	   IN THE CICAVICA REGION, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The ethnic Albanian
rebels sit cross-legged on floor cushions, smoking cigarettes and
sipping Turkish coffee, rifles at their sides. The mood is relaxed,
until the radio crackles: It's news from another outpost.
	   The rebels get tense. Some jump up and leave the room, off to
guard positions in a war that hasn't been going so well lately for
the Kosovo Liberation Army. A recent pummeling by Serb forces left
KLA headquarter villages in charred ruins, driving rebels into
isolated pockets like this one, surrounded by Serbs in the Cicavica
region.
	   Communication with other KLA units is tough. And KLA rifles
can't begin to compete with the Serb arsenal of tanks and
artillery. But the rebels insist their fight for independence is
not over.
	   ``We'll fight to the death,'' a black-clad KLA fighter named
Hamet says, echoing a statement Tuesday from the KLA's mysterious
leadership.
	   The Serb offensive ``has only strengthened our resolve to
bravely continue on the road to freedom,'' the statement said. It
also called on ethnic Albanians, who in Kosovo's population of 2
million outnumber Serbs 9-to-1, to ``unite with the KLA and help us
in our just freedom fight.''
	   On orders to crush the KLA, Serb forces in the past two weeks
went on a burning rampage through villages in the Drenica region, a
traditional stronghold of ethnic Albanian resistance. Tens of
thousands of civilians fled, to live with relatives or to camp in
hills and forests with no water and little food.
	   A Western diplomat last week called the burned villages a
``typical Balkan war tactic'' designed to punish civilians for
supporting the rebels and to dampen their enthusiasm. The diplomat
wagered that sometimes the tactic backfires _ and it apparently
has.
	   Under a blistering sun, refugees camped by a stream in a Drenica
valley showed nothing but loyalty to the rebels, angrily dismissing
suggestions that the KLA had been too weak to defend their
villages.
	   Like a refrain, refugees said they supported the KLA because
``we are all KLA, we are all the same people,'' joined in a quest
for independence from Serbia, that makes up most of Yugoslavia.
They expressed disgust at U.S. and European diplomats working to
arrange peace negotiations with the goal of autonomy for Kosovo
instead of independence.
	   Kosovo Albanians had autonomy for about 15 years until 1989,
when Slobodan Milosevic, then president of Serbia.
	   ``Autonomy is meaningless,'' said Ramadan Balija, 25, a refugee
from Drenica. ``After all these massacres, they could just take
autonomy away again.''
	   The autonomy issue raises a slight contradiction in the KLA's
fatalistic rally cry to fight to the death.
	   In principle, the KLA has agreed to join ethnic Albanian
politicians in what they call a ``government'' for Kosovo. The KLA
would control the armed forces, holding posts more or less
equivalent to defense and police ministries. From this
``government,'' U.S. diplomats expect the ethnic Albanians to form
a team for negotiations with the Serbs. And independence is not an
option.
	   So if at least some of the rebels are willing to accept
autonomy, why are they continuing their fight for independence? It
is just one more unanswered question about the KLA _ a group with a
so-called spokesman who rarely speaks, a money man who lives in
Switzerland, and a menagerie of commanders with nicknames such as
the Lion, the Tiger, the Snake and the Sultan.
	   Two schools of thought exist in the KLA, one of which believes
the struggle is not just for Kosovo but for the ultimate goal of
including parts of Macedonia and Yugoslavia's other republic,
Montenegro, in a ``Greater Albania.''
	   Rebels in the dirt hills of the Cicavica region, who asked that
their village not be identified, represent the ``moderate'' voice
that looks forward to joining the ``government'' and allies itself
with pacifist ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova.
	   ``We're just simple soldiers, and we'll respect what is best for
the state,'' the 35-year-old rebel unit leader said Tuesday. He
gave only a first name, Shpetim, and wore camouflage pants and a
gray Adidas t-shirt.
	   Gathered at Shpetim's headquarters, a brick house owned by a
Serb family driven from the village, rebel fighters claimed that
new shipments of guns were coming into KLA hands every day.
	   ``We have weapons, not like the Serbs, but enough to fight,''
the rebel leader said.
	   The KLA statement warned NATO not to deploy troops on the
Albanian-Serbian border _ the main route of arms supply for the KLA
_ ``because we would consider this the second offensive against our
freedom and our national pride.''

Rios breaks with coach Stefanski
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Marcelo Rios, who this week regained the
number one spot in the ATP world ranking, has broken with his
American coach Larry Stefanski for the second time in three years,
his father said.
	   ``For strictly personal reasons Marcelo has ended his
professional relationship with Larry Stefanski,'' Jorge Rios told
Santiago TV Channel 13.
	   Stefanski had resumed coaching Rios last year, after the two had
also broken their professional relationship three years earlier.
	   The 22-year-old Chilean tennis ace has not announced the name of
a new coach and is working with his trainer Manuel Astorga, Rios'
father said.

Nigerian leader defies trail of broken promises

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria's new military leader on Tuesday
vowed to break a pattern of broken promises by dictators who backed
down from allowing a democratic transition to civilian rule in this
sprawling West African country.
	   Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar said he would not budge from his
timetable to hand over power to an elected government by the end of
May next year.
	   ``Time is not on our side,'' Abubakar said. ``To this
administration, the 29th of May is a sacrosanct hand-over date ...
It is a great national responsibility.''
	   Also Tuesday, the career military general swore in a new
electoral commission and abolished several decrees used by his
predecessor, the late dictator Gen. Sani Abacha, to prevent labor
unions from operating freely in the oil-rich country.
	   Abubakar has drawn cautious applause from critics since
releasing political prisoners and announcing his democratic
transition plan last month. He took over in early June shortly
after Abacha died of an apparent heart attack.
	   Nigeria is a country where people are accustomed to military
rulers breaking their promises of democratic change.
	   In the 38 years since Nigeria's independence from Britain, only
10 years have been marked by civilian rule. Abacha, who was widely
condemned for human rights abuses, had promised to step aside in
favor of a civilian but was instead was believed to be maneuvering
himself as the sole candidate in presidential elections before he
died.
	   An earlier military leader, Maj. Gen. Ibrahim Babangida who
ruled Nigeria from 1985 to '93, made several promises of democracy
without fulfilling them.
	   During a ceremony in the capital, Abubakar implored the new
14-member electoral commission appointed to oversee national
election early next year to work ``extremely hard'' to ensure a
free and fair poll.
	   Democracy is the ``greatest expectation of our people today,''
Abubakar added.
	   The man who is leading the electoral body, former judge Ephraim
Akpata, said he would resign if the government meddled in the
commission's affairs.
	   ``If I disagree with the government on fundamental issues, I
will have to resign if I can't have my way when I know I'm right,''
the 71-year-old Akpata said.
	   One of the first tasks of the electoral panel is to register new
political parties in this ethnically-divided West African country
of more than 100 million people.
	   Already, at least two opposition coalition groups have said
they're ready to contest the elections.

In a recent article, written after Serb forces took control of the
Kosovo town of Orahovac, Rathfelder cited a witness as saying
hundreds of ethnic Albanians had been buried in a mass grave near
the town.
	   A European Union observer team later visited the area and said
there was no evidence of the existence of mass graves.
	   Radmila Visic, deputy information minister in the Serbian
government, said that Rathfelder will no longer be allowed into
Yugoslavia. Visic said that the government had lodged a protest
with the Tageszeitung and Rathfelder about the article, the Beta
news agency reported.
	   The Serb government and independence-seeking ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo have been fighting for control of the province for five
months.

Rebel commander says 60,000 fighters closing in on Kinshasa
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ A Congolese rebel commander said Tuesday his
60,000 troops were closing in on Kinshasa in a nationwide rebellion
to topple embattled President Laurent Kabila.
	   ``Our strategy is that our friends are everywhere. It's a war
that concerns everyone,'' commander Jean-Pierre Ondekane said in
Goma, a town in eastern Congo on the north end of Lake Kivu. ``We
don't want an atrocious war. We want to end this soon.''
	   Amid a flurry of propaganda launched against its opponents,
Kabila's government boasted it was retaking territory lost earlier
to the rebels and had deployed new forces to the east and west of
the capital of Kinshasa.
	   But the rebels did not speak of losses.
	   On the western end of this vast country, Ondekane said, 19
battalions of rebel troops had cut the oil pipeline at the Atlantic
seaside town of Muanda that supplies the capital of Kinshasa and
had advanced to the outskirts of the major Congo River port of
Matadi, 280 kilometers (173 miles) southwest of the capital.
	   The reported advances came amid government claims of making
inroads in both in the far west and east. Government troops had
retaken the city of Bukavu, south of Goma on Lake Kivu, and a
nearby airport while other loyalists were fighting for the town of
Boma, about 60 kilometers (40 miles) inland from Muanda, officials
in Kinshasa said.
	   Interior Minister Gaetan Kakudji backed down from an earlier
government claim that loyalists had recaptured Boma, about 60
kilometers (40 miles) inland from Muanda.
	   Ondekane denied that Bukavu had been recaptured.
	   He said rebel aircraft were supporting forces on the ground at
Kitona airbase just outside Muanda and in the north central town of
Kisangani, 840 kilometers (520 miles) northeast of Kinshasa on the
Congo River where he said his units were in control of a large
airport on the outskirts of the city.
	   ``The military situation is going well. We've covered much
distance,'' he said. ''I don't know anyone who can counter the
offensive from the people who are extremely aggressive.''
	   It was not possible to obtain independent confirmation of the
claims by both sides, who appear to be using the media to further
their positions.
	   ``I've taken in soldiers who had not been paid for eight months.
I clothed them, I armed them, and they are heading toward
Kinshasa,'' Ondekane said without elaborating.
	   Ondekane, a French-speaking commander from Equatoria Province _
home of Mobutu Sese Seko _ served in the armed forces under the
long-time dictator until he was toppled in May 1997 by rebels
fighting under Kabila.
	   In contrast to November 1996, when fighting for Goma between
Mobutu's forces and the rebels was heavy and looting widespread,
today, shops in the sprawling town are well-stocked and banks are
open.
	   Life under the new military administration appeared to be near
normal. Residents said no shots had been fired, and the change of
power had been peaceful.
	   Residents go about their daily lives, and police direct traffic
at major roundabouts, but the border with neighboring Rwanda
remains officially closed.
	   Congolese leaders accuse Rwanda and Uganda _ Kabila's erstwhile
allies _ of sending troops and tanks to help the rebels.
	   Rwanda, Uganda and the rebels all deny the claim and say it was
Congolese ethnic Tutsis _ with close ties to Rwanda _ who were
participating in the fighting.
	   Ondekane said the rebels represent a cross-section of Congo's
estimated 47 million people, including ethnic groups in Equatoria,
Katanga and Kasai regions.
	   In their villa-turned-army headquarters on the shore of Lake
Kivu, rebel commanders identified themselves as former officers in
the Congolese military who were fed up with Kabila's misuse of
power, corruption and mismanagement.
	   The rebellion erupted 10 days ago when Congo announced it was
expelling Rwandan officers and soldiers who had trained and managed
the new army.
	   Kabila's relations with Rwanda and Uganda had been gradually
deteriorating, particularly because of his failure to control
Congo's vast eastern border region from where opponents attack both
countries.
	   ``We don't want Mobutu III and Mobutu IV,'' Ondekane said.
``We're looking first to unite. Then, the politicians will decide
what comes next.''
	   He ruled out negotiations with Kabila.
	   ``We no longer want somebody who declares himself a president,''
he said. ``This is a movement of the children of this country. We
no longer want a dictatorship. We chased out Mobutu. We don't want
somebody who will just continue where Mobutu left off.''

Dutch Antilles shuts out El Salvad22or in Central American Games

<TEXT>
	   MARACAIBO, Venezuela (AP) _ The Dutch Antilles female softball
team shut out El Salvador 12-0 Tuesday during the Central American
and Caribbean Games in Maracaibo, Venezuela.
	   The Salvadorans lost by default after five innings without a
run. It was the third shut-out El Salvador has suffered during the
games.
	   The Dutch Antilles' Sherry Howell batted two home runs, and
pitchers Rozelin Kimburn and Solange Van Gurp allowed only two
hits.
	   El Salvador managed to fill the bases in the fourth inning with
a single from Milagros Cercamo off Kimburn, but the team failed to
bat them in.
	   The Dutch Antilles stands 2-1 in the competition.

Market turmoil: stocks slide around world on Asia jitters
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Wall Street close, stocks also down in Argentina,
Brazil. &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Worries about Asia's economic crisis sent stocks
tumbling on exchanges across the world on Tuesday.
	   From Tokyo to Frankfurt, from Brazil to Paris, equity markets
were slumping. Perhaps the most dramatic action took place in
Russia, where trading was suspended for a time and stocks were
nearly 10 percent below Monday's levels.
	   Concerns about impact of a sliding yen drove Hong Kong's stocks
down 3.6 percent. European stocks slid further on Tuesday, after
Wall Street opened sharply lower.
	   In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 112.00 points
_ or 1.3 percent _ at 8,462.85.
	   Russian stocks plummeted again in panic selling Tuesday, amid
fears that the Russian government is too broke to cope with another
emerging market selloff.
	   The Russian Trading System Index sank 9.1 percent in all, to
close at 109.9 points, down from 120.91 points Monday.
	   Trading was suspended for 45 minutes late in the session, when
losses exceeded those allowed under trading rules. After trading
reopened there was a slight rebound, but traders did not expect
much more of a climb.
	   Hong Kong stocks closed at a five-year low. The blue-chip Hang
Seng Index fell 3.6 percent, or 254.67 points, to 6779.95, its
lowest level since July 23, 1995.
	   The Hong Kong market's plunge was blamed on the weakening yen
and the fear that a weaker yen will force China to devalue the
yuan, which in turn will crush the Hong Kong dollar's peg to the
U.S. dollar, analysts said.
	   But these fears aren't new, said Vincent Cheung, a trader at
Sassoon Securities.
	   ``Bad news is just haunting the Hong Kong market in general,''
he said.
	   London's FTSE 100, which was given a boost in mid-afternoon
trade from the proposed merger of British Petroleum and Amoco Corp,
closed Tuesday's session at a low level not seen since late January
as a fall in U.S. stocks sent the index into free-fall.
	   The FTSE 100 closed Tuesday's session down 154.8 points, or 2.8
percent, at 5432.8 points. The index had earlier touched a low of
5403.3 points.
	   The French stock market also tumbled, as local investors got
caught in the mood of panic that swept other European exchanges.
The CAC 40 dropped 93.47 points Tuesday, or 2.4 percent, to close
at 3845.98 points. That is only 28 percent higher than at the
beginning of the year compared with 47 percent higher 3 1/2 weeks
ago when it topped out at a record 4,404.94 points.
	   In Germany, Frankfurt's DAX index fell 3.3 percent.
	   In Latin America, Argentina's blue chip stock index tumbled 4.35
percent, shuddering on more bad news from Japan and the
triple-digit tailspin by the Dow industrials.
	   In Brazil, the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange's Bovespa Index ended
the day 381 points _ or 4.1 percent lower.

UEFA Cup: Osijek wins 3-1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSIJEK, Croatia (AP) _ Osijek posted a surprising 3-1 victory
over favorite Anderlecht in the first leg of a UEFA Cup
second-round qualifying match Tuesday.
	   Petar Krpan opened the scoring for the Croats in the 29th minute
and youngster Mario Prisc increased the lead in the 54th.
	   Jurica Vranjes notched the third in the 81st minute, dousing
what seemed to be a Belgian attempt at a comeback only a minute
earlier.
	   Anderlecht started cautiously, hoping to catch the home side on
the break. However, the tactic backfired, allowing Osijek room to
maneuver and mount effective attacks.
	   Krpan found the back of the net with a precise lob from the box,
while Prisc bolted through a bogged down defense on the right to
score.
	   Per Zeterberg tried to pull the visitor's back on track when he
connected powerfully with a long distance drive in the 80th minute.
	   But a boisterous home crowd carried Osijek and Vranjes put the
winner past goalie Filip De Wilde on a quick counter attack.

Roma coach questioned by Olympic Committee officials
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italian Olympic Committee officials on Tuesday
questioned the coach of AS Roma about his allegations that a number
of top league Italian soccer players may use performance-enhancing
drugs.
	   The officials summoned Zemen following his remarks last week to
the newsweekly Espresso in which he said he was amazed by the quick
muscular development of players including Alessandro Del Piero and
Gianluca Vialli.
	   Zeman, a Czech, did not refer specifically to doping substances,
but said the players used ``medicines.'' The Olympic Committee's
doping experts, who met with Zemen for two hours, want him to back
up his claims.
	   The head of Juventus' medical team, Riccardo Agricola, denied
administering steriods or other banned substances to his players
and said he doubted other teams used them.
	   ``To use steriods would be counter productive in soccer,'' said
Agricola. ``They could cause muscle problems and threaten the
athletes' health.''
	   The Turin club and Del Piero, its star player, have said they
would sue Zemen for libel.
	   Vialli, a former player of Juventus and currently Chelsea's
player-coach in the English Premier League, called Zeman a
``terrorist trying to destabilize the soccer world.''
	   Turin prosecutor Raffaele Guariniello, who has been
investigating doping in sports and other health-related issues for
several years, also wants to question Zemen. The meeting is
expected to take place Wednesday morning in Turin.
	   Italian news reports said the prosecutor has also summoned Del
Piero and Vialli.
	   Italy's first division soccer league, known as the serie A,
kicks off in mid-September.

 &UR; Pentagon: Americans at Turkish base using field kitchens due to
strike &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with spokesman's comments, adds byline &QL; 
 &UR; By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Military Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Many of the 5,300 Americans at Incirlik Air
Base in Turkey are being fed from emergency field kitchens because
of a three-week-old strike by local workers, a Pentagon spokesman
said Tuesday.
	   The Americans also have been warned to travel off base only in
groups, Defense Department spokesman Kenneth Bacon added.
	   ``We're doing our best to protect the security and the safety of
the Americans on the air base. Second, we are doing our best to
keep them supplied,'' Bacon said, describing the effort as
``difficult.''
	   The strike, which began July 23, has shut down the commissary,
gas station, dining halls and other facilities at Incirlik.
Services at bases in Ankara and Izmir have also been interrupted.
	   Bacon said no decision has been made on whether American
dependents at the sites will be brought home. For a time, some of
the American residents at the base were living on cold military
rations known as Meals Ready to Eat or MREs, but, he said, ``my
understanding is that most, if not all, of the people should be
getting hot meals from field kitchens now.''
	   Of the 5,300 Americans on the base, 2,200 are military men and
women, Bacon said. It is the hub of operations for U.S. and British
patrol flights over the no-fly zone in northern Iraq.
	   Bacon said military officials were negotiating with the Turkish
labor unions over the strike by 1,400 Turkish workers and were
hopeful a settlement would be reached. He said many facilities at
the base have been shut down, including recreational centers, but
military operations ``have not suffered at all.''
	   The Turkish media have reported several confrontations between
U.S. soldiers and Turks, including physical and verbal attacks by
Americans at Incirlik, but the U.S. consulate in Adana, a few miles
from Incirlik, issued a denial.
	   ``All allegations of violent actions by U.S. servicemen at
Incirlik, such as assaults, have been thoroughly investigated, and
have proven to be unfounded,'' the consulate's statement said.
	   The strikers are demanding that salaries be raised every three
months in line with inflation, now running at around 70 percent a
year. They are also demanding improved benefits and compensation
for earlier pay cuts. Strikers rejected the latest U.S. offer last
week and negotiations have been deadlocked since then.
	   Asked about any altercations, Bacon said an American
noncommissioned officer ``was attacked in a parking lot outside a
store. ... He has filed charges with the Turkish police against the
people who attacked him.''

	   GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) _ Rod Wallace missed two chances before
scoring his first goal in European competition as Glasgow Rangers
beat PAOK Salonika in the UEFA Cup second round qualifying game at
Ibrox on Tuesday.
	   Rangers squandered chances in the first half but converted two
goals in the second period to beat the Greek side 2-0 in the first
leg of the qualifying series.
	   Wallace, who never scored a goal in European competition in six
seasons for previous club Leeds United, drove a 20-meter attempt
into goal in the 69th minute to give the Scottish League giant its
winning advantage.
	   He also played a role in Ranger's first goal when he found time
and space on the left flank to send a cross to Andrei Kanchelskis,
who headed the ball into goal in the 55th minute.
	   Danish referee Kim Milton Nielsen, who red-carded England
midfielder David Beckham at France 98, was in the thick of action
again at Ibrox on Tuesday.
	   He sent-off PAOK Salonika's Triantafilos Macheridis after just
eight minutes after yellow carding the Greek midfielder twice in
four minutes.

LaFontaine retires on doctor's advice
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOSH DUBOW &QC;

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Concussions finally got the best of Pat
LaFontaine, forcing one of the best U.S.-born players in National
Hockey League history to retire on Tuesday.
	   ``Every time you sustain a head injury, the risk gets higher and
higher,'' LaFontaine said a news conference. ``I always said that
if there ever was a point where the risk was more than minimal, I
would stop playing.''
	   That point came March 16, when the 33-year-old center sustained
his sixth concussion after being hit by teammate Mike Keane, ending
his only season with the New York Rangers.
	   Neurologist Dr. Jim Kelly told LaFontaine a few weeks ago that
he was at risk for more concussions and suggested he retire.
	   ``I think it would have been a very difficult decision if I had
to make it on my own,'' LaFontaine said. ``I feel fortunate that
Dr. Kelly made the decision for me. I'm thankful he decided I could
play last year and I wouldn't question his decision this year.''
	   After his latest concussion, LaFontaine went through a long
period of migraine headaches, fatigue, depression and sleepless
nights. Another concussion could have led to more serious symptoms
and a longer recovery period.
	   ``I applaud Pat LaFontaine's courage and wisdom for recognizing
that his brain is more important to his life than another MVP award
or record,'' Dr. Kelly said in a statement. ``As we see with Pat, a
concussion can end a career. It can destroy dreams and
aspirations.''
	   LaFontaine's career was almost ended a year earlier, after being
severely injured when he was checked by Pittsburgh's Francois
Leroux. LaFontaine played only 13 games in the 1996-97 season and
was urged to retire then by the Buffalo Sabres. He resisted and was
traded to the Rangers, collecting 23 goals and 39 assists in 67
games and finishing as the team's second-highest scorer.
	   LaFontaine played 15 seasons in the NHL with the New York
Islanders, the Sabres and the Rangers, finishing with 468 goals,
545 assists and 1,013 points. He also played on the 1984 and 1998
U.S. Olympic teams and the 1996 gold medal World Cup team.
	   LaFontaine finished his career second only to Joey Mullen in
goals by U.S.-born players. Mullen had 502 goals.
	   In the final year of a dlrs 21 million, five-year contract,
LaFontaine will receive the dlrs 4.8 million due him this season.
The Rangers will pay about dlrs 1.7 million of that, with insurance
picking up the rest.

	   IN THE CICAVICA REGION, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The ethnic Albanian
rebels sit cross-legged on floor cushions, smoking cigarettes and
sipping Turkish coffee, rifles at their sides. The radio crackles:
It's news from another outpost.
	   The rebels get tense. Some jump up and leave the room, off to
guard positions in a war that hasn't been going so well lately for
the Kosovo Liberation Army. A recent pummeling by Serb forces left
KLA headquarter villages in charred ruins, driving rebels into
isolated pockets like this one, surrounded by Serbs in the central
Cicavica region.
	   Communication with other KLA units is tough. And KLA rifles
can't begin to compete with the Serb arsenal of tanks and
artillery. But the rebels insist they'll keep fighting for
independence for Kosovo _ a province in southern Serbia, one of the
two republics that make up Yugoslavia.
	   ``We'll fight to the death,'' a black-clad KLA fighter named
Hamet says, echoing a statement Tuesday from the KLA's mysterious
leadership.
	   The Serb offensive ``has only strengthened our resolve to
bravely continue on the road to freedom,'' the statement said. It
also called on ethnic Albanians, who in Kosovo's population of 2
million outnumber Serbs 9-to-1, to ``unite with the KLA and help us
in our just freedom fight.''
	   On orders to crush the KLA, Serb forces in the past two weeks
went on a burning rampage through villages in the Drenica region, a
traditional stronghold of ethnic Albanian resistance. Tens of
thousands of civilians fled, to live with relatives or to camp in
hills and forests with no water and little food.
	   A Western diplomat last week called the burned villages a
``typical Balkan war tactic'' designed to punish civilians for
supporting the rebels and to dampen their enthusiasm. The diplomat
wagered that sometimes the tactic backfires _ and it apparently
has.
	   Under a blistering sun, refugees camped by a stream in a Drenica
valley showed nothing but loyalty to the rebels, angrily dismissing
suggestions that the KLA had been too weak to defend their
villages.
	   Like a refrain, refugees said they supported the KLA because
``we are all KLA, we are all the same people,'' joined in a quest
for independence from Serbia, that makes up most of Yugoslavia.
They expressed disgust at U.S. and European diplomats working to
arrange peace negotiations with the goal of autonomy for Kosovo
instead of independence.
	   Kosovo Albanians had autonomy for about 15 years until 1989,
when Slobodan Milosevic, then president of Serbia, revoked the
autonomy.
	   ``Autonomy is meaningless,'' said Ramadan Balija, 25, a refugee
from Drenica. ``After all these massacres, they could just take
autonomy away again.''
	   The autonomy issue raises a slight contradiction in the KLA's
fatalistic rally cry to fight to the death.
	   In principle, the KLA has agreed to join ethnic Albanian
politicians in what they call a ``government'' for Kosovo. The KLA
would control the armed forces, holding posts more or less
equivalent to defense and police ministries. From this
``government,'' U.S. diplomats expect the ethnic Albanians to form
a team for negotiations with the Serbs. And independence is not an
option.
	   So if at least some of the rebels are willing to accept
autonomy, why are they continuing their fight for independence? It
is just one more unanswered question about the KLA _ a group with a
so-called spokesman who rarely speaks, funded by Swiss bank
accounts, and led by a menagerie of commanders with nicknames such
as the Lion, the Tiger, the Snake and the Sultan.
	   Two schools of thought exist in the KLA, one of which believes
the struggle is not just for Kosovo but for the ultimate goal of
including parts of Macedonia and Yugoslavia's other republic,
Montenegro, in a ``Greater Albania.''
	   Rebels in the dirt hills of the Cicavica region, who asked that
their village not be identified, represent the ``moderate'' voice
that looks forward to joining the ``government'' and allies itself
with pacifist ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova.
	   ``We're just simple soldiers, and we'll respect what is best for
the state,'' the 35-year-old rebel unit leader said Tuesday. He
gave only a first name, Shpetim, and wore camouflage pants and a
gray t-shirt.
	   Gathered at Shpetim's headquarters, a brick house owned by a
Serb family driven from the village, rebel fighters claimed that
new shipments of guns were coming into KLA hands every day.
	   ``We have weapons, not like the Serbs, but enough to fight,''
the rebel leader said.
	   The KLA statement warned NATO not to deploy troops on the
Albanian-Serbian border _ the main route of arms supply for the KLA
_ ``because we would consider this the second offensive against our
freedom and our national pride.''

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ FBI agents used cotton swabs to collect
traces of explosives from the bombed-out wreckage at the U.S.
Embassy in Nairobi as search teams nearing the bottom of the rubble
hoped to find two survivors. Witnesses' accounts began to fill in
details of the attack.
	   The twin bombings Friday at the U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania claimed 234 lives and injured nearly 5,000. Investigators
suspect the powerful explosive Semtex was used in the attacks, but
no link has been found to any particular group, a senior U.S.
official in Washington said Tuesday on condition of anonymity.
	   In Tanzania, police working with the FBI arrested 14 more
people, including six Sudanese, six Iraqis, a Somali and a Turk.
Tanzania's ambassador to Washington, Mustafa Salim Nyang'anyi, said
some of those arrested ``may have had a hand'' in the attack. He
said they had been turned over to the FBI for interrogation.
	   Police had said Monday that 30 people have been arrested
altogether. It was not immediately clear if the 14 arrests
announced Tuesday were included in the 30. There have been no
confirmed arrests in Nairobi.
	   Meanwhile, a dozen FBI agents swept and raked Laibon Road
outside the wrecked embassy in Dar es Salaam, collecting and
sifting through debris in their search for evidence. The FBI said
more than 175 agents are either in or headed to the two African
nations.
	   In Nairobi, FBI agents in civilian clothes used cotton balls to
swab fences, walls and metal fragments at the bomb site to capture
traces of explosives. They worked behind a shroud of black fabric.
	   As the investigation heated up in both countries, cranes
bulldozers and rescue workers engaged in a frantic search for signs
of life at a collapsed building adjacent to the embassy in Nairobi.
	   Early Tuesday evening, the Israelis informed the Red Cross that
there might be two survivors, and medical teams were standing by,
said Red Cross spokeswoman Nina Galbe.
	   Israeli soldiers, the first professional search-and-rescue team
on the scene, had been spurred on by a woman named Rose who spoke
to Kenyan Red Cross workers on Sunday, and by a tapping noise heard
Monday morning.
	   But nothing had been heard from Rose for more than 48 hours. The
body of a woman named Rose was pulled from the rubble, but
authorities did not know if it was the same woman the Israelis had
been trying to reach.
	   ``I'm hoping that she's still alive,'' Rose's husband, Lawrence
Irungu, said at the bomb site. ``That's my prayers. ... I will stay
here until I see the end of the operation.''
	   No one has been pulled alive from the wreckage since Saturday.
And the mountain of twisted steel and concrete chunks is rapidly
diminishing.
	   ``We're hoping that there are still a couple of void areas that
may be big enough for a person to survive in,'' said Jim Chinn,
spokesman for the Fairfax, Va., search and rescue team.
	   ``However, the further we go down the more doubtful that it's
starting to look. We're getting to a point now where the debris is
more compact,'' he said. ``But we're still having hope.''
	   Kenyan Army Maj. Gen. George Agoi said he expects the search
teams to reach the bottom by late Wednesday or early Thursday.
	   Boy Scouts from all over Africa interrupted a jamboree to help
sweep debris from the streets. Red Cross volunteers gathered
eyeglasses, pens, torn ID papers and other personal items from the
wreckage to help identify the dead, said Galbe.
	   ``We will put everything in envelopes, labeled with where found
and when, so that at the end of the day we can piece as much of the
puzzle together as possible,'' she said.
	   In a rare show of solidarity, President Daniel arap Moi and
leaders of four opposition parties, visited the bomb site and
appealed to Kenyans to remain united.
	   The remains of a vehicle smashed against the embassy's back wall
and believed to have carried the bomb, was shrouded beneath a red
and white plastic sheet. A Marine stood guard, aiming his gun and
shouting warnings at journalists who considered taking photos.
	   Capt. Rhyl Jones, garrison engineer of the British Army in
Kenya, who was working at the bomb site, said nobody knows for sure
if the vehicle actually carried the bomb.
	   ``The vehicle that carried the bomb may be only a two-inch piece
of metal somewhere,'' he said.
	   Jones, a demolition expert who has investigated Irish Republican
Army bombings in Northern Ireland, said the bomb was professionally
made.
	   ``My opinion is that it was definitely a commercial explosive.
This wasn't a homemade device,'' he said.
	   The bomb left a 4-meter-diameter (13-foot-diameter) crater in
the rear of the embassy, Jones said. Kenyan Television on Tuesday
night quoted a source as saying an engine block had been found in
the crater.
	   Detection of the Czech-manufactured Semtex, which is far more
powerful than TNT, would support the theory that the nearly
simultaneous attacks were the work of a sophisticated terrorist
organization.
	   But the U.S. official, who spoke to The Associated Press on
condition of anonymity, said the culprits have not been identified.
	   News media have received claims of responsibility in the name of
the ``Islamic Army for the Liberation of Holy Shrines'' and the
``Army for the Liberation of Islamic Shrines.'' The claims could
not be confirmed and may have come from the same source.
	   The investigators were looking at a large number of people with
known terrorist connections and sympathies, among them Osama bin
Laden, a militant Saudi financier who once pledged to ``evict the
Americans from all Muslim land.''
	   The Cairo, Egypt-based Arab League on Tuesday condemned the
bombing, and the United Nations Security Council planned to
consider a similar resolution.
	   Immediately after the bomb, there was chaos at the bomb site in
the Kenyan capital as thousands of injured people sought help and
good Samaritans swarmed through the rubble looking for survivors.
As a result, U.S. investigators said, some evidence at the site was
compromised.
	   The bags of debris collected by the FBI were taken to a parking
lot where they were laid out in piles for further investigation.
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on Monday offered a dlrs 2
million reward for information leading to the capture of the
``cowards that committed this act.''
	   A Kenyan guard at the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi who told the East
African Standard that he witnessed the embassy attack, provided the
most detailed known account yet of the bombing.
	   Joash Okindo was quoted as saying he and his colleagues, armed
only with short wooden clubs, stopped five men in a truck at a
barrier to the embassy's front parking lot and forced them to turn
into the rear parking lot.
	   The attackers then jumped from the truck and opened fire with
automatic rifles, shooting a guard and then hurling a grenade into
the compound. At least one Marine returned fire. Moments later, the
truck exploded, Okindo told the paper.
	   ``We saved people's lives by sending it to the rear entrance,''
Okindo told the Standard. ``If we hadn't done that, I don't think I
would be alive and talking to you now.''
	   Okindo ``resisted heroically,'' U.S. State Department spokesman
James Foley said in Washington. His legs and left arm were almost
severed, according to the paper.
	   U.S. Embassy spokesman Chris Scharf said Tuesday that Okindo was
flown to Germany for treatment and was in Hamburg Hospital waiting
to be transferred to Landstuhl Army Hospital.
	   According to official Kenyan figures Tuesday night, 224 people
died in the Nairobi blast and 244 are still hospitalized, 7 in
critical condition. Among the victims are 12 Americans and 30
Kenyans who worked at the embassy.
	   Scharf said four Kenyan employees were still unaccounted for,
although no bodies are believed to be buried in the debris of the
embassy.
	   Ten Africans died in the Tanzanian attack and 74 were injured.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Sweden's Malmo provided the surprise of the UEFA
Cup second round qualifying Tuesday when it forced a 1-1 tie with
Croatian team Hadjuk Split.
	   Hadjuk eliminated Malmo in the same round last season and was
expected to dominate the Swedes in hot conditions at Split, but
failed to capitalize on its home ground advantage.
	   Defender Elvis Brajkovic put the Croats ahead on the stroke of
half-time with a header from close range.
	   The 1-0 half-time advantage could have been bigger but strikers
Mate Baturina and Jurica Vucko squandered chances in the goal
square.
	   Olagur Bjarnasson came off the bench to score the equalizer in
the 72nd minute, giving Malmo an advantage going into the second
leg match despite having defended for the majority of Tuesday's
match.
	   Osijek scored a shock 3-1 win over Belgian side Anderlecht in
the other match in Croatia.
	   Petar Krpan opened the scoring for the Croats in the 29th minute
while Mario Prisc increased the lead in the 54th.
	   Jurica Vranjes nailed in a third goal in the 81st minute,
dousing what seemed to be a Belgian attempt at a comeback only a
minute prior.
	   More than 45,000 Rangers fans saw the Glasgow soccer giant beat
Greek team PAOK Salonika 2-0 at Ibrox.
	   Former Leeds United midfielder Rod Wallace failed to convert two
chances in the first half but scored his first goal in European
competition in the 69th minute to seal Rangers' win.
	   He also played a key role in Rangers' first goal in the 55th
minute after beating the defense on the left flank and firing in a
cross to Andrei Kanchelskis, who headed the ball into goal.
	   Yugoslavia's Red Star Belgrade converted two penalties to beat
Russian side Rotor Volgograd 2-1 in front of 25,000 fans at
Belgrade.
	   Star striker Perica Ognjenovic clinched the victory by scoring
from the spot in injury time.
	   Red Star had taken the lead in the 60th minute on another
penalty, converted by Dalibor Skoric.
	   Six minutes later, Vitaly Abramov blasted in the equalizer with
a powerful shot from 30 meters.
	   The return leg of the second round qualifying series will be
held on Aug. 25.

	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ Police working with the FBI have
arrested 14 people in connection with the terrorist bombing of the
U.S. Embassy in Tanzania, police said Tuesday.
	   Six Sudanese, six Iraqis, one Somali and a Turk were arrested,
said police spokesman Aden Mwanunyange.
	   He said there was ``intelligence information that they may have
taken part in the incident.''
	   Police said on Monday that 30 people had been detained for
questioning in connection with the blast Friday in which 10 people
_ nine Tanzanians and one Kenyan _ died.
	   It was not clear whether the 14 came from the group of 30, nor
if any of the 30 had been released.
	   Home Affairs Minister Ali Ameir Mohamed, who oversees police
work, said no charges have been filed.
	   ``We cannot say we have got somebody who is really
responsible,'' Ameir told The Associated Press. ``We think we are
doing well,'' he added.
	   In neighboring Kenya, 224 people were killed in a simultaneous
bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi _ all but 12 of the dead
were Kenyans.
	   No arrests have been announced in the Nairobi bombing.
	   Tanzanian police and a team of FBI and counter-terrorism experts
who flew in from the United States were interrogating those
detained in Dar es Salaam, Ameir said.
	   A State Department security expert, who spoke on condition that
he not be further identified, said investigators cannot get inside
the damaged building yet because the walls must first be shored up.
	   ``Our first priority is safety. We're looking at the building in
terms of security concerns,'' he said. ``The second priority is
supporting the investigation of the FBI. It's a criminal
investigation, and they are treating it (the building) as a crime
scene.''
	   The official told reporters there were no video tapes of the
blast because the embassy's surveillance cameras did not record.
Rather, they were trained on different locations in synchronized
rotation, and the images appeared on a monitor.
	   It was not clear, he said, whether the picture on the monitor at
the moment of the blast was coming from the camera trained on that
area or whether the guard was actually watching the monitor or
doing something else.
	   All those killed were outside the embassy building and included
four security guards in a guard house.
	   He said a tanker truck that delivered water to the embassy was a
key element in the investigation. It is thought the bomb might have
been inside.
	   The security expert said the still undetermined number of people
who were inside the embassy at the time of the blast were
undoubtedly saved from death or severe injury by shatter-resistant
film on the windows.
	   Ameir said the FBI began investigating the Dar es Salaam bomb
site Tuesday after two days of studying the bodies and autopsy
reports of those killed.
	   Ameir said he didn't believe Tanzanians were responsible ``for
such a horrible thing,'' but did not rule out that locals may have
helped carry out the bombing.
	   Police have tightened security at the country's exit points in
case the bombers are in Tanzania and try to leave, he said.

Mexican stocks, peso plunge again
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ With investors jittery around the globe,
Mexico's stock market plunged for an eighth straight day on Tuesday
and the peso also fell to a record low despite central bank efforts
to bolster it.
	   The market's key IPC index was down 5.6 percent in late-morning
trade before rallying to close down 103.04 points, or 2.8 percent,
at 3628.45 points. It was the lowest close in peso terms since Jan.
13, 1997.
	   Volume was 1.09 billion pesos on 71.3 million shares traded.
	   ``The international environment continues to have a strong
weighing in the local market,'' said Francisco Rivero, head of
equity analysis at Valores Finamex brokerage in Mexico City. ``I
don't think that news coming from the domestic front would be able
to revert such trend.''
	   The central Bank of Mexico said Monday it would slightly
restrict liquidity and that helped push rates for Mexico's
bellwether 28-day Cetes bonds up 1.60 percentage points at
Tuesday's auction to 21.49 percent _ the highest level since March
19.
	   Mexico's average interbank interest rate rose 0.43 percentage
point to reach 23.63 percent.
	   But currency traders said nervous investors shrugged off local
rates and were moving assets to safer havens, such as U.S. Treasury
bonds, causing the Mexican currency to slide against the dollar.
	   Banking leader Banamex quoted the peso closing at a midrate of
9.192 per dollar, stronger from its open of 9.211 per dollar but
sharply weaker from its Monday close of 9.109. Spreads at the close
were 9.187-9.197.

<TEXT>
	   MBABANE, Swaziland (AP) _ U.S. embassies in Malaysia, Swaziland
and Uganda were shut down on Tuesday as security officials acted
cautiously in the face of threats reported after the bombings last
week in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   Patrick Kennedy, assistant secretary of state for management,
said ``maybe a half-dozen embassies'' around the world were closed
briefly in response to threats, but he did not specify the other
three.
	   In Swaziland, a tiny kingdom bordering South Africa, U.S.
Ambassador Alan MacKee said the apparently hoax bomb threat had to
be taken seriously.
	   The embassy was evacuated for several hours while sniffer dogs
searched the embassy and a nearby building housing embassy offices
and found nothing, a spokeswoman said.
	   In Uganda, which neighbors Kenya, the U.S. Embassy remained
closed in the capital of Kampala for a second day, and Ugandan and
U.S. security personnel were on high alert, a police spokesman
said.
	   Bob Ngobi said Parliamentary Road, where the U.S. mission is
located, has been closed to traffic for security reasons.
	   Radio stations broadcast requests from police to Kampala
residents to be on the alert and report any ``suspicious people.''
	   In Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, the U.S. Embassy closed its iron
gates for all but emergency services for American citizens, embassy
officials said.
	   Armed guards and patrol cars on 24-hour watch circled the U.S.
diplomatic compound. Guards, many armed with automatic weapons,
were stationed at a nearby gas station.
	   In Indonesia, next door to Malaysia, security was tightened at
the embassy in the capital, Jakarta, due partly to the recent
bombings, but also in expectation of possible violence around Aug.
17, Indonesia's independence day, embassy staff said.

Security Council fails to take action on Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Ed: UPDATES with Security Council statement, details &QL; 
 &UR; By RON KAMPEAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The international community's failure to
monitor the arms embargo against parties to the Kosovo conflict
scuttled an attempt Tuesday by the U.N. Security Council to get
tough with Yugoslavia.
	   Despite a strong statement Tuesday from Secretary-General Kofi
Annan _ condemning Yugoslavia's ``scorched-earth policy'' in the
Serbian province _ the Security Council statement broke no new
ground, reiterating calls for a ceasefire.
	   Its only concession to demands from at least three member
countries _ Britain, France and Slovenia, the council's current
president _ to announce action against Yugoslavia was to single out
Slobodan Milosevic's regime as using ``excessive force.''
	   In a report to the council, Annan said international agencies
had failed to make good on promises to monitor an arms embargo on
Kosovo.
	   Such an embargo would mostly affect separatist Albanians in
Kosovo, who are getting arms and troops smuggled across the
Albanian border.
	   Without the embargo, Russia _ one of the permanent veto-bearing
members of the council _ could not back a strong statement, deputy
Russian ambassador Yuriy Fedotov said.
	   ``We never even discussed a basic monitoring mechanism,'' he
said. Without that, he said, Russia was not ready to use its
closeness to Yugoslavia to demand Milosevic back down.
	   ``Preventing the flow of arms would help resolve the crisis,''
Fedotov told The Associated Press.
	   In his report, Annan noted that soon after the conflict between
Serbian authorities and ethnic Albanian separatists broke earlier
this year, he had recommended that organizations such as NATO and
the European Union set up a regime to monitor the arms embargo.
	   The organizations said they were willing to do so, he says, but
so far nothing has materialized.
	   ``The continuing infiltration from outside the borders of the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia of weapons and fighting men is a
source of continuing widespread concern,'' Annan's report says,
referring to the flow of Albanians into the province.
	   Annan said the influx of arms has eroded chances for compromise.
	   In another statement, Annan expressed his dismay with both
sides, but reserved his harshest language for Yugoslavia,
describing its actions in Kosovo as ``wanton destruction'' that
embody a ``scorched earth policy.''
	   He said the evolving refugee crisis could ``if unchecked, lead
to a large scale humanitarian disaster with the approaching
winter.''
	   The latest figures from the UNHCR, the U.N. refugee agency _
published Tuesday, after Annan released his report _ put the total
figure of refugees at around 240,000.
	   Serb forces have recently pushed the secessionists from most of
the strategic central region in the Serbian province, an offensive
that has killed hundreds.
	   Reports of violence against civilians have prompted some Western
nations to warn Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic of strong action
if he does order his forces to back down.
	   The Clinton administration has said that NATO has approved
contingency plans to use military action against Serb forces in
Kosovo.
	   Fedotov said that Russia sees Milosevic _ whatever his excesses
_ as at least being ready to negotiate.
	   ``There is still no other delegation,'' he said, referring to
failed Albanian efforts to agree on representatives.
	   Kosovo is a province in southern Serbia, where ethnic Albanians,
who demand independence, represent 90 percent of the population.
Serbia and the smaller republic of Montenegro make up what is left
of Yugoslavia.

`Bigger is Better' motto driving trans-Atlantic mergers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITS &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ What drives British Petroleum to buy Amoco,
British Telecom to hook up with AT-and-T, or steers Daimler toward
Chrysler?
	   Analysts looking to explain this year's tidal wave of
trans-Atlantic deals pointed Tuesday to factors ranging from the
advent of European monetary union to fear of being left behind in
an increasingly tough, global marketplace.
	   ``It's become a much more competitive environment,'' says Jeremy
Hawkins, chief economist for Europe at Bank of America in London.
``To survive in many ways you've simply got to be big.''
	   BP and Amoco echoed that view in announcing their dlrs 48
billion stock deal _ potentially the biggest industrial merger in
history.
	   ``We are uniting two excellent portfolios of assets and people
to create a group that will have the financial resources, scale and
global reach to compete effectively in the 21st century,'' their
statement said.
	   Amoco, based in Chicago, has been struggling recently to catch
up with other American oil companies that have moved away from the
maturing U.S. marketplace.
	   Because of the size of the U.S. economy, U.S. firms could grow
to become giants simply by focusing mainly on their domestic
market. That also gave them an edge in competing overseas, since
their local rivals were usually much smaller.
	   But with the strengthening of trading blocs like the European
Union, European firms especially have been expanding and
consolidating to a size where they can more easily take on the
American giants.
	   The planned Jan. 1 introduction of a single European currency in
11 countries has accelerated the trend _ and woken up many U.S.
companies to the new competition.
	   ``It's not possible any longer for the United States to remain
so inward looking,'' Hawkins said.
	   There's also savings to be derived from economies of scale.
	   In a conference call with analysts, BP and Amoco executives said
the merger of the two oil giants should save the combined company
dlrs 2 billion a year by the end of 2000.
	   BP deputy chief executive Rodney Chase said consolidation in the
oil industry is ``long overdue,'' and suggested this was but the
first merger among major oil companies.
	   Hawkins said he also expected the buying spree to continue for
several years.
	   ``For most players, dealing in everyday type goods and services,
it's simply the case you've got to be up there with the biggest in
order to survive,'' he said.

Streel wins first stage of Denmark race

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Casino rider Marc Streel of Belgium
won the first stage of the Denmark Stage Race followed by Dutch
Erik Dekker of Radobank.
	   The field was effectively divided in two already on this first
stage, leaving 68 riders with little chance of winning the stage
race. The first 33 riders arrived within one minute while the
remaining 68 riders lost almost 27 minutes to the winner. None of
the favorites were in the 68 group.
	   Streel crossed the finish line in Randers having spent 4 hours
21 minutes and 48 seconds on the 185-kilometer stage, which started
in Herning.
	   The field features star cyclist Russian Vjatjeslav Ekimov of US
Postal Service, Russian Piotr Ugrumov of Ballan, American George
Hincapie of U.S. Postal, Dane Bo Hamburger of Casino and Dane Rolf
Sorensen, Denmark's top cyclist.

	   Amparo Jimenez Pallares, 38, died early Tuesday after being shot
with a 9 mm pistol, said state police commander Col. Ciro Chitiva
Rincon and local reporters. She had just driven her son to school.
	   Jimenez was the fourth prominent human rights defender
assassinated this year and her killing, which had the hallmarks of
a professional hit, could be part of what some analysts consider an
ultra-rightist campaign to cripple government peace efforts.
	   As state director of the federal government's Peace Network for
the northern states of Guajira and Cesar, of which Valledupar is
the capital, Jimenez helped demobilized leftist rebels reenter
society.
	   She also publicly denounced human rights violations, criticizing
right-wing paramilitaries for displacing hundreds of peasants in
the region with a campaign aimed at alleged rebel sympathizers.
	   Jimenez had until this year worked as a reporter for several
national news programs.
	   ``Everyone is really shaken up in the press. She was very dear
and highly valued,'' said Carlos Alberto Atehortua, the Caracol
radio correspondent in Valledupar, 660 kilometers (400 miles) north
of Bogota.
	   Just a few days ago, Jimenez visited Atehortua's offices and
pasted stickers on the walls that designated them a ``Territory of
Peace.''
	   The Peace Network's national director, Ana Teresa Bernal, said
Jimenez may have been killed for her pro-peace activities by
paramilitary gunmen or rebels trying to discourage efforts by the
newly inaugurated president, Andres Pastrana, to end nearly four
decades of civil strife.
	   ``The logic of war dictates that when people are talking about
peace, combatants want to strengthen themselves of the battlefield.
The problem with this is that it affects unarmed civilians, and now
it has touched a woman who was the heard of the struggle for peace
in Cesar state,'' Bernal told the Radionet network.

	   MARACAIBO, Venezuela (AP) _ Trinidad and Tobago beat Barbados
1-0 Tuesday in the Group A soccer tournament of the Central
American and Caribbean Games in Maracaibo, Venezuela.
	   Trinidadian Jemmontt Kerwin knocked in the goal just before the
half.
	   The win balances Trinidad and Tobago's earlier loss to Nicaragua

Peru suspends talks until Ecuador withdraws troops
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Tension along the Peru-Ecuador frontier
increased Tuesday following Peru's announcement it will not renew
talks to end a border standoff until Ecuador withdraws the troops
that Peru charges are within its territory.
	   Foreign Minister Eduardo Ferrero made the announcement in
response to new Ecuadorean President Jamil Mahuad's inauguration
speech in Quito on Monday, in which he called on Peru's President
Alberto Fujimori to meet with him to reach a peace agreement.
	   ``Peru will not be able to restart the main dialogue until the
infiltrating troops withdraw from Peruvian territory,'' Ferrero
said Monday night.
	   In Quito, Ecuador's new armed forces chief, Gen. Patricio Nunez,
said Tuesday that his country will not remove the troops and called
Ferrero's comments ``regrettable.''
	   ``The Ecuadorean troops cannot withdraw because they have been
there for many years. It is a zone with an undefined border and it
is incorrect to say there was an infiltration,'' Nunez told a news
conference.
	   The area in question is on the upper eastern slopes of the
Cordillera del Condor mountain range. Peru has historically
considered the eastern slopes within its territory.
	   Earlier this year, representatives from the United States,
Argentina, Chile and Brazil _ who are trying to broker a deal to
end the conflict _ reportedly concluded that Peru was right in
saying the unmarked border should follow the spine of the mountain
range.
	   The latest flareup of the long-running dispute between the
Andean neighbors began last week when Peru charged that Ecuadorean
troops had entered its territory in a ``clear provocation.''
	   The countries have fought wars in 1941, 1981 and 1995 over their
disputed border. In the last two, fighting was over 49 miles (78
kms) of unmarked border in a remote stretch of mountainous jungle
560 miles (900 kilometers) north of Lima.
	   Fujimori charged that Peruvian and Ecuadorean troops met ``face
to face'' just inside Peruvian territory and canceled his trip to
Mahuad's inauguration to meet with his generals.
	   The standoff cast doubt on the future of internationally
brokered peace talks that had appeared near resolving the dispute.
	   Representatives of the mediating countries met in Quito on
Sunday to try to negotiate an end to the standoff, but failed.
	   Peru has rejected a plan to expand a demilitarized zone in the
region, saying it would infringe on its sovereignty. But it has
asked that neutral military observers monitor the area.
	   About 20 U.S. military observers are stationed in the
demilitarized area, where the two countries fought an undeclared
war in 1995.

Argentina to use cameras to monitor fans at football games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Argentina's government announced
on Tuesday a new initiative to curb increasing fan violence at its
first-division football matches.
	   Each of the top division soccer clubs must install a camera
system by the end of the year, said Miguel Angel Toma, Argentina's
Security Secretary.
	   ``The club that does not install them before the end of the year
will not be able to compete in the next championship,'' said Toma.
	   The monitoring system, developed by an Italian firm, will record
fan activity and its images will be stored in a digitalized
database.
	   In May, a judge suspended play in Argentina's top professional
league after a gruesome weekend of fan violence that included two
shootings.
	   Rowdy fans, called ``barrabravas'' here, are known for their
disruptive behavior that frequently involves rock-throwing,
fighting, and sometimes robbing fellow fans during the trip home
after games.

Synchronized diving adds new twist to national championships
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL NEWBERRY &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ The view is frightening enough from a 10-meter
tower when diving alone. Imagine what it's like to plunge into the
water below with a partner just inches away, matching your every
move.
	   Welcome to the burgeoning sport of synchronized diving, which
was featured Tuesday on the opening day of the 1998 National Diving
Championships.
	   ``The 10-meter tower is like Russian roulette as it is,'' said
Chris Mantilla of Boca Raton, Florida. ``Synchro is like Russian
roulette with two bullets in the chamber.''
	   Synchronized diving, recognized since 1995 and quickly becoming
popular with the fans, involves pairs taking off side by side from
either the 10-meter platform or from parallel 3-meter springboards.
They are judged on their individual technical skills and the
ability to coordinate their movements and enter the water together.
	   ``It's more of a distraction,'' said Bryan Gillooly of
Kississimee, Florida, Mantilla's partner in the 3-meter event.
``When you're doing 3 1/2 flips and someone is a couple of inches
away doing the same thing, it's hard not to see them. You really
have to focus on what you're doing.''
	   Synchronized diving is now recognized in most major
international events, including the world championships and the
recent Goodwill Games in New York. However, it hasn't been added to
the Olympic program.
	   ``Our eyes are set on individual goals,'' admitted Mantilla, who
will compete in all three individual and both synchronized events
in the national championships. ``They are more important to us
right now.''
	   ``We do most of our training alone,'' added Gillooly, the
defending national champion on the 1-meter springboard. ``We just
do synchro at the big meets.''
	   Gillooly and Mantilla were lured into synchronized competition
by their coach, Randy Ableman, who believes it is destined to
become a major force in the sport with wider exposure.
	   ``There's definitely a greater chance of smacking into
something,'' Mantilla said, grinning. ``Maybe that's why the crowds
like it so much.''
	   Todd Smith, executive director of U.S. Diving, said research has
shown synchronized diving is viewed by fans as more dangerous,
dramatic, artistic and entertaining than individual events.
	   ``Synchronized diving is the next aquatics events to probably be
approved for Olympic competition,'' Smith said. ``Hopefully, it'll
be in the Games at least by 2004, and at that point synchronized
diving will really take off.''
	   The national championships, which last until Sunday, are being
held at the Georgia Tech Aquatic Center, site of the Olympics two
years ago. The roofed, open-air facility held 14,600 during the
Games but has been downsized to 2,100 seats.
	   In this non-Olympic year, more than 125 divers were competing
for spots on U.S. national teams that compete in major
international events such as the World Cup.

Agassi keeps comeback rolling
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TERRY KINNEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MASON, Ohio (AP) _ A re-energized Andre Agassi, back in the top
10 for the first time since January 1997, kept his comeback rolling
Tuesday by beating Nicolas Kiefer of Germany in the dlrs 2.45
million ATP Championship.
	   Serving in game 12 of the second set and facing elimination,
Agassi won four straight points to force a tiebreaker after falling
behind 30-0, then dominated Kiefer and won 4-6, 7-6 (7-3), 6-2.
	   He seemed to play with more determination after breaking
Kiefer's serve in the ninth game of the second set with a stunning
cross-court shot that nipped the line.
	   ``I don't think you show up to any tournament and play your best
tennis in the first round,'' Agassi said. ``You've just got to get
through the days when you're not feeling the greatest.''
	   While he was slumping _ he was ranked No. 141 in November _ he
would not have survived a match like this, Agassi said.
	   ``Things like this used to be a quick exit for me,'' he said.
	   But with a new dedication to being No. 1 again has come a
renewed mental toughness.
	   ``It's nice to feel competitive again,'' said Agassi, who now is
No. 9. ``It's nice getting the `W' when you're not at your best.''
	   Kiefer, who is 25th in the ATP rankings, never had played Agassi
before. But he looks forward to a rmatch.
	   ``It was a good chance to beat him. I just didn't make it,''
Kiefer said. ``I played him very aggressive. I see that I can beat
him.''
	   Meanwhile, two of the tournament's seeded players lost.
	   Thomas Muster of Austria beat 11th-seeded Tim Henman of Britain
6-4, 7-5 and Wayne Ferreira of South Africa defeated 15th-seeded
Felix Mantilla of Spain 7-6 (7-5), 7-5.
	   In other matches, Andrei Medvedev of Ukraine beat Arnaud Clement
of France 6-4, 6-3; Jerome Golmard of France defeated countryman
Nicolas Escude 6-2, 6-7 (2-7), 6-3; Scott Draper of Australia
downed Nicolas Lapentti of Ecuador 6-4, 4-6, 7-5, and Mark
Philippoussis of Australia beat Byron Black of Zimbabwe 6-2, 6-3.
	   Also, 14th-seeded Goran Ivanisevic of Croatia beat Andrew Ilie
of Australia 6-4, 0-6, 6-4; Marco Ondruska of South Africa defeated
Steve Campbell 5-7, 6-2, 6-3; Michael Chang topped Todd Woodbridge
of Australia 6-1, 3-6, 6-2, and Martin Damm of the Czech Republic
beat Mark Woodforde of Australia 6-4, 3-6, 6-2.
	   The new No. 1, Marcelo Rios, had a night match Tuesday. Pete
Sampras, the defending champion and No. 1 seed, was idle until
Wednesday, when six of the top eight seeds play for the first time.

Young guns have one last chance at Sahalee
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   REDMOND, Washington (AP) _ So much for Generation X taking over
golf.
	   A year ago, the 20-something stars came to the PGA Championship
trying to make it a clean sweep of the major championships. They
arrived this week at Sahalee Country Club with one last chance to
steal one from the old guys.
	   ``These guys obviously have a lot of game,'' Tiger Woods said
Tuesday. ``They're working harder and harder. To win a major, you
need to get a few breaks. And more importantly, you've got to have
experience.''
	   Lately, the young guns' experience in the majors has been more
about despair than domination.
	   It's no longer Woods in a runaway in the Masters, but a
22-year-old who finally made a Sunday move in a major only to see
41-year-old Mark O'Meara win his second major of the year in the
British Open.
	   It's no longer Ernie Els winning his second U.S. Open at age 27,
but someone trying to cope with an ailing back and simply get into
contention again in a major.
	   Justin Leonard, who won the British Open and gave Davis Love III
all he could handle in the PGA Championship, hasn't been in serious
contention since March and was blown away by an 82 in the third
round at Royal Birkdale.
	   Make room for O'Meara, who played 56 majors as a pro without
winning but now is trying to become the first player since Ben
Hogan in 1953 to win three in one year.
	   Don't forget about nine-year veteran Lee Janzen, who proved by
winning his second U.S. Open title that he's one of the best
grinders when the conditions are tough.
	   ``I don't feel any additional pressure,'' said David Duval, a
five-time winner since October but trying to get his first major.
``It would put a nice asterisk on what already has been a good
year.''
	   Youth figures to be sorely tested at Sahalee, which will require
patience to realize there are birdies for the taking as long tee
shots are guided away from the towering trees lining every fairway.
	   ``With the trees being so large and so close to the fairway, you
immediately see the only shot you possibly can hit, and that's a
straight shot right down the middle,'' Janzen said.
	   ``I think the best way to prepare for this course would have
been to go to New York and maybe play down Fifth Avenue.''
	   Woods, whose inaccuracy off the tee cost him last year at Winged
Foot, may not even hit the driver this week.
	   The most strategic landing areas are 240 to 280 yards (218 to
255 meters) out, good enough for his 2-iron or, if he really feels
bold, his 3-wood.
	   ``Last year, I was guilty of being too rambunctious at times,''
he said.
	   And, last year, Woods was guilty of waking up seasoned pros and
making them raise their game to a higher level. It started when he
won three times in his first 14 tournaments as a pro, then won the
Masters by 12 strokes with a record 18-under 270.
	   ``Sometimes when you've been doing this for so long you get into
a rut. Sometimes you can use a kick-start,'' Woods said. ``New
blood tends to do that.''
	   The first wave of response came from his peers.
	   Els and Leonard won the next two majors. Duval closed out the
year by winning three straight tournaments, and Phil Mickelson
started 1998 by winning a duel with Woods in the Mercedes. Jim
Furyk seemed to finish in the top 10 every time he played.
	   That now seems like ancient history.
	   Not only have the majors been won by O'Meara and Janzen, a
player in his 20s hasn't won on the PGA Tour since Stuart Appleby
in the Kemper Open the first weekend in June.
	   ``I think Tiger Woods has probably influenced a lot of players
since he's come out on tour,'' said Janzen, who won his second U.S.
Open title at The Olympic Club.
	   ``He expects a lot out of himself and he also thinks he can do
just about anything,'' Janzen said. ``And I think this challenged
the rest of us to maybe start thinking a little higher and setting
higher goals.''

Holyfield returns to ring for hometown fight against unheralded

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Evander Holyfield says this one isn't about the
money.
	   Holyfield, who failed to line up a lucrative heavyweight
unification bout with Lennox Lewis, instead will settle for his
first hometown fight in seven years when he meets unheralded Vaughn
Bean at the Georgia Dome on Sept. 19.
	   The hastily arranged fight was promoted during a news conference
Tuesday featuring all the ludicrous hype _ Don King was the master
of ceremonies, after all _ and bad taste usually associated with a
heavyweight title fight.
	   Holyfield, holder of the IBF and WBA titles, pushed for a fight
in Atlanta when he couldn't come to terms with Lewis, the WBC
champion. In order to make the bout happen outside the casino belt,
Holyfield had to agree to take a substantial cut in his usual
purse.
	   Instead of commanding at least dlrs 10 million for a fight in
Las Vegas or Atlantic City, Holyfield agreed to base his purse on
ticket sales at the 40,000-seat Georgia Dome.
	   ``This thing is not about the money,'' Holyfield said. ``I know
I'm worth more than I'll be getting.''
	   His lawyer, Jim Thomas, would not disclose Holyfield's possible
purse, but said it would be less than dlrs 3 million even if ticket
sales are strong _ certainly no guarantee considering Atlanta's
checkered boxing history.
	   Muhammad Ali made his historic return to the ring in 1970 at the
City Auditorium, selling out the 5,000-seat arena for a bout
against Jerry Quarry. But two title fights in 1986, one featuring
Holyfield's cruiserweight bout against Dwight Muhammad Qawi, drew
poorly at the Omni.
	   Holyfield's last fight in Atlanta came in 1991 for his
heavyweight defense against Bert Cooper. A crowd of 12,996 was
announced, short of a sellout at the Omni and a gathering that
would appear downright sparse in the cavernous Georgia Dome.
	   ``The purse is going to be based largely on the gate,'' Thomas
said. ``It's going to be a sacrifice under the best of
circumstances. But how many nickels and dimes he makes are not
important.''
	   Holyfield said he plans to use the bout to give a firsthand
lesson to the underprivileged children in his hometown, showing
they can reach their goals with dedication and hard work. He called
on Atlanta's business community to purchase blocks of tickets _
King said half of the seats would be priced at dlrs 50 or less _
and distribute them to inner-city youngsters.
	   ``I've been fortunate enough to make a lot of money,'' said
Holyfield, who lives in a huge suburban estate. ``That's the reason
I can fight here. Hopefully, I can show the kids that it's not
where you're at but where you're going.''
	   Holyfield (35-3 with 25 knockouts) hasn't fought since a Nov. 8
knockout of Michael Moorer added the IBF belt to his collection of
titles. Holyfield was scheduled to fight June 6 at Madison Square
Garden, but the bout was canceled when opponent Henry Akinwande
tested positive for hepatitis.
	   Bean, rated the No. 1 contender by the IBF, has built up an
impressive record (31-1, 25 KOs) against a collection of mediocre
opponents. His lone loss came in a March 1997 title fight against
Moorer, who claimed a 12-round decision in a lackluster performance
by both fighters.
	   ``I want to tell the world that there's no fear here,'' said
Bean, who had a large red turban on his head and former heavyweight
champions Joe Frazier and Michael Spinks at his side. ``I respect
Mr. Holyfield for the champion he is and the things he's
accomplished. But I'm here to win.''
	   Nevertheless, Bean was largely a sideshow in Tuesday's news
conference and doesn't figure to get much attention leading up to
the bout, which will be televised by the Showtime network.
	   Holyfield, who will be a huge favorite, admitted that he's never
seen Bean in action and doesn't plan to watch tapes of his opponent
until a week or two before the bout.

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Jesus Sanchez scattered five hits in 6 1-3
shutout innings and Todd Dunwoody homered and drove in three runs
as the Florida Marlins built an eight-run lead and hung on to beat
the Los Angeles Dodgers 8-6 Tuesday.
	   Florida, which has the worst record in the majors at 43-76, had
17 hits, the most off the Dodgers this season. The Dodgers, who
scored five runs in the ninth, lost for the fifth time in seven
games.
	   Sanchez (6-6) struck out four and walked three. Darren Dreifort
(6-11) allowed five runs and 11 hits in five innings, striking out
eight.
 &UR; Giants 8, Cubs 7
	   In San Francisco, Jeff Kent hit a pair of two-run homers and
Barry Bonds added three RBIs as the Giants broke a five-game losing
streak with a win Tuesday over the Chicago Cubs.
	   Sammy Sosa went homerless but scored three times. Sosa, who tied
Mark McGwire for the major league lead by hitting his 45th and 46th
homers on Monday night, went 1-for-2 with two walks and was hit by
a pitch.
	   The Giants, who wasted a 5-0 lead, trailed by a run in the
seventh before Bonds tied the game with an RBI single and Kent
connected off Terry Adams (7-7) for his 19th homer.
	   Bonds, who had 10 RBIs in his last three games, had a two-run
triple and Kent hit his first homer as the Giants scored five in
the third off Kerry Wood, who allowed five runs, five hits and
three walks in four-plus innings.
	   Wood struck out eight, moving past San Diego's Kevin Brown into
second place in the NL with 193. Philadelphia's Curt Schilling
leads the league at 226.

Honduran businesspeople seek to ban U.S. anti-sweatshop crusader
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By FREDDY CUEVAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ A major Honduran business
association said Tuesday it has asked the government to ban a U.S.
labor activist who has campaigned against foreign sweatshops and
used Honduras as an example.
	   The Honduran Council of Private Enterprise expressed alarmed at
the visit of Charles Kernaghan, director of the National Labor
Committee, who helped cause a scandal over conditions at factories
here producing Kathie Lee brand clothing in 1996.
	   ``Kernaghan represents labor groups in the United States ready
to finish off the (Honduran) national economy,'' charged Rigoberto
Stephan, vice president of the business council. ``We will never
permit that.''
	   ``Kernaghan has caused grave damage to the national economy and
caused our exports to tumble by claiming before the U.S. Congress
that the human rights of Honduran workers are violated here,'' he
said.
	   ``Because of his lies, the government should declare Kernaghan
persona non grata and never allow his entry to Honduras,'' Stephan
added, saying the council ``has asked that of the government.''
	   Kernaghan heads the New York-based non-profit labor committee,
which says it receives a minority of its funding from U.S. unions.
He has been campaigning to force U.S. businesses to end use of
sweatshop labor abroad.
	   Kernaghan twice has brought 15-year-old Honduran girls to the
United States to testify before Congress about mistreatment in
factories.
	   Testimony in 1996 about conditions at a factory that had made
clothing under Kathie Lee Gifford's brand for Wall-Mart prompted
Mrs. Gifford, Wall-Mart and other manufacturers to announce tighter
controls over conditions at supplier factories.
	   Honduras' government and business representatives deny
mistreating workers.
	   Kernaghan arrived Sunday in Honduras and met with union
officials in San Pedro Sula, a center of in-bond clothing
manufacturing plants known as maquiladoras some 110 miles north of
the capital.
	   ``Kernaghan is again trying to affect Honduras,'' said Juan
Canahuati, the president of Honduras' Maquiladora Association.
	   He noted that the U.S. Congress is expected to decide in
September if Central American and Caribbean maquiladoras should
receive free-trade benefits similar to those of Mexican factories.
	   ``That is that Kernaghan is trying to block,'' Canahuati said.
``And that is why he is in Honduras.''
	   Kernaghan was not reachable Tuesday evening and the government
had no comment.
	   Maquiladoras employ more than 90,000 people in Honduras and they
have surpassed bananas as the country's principal export industry,
earning about dlrs 500 million a year.
	   In November, Kernaghan charged that Nicaraguans who make
garments sold at Wal-Mart, J.C. Penney and Kmart worked in
appalling conditions and were paid even less than Hondurans.
	   He also has criticized conditions at Chinese factories.

Cleaners find jewels worth dlrs 2.5 million abandoned at airport
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ You never know what you might find
cleaning up after others.
	   Airport sanitation workers discovered precious jewels worth 3
million reals (dlrs 2.5 million) in the arrivals area of the
international airport here, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   The jewels were found in five pieces of hand luggage abandoned
in a bathroom during a police operation to intercept contraband
from Italy, the Jornal do Brasil newspaper reported.
	   Police believe whoever was carrying the jewels had been tipped
off about the operation and dumped them, the newspaper reported.
	   The jewels, found on July 27, were being held by the Federal
Savings and Loan. Police only divulged the find Monday, for
security reasons.
	   Airport police Tuesday referred calls to customs, saying the
case was a matter for them. No one was available at customs for
comment.

Princes William and Harry, and Sarah McLachlan. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ ``The Avengers,'' one of the most anticipated
movies of the summer, may be headed for trouble at the box office,
with the studio declining to show it to critics before its release
Friday.
	   Traditionally, studios that have little faith in a movie refuse
to screen it early for reviewers, preferring to take their chances
with the public.
	   The remake of the stylish '60s TV show stars Ralph Fiennes as
the dapper John Steed and Uma Thurman as the leather-jumpsuited
Emma Peel. Sean Connery plays the villain.
	   Warner Bros. didn't immediately return a call Tuesday, but
senior vice president Don Buckley told the New York Post that the
studio ``decided that we want the press and the audiences to
discover the movie together.''
	   ``We're very proud of the movie,'' he said.
	   The Los Angeles Times quoted an unidentified studio spokesman as
saying the filmmakers were tinkering last week with the special
effects. The source said there would be no gala premiere because
its three stars had scheduling conflicts and were unavailable.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PHOENIX (AP) _ Tommy Lee was sentenced Tuesday to 30 days in
jail and fined dlrs 800 for assaulting a security guard at a
concert last winter.
	   The Motley Crue drummer spoke with City Court Judge Michael
Lester by phone from the Los Angeles County Jail, where he is
serving a six-month sentence for kicking his estranged wife, Pamela
Anderson. Under the plea agreement, he will serve the 30 days at
the same time as his California sentence.
	   Lee, 35, and fellow Motley Crue member Nikki Sixx were charged
with assault on a security guard in December.
	   The guard had tried to hold back 75 to 150 fans who rushed the
stage at America West Arena after members of the band told them to
leave their seats.
	   Sixx has pleaded innocent.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) _ Nelson Mandela says he tied the knot
with Graca Machel under ``unbearable'' pressure from friends.
	   The South African president's relationship with Ms. Machel was
out in the open for two years before their surprise wedding July
18. Members of the clergy complained the couple set a bad example
by not getting married.
	   ``Even in Parliament in my country, deputies told me I should
get married,'' Mandela said Monday. ``The pressure became
unbearable.''
	   Ms. Machel delayed marriage because she didn't want to give up
her work and her status in her native Mozambique as the widow of
another president. She continues to live here.
	   Mandela said they kept the wedding secret because they wouldn't
have known which of the ``numerous friends'' who have helped South
Africa should be invited, and to avoid clogging the streets with
traffic.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ Princes William and Harry won't become involved in
running a charity set up by their mother, Buckingham Palace said
Tuesday.
	   Newspapers had speculated that the boys they would be asked to
become patrons of the Princess of Wales Charities' Trust, a
foundation worth about 1 million pounds, or dlrs 1.63 million.
	   Princess Diana's trust gave to more than 100 charities,
including a domestic-violence project and a women's center.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ What a difference a decade makes.
	   Now 30, Lilith Fair leader Sarah McLachlan says she was a gawky,
anxious teen-ager growing up in Canada's Nova Scotia.
	   ``It took me a long time to get over the `you're ugly and stupid
thing,''' she told USA Weekend in the Aug. 14 issue. ``From age 13
to 18, it was consistent in my life, from my peers. You want
desperately to fit in, and I tried hard, but I didn't.''
	   Two Grammys and two multiplatinum albums later, the folk-pop
performer is on a happiness high with her drummer-husband, Ashwin
Sood.
	   ``I have a great sense of myself that I've never had before,''
she said.

	   ACAPULCO, Mexico (AP) _ A former mayor of Zihuatanejo, a popular
tourist destination on Mexico's Pacific Coast, has been kidnapped
and stabbed to death, police said Tuesday.
	   The body of Amado Sotelo Roque was found Saturday by a highway,
65 miles from Zihuatanejo. He had been stabbed several times and
his hands were bound with wire.
	   Sotelo Roque, 64, was mayor of Zihuatanejo in the 1970s and
owned a hotel and restaurant in the town 190 miles (304 kms)
southwest of Mexico City.
	   The killing appeared to be the result of a personal dispute not
related to politics. Police have identified a suspect and were
seeking an arrest warrant.
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Three men were arrested in connection with
the killing of a band leader who was shot four days after losing a
mayoral election, news reports said.
	   Abel Rueda Sarabia, 38, died July 9 after playing at a
graduation party in Pueblo Nuevo, 500 miles (800 kms) north of
Mexico City, where he was a center-right mayoral candidate.
	   Authorities said the killing didn't appear politically
motivated, government news agency Notimex said.
	   Officials said the suspects admitted being drunk and that they
killed Rueda Sarabia after he refused to have his band continue
playing at the party.
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Former President Carlos Andres Perez
must remain under house arrest until charges of illegal enrichment
against him are decided, the Supreme Court ruled Tuesday.
	   Perez was accused in April of depositing illicit funds in
several U.S. bank accounts. The amount of money he and longtime
companion Cecilia Matos kept in the accounts far exceeded their
earnings as public officials, a local judge said.
	   Perez's lawyers had requested a suspension of the house arrest
pending a decision in the case. The two-time president, 74, is
confined to his house instead of jail because of his age.
	   ``I'm not surpised at all, I didn't expect any other decision
because the justice system in Venezuela is totally politicized,''
Perez told the Associated Press in a telephone interview.
	   Perez acknowledges he and Matos held one joint bank account in
New York, but says it was for campaign funds that totaled a maximum
of (dlrs) 37,850. He says the account was closed six years ago.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The federal comptroller's office has barred
the Mexico City prison director from holding public office for
three years, accusing him of misspending money when he headed a
federal psychiatric center, Mexican newspapers reported Tuesday.
	   But the director, Carlos Tornero Diaz, will stay in office while
he fights the ruling. He has denied any wrongdoing.
	   Tornero is accused of making unauthorized payments of 304,954
pesos _ now worth about dlrs 33,000 _ when he was director of the
Federal Center of Psychosocial Rehabilitation in the central state
of Morelos in 1994 and 1995. The reports did not say how the money
was spent.
	   ___
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ U.S. Customs agents in Puerto Rico
announced Tuesday they arrested a Colombian man on charges of
smuggling heroin inside ``unusually heavy'' clothes hangers.
	   The Customs Service said it arrested Carlos Castano Toro, 32, on
Aug. 7 as he arrived at Puerto Rico's Luis Munoz Marin
International Airport on a flight from Curacao.
	   Agents said they found about 1.7 kilograms of heroin worth about
dlrs 180,000 in clothes hangers in Castano's luggage. The drug went
undetected through a baggage X-ray machine, but inspectors
``noticed the plastic clothes hangers to be unusually heavy,''
according to a Customs Service statement.
	   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) _ A truck crashed head-on into a
bus after blowing a tire Monday on a highway north of San Salvador.
Sixteen people were killed and 17 injured, most of them seriously.
	   The bus was heading toward the Salvadoran capital from the city
of Chalatenango, 72 kilometers (45 miles) north, when the crash
occurred about 11 a.m. Six people, including the truck driver, died
instantly. Seven people died in hospitals and three in ambulances.
	   A paramedic, Carlos Fuentes, said most of the other passengers
were being treated intensive care units.
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ An alleged former guard at
Croatia's largest World War II concentration camp will not oppose
that country's extradition request, her lawyer said Tuesday.
	   Esperanza Sakic is believed to have run a female block at the
Jasenovac concentration camp, once under her husband's command,
where tens of thousands of Serbs, Jews, Gypsies and Croats died.
	   Croatia issued an extradition request for her last month, not
long after her husband, Dinko Sakic, was extradited to Zagreb.
	   ``Once the request is formally received, she will take the same
action as her husband,'' said Miguel Angel Rossi, Sakic's lawyer.
	   Dinko Sakic did not resist the Croatian extradition request
earlier this year. He was discovered by authorities after he
declared during an Argentine television interview he once ran
Jasevovac.
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Authorities on Tuesday exhumed a body
from the private cemetery of a secretive German colony in southern
Chile to determine whether it indeed corresponds to that of the
founder of the enclave.
	   Scores of uniformed and plainclothes police were mobilized for
the exhumation at Colonia Dignidad, or Dignity Colony, and
officials from the coroner's office left the place carrying the
remains believed to be those of Herman Schmidt.
	   Judge Jorge Norambuena ordered the exhumation at the request of
the Internal Revenue Service which expressed doubts Schmidt had
indeed died of a heart attack in 1996 at age 81.
	   The colony leaders then announced the death, days after the IRS
sued Schmidt for tax evasion.
	   Schmidt was the co-founder of the Colony in 1991 along with Paul
Schafer, who is now a fugitive of the Chilean justice, that
indicted him of child sex abuse charges.
	   LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) _ A major natural gas field was discovered
in southern Bolivia that will help satisfy exports to Brazil, the
Vice Minister of Energy Carlos Alberto Lopez said Tuesday.
	   The San Alberto X field has reserves of one trillion cubic feet
of natural gas a day and will produce 35.5 million cubic feet of
natural gas per day. The fields are owned by Petrobas Bolivia,
Petrolera Andina S.A. and Total Exploration Bolivie. Petrobras is
owned by the Brazilian state oil company.
	   The reserves were found after eight months of exploration and an
investment of 20 US million dollars. The new fields are located in
southern Bolivia near the border with Argentina.
	   With this find, the government is assured sufficient gas to feed
into the pipeline that is being built between Bolivia and Brazil
and is expected to go into production early next year.
	   The 1,900-mile (3,060-kilometer) pipeline beginning in Santa
Cruz, Bolivia, and ending in the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do
Sul, is expected to cost dlrs 1.8 billion. and should move 30
million cubic meters (1 billion cubic feet) of gas per day.

Iraq must resume cooperation with inspectors before review happens
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RON KAMPEAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraqi authorities must resume cooperation
with weapons inspectors before the U.N. Security Council reviews
its relationship with Iraq, a Western diplomat said.
	   The United States and Britain met with other Security Council
diplomats Tuesday from countries friendly with Iraq to ask them to
tell Iraq that nothing will be done until it resumes cooperation.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan had proposed a ``comprehensive
review'' of the relationship last week as a way of enticing Iraq to
cooperate. He wanted the Security Council to consider his proposal
this week.
	   A senior Western diplomat at Tuesday's meeting said that was
unlikely _ and that the United States and Britain, which hold
vetoes on the council, were prepared to wait.
	   ``There will be no further actions until Iraq resumes
cooperation,'' said the diplomat, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   Iraq suspended cooperation last week after the chief weapons
inspector, Richard Butler, refused to certify that it had complied
with provisions that would allow sanctions imposed after its 1990
invasion of Kuwait to be lifted.
	   Butler says that Iraq has complied with most of the requirements
regarding missiles, but that inspectors still have questions about
its chemical and biological warfare capabilities.
	   Some countries _ notably Russia _ have suggested that the
Security Council encourage Iraq to cooperate by formally commending
it for closing its nuclear file and nearly closing its missiles
file.
	   But Britain and the United States were firmly against enticing
Iraq to cooperate, the Western diplomat said.
	   That meant nothing would happen anytime soon, said Iraq's charge
d'affaires at the United Nations, Said Hasan.
	   ``We will not exchange something for nothing,'' he told The
Associated Press.
	   The Western diplomat said that Britain and the United States
supported Annan's proposed review _ but only after Iraq complies.
	   He said that the feeling among Security Council members was that
they were ready to wait a long time for Iraq to make the necessary
moves.
	   That contrasts with the sense of urgency in February, the last
time Iraq cut off the inspectors. At that time, Britain and the
United States threatened military action against the Iraqis. Annan
resolved the crisis by brokering an agreement that allowed work to
resume.
	   Annan's envoy, Prakash Shah, is on his way to Iraq to press the
Iraqis to comply. He is due to arrive Thursday.
	   Also Tuesday, Butler met with 12 Roman Catholic activists who
have been fasting for 19 days to encourage the United Nations to
end the sanctions, which they say are killing 5,000 Iraqi children
a month.
	   Both sides said the 40-minute meeting went well.
	   The Chicago-based activists, who end their fast on Wednesday,
displayed pictures of ill children to Butler, said one of the
activists, Kathy Kelly.
	   ``Butler is very aware of debate in capitals around the world
about the use of sanctions,'' she said.

Brazil hires soccer coach
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Vanderley Luxemburgo, who twice
coached his Brazilian club to league titles, was given one of the
most prominent jobs in soccer when he was hired as Brazil's
national soccer coach.
	   He succeeds Mario Zagallo, who was removed after his team lost
3-0 to France in the World Cup title game last month in one of the
Brazilian team's most disappointing showings.
	   In a nation where even runner-up finishes in the World Cup are
unacceptable, Luxemburgo must now attempt to win a fifth World Cup
for his country.
	   ``I am very satisfied,'' he said Tuesday. ``To be part of the
national team is the objective of any soccer professional, be he a
coach or a player.''
	   He said it is premature to discuss plans for the team until
personnel in the national soccer federation is set and ``priorities
are established.''
	   The squad was plagued with disagreements among players and
management, and Luxemburgo said one of his first jobs will be to
end the ``vanity'' that beset the team.
	   Luxemburgo, 46, is the coach of first-place Corinthians. He will
continue coaching the team until the end of the national
championships in December.
	   The first players for the new national team are expected to be
named in September for the year's remaining three or four
exhibition games.
	   Since beginning his coaching career in 1983, Luxemburgo has
coached 14 teams, including two in Saudi Arabia. He led Palmeiras
to the national championship in 1993 and 1994.
	   Luxemburgo had a lackluster 11-year career (1971-1982) as a
player. He gained national attention in 1990 as coach of
Bragantino, an obscure team that won the Sao Paulo state
championship.
	   After coaching Flamengo in 1995, he returned to Palmeiras. He
coached Santos in 1997 and this year joined Corinthians.

	   MANHATTAN BEACH, California (AP) _ Wimbledon finalist Nathalie
Tauziat led three Frenchwomen into the second round of the Acura
Classic women's tennis tournament on Tuesday.
	   Playing a patient game and waiting for her opponent's mistakes,
Tauziat defeated Chanda Rubin 6-4, 7-5.
	   Seventh-seeded Sandrine Testud ousted Italy's Adriana
Serra-Zanetti 6-3, 7-5 and Alexandra Fusai eliminated 17-year-old
Alexandra Stevenson 6-3, 6-3.
	   Tauziat needed 87 minutes to down Rubin and won 83 percent of
her first service points, including six aces. Rubin dumped numerous
forehands into the net and double-faulted six times.
	   ``I don't think I played so well today.,'' Tauziat said. ``She
made some unforced errors. She can put the ball out or in and so
you just have to always concentrate. It was hot and humid and
sometimes I didn't read her so good.''
	   In another match involving a seeded player, No. 8 Natasha
Zvereva, a quarterfinalist here last year, defeated Anne Kremer of
Luxembourg 7-5, 6-2. Iva Majoli, the 1997 French Open champion,
fought back to beat Rita Grande of Italy 1-6, 6-2, 6-4.

Rios upset by Vacek

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with evening match; no pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By TERRY KINNEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MASON, Ohio (AP) _ Marcelo Rios of Chile, who took over the top
ranking on the ATP Tour this week, was no match Tuesday night for
power-serving Daniel Vacek of the Czech Republic.
	   Vacek, ranked 53rd in tour standings, blew away Rios 6-3, 6-2 in
62 minutes in the second round of the dlrs 2.45 million ATP
Championship.
	   Rios, looking lackluster, stayed at the baseline most of the
time, hung his head after hitting numerous returns into the net and
watched helplessly as Vacek repeatedly knocked the ball past him.
	   Rios failed to hold serve in the sixth game, so all Vacek had to
do was stay on serve the rest of the first set. Vacek broke Rios in
the third game of the second set, won the next game with an ace and
broke Rios again in the fifth game.
	   Both players held serve the rest of the way, although Vacek made
the last game interesting, double-faulting at 40-15 and twice more
before putting Rios away.
	   Earlier, a re-energized Andre Agassi, back in the top 10 for the
first time since January 1997, kept his comeback rolling Tuesday by
beating Nicolas Kiefer of Germany.
	   Serving in game 12 of the second set and facing elimination,
Agassi won four straight points to force a tiebreaker after falling
behind 30-0, then dominated Kiefer and won 4-6, 7-6 (7-3), 6-2.
	   He seemed to play with more determination after breaking
Kiefer's serve in the ninth game of the second set with a stunning
crosscourt shot that nipped the line.
	   ``I don't think you show up to any tournament and play your best
tennis in the first round,'' Agassi said. ``You've just got to get
through the days when you're not feeling the greatest.''
	   While he was slumping _ he was ranked No. 141 in November _ he
would not have survived a match like this, Agassi said.
	   ``Things like this used to be a quick exit for me,'' he said.
	   But with a new dedication to being No. 1 again has come a
renewed mental toughness.
	   ``It's nice to feel competitive again,'' said Agassi, who now is
No. 9. ``It's nice getting the `W' when you're not at your best.''
	   Kiefer, ranked 25th in the world, never had played Agassi
before. But he looks forward to a rematch.
	   ``It was a good chance to beat him. I just didn't make it,''
Kiefer said. ``I played him very aggressive. I see that I can beat
him.''
	   Meanwhile, two of the tournament's seeded players lost.
	   Thomas Muster of Austria beat 11th-seeded Tim Henman of Britain
6-4, 7-5 and Wayne Ferreira of South Africa defeated 15th-seeded
Felix Mantilla of Spain 7-6 (7-5), 7-5.
	   In other matches, Andrei Medvedev of Ukraine beat Arnaud Clement
of France 6-4, 6-3; Jerome Golmard of France defeated countryman
Nicolas Escude 6-2, 6-7 (2-7), 6-3; Scott Draper of Australia
downed Nicolas Lapentti of Ecuador 6-4, 4-6, 7-5, and Mark
Philippoussis of Australia beat Byron Black of Zimbabwe 6-2, 6-3.
	   Also, 14th-seeded Goran Ivanisevic of Croatia beat Andrew Ilie
of Australia 6-4, 0-6, 6-4; Marco Ondruska of South Africa defeated
Steve Campbell 5-7, 6-2, 6-3; Michael Chang topped Todd Woodbridge
of Australia 6-1, 3-6, 6-2, and Martin Damm of the Czech Republic
beat Mark Woodforde of Australia 6-4, 3-6, 6-2.
	   Pete Sampras, the defending champion and No. 1 seed, was idle
until Wednesday, when six of the top eight seeds play for the first
time.

 &UR; With Embassy Bombings &QL;

 &UR; By DIANNA CAHN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ The bruises and deep gashes on
Elizabeth Mary Slater's nose, neck and body bear witness to the
bomb attack she lived through just two days after arriving for a
new assignment at the U.S. Embassy in Tanzania.
	   ``It was something terrible, horrible,'' she said of the moment
the bomb went off. ``Then things began to fall. I thought it was
the ceiling but I guess ... it was a wall falling on me.''
	   Acting ambassador John Lange helped pull her out from under
chunks of concrete and flee to safety. But the tragedy has not
dampened the Orlando, Florida, woman's enthusiasm for her new job.
	   Slater landed in this Indian Ocean port city Aug. 5 to begin her
first posting as a foreign service officer. She previously had
served 18 years in embassies in Africa as a secretary.
	   ``I came to Dar es Salaam for a new career,'' said the
Zimbabwean-born Slater, her pale green eyes filling with tears. ``I
was very excited, and I hit the ground running.''
	   The nearly simultaneous bombings Friday of the embassies in Dar
es Salaam and the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, killed more than 200
people and injured more than 5,000.
	   The attacks were directed at the United States, but the
overwhelming majority of the victims were Africans _ more than 200
in Kenya and 10 in Tanzania. No Americans died in Dar es Salaam.
	   Slater, 42, was in a colleague's office in the front of the
building when a blast outside the front gate ripped through the
embassy, pinning her legs under rubble and nearly tearing her nose
off her face. Her colleague fared worse and was evacuated to Europe
for treatment.
	   First Slater heard the noise. Then, all was dark.
	   ``I couldn't see a thing,'' she said. ``The colleague I was
sitting with was hysterically screaming.''
	   As she left the building she noticed that cars were burning and
the guard house at the outside gate was blown to pieces. A U.S.
security official said Tuesday that lives inside the building were
saved by a shatter-resistant film over all the embassy windows.
	   Laurel Mcmullen worked in the consular section in the office
behind Slater's _ that much further from the blast.
	   ``I heard a rumbling noise,'' said Mcmullen, 43, from
Alexandria, Virginia, Her shoulder-length brown hair was partially
shaven to treat a head wound.
	   ``There was a rush of wind, and everything came flying at us _
glass, debris,'' she added. ``Then it got very dark. I remember
smoke. I remember screaming very loud. Then an eerie calmness came
over.''
	   McMullen's head was bleeding badly, but still she stopped to
help others as she made her way out.
	   Slater, who underwent surgery on her nose Tuesday, said she was
still excited about her foreign service career.
	   ``Dar es Salaam, here I come.''

``Little Poison'' plays practice half round
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM COUR &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   REDMOND, Washington (AP) _ ``Little Poison'' is still going
strong at 90. So Paul Runyan warmed up for the PGA Championship by
playing nine practice holes.
	   No, he's not going to try a comeback against the likes of Tiger
Woods, Lee Janzen and Mark O'Meara this week.
	   The winner of two PGA Championship tournaments in his heyday _
1934 and 1938 (he beat Sam Snead 8 and 7 in match play in '38) _
just wanted to educate himself about the Sahalee Country Club
course.
	   ``I started out to find out if my judgment about Sahalee was
correct,'' Runyan said Tuesday. ``I wanted to know if they had ever
been able to grow the roughs under those beautiful trees.''
	   So what kind of score did Runyan shoot?
	   ``Why did you have to ask that?'' he replied with a smile.
	   In actuality, he had a tremendous half round for a 90-year-old _
a 42 that included a 5 on the par-3 fifth hole when he put a ball
in the water. He admits he doesn't hear as well as he did at one
time and he doesn't walk as fast, but he takes a lot of pride in
his game.
	   ``Ninety-nine percent of the time, I beat my age,'' he said. ``I
can still have a terrible game and beat my age.''
	   Runyan will receive the PGA's Distinguished Service Award
Wednesday night. When he was in his prime, he was known as ``Little
Poison'' to his rivals because of his small size. Despite being
5-foot-7 1/2 (1.68-meter) and 138 pounds (62 kilograms), he won 29
official events.
	   He still plays and teaches at Arroyo Seco Golf Course, a small
public course near his home in Pasadena, California.
	   He's happy to see Washington state gets its second major
tournament since the PGA Championship was played in Spokane in
1944. He's particularly happy for Sahalee, where he was the first
head pro in 1969.
	   ``Early on, I had it come to my mind that this would be a
wonderful place to have a major championship,'' he said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; ISLEWORTH SWEEP: &LR;  Lee Janzen (U.S. Open) and Mark O'Meara
(Masters and British Open), both from the Isleworth Country Club of
Orlando, Fla., have won three-fourths of the majors this year.
	   What are the chances of one of their members making it a clean
sweep in the PGA Championship?
	   ``I think it would be one of the most unique things that ever
happened in sports if all four majors happened to be at Isleworth,
the same club,'' Janzen said. ``Who knows if it's ever been done
before, but certainly it would be something to talk about.''
	   In addition to Janzen and O'Meara, Tiger Woods, Scott Hoch,
Payne Stewart, Stuart Appleby and Grant Waite are members of
Isleworth.
	   ``I think it's really amazing that so far three have been at
Isleworth,'' Janzen said.
	   He won his second U.S. Open title in June at San Francisco's
Olympic Country Club.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; GRIFFEY THE GOLFER: &LR;  One of the golfers' Isleworth neighbors is
1997 American League MVP Ken Griffey Jr., who leads the AL in
homers again this season.
	   Griffey placed a call from Toronto, where the Seattle Mariners
are playing, to Tiger Woods this week. And Griffey's wife, Melissa,
and two children, son Trey (4) and daughter Taryn (2), came to see
Woods' practice round Tuesday.
	   Griffey is amazing on the baseball field and he's amazing off
the tee, too, Woods said.
	   ``You cannot believe how far he can hit it for as slow a swing
as he has until impact,'' he said. ``At the moment of impact, you
can't believe the speed.
	   ``He'll wait until the last minute to let his hands go and when
he does, you wonder how he can hit it so far,'' Woods added.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; WATSON WATCH: &LR;  Tom Watson, winner of 35 PGA Tour events in a
distinguished career that began in 1971, thinks the key to winning
this week at Sahalee will be playing conservatively because of the
narrow fairways and all the trees.
	   ``Don't fire at too many pins,'' he said after a practice round.
``The pins are going to be tucked in areas where even a great shot
can't get close.''
	   Watson, 48, said the winning score depends on the greens.
	   ``If the greens are hard, an even par might take it,'' he said.
``But if the greens are soft, I think the winning score will be
around 8- or 9-under. You have to hit the ball straight to play
this golf course well.''
	   Watson has captured eight major titles, but never the PGA. He
captured the MasterCard Colonial in Fort Worth, Texas, in May for
his first victory since the 1996 Memorial.

Bombing, travel warning delivers one-two punch to Kenya tourism

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Kenya is the stuff of Hollywood legend, of
Hemingway fame _ a place etched into popular culture by countless
books and films, from ``The Snows of Kilimanjaro'' to ``Out of
Africa.''
	   For many people, going on safari in Kenya, a land famed for its
wildlife and spectacular scenery, is the dream of a lifetime.
	   Tourism is vital to Kenya, as important as coffee and tea
exports to the faltering economy. And it has just suffered a
stunning one-two punch.
	   On Friday, a terrorist bomb rocked the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi.
A nearly simultaneous blast hit the embassy in neighboring
Tanzania.
	   The bombings _ thought to be the work of outsiders _ were cruel
enough on their own. More than 200 people, most of them Kenyans,
are dead, and thousands injured. The damage to buildings alone is
estimated at dlrs 330 million.
	   Then came the second blow, just hours later: A State Department
warning urging Americans to ``exercise caution'' in traveling to
Kenya and Tanzania _ and even to leave if they felt unsafe.
	   John Glen, a tour operator who owns Destination Kenya, was hit
hard.
	   ``I just had a cancellation from America,'' he said Tuesday.
``It's just blown dlrs 750,000 off my books.''
	   The Kenya Tourist Board is still trying to assess the damage the
travel industry has sustained; it could take months.
	   ``The greatest problem is that we won't get new bookings unless
the advisory is changed,'' said the board's head, James Flannery.
	   The board says more than 750,000 tourists visit Kenya every
year. Tourism accounts for 9 percent of the gross national product,
and it rivals Kenya's two major exports _ coffee and tea _ in
foreign currency earnings.
	   Flannery said the advisory especially hurt because it covered
both Kenya and Tanzania. Many Americans on safari in Kenya also
make side trips to Tanzania's Mt. Kilimanjaro. The mountain's
slopes and preserves extend into Kenya.
	   The blow couldn't have come at a worse time.
	   The economy is near collapse, and the IMF suspended a dlrs 220
million loan to Kenya last year because of high-level corruption.
	   And tourism was just coming out a deep slump brought on by
political violence last year on the Indian Ocean coast that kept
Europeans from beach resorts.
	   Unlike Europeans, Americans don't come to Kenya for the beaches;
they come for safaris, which cost dlrs 5,000 and up in a country
where the average person makes less than dlrs 300 a year.
	   That means Americans tourists are especially prized: They stay
longer and spend more than other visitors.
	   Chicago lawyer Laurel Dineff was on safari in central Kenya with
her family and 15 other people when the bombings happened.
	   At the Mt. Kenya Safari Club in the foothills of the snowcapped
peak, they didn't hear about the advisory. If they had, Dineff
said, they might have gone home. Now Dineff, who also owns a travel
agency, is glad they didn't.
	   ``We saw herds of just about everything: herds of elephants,
herds of Cape buffalo. We saw leopards, we saw lions,'' she said.
``We saw rhinos, black ones with babies. We saw hippos by the
dozens. I'm so glad we didn't turn tail and run.''
	   Kathleen Tyson, who is coming to Kenya next week with her
family, said in a telephone interview from New York that she was
worried, in part because of graphic footage of the carnage on
television.
	   But after talking to people who'd visited Kenya, she decided to
go.
	   ``Even people who are normally grouchy about everything come
back raving about what they've seen,'' she said.

Dollar edges lower, Japanese stock prices mixed in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar edged lower early Wednesday amid
speculation about possible intervention to support the yen.
Japanese stock prices turned mixed in light trading.
	   The dollar bought 147.16 yen in early trading, down 0.25 yen
from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York rate of
147.35 yen overnight.
	   Remarks from Japanese officials hinting at yen-buying
intervention to support the Japanese currency nudged the dollar
lower, although market players said that such a move by Japan's
central bank was unlikely.
	   On Tuesday, the yen tumbled to an eight-year low against the
dollar on further evidence of Japan's worsening economy, reaching
147.61 yen, a level not seen since Aug. 20, 1990, when the dollar
hit 147.96 yen.
	   ``What we are concerned about is that the yen is weakening in
such a way that it doesn't reflect economic fundamentals, and that
is not only undesirable for the Japanese economy, but for other
Asian economies as well,'' Haruhiko Kuroda, head of the
international bureau of the Finance Ministry , told reporters
Wednesday morning.
	   ``We will take appropriate action in the market as necessary,''
Kuroda said.
	   Market conditions remained thin as many market players were
absent due to the annual weeklong ``Obon'' Buddhist holiday.
	   Despite the yen's rise, traders said the currency remains
vulnerable to selling pressure amid continued instability in Asian
markets.
	   Concerns about instability in Asian financial markets pushed the
Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index moderately lower at the start,
but it quickly rebounded as the yen's relative strength against the
dollar encouraged investors.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 61.59 points, or 0.40
percent, to 15,468.58 points in the first 30 minutes of trading. On
Tuesday, the Nikkei index closed down 219.43 points, or 1.40
percent, marking the seventh consecutive trading day of losses.
	   Overnight on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average fell
112.00 points _ or 1.3 percent _ to close at 8,462.85 points, after
having 258 points in earlier trading.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section, however, was down 2.42 points, or 0.20 percent, to
1,184.46 points. The TOPIX closed down 20.21 points, or 1.67
percent, the day before.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 1.190 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.180 percent,
driving its price down to 111.83 yen from 111.92 yen.

Moderate earthquake hits northwestern Japan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A moderate earthquake with a preliminary magnitude
of 4.1 hit an area of northwestern Japan on Wednesday. There were
no immediate reports of damage or injuries.
	   The quake was centered about 10 kilometers (6 miles) underground
in central Nagano prefecture, or state, 210 kilometers (130 miles)
northwest of Tokyo and struck at 9:40 a.m. (0040 GMT), the
Meteorological Agency announced.
	   There was no danger of tsunami, undersea waves triggered by
volcanic activity or earthquakes, arising from the temblor.
	   A magnitude 4 quake can shake houses and buildings and cause
hanging objects such as lamps to swing.
	   Japan is one of the world's most earthquake-prone nations as it
sits atop four tectonic plates, slabs of land that move across the
earth's surface.

Kinshasa's Tutsis implicated by ethnicity

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Authorities in the Congo are cracking
down indiscriminately against Tutsi residents, broadcasting fierce
attacks against them, arresting them wholesale, holding them in
cramped cells and in some cases beating them in front of family.
	   Thousands of Tutsis have gone into hiding, hoping to avoid the
fate of three whose bodies were found dumped in shallow river on
the outskirts of the capital.
	   The crackdown appears to be a reflex by the officials loyal to
President Laurent Kabila, who faces a rebellion in eastern Congo.
	   The region, adjacent to Rwanda, is heavily populated by Tutsis.
The Rwandan government, which had backed the movement that put
Kabila in power, now appears to be backing the rebellion against
him. The rebellion has spread to the west, near the Atlantic
coastline.
	   The government says there has been no maltreatment of Tutsis,
but acknowledges a roundup.
	   ``We have set the minorities aside as a preventive measure to
keep them from the public so they aren't lynched,'' Interior
Minister Gaetan Kakudji said. ``This is a humanitarian objective.''
	   United Nations and American officials, however, say that
thousands of Tutsis have been detained, and have urged authorities
to stop.
	   When gun battles broke out more than a week ago in two Kinshasa
army barracks, the government broadcast that Rwandan Tutsi soldiers
allied to Kabila had revolted. Since then, the hunt has been on.
	   ``Today we realize that the Tutsis are also guilty of genocide
like the Rwandan Hutus,'' Interior Minister Kakundji said in one of
the broadcasts.
	   Last week in the Quartier De Bonhomme on Kinshasa's east side,
the bodies of three Tutsi soldiers were found tossed into a shallow
river in a residential neighborhood.
	   Since then, Tutsis have disappeared from the streets.
	   Although Tutsis _ an ethnic minority found in Congo, Rwanda,
Burundi, Uganda and Tanzania _ live scattered throughout the
region, in Kinshasa, they've been lumped together as one rebellious
lot.
	   One Tutsi man, who spoke on condition he not be further
identified, described how Congolese security agents beat and
arrested him. A rifle butt slammed into his left eye when he opened
his front door. Dazed, his eye swollen shut, his face caked in
blood, the questions came later.
	   Guns aimed at his chest and belly, soldiers grilled the man in
front of his wife and daughter for hours before they dragged him
off to prison last week.
	   A victim of a frenzied witchhunt for ethnic Tutsis in Kinshasa,
he's guilty by ethnicity.
	   ``I'm a Tutsi so they think I must be one of the fighters,'' the
man says. ``They look at my face and they hate me. I'm in danger.''
	   The man was released after his first night in jail and given
papers from the police commander that cleared him of suspicion.
	   When he returned to his apartment, his door had been broken
down, his belongings ransacked, his pregnant wife and daughter were
missing. They too had been arrested and taken to a different prison
where they were held overnight.
	   Thousands of civilian Tutsis and other ethnic minorities have
been arrested by the police and military in the 10 days since the
rebellion began, according to United Nations officials.
	   The Tutsis' distinctive lean, angular features are often a dead
giveaway. Tutsis in Kinshasa _ businessmen and street sweepers,
doctors, engineers and students _ are all suspect. Indeed, almost
anyone who has worked with a Tutsi or socialized with them is under
the watchful eye of Kabila's military intelligence.
	   One non-Tutsi government ministry bureaucrat, who worked as an
aide to former Foreign Minister Bizima Karaha _ a Tutsi who fled to
the rebel side _ has gone into hiding, his colleagues say.
	   In police stations throughout the city, tiny holding cells are
crammed with Tutsis set aside, allegedly for their protection. At
one station in central Kinshasa, a foreigner who was held briefly
saw dozens of people packed into a cell.
	   Mary Robinson, the former Irish president who heads the United
Nations Human Rights Commission, has appealed for the safety of
Tutsis and other ethnic minorities in Congo. So far, that appears
to have fallen on deaf ears.
	   ``The government must extend equal protection to all persons
under its jurisdiction, regardless of origin,'' Robinson said.
	   The State Department in Washington has made a similar call.

U.S. accounting for war missing bolsters Laos film archives
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY315 &QL; 
 &UR; By DON PATHAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENTIANE, Laos (AP) _ The U.S. campaign to account for
Americans missing in action during the Vietnam War is helping the
people of Laos preserve their history.
	   Scouring for clues on the fate of MIAs, the U.S. military has
played a key role in getting missing wartime films back from
Vietnam to Laos and is improving the preservation of important
archives here.
	   ``The idea is that we wanted to review the films, and the Lao
needed an adequate facility to accommodate them,'' says Lt. Col.
Robert T. Gahagan, a member of the search project. ``It helps
preserve Lao history.''
	   Since the establishment in 1994 of an archival research team
under the U.S. task force on MIAs, American military personnel and
Lao officials have screened thousands of reels of film.
	   The team looks for information that would help account for the
2,090 American servicemen still listed as missing in action in
Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos.
	   In exchange for the access, the United States has provided new
computers, film editing machines, air-conditioned storage rooms and
other improvements for Laos' film archives.
	   Most of the films were taken during the Vietnam War by Lao and
Vietnamese cameramen. They include documentaries on life in the
countryside, war propaganda, educational films and entertainment.
	   Although not officially at war in Laos, the United States backed
the government then in Vientiane in its fight with
Vietnamese-backed Pathet Lao Communists. In an unsuccessful effort
to stem communist advances, Washington unleashed history's most
intense aerial bombardment on Laos.
	   Most of the 446 American servicemen still listed as MIA in Laos
were airmen bombing the Ho Chi Minh Trail to stop North Vietnam
from moving troops and supplies through Laos into South Vietnam.
	   One reason for improving Laos' film archive facilities was to
prepare a home for 1,181 reels of film from Vietnam, which arrived
in July. Lao authorities believe 162 of these reels may contain
relevant information on MIAs.
	   ``We started to review the films and thus far we have run into a
couple items that may be related,'' said Chief Warrant Officer
Ruben Williams, the team leader. ``At this stage we don't have the
final analyses.''
	   The United States played a significant role in helping the Lao
government obtain the films, which were transported to Vientiane by
a U.S. C-130 military cargo plane. Deputy Assistant Secretary of
Defense Robert L. Jones witnessed their arrival.
	   ``We wanted to help the Lao government get hold of them for
quite a while,'' said Gahagan. ``We have spent the last four years
working on this.''
	   The American MIA search in Laos has also involved examining oral
and written wartime accounts and the joint excavation of 26 plane
crash sites since 1996. Eighty-two other crash sites have been
identified and are awaiting excavation.
	   The work has led to the resolution of 119 MIA cases, as well as
friendlier ties between the United States and Laos' government.
	   Although several leads have been obtained from the films, none
has yet led to the recovery of any American remains. Gahagan,
however, said the film archives project shouldn't be dismissed as
insignificant.
	   ``Our mission is the fullest possible accounting, and so we will
pursue any and all leads regardless where we get them,'' he said.
``We won't leave any stone unturned.''

New Zealand Air Force to make dangerous Antarctic medivac flight
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand (AP) _ A New Zealand medical team will
fly to the United States' McMurdo base in Antarctica on Wednesday
to evacuate an American believed to have a burst appendix,
officials said.
	   The National Science Foundation, which manages the U.S.
Antarctic Program, said in a statement that a 41-year-old man at
the base had acute appendicitis, but was in stable condition.
	   New Zealand Air Force spokesman Paul Harrison identified the
patient as McMurdo station manager Jerry Ness. Ness' hometown was
not immediately known.
	   A New Zealand Air Force Hercules C-130 will make the eight-hour
flight from Christchurch to McMurdo, where it will have to land in
the dark on a snow-covered runway to refuel and complete the
evacuation.
	   Harrison said the mission was dangerous but necessary because
the patient's life may be in danger.
	   The C-130 has a wheeled undercarriage, not skis, and the trip is
the first time a New Zealand Hercules has flown to Antarctica
during winter, Harrison said.
	   ``These things are critical and we have put ourselves right out
at the end of the envelope here to do this and save a guy's life,''
he said.
	   Base staff will try to clear the runway of snow, Harrison said.
	   The U.S. Air Force usually provides support for the American
Antarctic Program, but there were no polar-qualified pilots
available for the evacuation and to wait for a suitable crew would
take several days, the National Science Foundation said.
	   McMurdo base is in winter operating mode, with a skeleton staff
of 166 people. The sun has yet to rise marking the end of winter
and the temperature is well below freezing, the foundation said.
	   Normal supply flights to the base are not scheduled to begin for
another week.
	   There have been only three previous emergency medical evacuation
flights to McMurdo, the first in 1961, and the most recent last
year to bring back the body of an American who died of heart
failure.

African nation searches for new wealth before oil runs dry
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Graphic GABON DILEMMA
 &UR; By GLENN McKENZIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PORT GENTIL, Gabon (AP) _ Surrounded by rain forest and
unreachable by road, this quiet harbor town on the Gulf of Guinea
is an island of prosperity and stability in a part of Africa
defined by wars and poverty.
	   Businessmen in European-tailored suits sip cappucinos at
brightly painted sidewalk cafes looking out at some of the
continent's most profitable oil refineries and storage depots.
	   White-washed French colonial buildings and small modern office
blocks line wide, tree-shaded streets that bustle with cash-flush
oil workers returned from long stints on offshore oil platforms and
remote jungle drilling sites.
	   The town's hospital, built by a foreign oil firm, is
well-stocked with medicines, and there are books in the schools.
	   A gateway for fuel shipments to Europe, Port Gentil is a potent
symbol of Gabon's decades-old reputation as a haven of wealth in
central Africa _ a region better known for corrupt dictators, civil
wars and abject poverty.
	   It is a reputation threatened, however, by declining reserves of
crude oil and persistent allegations of government misrule.
	   Major oil producers like the Anglo-Dutch giant Royal Dutch-Shell
and Elf-Aquitaine of France have scaled back operations in the past
year, turning their attention to Gabon's more turbulent neighbors:
Republic of Congo, Nigeria and Angola.
	   Total, another French company, gave up plans to drill for oil
after several unsuccessful exploration ventures.
	   ``It was just not profitable for our company to continue
exploration here,'' said Christophe Girardo, director-general of
Total's Gabon subsidiary.
	   Gabon produces about 15 million gallons of crude oil a day, but
this is expected to drop.
	   ``Unless a big oil discovery is made soon, this country is in
for some hard times,'' said Franck Wendlinger, Gabon's district
manager for Baker Oil Tools, a major U.S.-based oil equipment
supplier.
	   A former French colony, Gabon is one of the richest countries in
Africa, but it is almost totally dependent on petroleum.
	   While five other African nations produce more oil than Gabon,
none has such a small population: half of the 1.3 million people in
this Colorado-sized country are supported by the oil rigs.
	   The average Gabonese earns nearly CFA francs (dlrs 4,000) a year
_ dwarfing per capita incomes of Nigeria, Cameroon and Central
African Republic.
	   For the elite, money flows freely.
	   In the coastal capital, Libreville, expensive European cars
cruise streets lined by mini-skyscrapers. Flashy nightclubs and
cafes abound.
	   In the boom days of the early 1990s, Gabon boasted the world's
20th largest consumption of French champagne while Libreville
joined Tokyo and Hong Kong among the world's most expensive cities.
	   Despite this explosion of affluence, people in the jungle
interior still eke out livings by hunting wild game _ from
elephants to lowland gorillas to wild birds _ and by subsistence
farming. Those wanting paid jobs trek to the coast in hopes of
landing work with an oil company.
	   Michel Maganga, a computer operator at a contractor for
Elf-Aquitaine, supports 10 relatives with his 1.1 million CFA
francs-a-month (dlrs 2,000) job. Well off by African standards, he
knows the work could disappear without warning.
	   ``If the oil industry does not improve, I could lose my job,''
Maganga said.
	   Much of the blame for Gabon's lack of economic diversification
is aimed at Gabon's leader the past 30 years, President Omar Bongo,
a diminutive 61-year-old whom critics accuse of misrule and
corruption.
	   Despite collecting oil revenues of more than 600 billion CFA
francs (dlrs 1 billion) a year, the government has a staggering
foreign debt thanks to flashy, but costly mega-projects _ including
a 1.8 trillion CFA francs (dlrs 3 billion) railway _ that have done
little to broaden the economy.
	   A slow-growing logging industry is Gabon's second largest
employer, but it has created few benefits for average villagers.
	   Despite a lush, fertile climate and soil conditions, there is
little commercial farming. Much of the country's food is imported
from France.
	   Facing pressure from the World Bank and International Monetary
Fund to diversify Gabon's cocoa, palm oil, coffee and sugar cane
industries, the government has promised to privatize the country
largest agricultural earner, the 9 billion CFA francs-a-year (dlrs
15 million) palm oil industry.
	   Still, most Gabonese pin their hopes on a renewed oil industry.
	   Twice before in the 1980s, Gabon's oil reserves were reported to
be running out. Each time, fresh discoveries were made, saving the
need for painful change.
	   The second major find, the on-shore Rabi-Kounga field, was
hailed in 1988 as the largest oil reserve in the region. It is now
nearly tapped out.
	   ``We're all hoping for another discovery like the last one,''
said Maganga.

	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ A Congolese rebel commander said his 60,000
troops were closing in on Kinshasa in a revolt to topple embattled
President Laurent Kabila.
	   ``Our strategy is that our friends are everywhere. It's a war
that concerns everyone,'' commander Jean-Pierre Ondekane said in
the eastern city of Goma on Tuesday. ``We don't want an atrocious
war. We want to end this soon.''
	   Meanwhile, Kabila's government boasted it was retaking territory
lost earlier to the rebels and had deployed new forces to the east
and west of the capital of Kinshasa.
	   The rebellion erupted last week when Congo announced it was
expelling Rwandan officers and soldiers who had trained and managed
Kabila's new army. The Rwandans had also helped Kabila overthrow
longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko last year.
	   The expulsion of the Rwandans spurred ethnic Tutsis, who also
joined Kabila in a fragile alliance against Mobutu, to revolt
against their former ally in Congo. Kabila has accused Rwanda and
Uganda of supplying tanks and troops to the Tutsi rebels, an
accusation both countries have denied.
	   Kabila's relations with the two neighbors have been gradually
deteriorating, particularly because of his failure to control
Congo's vast eastern border region. Rwanda has been frustrated by
Kabila's failure to stop cross-border Hutu rebel attacks on Rwanda.
	   On Tuesday, Ondekane said rebel troops had cut an oil pipeline
in western Congo that supplies the capital, Kinshasa. He also said
troops had reached the outskirts of the major Congo River port of
Matadi, 173 miles (278 kilometers) southwest of the capital.
	   The reported advances came amid government claims that its
forces had made inroads in both the far west and east. Officials
said government troops had retaken the city of Bukavu, south of
Goma, and a nearby airport while other loyalists were fighting for
the western town of Boma, officials in Kinshasa said.
	   Ondekane denied that Bukavu had been recaptured.
	   He said rebel aircraft were supporting forces on the ground at
Kitona airbase just outside the Atlantic seaside town of Muanda and
in the north central town of Kisangani, 520 miles (836 kilometers)
northeast of Kinshasa on the Congo River.
	   ``I've taken in soldiers who had not been paid for eight months.
I clothed them, I armed them, and they are heading toward
Kinshasa,'' Ondekane said without elaborating.
	   It was not immediately possible to obtain independent
confirmation of the claims from either side.
	   Ondekane, a French-speaking commander from Equatoria Province _
home of Mobutu _ served in the armed forces under the dictator
until he was ousted in May 1997 by rebels fighting under Kabila.
	   In contrast to November 1996, when fighting for Goma between
Mobutu's forces and the rebels was heavy and looting widespread,
shops in the sprawling town Tuesday were well-stocked and banks
were open.
	   Life under the new military administration appeared to be near
normal. Residents said no shots had been fired, and the change of
power had been peaceful.
	   Ondekane said the rebels represent a cross-section of Congo's
estimated 47 million people, including ethnic groups in Equatoria,
Katanga and Kasai regions.
	   In their villa-turned-army headquarters on the shore of Lake
Kivu, rebel commanders identified themselves as former officers in
the Congolese military who were fed up with Kabila's misuse of
power, corruption and mismanagement.
	   ``We don't want Mobutu III and Mobutu IV,'' said Ondekane, who
ruled out negotiations with Kabila. ``We're looking first to unite.
Then, the politicians will decide what comes next.''

Honduran government battles increase in dengue fever
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By FREDDY CUEVAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Alarmed by a sharp increase in
cases of dengue fever, the Honduran government on Tuesday ordered a
national effort to eradicate the mosquito that spreads the disease.
	   The health ministry said it has recorded 8,100 cases of dengue
this year, four times as many as were reported at the same time
last year.
	   The most affected areas are in the northern, Atlantic provinces
and in the capital, Tegucigalpa.
	   Health Minister Marco Antonio Rosa said he has ordered ``an
intense campaign to fumigate the whole country'' against the Aedes
aegypti mosquito that transmits dengue.
	   Dengue struck more than 28,000 Hondurans in 1995, but only 7,500
in 1996 and 12,000 last year. During that period, 10 people died of
the disease.
	   Dengue, also known as breakbone fever, is characterized by high
fever, intense headache, pain behind the eyes, backache, joint
pains and sometimes a rash.
	   Its more serious form, hemorrhagic dengue, can be fatal. Rosa
said so far only six cases of hemorrhagic dengue have been reported
so far this year.
	   It was the second time the government has tried to rally efforts
against dengue. On July 17, it tried to mobilize 500,000 volunteers
to get rid of the pools of water where the mosquito breeds. But the
drive was not very successful because of limited participation.
	   The New York Times reported this week that scientists fear warm
weather linked to the El Nino phenomenon could lead to increased
cases of dengue, as well as other diseases such as cholera and
malaria this year.
	   There have been serious outbreaks this year in Southeast Asia.
But Mexico has seen a drop in dengue cases. From January to July,
Mexico's Health Secretariat reported 2,173 cases of classic dengue
and 37 of hemorrhagic dengue, compared with 4,683 and 63 for the
same period last year.

Venezuela stock market hits two-year low
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Venezuela's stock market tumbled 4.61
percent Tuesday and hit a 27-month low, brought down by Asian and
Russian financial woes.
	   The Caracas General Stock Index closed at 3989.07, down 192.71
points from Monday's official close of 4181.78. It was the lowest
level since May 14, 1996, when it hit 3,962.82.
	   Venezuela's economy has been stung by plummeting oil prices that
hit a 12-year low in June. However, most analysts attributed
Tuesday's drop to the troubles in Asia and Russia.
	   Elsewhere in Latin America, the Buenos Aires stock market fell
almost seven percent and the Sao Paulo stock market dropped by 4.6
percent.

FBI collects traces of explosives as survivor search intensifies

	   NAIROBI, Kenya _ Rescuers on Wednesday were nearing the bottom
of a mountain of twisted steel and concrete chunks holding the last
hope of survivors of the embassy bombing in Nairobi.
	   No one has been brought out alive since Saturday, the day after
terrorist attacks in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, the Tanzanian
capital, killed at least 234 people and injured some 5,000.
	   Investigators suspect the powerful explosive Semtex was used in
the attacks, but no link has been found to any particular group, a
senior U.S. official in Washington said Tuesday on condition of
anonymity.
	   In Tanzania, police working with the U.S. FBI arrested 14
people; six Sudanese, six Iraqis, a Somali and a Turk. Tanzania's
ambassador to Washington, Mustafa Salim Nyang'anyi, said some of
those arrested ``may have had a hand'' in the attack. He said they
had been turned over to the FBI for interrogation.
	   Meanwhile, a dozen FBI agents raked Laibon Road outside the
wrecked embassy in Dar es Salaam, searching debris for evidence.
The FBI said more than 175 agents are either in or heading to the
two nations.
	   In Nairobi, FBI agents used cotton balls to swab fences, walls
and metal fragments at the bomb site to capture traces of
explosives. They worked behind a shroud of black fabric, not far
from a spot Israeli rescuers said might hold two survivors.
	   But Israeli rescue workers said nothing had been heard since
Monday from a spot they believed might be holding a woman named
Rose who spoke to Kenyan Red Cross workers on Sunday. On Monday
rescuers heard tapping, raising the hopes of Rose's husband.
	   ``I'm hoping that she's still alive,'' Lawrence Irungu said at
the bomb site. ``That's my prayers. ... I will stay here until I
see the end of the operation.''
	   Rescue workers expected to reach the bottom of the twisted pile
late Wednesday or early Thursday.
	   ``We're hoping that there are still a couple of void areas that
may be big enough for a person to survive in,'' said Jim Chinn,
spokesman for an American rescue team.
	   ``However, the further we go down, the more doubtful that it's
starting to look. We're getting to a point now where the debris is
more compact,'' he said.
	   Boy Scouts interrupted a jamboree to sweep up debris, while Red
Cross volunteers gathered eyeglasses, pens, torn ID papers and
other personal items, said Red Cross spokeswoman Nina Galbe.
	   In a rare show of solidarity, President Daniel arap Moi and
leaders of four opposition parties visited the bomb site and
appealed to Kenyans to remain united.
	   The remains of a vehicle smashed against the embassy's back wall
and believed to have carried the bomb, was shrouded beneath a red
and white plastic sheet
	   Capt. Rhyl Jones, garrison engineer of the British Army in
Kenya, who was working at the bomb site, said nobody knows if the
vehicle actually carried the bomb. He believes the bomb was
professionally made.
	   ``My opinion is that it was definitely a commercial explosive.
This wasn't a homemade device,'' said Jones, a demolition expert
who has investigated Irish Republican Army bombings in Northern
Ireland.
	   The bomb left a 4-meter-diameter (13-foot-diameter) crater
behind the embassy, Jones said. Kenyan Television on Tuesday night
quoted a source as saying an engine block had been found in the
crater.
	   A Kenyan guard at the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi told the East
African Standard that he witnessed the attack.
	   Joash Okindo was quoted as saying he and his colleagues, armed
only with short wooden clubs, stopped five men in a truck at a
barrier to the embassy's front parking lot and forced them to turn
into the rear parking lot.
	   The attackers jumped from the truck and opened fire with
automatic rifles, shooting a guard and then hurling a grenade into
the compound. At least one Marine returned fire and moments later
the truck exploded, Okindo told the paper.
	   Okindo ``resisted heroically,'' U.S. State Department spokesman
James Foley said in Washington. His legs and left arm were almost
severed, according to the paper.
	   In Washington, the United States announced it has suspended
operations at about half a dozen embassies because of increased
threats of terrorism. It named U.S. interests in Egypt, Malaysia
and Yemen as among the threatened targets.
	   Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering said Tuesday that some
embassies also would have to be relocated to guard against
terrorist attacks. The embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, which
sustained massive damages in bombings last Friday, also will have
to be rebuilt.

New government announces belt-tightening
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP)_ In its first move to revive Colombia's
ailing economy, President Andres Pastrana's government announced
Tuesday it would cut government spending by dlrs 730 million and
severely curtail bureaucratic fat.
	   Finance Minister Juan Camilo Restrepo was short on specifics,
which he said he would announce at a later date.
	   ``We discovered that even ministers' chauffeurs had cellular
phones paid for with public funds,'' Restrepo commented on what he
deemed wasted taxpayer dollars during President Ernesto Samper's
tenure.
	   He said the government would not shrink public employee
payrolls, however.
	   As an opposition senator during Samper's tenure, Restrepo was
among people who accused the scandal-plagued former president of
raiding the treasury and paying off political supporters with
pork-barrel projects.
	   Samper left the country with its worst-ever fiscal deficit
	   Pastrana, who took office Friday, has promised to decrease tax
evasion, estimated at more than 30 percent, cut the national sales
tax from 16 percent to 12 percent and bring the economy out of a
slump that saw interest rates skyrocket and unemployment soar to 16
percent.
	   ``This is the manner in which we'll start to tighten the belt on
a fiscal and budgetary situation which is really calamitous, which
we inherited from the outgoing government,'' Restrepo said. He said
he was working on a plan to reduce the sales tax next year by one
percentage point.
	   The announced spending for fiscal 1998 cut amounts to some 0.8
percent of gross domestic product.

Moderate earthquake hits northwestern Japan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in last graf with three smaller quakes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A moderate earthquake with a preliminary magnitude
of 4.1 hit an area of northwestern Japan on Wednesday. There were
no immediate reports of damage or injuries.
	   The quake was centered about 10 kilometers (6 miles) underground
in central Nagano prefecture, or state, 210 kilometers (130 miles)
northwest of Tokyo and struck at 9:40 a.m. (0040 GMT), the
Meteorological Agency announced.
	   There was no danger of tsunami, undersea waves triggered by
volcanic activity or earthquakes, arising from the temblor.
	   A magnitude 4 quake can shake houses and buildings and cause
hanging objects such as lamps to swing.
	   Japan is one of the world's most earthquake-prone nations as it
sits atop four tectonic plates, slabs of land that move across the
earth's surface.
	   The same region was subsequently hit by three smaller quakes
between 9:46 a.m. (0046 GMT) and 10 a.m. (0100 GMT) with
preliminary magnitudes of 3.0, 2.9 and 2.7 respectively, the agency
said.

<TEXT>
	   WELLESLEY, Massachusetts (AP) _ Third-seeded Lisa Raymond beat
Amy Frazier 6-4, 6-2 Tuesday at Babson College in the first-round
of the BostonCup of the WTA Tour before the day's matches were
suspended due to storms.
	   The suspension came after Mary Joe Fernandez of Miami had taken
a 4-1 lead in the first set of her match against fourth-seeded
Silvia Farina of Italy. The match was to resume Wednesday.
	   Tournament officials suspended play six times during the second
day of the tournament as rain and lightning played havoc with the
tournament schedule.
	   Raymond, who won her doubles match with partner Rennae Stubbs of
Australia on the opening day of the BostonCup, dominated her match
against Frazier.
	   ``This is one of the strongest fields I've ever seen for a
tournament of this nature,'' Raymond said. ``I just tried to stay
aggressive and hit the ball solid.''
	   Frazier, ranked as high as 13th in 1995, said, ``Lisa was
aggressive and had me on the defense the whole match.''
	   In other matches played Tuesday, Nana Miyagi of Japan beat
Rachel McQuillan of Australia 6-4, 6-2; Catalina Cristea of Romania
beat Liezel Horn of South Africa 6-4, 6-1; Barbara Schett of
Austria beat Kristina Brandi 6-4, 6-0; Elana Likhoutseva of Russia
led Andrea Glass 6-1, 4-2 when the German retired from the match
due to cramps; Megan Shaugnessy beat Nicole Pratt of Australia 6-2,
6-0; and Olga Barabanschikova of England beat Erika de Leone 6-1,
6-2.

Appleby taking small steps from tragic death of his wife
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   REDMOND, Washington (AP) _ Each step is just as difficult as the
one before. Stuart Appleby doesn't know where the road will lead,
only that it is long.
	   ``This is stage whatever of infinity,'' he said.
	   The drive into Sahalee Country Club was his first to a major
championship without his 25-year-old wife, Renay, at his side to
read off the directions. The practice rounds were the first without
seeing her behind the ropes along the fairway.
	   Three weeks ago, the 27-year-old Australian and his wife were
taking their luggage out of a taxi that was double-parked in front
of a London train station. They were on their way to Paris for a
second honeymoon.
	   Seconds later, she was crushed to death between two cars in a
freak accident.
	   No one expected to see Appleby in the PGA Championship. Even
Appleby had doubts that he could return to a career he and Renay
had built together.
	   ``At my best, I feel good,'' he said. ``At my worst, I feel
terrible.''
	   He wanted to meet with reporters now so he wouldn't have to take
questions at every stop. All that does is take more time away from
time on the course _ and make him fight back tears.
	   On Tuesday, he held back as long as he could.
	   ``The tough times ...'' Appleby started, before tears welled in
his eyes and his voice began to crack.
	   ``The tough times are when you do a lot of thinking,'' he said,
fighting to continue. ``You just wish things were different. I've
just got to bust through this little bubble in front of me.''
	   Renay Appleby's death sent shock waves across PGA tours around
the globe. She was a favorite among players and their wives, having
caddied for her husband when he was trying to make it on the Nike
Tour.
	   When he won for the first time on the PGA Tour two years ago,
she nearly pulled his thumb off as they nervously held hands behind
the 18th green in the Honda Classic as the last group came through.
	   ``I feel very lucky that I knew her,'' Appleby said. ``The time
we spent together was good quality. She was the first prize in a
raffle, and I was lucky enough to win. She changed a lot of
people's lives.''
	   That much has been made clear in the past couple of weeks.
	   Nick Price did not celebrate his first PGA Tour victory of the
year two weeks ago in Memphis without paying tribute to Renay.
Emlyn Aubrey shot 61 on the Nike Tour in his victory two weeks ago
and dedicated it to Renay.
	   Billy Mayfair had tears in his eyes walking up the 18th fairway
toward victory in the Buick Classic on Sunday, thinking about
Renay.
	   ``Obviously, winning and all that was very special to me,''
Mayfair said. ``But my wife Tammie and I said that the first win I
get I'm going to dedicate to Renay.''
	   Appleby has received more letters than he can count, so many
flowers that he was able to put a fresh batch on Renay's grave up
until he left Australia for the PGA Championship.
	   ``Not an hour goes by that I don't think about her _ not an
hour,'' Appleby said. ``Just getting back to golf is very
important.''
	   He figured he had two options, the first of which was not very
appealing.
	   ``I could dig myself in a hole and lose all the potential I
had,'' he said. ``Or I could say I was lucky to get her.''
	   There are more steps ahead on the long journey. Appleby has not
been to their home in Florida since a week before leaving for the
British Open and doesn't look forward to going through the door
without her.
	   He doesn't know what to expect this week in the PGA
Championship, only that he won't be as tight as he usually is when
he steps to the first tee in a major championship.
	   ``I don't think it will be very hard at all,'' he said. ``Nerves
don't concern me. They're so irrelevant right now. I'm ready for
whatever happens.''

Man arrested for threatening to lace cakes with salmonella
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Police have arrested a man in northern Japan for
allegedly trying to blackmail a confectionary shop by threatening
to lace its cakes with salmonella, an official said Wednesday.
	   Tetsuzo Honda was arrested Tuesday on suspicion of trying to
extort 30 million yen (dlrs 204,000) from the shop in Sapporo, 829
kilometers (518 miles) north of Tokyo on the island of Hokkaido,
said a police official, who gave his surname Azuma.
	   The mass-circulation Asahi newspaper said that Honda, a
51-year-old hotel manager, was motovated by a case two weeks ago in
southwestern Japan in which four people were killed after eating
curry laced with cyanide and arsenic.
	   Azuma declined to confirm the report.
	   The poisoned curry case sent shockwaves through Japan, which has
become skittish about poisonings after a religious cult carried out
a sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subways in 1995, killing 12 people.
	   On Monday, ten people in northern Japan suffered nausea and
numbness after drinking tea laced with a toxic sodium compound. The
case has dominated the news this week and has raised fears of
copycat poisonings.

No. 1 Rios upset by Vacek
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES &QL; 
 &UR; By TERRY KINNEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MASON, Ohio (AP) _ Marcelo Rios of Chile, who took over the top
ranking on the ATP Tour this week, was no match Tuesday night for
power-serving Daniel Vacek of the Czech Republic.
	   Vacek, ranked 53rd in tour standings, blew away Rios 6-3, 6-2 in
62 minutes in the second round of the dlrs 2.45 million ATP
Championship.
	   ``I made a lot of mistakes,'' Rios said. ``He was serving big. I
think it's tough to play a guy like that.''
	   Rios, looking lackluster, stayed at the baseline most of the
time, hung his head after hitting numerous returns into the net and
watched helplessly as Vacek repeatedly knocked the ball past him.
	   It was Rios' first tour match as the No. 1 player, although he
held that position for about four weeks earlier this year. It also
was his first match on a hard court since March, and he was
bothered by the lights.
	   ``I always have a tough time at night,'' Rios said. ``I have a
hard time returning big serves at night.''
	   Rios failed to hold serve in the sixth game, so all Vacek had to
do was stay on serve the rest of the set. Vacek broke Rios in the
third game of the second set, won the next game with a 126 mph ace
and broke Rios again in the fifth game.
	   Both players held serve the rest of the way, although Vacek made
the last game interesting, double-faulting at 40-15 and twice more
before putting Rios away.
	   It was Vacek's first win over a No. 1-ranked player, although he
had beaten Rios once in four previous matches.
	   ``I know what to serve and get him off balance a little bit,''
Vacek said. ``I was mixing up quite well, moving around and playing
to spots he doesn't like so well.''
	   In another evening match, Magnus Larsson of Sweden upset
countryman Jonas Bjorkman, the No. 6 seed, 6-7 (2-7), 6-2, 6-3.
	   Earlier, a re-energized Andre Agassi, back in the top 10 for the
first time since January 1997, kept his comeback rolling by beating
Nicolas Kiefer of Germany.
	   Serving in game 12 of the second set and facing elimination,
Agassi won four straight points to force a tiebreaker after falling
behind 30-0, then dominated Kiefer and won 4-6, 7-6 (7-3), 6-2.
	   He seemed to play with more determination after breaking
Kiefer's serve in the ninth game of the second set with a stunning
crosscourt shot that nipped the line.
	   ``I don't think you show up to any tournament and play your best
tennis in the first round,'' Agassi said. ``You've just got to get
through the days when you're not feeling the greatest.''
	   While he was slumping _ he was ranked No. 141 in November _ he
would not have survived a match like this, Agassi said.
	   ``Things like this used to be a quick exit for me,'' he said.
	   But with a new dedication to being No. 1 again has come a
renewed mental toughness.
	   ``It's nice to feel competitive again,'' said Agassi, who now is
No. 9. ``It's nice getting the `W' when you're not at your best.''
	   Kiefer, ranked 25th in the world, never had played Agassi
before. But he looks forward to a rematch.
	   ``It was a good chance to beat him. I just didn't make it,''
Kiefer said. ``I played him very aggressive. I see that I can beat
him.''
	   Meanwhile, two of the tournament's seeded players lost.
	   Thomas Muster of Austria beat 11th-seeded Tim Henman of Britain
6-4, 7-5 and Wayne Ferreira of South Africa defeated 15th-seeded
Felix Mantilla of Spain 7-6 (7-5), 7-5.
	   In other matches, Andrei Medvedev of Ukraine beat Arnaud Clement
of France 6-4, 6-3; Jerome Golmard of France defeated countryman
Nicolas Escude 6-2, 6-7 (2-7), 6-3; Scott Draper of Australia
downed Nicolas Lapentti of Ecuador 6-4, 4-6, 7-5, and Mark
Philippoussis of Australia beat Byron Black of Zimbabwe 6-2, 6-3.
	   Also, 14th-seeded Goran Ivanisevic of Croatia beat Andrew Ilie
of Australia 6-4, 0-6, 6-4; Marco Ondruska of South Africa defeated
Steve Campbell 5-7, 6-2, 6-3; Michael Chang topped Todd Woodbridge
of Australia 6-1, 3-6, 6-2, and Martin Damm of the Czech Republic
beat Mark Woodforde of Australia 6-4, 3-6, 6-2.
	   Pete Sampras, the defending champion and No. 1 seed, was idle
until Wednesday, when six of the top eight seeds play for the first
time.

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Roy Lassiter tied a club record with four
goals as D.C. United crushed Joe Public of Trinidad and Tobago 8-0
Tuesday night in a CONCACAF Champions Cup quarterfinal at RFK
Stadium.
	   Ben Olsen and A.J. Wood added two goals each as United set
franchise records for most goals in a match and largest margin of
victory.
	   The Champions Cup features the top club teams from North
America, Central America and the Caribbean.
	   United plays the winner of Wednesday's quarterfinal between
Firpo of El Salvador and Leon of Mexico in a semfinal match
scheduled for Friday.
	   Two-time defending Major League Soccer champions United
completely overwhelmed the semiprofessional Eastern Lions Tuesday,
scoring four goals in each half.
	   D.C. has won eight consecutive matches with its last loss coming
June 25 at Colorado. United is 13-1 at RFK this year.
	   Lassiter, the MLS leading scorer with 16 goals in 24 games,
scored two goals in each half Tuesday. Lassiter's rare four-goal
performance included scores in the 22nd, 29th, 67th and 72nd
minutes.
	   Olsen, a Project-40 player who joined United after his junior
season at Virginia, had goals in the 13th and 44th minutes and
added two assists.
	   Wood, another Virginia product, scored in the 75th and 92nd
minutes after coming on as a second-half substitute.
	   Back-up United keeper Tom Presthus earned the shutout with seven
saves.

Book on flowers and notes laid in mourning of Diana to be published
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Photographs of the millions of flowers, poems and
notes laid outside the gates of Kensington Palace following the
death of Princess Diana have been gathered together for a book to
be launched this week.
	   ``Flowers in the Park,'' a 96-page paperback, is designed to be
a permanent record of the floral sea that covered acres of grass
outside the princess' former home, where scores of mourners kept a
vigil during the period between her death in a Paris car crash Aug.
31 and her funeral a week later.
	   Volunteers worked for three weeks to clear the bouquets after
her funeral and up to 15 tons (14 metric tons) of flowers left by
mourners at Kensington, Buckingham and St. James's palaces were
composted to regenerate the grass at Kensington Gardens, which was
worn away by the thousands of people who came to pay their respects
to the princess.
	   All proceeds from the book, which will be sold for 10 pounds
(dlrs 16) will go to the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund,
which was set up in the weeks following her death to coordinate the
flood of spontaneous donations from the public.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar dropped against the yen early
Wednesday amid speculation monetary authorities might intervene to
buoy the embattled Japanese currency. Tokyo stocks fell slightly.
	   The dollar bought 146.16 yen in early trading, down 1.25 yen
from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York rate of
147.35 yen overnight.
	   On Tuesday, the dollar soared to 147.61 yen _ the highest since
Aug. 20, 1990, when the dollar hit 147.96 yen.
	   Remarks from Japanese officials hinting at yen-buying
intervention to support the currency prompted profit-taking after
the dollar's recent surge to an eight-year high, traders said.
	   ``We will take appropriate action in the market as necessary,''
said Haruhiko Kuroda, head of the international bureau of the
Finance Ministry.
	   Many market players discounted the likelihood of large-scale
yen-buying by the Bank of Japan, however. Despite the yen's slight
recovery early Wednesday, traders said the currency remains
vulnerable to selling pressure amid continued instability in Asian
markets.
	   Japanese stocks lost ground in early trading on these same
worries over the recent drop in neighboring Asian markets and a
plunge overnight in U.S. stocks traded on Wall Street, trader said.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, meanwhile, the benchmark 225-issue
Nikkei Stock Average fell 56.29 points, or 0.37 percent, to
15,350.70 as of midday. On Tuesday, the Nikkei closed down 219.43
points, or 1.40 percent, marking a seventh consecutive trading day
of losses.
	   ``The market can't find any bullish factors that would prompt
buying, except a reversal of the excessively weak yen seen earlier
today,'' said Takeshi Kubota, a general manager at Meiko Securities
Co.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 112.00 points _ or 1.3
percent _ to close Tuesday at 8,462.85 points.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section, declined 7.36 points, or 0.62 percent, to 1,179.52.
The TOPIX closed down 20.21 points, or 1.67 percent, the day
before.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond was unchanged from Tuesday at 1.180 percent, but its price
fell to 111.91 yen from 111.92 yen the previous day.

Drinkers of traditional sedative prefer kava to sex
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT KEITH REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SUVA, Fiji (AP) _ A traditional drink that produces a mild high
also suppresses the libido and is threatening the future population
of some of Fiji's islands, the Pacific nation's Health Minister Leo
Smith said Wednesday.
	   After touring islands in the Lau group in eastern Fiji, Smith
said village chiefs complained that young men had become so
addicted to drinking kava they had lost their sex drive and were
not marrying or having children.
	   ``Some of Lau's schools have only five students in one class and
next year's intake will be even less,'' Smith said.
	   Kava, made from the powdered root of a pepper plant, piper
methysticum, and water, has been used for generations in ceremonies
and socially in parts of Melanesia, Polynesia and Micronesia.
Often, men sit in a circle, clapping or chanting as half a coconut
shell is passed around as a cup, distributing kava from a communal
bowl.
	   Because of proven antidepressant and sedative qualities similar
to Valium, kava is being processed by some pharmaceutical companies
in Germany and France. It is also sold around the world for use in
homeopathic medicines.
	   Doctors say there are no proven side-effects of kava use,
although long-term excessive use causes the skin to scale.
	   In Fiji, where it is also known as yaqona, kava is increasingly
being used as a susbstitute for beer, which is more expensive.
	   Kava use has risen so steeply here that it is disrupting daily
village work routines. Where once bowls of kava were kept ready for
workers to use socially during a midmorning break, many government
departments and business offices are now banning the product
because of disruption of work.
	   Kava crops fetch more than U.S. dlrs 25,000 an acre and the Fiji
government is encouraging large scale farming to meet the demand
from European and U.S. drug companies who are developing
tranquilizers and antidepressants from the drink.
	   Fiji Medical Department nutritionists have warned of another
danger from kava _ that some Fijian children are becoming
malnourished because their parents are pulling up traditional food
gardens to grow kava.
	   Growers are switching their children to diets based on processed
food which are high in salt and fat, authorities say.

Jobless man arrested for setting fire to Hiroshima paper cranes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ An unemployed man has been arrested for allegedly
setting fire to thousands of paper cranes folded to commemorate the
53rd anniversary of the world's first atomic bombing in Hiroshima,
police said Wednesday.
	   Kiuchi Hiraga, a Hiroshima police spokesman, identified the
arrested man as Yoshikatsu Nakano, 55. Hiraga said Nakano was from
Japan's northernmost main island of Hokkaido and had no job. The
man was arrested on a charge of damaging.
	   Hiraga said police arrested Nakano at Hiroshima's Peace Memorial
Park on Tuesday night after a security guard saw him set fire to
the paper cranes. The motive was unknown, Hiraga said.
	   The cranes, a Japanese symbol of peace and longevity, had been
placed in the park that same night, he said.
	   Tuesday's incident was the second suspected case of paper cranes
being burned recently in Hiroshima, which on Thursday marked the
53rd anniversary of the August 6, 1945 U.S. atomic attack on the
southwestern Japanese city.
	   Last Tuesday, 5,800 ``origami'' folded cranes were found burning
in a Hiroshima schoolyard. Hiraga said police were investigating
whether Hirano was also responsible for that incident.
	   In Japan, paper cranes are also presented as encouragement to
people fighting illness or to those participating in a sporting
event.
	   If convicted, Nakano will face up to three years in prison, or a
fine of 300,000 yen (dlrs 2,050).
	   The atomic bombing of Hiroshima, the world's first, killed about
140,000 people. The United States dropped a second bomb on the city
of Nagasaki on Aug. 9, 1945, killing about 70,000 people.

Report: Yamaha motorcycles lays off 500 Thai workers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Siam Yamaha, the Thai unit of the
Japanese motorcycle and auto parts manufacturer Yamaha Motor Co.,
has laid off 500 workers, the Bangkok Post reported Wednesday.
	   The company has agreed to pay seven months severance, more than
the law requires, the Post quoted workers as saying.
	   Thailand's motor vehicle industry is slumping along with the
country's economy. Thailand is receiving a dlrs 17.2 billion
bailout from the International Monetary Fund.
	   The economy is expected to contract by as much as seven percent
this year. Domestic vehicle sales have plunged.
	   Meanwhile, nearly 2,000 workers laid off by the Thai Melon
Textile Company, one of the largest textile companies in Thailand,
vowed to march to Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai's home to demand
help, the Post reported.
	   Thai Melon closed last month, leaving more than 5,000 workers
jobless. Disputes have arisen over the amount of compensation the
company is willing to pay.
	   More than 2,000 workers have accepted severance payouts from
Thai Melon, but the rest have refused, saying the amounts offered
are below the legal requirement.

No. 1 Rios upset by Vacek
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 12 grafs  &QL; 
 &UR; By TERRY KINNEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MASON, Ohio (AP) _ Marcelo Rios of Chile, who took over the top
ranking on the ATP Tour this week, was no match Tuesday night for
power-serving Daniel Vacek of the Czech Republic.
	   Vacek, ranked 53rd in tour standings, blew away Rios 6-3, 6-2 in
62 minutes in the second round of the dlrs 2.45 million ATP
Championship.
	   ``I made a lot of mistakes,'' Rios said. ``He was serving big. I
think it's tough to play a guy like that.''
	   Rios, looking lackluster, stayed at the baseline most of the
time, hung his head after hitting numerous returns into the net and
watched helplessly as Vacek repeatedly knocked the ball past him.
	   It was Rios' first tour match as the No. 1 player, although he
held that position for about four weeks earlier this year. It also
was his first match on a hard court since March, and he was
bothered by the lights.
	   ``I always have a tough time at night,'' Rios said. ``I have a
hard time returning big serves at night.''
	   Rios failed to hold serve in the sixth game, so all Vacek had to
do was stay on serve the rest of the set. Vacek broke Rios in the
third game of the second set, won the next game with a 126 mph ace
and broke Rios again in the fifth game.
	   Both players held serve the rest of the way, although Vacek made
the last game interesting, double-faulting at 40-15 and twice more
before putting Rios away.
	   It was Vacek's first win over a No. 1-ranked player, although he
had beaten Rios once in four previous matches.
	   ``I know what to serve and get him off balance a little bit,''
Vacek said. ``I was mixing up quite well, moving around and playing
to spots he doesn't like so well.''
	   In another evening match, Magnus Larsson of Sweden upset
countryman Jonas Bjorkman, the No. 6 seed, 6-7 (2-7), 6-2, 6-3.
	   The evening program was rife with upsets. Magnus Larsson of
Sweden defeated countryman Jonas Bjorkman, the No. 6 seed, 6-7

Pioline of France 6-7 (5-7), 7-6 (7-5), 6-4.
