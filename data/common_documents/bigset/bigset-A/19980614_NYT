GORE BACKS AFTER-SCHOOL PROGRAMS FOR L.A. YOUTHS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID R. BAKER and PETER HARTLAUB  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Saying the nation needs to better educate and
protect its latchkey kids, Vice President Al Gore called for the
creation of more after-school programs while speaking at Sutter
Middle School.
</P>
<P>
   Gore pointed to the success of Los Angeles after-school programs
as he addressed about 900 teachers, students, parents and public
officials Saturday at the invitation-only event in the suburban
Winnetka school's shaded quad. He pushed President Clinton's
proposal to spend $1 billion during the next five years on programs
that keep children occupied and supervised before their parents
return home from work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to make this available to every child in every
school,'' Gore said, adding that such programs cut juvenile crime
and keep children away from drugs and alcohol. ``This ought to be
the norm.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's visit to Winnetka was followed by a luncheon at the
suburban Calabasas home of Democratic fund-raiser Sim Farar,
attended by guests including actress Sally Field and singer Nancy
Sinatra.
</P>
<P>
   Billed as as a ``town-hall meeting,'' the hourlong school event
drew children and parents, educators and elected officials. Among
them were Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., and Rep. Brad Sherman,
D-Woodland Hills, both of whom added their own pitches for
after-school programs, as did Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman
Block.
</P>
<P>
   They cited FBI statistics showing that most juvenile crime takes
place between 3 and 8 p.m., and praised the ability of after-school
programs to give students individual attention and bolster their
studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I visit these programs, I get choked up, because I
see these kids are getting what they need,'' Boxer said.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the audience were sold on Gore's idea. Teachers and
school administrators from as far as Orange County arrived eager to
tout their own school districts' programs.
</P>
<P>
   One 17-year-old student from nearby Chatsworth High School
agreed with Gore's call for more after-school activities. While
some youths Scott A. Davis knows are experimenting with drugs, he
said his afternoons are taken up with volleyball at his school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Volleyball practice runs into that danger time,'' Davis told
the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to promoting the need for more after-school
programs, Gore announced that the Los Angeles Unified School
District will receive more than $8 million for earthquake safety
work. The money will be used to brace bookcases and coat windows
with safety film to prevent flying glass.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the meeting involved Gore asking the audience to share
experiences and ideas while he acted as master of ceremonies. He
listened as Alesia Mayfield, a biology teacher at Inglewood High
School, described a program in which her students drafted disaster
plans for the city of Inglewood, near West Los Angeles, using a
grant from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we're setting our sights too low,'' Gore said. ``Maybe
next you'll take on world peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of those in the audience, however, aimed their questions at
Gore. Speaking in Spanish through an interpreter, A. Cortes of
South Central Los Angeles asked what the federal government would
do in the wake of Proposition 227, which all but ended bilingual
education programs in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know this program will help our children to become better
citizens in the future,'' Cortes said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore responded that the administration would work within the
limits of the new law to provide the best education possible for
children with limited English skills. But he said he believes the
one-year, English-immersion course required under the new law will
be too short to fully prepare students for learning in English-only
classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe three years is the minimum,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   The town-hall meeting was just one part of the Clinton
administration's efforts to bolster after-school programs. U.S.
Department of Education officials are also coordinating efforts
among teams of school administrators, law enforcement officials,
teachers and parents throughout Southern California to create plans
for expanding such programs.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's fund-raising luncheon in Calabasas kept traffic busy on
Aspen Way, a small cul-de-sac in a gated community near Mulholland
Highway.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time the vice president has ever done a
fund-raiser in the San Fernando Valley,'' Farar said. The luncheon
included about 30 guests.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street, about three dozen residents -- including
scores of children -- set up lawn chairs or sat on the curb to
watch Gore and the celebrities arrive.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd clapped and cheered as Gore walked in the house, and
residents said he crossed the street and shook their hands after
lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sounds like a pretty good politician, but I don't know
exactly what vice presidents do,'' said 13-year-old Lisa Schopler,
who lives down the street from Farar.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors have gotten used to celebrities on their quiet street.
Farar has had other famous guests, and rapper Mack-10 moved into
the largest house on the block earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Secret Service agents roamed, politely asking residents to stay
on their own property.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more guys with plugs in their ears than when Ted
Kennedy came last year,'' next-door neighbor Karl Reinecker said,
packing up his folding chair.

GROWTH INITIATIVE HITS TWIN ICEBERGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KATHLEEN INGLEY  
 and MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It seemed like the unsinkable plan: Slapping tough controls on
uncontrolled growth.
</P>
<P>
   All the polls showed tremendous public support for a ballot
initiative to fight sprawl. It struck so much fear into business
interests and lawmakers that they put together their own competing
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   But the environmentalists' plan to manage growth suddenly sank
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to collect enough signatures by the July 2 filing
deadline, they called off their petition drive to put the Citizens
Growth Management Initiative on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   It hit two icebergs: Time and money.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's so disappointing and what's so frustrating is we know
this would be successful if it was on the ballot,'' said Sandy
Bahr, conservation coordinator for the local chapter of the Sierra
Club. ``All we needed was for one or two people to come through
early with some additional funds.''
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the Titanic, the growth management initiative isn't
permanently scuttled.
</P>
<P>
   Right after the November elections, as soon as it's legal to
start, environmentalists say they'll launch a petition drive to put
the measure on the ballot in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing we've learned is that our proposal is solid,'' said
Peter Martori, chairman of Citizens for Growth Management, the
umbrella group supporting the initiative. ``It has the basic
elements that the public is going to support.'' &QL; 
LINE IN THE SAND &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, though, he fears that developers will rush to
get projects approved and bulldozers will blade away more of the
desert.
</P>
<P>
   The growth-management initiative draws a line in the sand.
Cities and counties would have to set boundaries to limit urban
sprawl, subject to voter approval. Developers would have to
shoulder the full cost of roads, schools and other new public
facilities that serve their projects. Services could not be
extended beyond the growth boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Center for Law in the Public Interest, the Sierra
Club and others worried about growth began working on the
initiative three years ago. Last year, they passed around drafts of
the initiative to a wide range of people, continually tweaking the
ideas and language.
</P>
<P>
   The target for kicking off their signature drive was the end of
1997, but the revisions dragged on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were still fiddling around in February,'' said Pete Chasar,
a Phoenix activist. ``We should have had it finished by the end of
the year.''
</P>
<P>
   The petition drive wasn't launched until March 2. That left just
four months in which to gather 113,000 signatures _ plus a healthy
cushion of names to make up for any signatures that might be
invalidated.  &QL; 
PLEASING TOO MANY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``In hindsight, we shouldn't have spent as long as we did trying
to get so many different groups happy with the language,'' said
Chris Gehlker, a member of the steering committee for the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he said, the group wasted a month haggling over
language about subdivisions in the hopes of winning the Nature
Conservancy's support. When the changes were finally made, the
group explained that it doesn't make political endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney David Baron, the principal author of the initiative,
argued that it was worthwhile taking so much time for feedback on a
complex issue.
</P>
<P>
   The real question, to him, was whether it made sense to shoot
for this November's election.
</P>
<P>
   ``One might argue that we should have waited until 2000, given
the time that was left,'' said Baron, assistant director of the
Center for Law in the Public Interest.
</P>
<P>
   But he worried that people wouldn't be able to focus on a
proposal that far into the future.
</P>
<P>
   Time hurt the proposal on another front.
</P>
<P>
   Many potential supporters sat on their hands as the Legislature
worked on its own growth plan. That in itself took months.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people felt the Legislature might do something good''
so they were reluctant to lend support or dip into their wallets,
the Sierra Club's Bahr said.  &QL; 
`GROWING SMARTER' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers made no secret that one of their goals was to derail
the environmentalists' initiative.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature finally approved a plan, called Growing Smarter,
3{ weeks ago. It requires communities to adopt general plans every
10 years with specific points, such as strategies for efficient
transportation and well-timed expansion of sewers, streets and
other infrastructure. Developers must pay their fair share of the
cost of new services for the their projects, but not the entire
cost.
</P>
<P>
   Growing Smarter includes a ballot measure: Voters will decide in
November whether to spend $20 million a year to preserve state
trust land, which might otherwise be developed. The money would be
available for 11 years as matching funds.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Baier, a policy adviser to Gov. Jane Hull, speculates that
the environmentalists pulled out partly because it was ``a pretty
intimidating prospect'' to go up against Growing Smarter.
</P>
<P>
   Hull pushed Growing Smarter, and the business community was
cranking up a massive campaign for it. To complicate the fight,
Growing Smarter contains a ``poison pill,'' killing its funding if
the growth-management initiative also won.  &QL; 
TIME, MONEY RUN OUT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bahr, however, says many saw Growing Smarter as toothless once
it passed, and the money began pouring in for the
environmentalists. But time had run out.
</P>
<P>
   And the piggybank was nearly empty.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the Citizens Growth Management Initiative had
commitments for $150,000. The latest financial report, to be filed
with the Secretary of State's Office at the end of June, likely
will show they actually raised about $60,000, and have about
$10,000 cash on hand.
</P>
<P>
   Sky-high expectations also hobbled the fund-raising. A private
poll in the fall showed 74 percent support for the initiative. Even
a poll by the Arizona Chamber of Commerce, a chief opponent, showed
heavy support.
</P>
<P>
   Bahr recalled, ``When I started calling people, they were
saying, `My God, you need help? I thought this was a slam dunk.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The money was crucial. In Arizona politics, it takes more than
volunteers to gather signatures. It also takes paid circulators,
those folks who sit outside the library or post office with
clipboards of petitions.
</P>
<P>
   Gehlker said that up until the last weekend in May, the group
thought it was on track. &QL; 
PETITION BOMBSHELL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That was when the owner of Lee Petition Management, the company
circulating the petitions, dropped a bombshell: He had only
gathered 7,000 signatures, far less than expected.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, he didn't expect to get many more unless the
environmentalists forked out more than the $1.65 per name that they
had budgeted.
</P>
<P>
   Workers get a cut of the price, so there's more incentive to
push the higher-paying causes.
</P>
<P>
   Derrick Lee, owner of Lee Petition, confirmed that he said they
would have to pay as much as $3 per signature to reach their goal.
</P>
<P>
   The cost jumped this year, he said, because some candidates are
paying $4 a signature. Plus, the state's robust economy means fewer
workers are available to carry petitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they were the only game in town, it would be a different
story,'' Lee said. ``There's just a lot of petitions chasing very
few petitioners.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign also suffered from a lack of organization, said
Marcita Ryon, president of the Coalition of Pinnacle Peak, a group
that supported the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   With such a short time frame, supporters should have been
prepared to leap the moment they filed, she said, but ``they didn't
have a plan that I could see.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, she said, people were eager to sign the petition,
but few people were circulating them.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign chairman Martori countered that ``a strategy for
getting signatures is not real complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   What eats up time is getting organizations to come on board and
training members to pass petitions.
</P>
<P>
   That work took too long for this election, but Martori predicts
it will pay off for the 2000 ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen what groups really have the ability to get people
on the street and run petition drives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He and others say the ballot measure may be tuned up a bit, but
the basics won't change.
</P>
<P>
   Will the public be bored by an extended petition drive?
</P>
<P>
   Not at all, Martori said: ``They're going to still be
experiencing the same stuff that has them upset now. They're paying
the price. This uncontrolled development is eating up the natural
areas they love.'' &QL;

USE OF U.S. MILITARY ON BORDER A `TERRIFYING IMAGE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER AND MARK SHAFFER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. House wants to put troops on the Southwest border to
stem the flow of drugs and illegal immigrants, a proposal critics
say would make the region look like ``East Berlin during the Cold
War.''
</P>
<P>
   The House plan has ignited protests from Arizona Gov. Jane Hull
and officials along both sides of the border.
</P>
<P>
   It authorizes the U.S. military to be dispatched to join with
civilian law enforcement agencies to prevent the entry of
``terrorists, drug traffickers and illegal aliens'' into the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The border is a national security issue, and, by God, the
Congress of the United States better start securing our borders,''
said Rep. James Traficant, D-Ohio, the proposal's author, in a
speech on the House floor. He charged that the Southwest border is
``wide open.''
</P>
<P>
   Although a few politicians in national election campaigns have
called for sending troops to the Mexican border to stem the flow of
immigrants, this is the first time the proposal has actually
approached becoming law. The plan was attached by Traficant to a
$270 billion defense budget bill that was overwhelmingly approved
by the House and will be considered by the Senate this summer _
possibly as soon as next week.
</P>
<P>
   Traficant said his amendment would not deploy troops, but merely
authorize the Pentagon to do so if requested by the U.S. attorney
general or Treasury secretary. The troops, which would ``provide
support'' for the Border Patrol and other agencies, would receive
special law enforcement training and be accompanied by a civilian
officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they (the troops) see a narcotics trafficker, they can
tackle them. They can engage,'' Traficant said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would point out that the Customs Service currently is
working hand in hand with the Florida National Guard to inspect
cargo and vehicles at points of entry on Florida. Why not expand
this successful program?''
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Nogales and Douglas said they were told by the
state's Congressional delegation that the troop deployment in the
state could be 3,000 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Traficant's plan is opposed by the Pentagon and Gen. Barry
McCaffrey, the national drug czar. The proposal is likely to come
up Monday, when McCaffrey, a retired four-star general, meets with
Arizona mayors, journalists and law enforcement officials about his
crusade against drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is ``an affront to our relationship with Mexico, and it
wouldn't work,'' said Jim McDonough, a top McCaffrey strategist.
``We could line up every division we have in the U.S. Army and the
Marine Corps put together, and you couldn't cover that
(2,000-mile-long) border.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Mexican officials are waiting for Congress' next move.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus Reyes-Heroles, Mexico's ambassador to the U.S., called it
typical election-year posturing and said, ``I'm sure that we will
get more initiatives that are contrary to U.S.-Mexico interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an issue for the Americans to decide.''
</P>
<P>
   Reyes-Heroles added, ``We cannot ask the U.S. not to enforce its
migratory policies.''
</P>
<P>
   But Traficant's plan has drawn widespread criticism from Gov.
Jane Hull and the state's border cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've protested this in the strongest terms possible,'' said
Ignacio Barraza, Nogales' assistant city administrator.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., Hull wrote that the
prospect of armed, uniformed soldiers patrolling the streets of
border towns ``creates a terrifying image that threatens our very
nature as a peaceful nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull also noted in the letter that the state had worked for
years to strengthen its relationship with the neighboring Mexican
state of Sonora.
</P>
<P>
   ``Permission to militarize the border is unnecessary and
antagonistic to a country that is working to overcome the many
challenges of a developing nation,'' Hull wrote. ``It is a
confrontational action that will gravely impact relations between
the United States and Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Cruz County Board of Supervisors also sent a letter to
McCain questioning why such a move would be considered ``where many
Santa Cruz County families share commerce, work, play and have
family relatives in a connected society.''
</P>
<P>
   Traficant's plan, in the form of an amendment, was approved May
21 on a vote of 288-132 by the House, which then easily passed the
defense bill it was attached to.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Daniels, a spokesman for the U.S. Border Patrol in Tucson,
warns that there could be many problems in a combined effort by the
Border Patrol and military.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jobs and training are awfully different,'' Daniels said.
``But if we do get help, it couldn't be coming at a better time.
There hasn't been a time in recent memory when it's been more
violent on our border.''
</P>
<P>
   All of the Arizona representatives voted against the measure
except Republican Reps. Matt Salmon and John Shadegg, whose
districts are in the Valley. Several lawmakers who represent border
districts _ for example, Rep. Jim Kolbe _ said during the debate
that Traficant, a former county sheriff from Ohio, didn't seem to
realize the implications of his proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The front line of the war on drugs is just as much in
Youngstown, Ohio, as it is in Nogales, Arizona,'' Kolbe said. ``And
I do not think any of us believe that the 82nd Airborne should be
patrolling the streets of Youngstown, Ohio.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Chet Edwards, D-Texas, said Traficant's amendment could
make border regions ``look like East Berlin during the Cold War.''
</P>
<P>
   The military already performs a border function, including
intelligence. The Air Force operates aerostats looking for planes,
and the National Guard helps unload trucks so they can inspected at
the border.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say law enforcement is different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because people in the military wear uniforms and carry
guns doesn't mean that this (border law enforcement) is either an
appropriate or a wise use of their resources,'' said Chuck
Blanchard, a counsel in the drug czar's office and a former Arizona
state senator. &QL;

Reds maintain hex on Reynolds, top Astros 7-4
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOSEPH DUARTE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
CINCINNATI _ The Red Plague continues to infect Shane Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   With a lack of success against Cincinnati throughout his career,
the righthander must feel like he's on his deathbed every time he
faces the Reds. There still was no cure evident Saturday night as
the Reds homered three times off Reynolds to send the Astros to
their second straight setback, a 7-4 loss before a crowd of 28,055
at Cinergy Field.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the Reds' hits went for extra bases, including
back-to-back home runs by Dmitri Young and Bret Boone in a four-run
fifth inning that turned a 3-1 Astros lead into a 5-3 deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds, who surrendered a leadoff home run to Reggie Sanders
on his fourth pitch of the game, had his five-game winning streak
snapped while dropping to 1-8 with a 5.19 ERA lifetime against
Cincinnati. He had not lost a game since May 6 against the Chicago
Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hit me pretty good,'' said Reynolds, who had gone 5-0
with a 1.89 ERA in his previous six starts. ``When I do seem to
have a pretty good game against them, their pitcher has a pretty
good game. They are one of those teams that hit you, but a lot of
it was my mistakes, making bad pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros dropped to 3-2 on their current seven-game road trip
and saw their lead in the National League Central recede to a game
over the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   It was tale of two Reynoldses on Saturday. The good Reynolds
settled down after Sanders' home run to limit Cincinnati to two
hits over the first four innings. The bad Reynolds gave up a
two-out single to Barry Larkin in the fifth and walked Eddie
Taubensee before Young sent a three-run bomb to right field. Two
pitches later, Boone drilled a shot to right, giving the Reds
back-to-back home runs for only the second time this season.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds (7-4) allowed five runs, seven hits and four walks in a
season-low five innings. Before Saturday, he had pitched six or
more innings in his last 11 starts.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds said most of his problems stemmed from falling behind
in the count on a number of occasions. He threw 114 pitches through
five innings before being relieved in the sixth by Trever Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't getting ahead. That's all it was,'' Reynolds said.
``If you get behind on these guys, more times than not they will
hurt you.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds was not without support, as the Astros rallied to give
him a 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Everett, who has 11 RBIs in his last seven games, tied the
score at 1 in the second inning with a sacrifice fly to left field
that scored Jeff Bagwell, who began the inning with a double.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros added two more runs in the third when Craig Biggio
walked and Derek Bell sent a two-run homer 437 feet to straightaway
center field off Reds starter Scott Klingenbeck (1-1), who recorded
his first National League win.
</P>
<P>
   Klingenbeck allowed four runs on five hits in 5 innings as the
Reds won for only the third time in 11 games. But two of those
victories have come against the Astros, who entered the four-game
series on a five-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Larry Dierker said it's not unusual for a team like
Cincinnati, which has spent almost the entire season in the NL
Central basement, to rise to the occasion in a big series. The
Reds, who have won three of four meetings with the Astros this
year, have scored 14 runs in two games after being held to eight
runs in their previous six.
</P>
<P>
   But Dierker, who got only 3 innings out of starting pitcher Jose
Lima in Friday's 7-1 loss, weren't prepared to give all the praise
to the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just playing flat,'' Dierker said. ``They look like they
are inspired. That's what we have to face right now because we are
in first place. Every team that plays us is going to get up a
little more than they might ordinarily, and we have to get up with
them. Sometimes you can't always do that. I'm not saying that we
weren't up for the game, but we were just flat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty good reminder of how hard it's going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros scored their final run in the sixth when Bagwell
doubled down the right-field line and Tony Eusebio delivered a
two-out RBI single to slice the Reds' lead to 5-4. Ricky Gutierrez
walked to put the tying run at second base, but Reds reliever Danny
Graves got pinch hitter J.R. Phillips to fly out to left.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds added two insurance runs in the eighth when Boone hit a
leadoff single, pinch hitter Eduardo Perez singled, and Chris
Stynes doubled home a run off Astros reliever Mike Magnante.
Sanders had a run-scoring groundout to give the Reds a three-run
cushion.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Shaw pitched the ninth inning for his 18th save. He has not
allowed an earned run in his last 19 appearances, a span of 25
innings.

U.S. WEIGHS COORDINATOR FOR DRUG BATLE IN SOUTHWEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States, overrun by drug traffic from
Mexico, might assign responsibility for all of its Southwest border
drug-control efforts to a single official, The Republic has
learned.
</P>
<P>
   An ``in-charge'' federal official is needed because
drug-fighting efforts by nearly a dozen federal agencies along the
2,000-mile-long border are disjointed and hampered by inter-service
rivalries, according to top strategists in the office of Gen. Barry
McCaffrey, the national drug czar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to come to agreements on who does what and who answers
to whom,'' said Jim McDonough, strategic planning director for
McCaffrey. ``We're going to estab lish, at the end of all this, a
coordinator for along the border, a single person.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten primary agencies are battling cocaine, marijuana, methamphet
amine and heroin traffic at 24 border entry points, but no single
individual or agency oversees the ``big picture.''
</P>
<P>
   As traffickers found increasingly sophisticated methods to evade
de tection, seizures of cocaine along the border hit a 10-year low
last year. About 57 percent of the co caine entering the United
States is estimated to cross the Southwest border. Last year,
900,000 U.S.-bound trucks _ about a quarter of the total crossing
the border _ were subjected to drug control inspec tions. Cocaine
was found in just 16.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has been prod ding Mexico to aggressively
combat official corruption that hinders its fight against drug
lords. Some in Congress complained that the United States should
have withheld its recent certification of Mexico's drug-fight ing
efforts until further progress was documented.
</P>
<P>
   The agencies _ including the Border Patrol, Customs Service and
Immigration and Naturalization Service _ have been meeting since
the summer of 1996 about border issues. McDonough has set the end
of the summer as a target for finalizing a plan for a border
coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably what it's going to be is, Agency X has got it for two
years, then Agency Y has got it for two years. And then there is a
staff under that singular person com prised of representatives of
(various agencies),'' McDonough said.
</P>
<P>
   Congress created McCaffrey's of fice in 1988 to develop a
drug-con trol strategy. Part of his job is to minimize rivalries
among a host of federal agencies and prod them into better
supporting the drug fight.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey is scheduled to meet Monday with Arizona mayors and
law enforcement officials in the Valley about his crusade against
drugs. The retired, four-star general toured the Southwest border
in August, including a stop at Nogales, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for a Southwest border viceroy is derived partly from a
memorandum prepared by the drug czar's office last October
concluding the United States needed to revamp its $1.7
billion-per-year effort to curtail the flow of drugs from Mexico
and Central America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our current interdiction efforts almost completely fail to
achieve our purpose of reducing the flow of cocaine, heroine and
methamphet amine across the (Southwest) bor der,'' said the
memorandum, which was given to Congress and to The Republic.
</P>
<P>
   The memorandum recommended better accountability and a strategy
emphasizing improved intelligence and high-tech drug-screening
equip ment. A White House task force has been studying U.S.
intelligence ca pabilities on the drug issue and is due to release
its findings June 22.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the drug czar's office said they have found alarm
ing variations in the level of efficient cooperation among federal
departments at the arrival zones. At some entry areas, federal
agencies can't agree on which one should handle even fundamental
tasks _ such as inspecting incoming vehi cles for drugs _ and so
the responsibility is split.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not smart to have one lane handled by Customs, one lane
by INS (as occurs at some entry points),'' McDonough said. ``You
will have different standard operat ing procedures in each lane.''
</P>
<P>
   Cell phone-equipped spotters working for drug traffickers ``can
figure out the pattern of the individ ual agent based on which
agency is responsible for that lane,'' he said. ``A druggie might
say of one agent, `He's a little bit loose looking under the car.'
Better to have a single, effective standard operating proce dure,
which means you put one agency in charge.''
</P>
<P>
   During the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, $1.7 billion was
spent for federal drug-control activities along the border,
supporting more than 7,700 special agents. &QL;

ANGELS CRUSH RANGERS, 18-6
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ It appears that the Rangers must implement
change.
</P>
<P>
   Their rotation demands it.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Aaron Sele, the collection's most consistent member
this season, sank to the level established by his peers during last
night's 18-6 loss to the Anaheim Angels at The Ballpark in
Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   A prolific offense put the Rangers in first place.
</P>
<P>
   This rotation will apparently pitch the Rangers out of first
place, and that could occur as early as tonight.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels, who moved within a half-game of the first-place
Rangers in the American League West, generated a season-best 18
runs with a season-high 21 hits and matched their single-game team
record for doubles with eight.
</P>
<P>
   Sele (9-4) surrendered a good portion of that during his
four-inning appearance. The Rangers' rotation, which entered this
game with the league's third-worst earned-run average (5.62), saw
it rise to 5.72 after Sele's performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of anything we did very well tonight,'' Rangers
manager Johnny Oates said. ``I'm very disappointed in tonight's
performance. We didn't make a whole lot of good pitches. It was
just one of those nights, and I want to make sure we don't keep
playing that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates apparently had a closed-door meeting with the players
after the lopsided loss in which the Rangers committed three
errors. He refused to comment on it.
</P>
<P>
   Sele surrendered eight runs (seven earned) on seven hits and two
walks and failed to retire any of the six batters the Angels sent
to the plate against him during their seven-run fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Gary DiSarcina, the Angels' No. 9 hitter, went 5-for-5
with two doubles and a triple and drove in four runs. Center
fielder Jim Edmonds collected four hits, including three doubles,
and drove in three runs during his six at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Angels left-hander Jarrod Washburn (2-0) kept the Rangers in
check after a shaky first inning in which he issued two walks,
including one intentional to designated hitter Juan Gonzalez, and
fell victim to an error by DiSarcina.
</P>
<P>
   A two-out walk drawn by right fielder/first baseman Mike Simms
with the bases loaded forced in the Rangers' first run, and
Washburn _ making only his third major-league start _ hurt his
cause by falling behind in the count to catcher Bill Haselman.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' opportunity for a big inning, though, melted in the
Texas heat with the next pitch. Haselman chased a 3-0 pitch out of
the strike zone and produced a harmless fly ball that settled in
the glove of Angels third baseman Dave Hollins for the inning's
final out.
</P>
<P>
   Washburn later would allow sixth- and seventh-inning solo home
runs to Simms and outfielder Roberto Kelly, respectively, but that
became moot after the Angels' seven-run fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels won the first two games of this four-game set because
of the performance of their rotation. Right-hander Omar Olivares
surrendered only one run during 6 2/3 innings in Friday's 5-1
victory, and Washburn allowed three runs (two earned) on five hits
during seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers right-hander John Burkett and Sele surrendered 13 runs
(12 earned) on 14 hits in 11 2/3 innings during these two games.

Fedorov scores game-winner to give Wings 3-0 finals lead over Caps
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By NEIL HOHLFELD &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
WASHINGTON _ For eight games, Sergei Fedorov hardly was living up
to his billing as the $12 million man.
</P>
<P>
   Fedorov, the Detroit Red Wings superstar, had scored one goal in
the past eight playoff games before Saturday night. That's hardly
what the Red Wings expected when they signed Fedorov to a contract
in March that had a $12 million bonus clause if Detroit advanced to
the NHL Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings advanced, but Fedorov scored only once in the
six-game victory over the Dallas Stars. He was blanked in the first
two games of the Stanley Cup finals against Washington, even though
Fedorov launched a remarkable 13 shots on goal in Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   Game 3 was a different matter. With the teams tied at 1 late in
the third period, Fedorov moved neatly in on Washington Capitals
goaltender Olaf Kolzig and scored to give the Red Wings a 2-1 win
and commanding 3-0 lead in the best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big-time goal by a big-time player,'' said Detroit
coach Scotty Bowman. ``He showed his speed and made a great play.
You could sense something like this was coming from him.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington overcame a horrific first period in which it was
outshot 13-1 and tied the score at 1 just five minutes before
Fedorov's game-winner. Brian Bellows' power-play goal at 10:35
breathed life into the Capitals.
</P>
<P>
   Fedorov snuffed it out with a nifty move down the right side. He
fired the puck through the legs of Washington defenseman Calle
Johansson and beat Kolzig on the glove side.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you don't score for a long time, there are a lot of
reasons,'' Fedorov said. ``Tonight, I generated a lot of speed
through the neutral zone and was on top of my game. Dougie (Brown)
threw me the puck, and I let it go on the near side.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings became the first team to win the first three games
of a Stanley Cup finals by one goal each since the 1976 Montreal
Canadiens did it to Philadelphia. The coach of that Montreal team?
Bowman.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings will try for their second straight Stanley Cup
sweep in Game 4 on Tuesday night at Washington. Once again, they
scored the first goal Saturday night, running their record to 12-1
in this playoff season when they score first.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the sellout crowd of 19,470 at MCI Center worked
itself into a frenzy in the final moments before the puck was
dropped to start the first Stanley Cup finals game in Washington
franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-five seconds into the game, the building went silent _
with the exception of the 1,500 or so vocal Red Wings fans
scattered around the upper reaches of the new arena.
</P>
<P>
   Red Wings captain Steve Yzerman put on a burst of speed and flew
past Washington's Esa Tikkanen down the left side. With Tikkanen
pulling him down, Yzerman slid a weak shot toward Kolzig.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, the puck squirted free after Kolzig's save. Tomas
Holmstrom, who has become a major offensive factor during the
playoffs, beat Washington's Todd Krygier to the rebound and slipped
it behind Kolzig, who was lying on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit's first shot of the game put Washington in an uphill
battle. Holmstrom's seventh goal of the playoffs stunned the
Capitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked so much about a fast start in the first period and
then _ bang! _ 35 seconds in we score a goal,'' Bowman said. ``That
gives the whole team a lift.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever steam the Capitals should have had seemed to vaporize.
The Red Wings won nearly every battle for the puck along the
boards; the Caps were busy giving away the puck nine times in the
period.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of a terribly lopsided first period, the only part of
the stats sheet Washington coach Ron Wilson could possibly have not
blanched at was the score.
</P>
<P>
   The Caps had one shot on goal _ a weak lob from the left point
20 seconds into the game. Detroit outshot Washington 13-1,
continuing the dominance of the first two games when the Wings held
a 91-50 edge.
</P>
<P>
   The single shot tied a mark for fewest shots in a regulation
period of a Stanley Cup finals game since 1968. The other club with
one shot was Detroit _ in the final period of Game 4 when New
Jersey swept the Red Wings in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``We basically didn't show up for the first period,'' Wilson
said. ``Why? I don't know. I'll have to stay up all night tonight
to try to analyze it. I mean, you work so hard to get here, and we
have had some just not play very well at all at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   To an extent, things were better in the second period, when the
Caps took 12 shots on goal, several putting Detroit goaltender
Chris Osgood to the test. But the result was the same as the second
period ended with Detroit ahead 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   While the Wings were short-handed early in the second, a shot by
Washington's Jeff Toms deflected off the skate of a Detroit player
and skittered behind Osgood. He reacted quickly, grabbing the puck
before it crossed the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   While the Caps were on the power play midway through the period,
Osgood turned away Adam Oates on a point-blank shot. Shortly after
that, Osgood made a sliding pad save on Peter Bondra. With less
than two minutes left in the second period, Osgood robbed Bondra
again, this time with his glove.
</P>
<P>
   The Caps' plan in the final period seemed to be firing the puck
into the Red Wings' zone as much as possible. Long shots have been
Osgood's undoing throughout the playoffs, and Washington tried
everything possible to break through against the Detroit
goaltender.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Bellows jammed home the puck from short distance to
draw the Caps even. Darren McCarty went off at 9:22 for tripping,
giving Washington a chance. As Oates was driving toward the net,
Detroit penalty killer Kirk Maltby slid across the crease, trying
to deflect the puck away from the net.
</P>
<P>
   Problem was, he deflected it to Bellows, who was at the side of
the net and stuck it behind Osgood for the tying goal at 10:35. The
Caps, ineffective all night on the power play and booed at times by
their home fans, had life.
</P>
<P>
   But only briefly. Fedorov reached down and regained his scoring
touch at just the right time for the Wings, who are poised on the
verge of back-to-back NHL titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you analyze this series, we're only one goal better than
they are each night,'' Bowman said. ``But they (the Wings) have
been in this position before. We'll remind them it's not a
three-game series. It's a four-game series.''

FEDOROV, RED WINGS FORGE AHEAD
</HEADLINE>
 HKN-REDWINGS-CAPITALS-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By Nancy L. Marrapese 
c.1998 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Detroit Red Wings say they have won nothing
yet, that the fourth victory in the Stanley Cup finals is the
hardest to earn.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitals, on the brink of becoming the fourth straight team
to be swept from the finals, say they are not dead yet, that they
still can come back and make a series of it.
</P>
<P>
   But after three games, all Detroit victories, including Saturday
night's 2-1 thriller, it appears the defending Stanley Cup champion
Red Wings will be crowned the NHL's best team again.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third straight game decided by one goal. The last
time the first three games of the finals were decided by a goal was
in 1976, the year Montreal swept the Flyers.
</P>
<P>
   After a dreadful start, the Capitals made a game of it and
appeared they might make a series of it when they tied the game,
1-1, at 10:35 of the third period. Adam Oates came out of the left
corner toward the net and his shot glanced off Kirk Maltby and
right to Brian Bellows, who beat Red Wings goalie Chris Osgood at
the left post for the equalizer.
</P>
<P>
   But Sergei Fedorov, who was shut out despite landing 13 shots in
Game 2, buried the Capitals with 4:51 left in regulation when he
skated the puck through the neutral zone, cut over the blue line
and snapped a shot from the right circle that went off the stick of
Calle Johansson and beat goalie Olaf Kolzig to the glove side.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big-time goal by a big-time player,'' said Red Wings
coach Scotty Bowman.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing, 2-0, in the series, the Capitals were hoping the home
crowd, familiar ice, and desperate position would spark them in the
early going of Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't happen, not even close.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitals came out horrendously in the first period. They put
just a single shot on Osgood _ who entered the game with a 6-0
career mark against the Capitals _ and that was in the opening 20
seconds. Only defenseman Mark Tinordi was able to get anything
through to the net. The Detroit defense was tremendous, completely
preventing the Capitals from forechecking. The one shot tied for
the fewest shots in a period of a Stanley Cup finals game since
1968. The Red Wings also landed just one shot in the third period
of the fourth and final game when they were swept by New Jersey in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their dominance, the Red Wings, who poured 14 shots on
Kolzig in the opening 20 minutes, scored just once _ on their first
shot.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Yzerman, who has had an outstanding series, skated down
through the left circle and got off a shot on Kolzig despite being
hauled down by Esa Tikkanen. The puck went into Kolzig, who was
lying on the ice, but the goalie couldn't contain it and squirted
out around his pads. Tomas Holmstrom, while being hooked from
behind by Todd Krygier, popped in the loose puck at the right post
and the Red Wings had a 1-0 lead just 35 seconds in.
</P>
<P>
   Kolzig said he didn't think Holmstrom's goal should have been
allowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really consider it a goal, period,'' Kolzig said. ``I
think the whistle should've been blown and I think a lot of my
teammates agree with me. I think (referee Terry Gregson) was just
maybe warming up his whistle and it hadn't gotten warm yet. It
wasn't the deciding factor in the hockey game by any means but it
did take a lot of the wind out of us early.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington coach Ron Wilson said before the game he wanted his
players to come out and be more physical than they had in Game 2.
However, instead of physical play, three of his veterans _ Chris
Simon, Dale Hunter, and Phil Housley _ took ill-advised penalties.
Kolzig, however, who entered the game 0-5 in his career against the
Red Wings, prevented Detroit from building on its lead by thwarting
the power plays.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitals woke up in the middle period, outshooting their
guests, 12-11, but were unable to dent Osgood despite some terrific
opportunities. Their best chance came with 1:42 left during a
two-on-one break when Peter Bondra teed up a slapper high in the
left circle. Osgood, way out of his net, made a terrific glove
save, setting the stage for the dramatic third.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a very tough hockey game,'' said Bowman. ``We had to
use everybody.''

BOUT IS TARGET PRACTICE FOR DE LA HOYA
</HEADLINE>
 BOX-DELAHOYA-CHARPENTIER-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By Ron Borges 
c.1998 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL PASO _ In less than nine minutes, Oscar De La Hoya left
45,368 people on their feet by knocking Patrick Charpentier off
his.
</P>
<P>
   The World Boxing Council welterweight champion wasted little
time in ridding himself of the so-called challenge of the No. 1
contender, dropping the outgunned Charpentier three times in the
third round to force a halt to what was an utterly one-sided match
from the moment it began.
</P>
<P>
   Referee Laurence Cole was watching Charpentier closely each time
he scrambled back up off the floor of the Sun Bowl and the third
time he got up Cole stepped in quickly to make sure there would be
no fourth collapse, ending the bout at 1:56 of the round.
</P>
<P>
   When he did, the highly partisan crowd exploded. It had been
given what it had come for. It had been given an execution.
Blending right into the Hispanic flavor of the evening, it had been
more bullfight than boxing match and it was obvious from the
opening moments who was the matador because De La Hoya came in
dressed like one.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did just what he was brought here for,'' said veteran
trainer Teddy Atlas, who called the fight on a national radio
broadcast. ``He was here to get annihilated and that's what
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   That process began quickly. When Charpentier got back to the
safe haven of his corner after the second round, he heaved a sigh
of relief like a man who just had heard the Supreme Court had
granted him a stay of execution. That stay lasted only for the
minute he was allowed to stay in his corner.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after he reemerged in De La Hoya's sights, the champion
bounced a left hook off his head and sent him to the canvas.
Charpentier got up quickly but was soon back on the floor when De
La Hoya nailed him with two body shots followed by a perfect left
uppercut to the point of the chin.
</P>
<P>
   This was no longer a boxing match. It was target practice and
Charpentier seemed to realize it. When he got up the second time
his look was different, his eyes saying he knew he would not remain
upright for long.
</P>
<P>
   He did not.
</P>
<P>
   Now hesitant to come forward and unable to retreat quickly
enough to get to safety as De La Hoya stalked him, the challenger
finally threw a half-hearted jab and De La Hoya answered it
immediately with a crushing right hand over the top of it that
drove Charpentier to the floor for the final time.
</P>
<P>
   That punch landed so squarely in the middle of Charpentier's
face it appeared he had been under orders not to move it a
centimeter in either direction. He was a bearded target now and
Cole knew it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no three-knockdown rule,'' Cole said. ``I stopped
it. He was definitely dazed. After the second knockdown I stayed
close to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Charpentier, so did De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no problems out there,'' De La Hoya (28-0, 23 KOs) said.
``Once I hurt him, I knew the knockout was coming. Everything
worked perfectly.''
</P>
<P>
   Including Charpentier, who had been brought to West Texas from
France to do exactly what he did Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Fall down in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the evening, it seemed there might be no fight, which
some might say remained the case even once the first bell rang.
</P>
<P>
   A powerful wind kicked up unexpectedly at approximately 6:20
p.m., battering the metal truss above the ring that held many of
HBO's cameras. As the stanchions that held it up began to sway,
someone in HBO's control truck noticed that a situation was
developing at ringside that could lead to an unexpected knockout if
something wasn't done so executive producer Ross Greenberg ordered
that ring announcer Michael Buffer and the media and officials
evacuate the area so the truss could be lowered by 15 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly the Sun Bowl had more obstructed view seats than the
old Boston Garden but at least it created a situation that allowed
the bouts to go on. When they did, WBC lightweight champion Stevie
Johnston was wishing a tsunami had hit.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston fought 12 less-than-scintillating rounds against
challenger Cesar Bazan on the undercard, losing a split decision
when judges David Harris and Omar Minton had the Mexican-born Bazan
a 115-113 winner, while Oren Shellenberger saw Johnston winning
easily, 116-112.
</P>
<P>
   As his title slipped away by split decision, Johnston stood
still in his silent corner. No one raised a protest.
</P>
<P>
   Kind of like Patrick Charpentier a few minutes later.

<P>
   How ``cute'' of Karl Malone to prolong Michael Jordan's career
at least one more game for the benefit of all those fans who are
fearful pro basketball will become Not Bloody Amusing once the
Chicago guard is gone for good.
</P>
<P>
   If not for Malone's 39-point performance in Friday's Game 5,
Jordan probably wouldn't have been reduced to talking like someone
who had Beanie Babies on the brain, calling the suspense
surrounding the wildly errant 3-point shot he launched for the
series-ending and maybe dynasty-dismantling win ``kind of cute.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For 1.1 seconds, everybody was holding their breath,'' Jordan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it has been more like 1.1 months that everybody who
loves watching Jordan play has been waiting to exhale. Between the
seven-game battle the Indiana Pacers waged against Chicago in the
Eastern Conference finals and the overtime game that got away in
Salt Lake City 11 days ago, it's a wonder Bulls fans haven't turned
Cubs blue by now.
</P>
<P>
   At this rate, disco will be on its way out again before the
Bulls finish their awkward gyrations to Donna Summer's ``Last
Dance.'' Then again, the fat lady could stop singing tonight.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard not to like the Bulls' chances in Game 6, even if it
is being played inside that loudspeaker otherwise known as the
Delta Center. Consider: Chicago missed 20 of its first 22 shots on
Friday and lost by only two points. Jordan and Scottie Pippen
misfired 31 times in 42 tries between them and even so, Jordan had
the ball in the final second with a chance to win the game and
claim outright the NBA's title deed for the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   That's how the script has been written since Jordan first burst
into our consciousness, as a freshman at North Carolina when, in
the 1982 NCAA title game against Georgetown, he hit a 17-foot
jumper with 15 seconds remaining to give the Tar Heels a one-point
win.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of 23,844 United Center spectators willing it to be so,
there would be no euphonious closure to Jordan's career, provided
he is, indeed, down to his final curtain calls. When his 35-foot
fallaway jumper for a one-point win over the Jazz fell short of the
rim, it botched the ending that all of Chicago had giddily written,
however prematurely.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls are lucky to have time for a quick rewrite, 1,250
miles away from the glare of a city full of eager editors. Had they
been able to distance themselves from Chicago's collective yearning
for the perfect fairy-tale ending, the Bulls might have seen that
the best conclusion in this case was the one that put the game
squarely in Toni Kukoc's hands.
</P>
<P>
   Kukoc clearly was the Bulls' best option on this night, having
made four of six shots from beyond the 3-point arc and having gone
7 for 7 from everywhere else on the floor. But the myth must be fed
and so it was Jordan got the nod despite having missed 16 of 25
shots.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, hope ran rampant that Jordan would somehow summon
the touch that had eluded him all night. From his jumper over
Cleveland's Craig Ehlo in the fifth game of the first round of the
1989 playoffs that got the wheels of this dynasty turning to his
jumper in Game 1 and 3-pointer in Game 5 of last year's finals
against Utah, Jordan has lavished his legacy with last-second
winners.
</P>
<P>
   But what tends to get lost in the lining of Superman's cape is
how Jordan's will to win has a way of rubbing off on his teammates
(sometimes as a direct result of his applying the elbow grease),
making them infinitely better. Good enough, anyway, to count on in
the clutch.
</P>
<P>
   During a tight game against Seattle in the NBA Finals two years
ago, Jordan got in Kukoc's face and said, ``Are you scared? If you
are, then sit down. If you're out here to shoot, then shoot.''
</P>
<P>
   So what do you imagine happened next? Kukoc came off the bench
and contributed two quick 3-pointers and a dunk off a pass from
Jordan to ice Game 2 on the Bulls' way to a six-game series win
that gave them their fourth NBA title in six years.
</P>
<P>
   The mind readily conjures up the indelible images of Jordan
nailing last-second jumpers against the Jazz to win two games in
last year's finals. But it's instructive to note the Bulls' fifth
championship in seven years wasn't iced with any one of Jordan's 39
points in the decisive Game 6 but with Steve Kerr's basket off a
pass from Jordan that on Friday he probably would have recalled as
being ``kind of cute.''
</P>
<P>
   That's OK. Sometimes even those of us who employ words to make
ends meet struggle to summon the right adjective when it comes to
Jordan, whose creativity knows no bounds.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Russell once said Jordan's imagination is the greatest
thing about his game. At 35, Jordan is still capable of
confounding, as he did earlier in the series by launching himself
from the free-throw line and slinging the ball from his right hand
to his left as though it were a ball of dough he was preparing for
pizza.
</P>
<P>
   As he tries tonight to satiate a city's hunger for a second
three-peat, Jordan just ought to remember, the hand he passes the
ball off to doesn't automatically have to be his own.

SPARKS MEET PHOENIX

<P>
   The Los Angeles Sparks continue their WNBA season-opening
three-game road trip today against the Phoenix Mercury at 1 p.m. at
the America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Leslie, who helped the USA national team win the gold medal
in the World Championships last Sunday, showed no signs of jet lag
as the Sparks' center scored 24 points and grabbed 12 rebounds in
the season-opening victory over the Utah Starzz Thursday. Guard
Tamecka Dixon added 18 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks missed the playoffs last year when they lost their
season finale, 73-68, in overtime to the eventual Western
Conference champion Mercury, who are coached by Cheryl Miller. The
Sparks and Mercury split the four-game series last year. Phoenix
won both its games in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Briget Pettis knocked down a 3-pointer with 4.5 seconds
remaining as Phoenix won its opener at Sacramento, 73-70, Thursday.
Jennifer Gillom led the Mercury with 22 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks play at Sacramento Tuesday before returning to Los
Angeles for their home-opener Friday against New York.

MEXICO WINS WORLD CUP OPENER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LYON, France A rare taste of success, at least the way things
have been going lately, and suddenly Mexico sees itself as world
beaters.
</P>
<P>
   The Tricolor was talking World Cup championship after a crucial
3-1 triumph Saturday over South Korea, a result that ended decades
of frustration as well as that of the last couple months and placed
the Mexicans squarely atop Group E.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Hernandez, ``El Matador,'' was the hero, scoring a pair of
second-half goals as Mexico utilized a man advantage to overcome an
early deficit and notch its first World Cup win on European soil.
</P>
<P>
   It was a vital result, absolutely necessary if the Tri has any
hope or desire of reaching the second round, which is an
understatement of mammoth proportions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico came to win the World Cup,'' declared halftime
substitute Ricardo Pelaez, who scored six minutes into the second
half to offset the Koreans' advantage. ``If you come with no idea
of winning, then why even play?''
</P>
<P>
   With Stade Gerland decked out like a miniature Estadio Azteca
Mexican flags, and fans, just about everywhere the Tri rode the
emotion of the crowd to a dominant win that hinged on a pair of
decisions, one by Austrian referee Guenter Benko, the other, a
reaction to the first, really, by Mexico coach Manuel Lapuente.
</P>
<P>
   Benko's involved Ha Seok-ju, who had fired South Korea ahead in
the 28th minute with the most fortuitous of free kicks, a 17-yarder
that slammed off the head of Mexican defender Duilio Davino and
ricocheted into the right-side netting, leaving goalkeeper Jorge
Campos going the other way. ``We felt our hearts fall,'' Hernandez
said.
</P>
<P>
   Two minutes later, an ill-conceived challenge by Ha on Ramon
Ramirez earned a red card, the first given exclusively for a tackle
from behind in this tournament under the new FIFA guidelines. That
was just about it for the Koreans aside from a 25-yard blast just
before halftime by 19-year-old midfielder Ko Jong-soo, which forced
a sprawling save by Campos who caved in once Lapuente changed the
Mexican focus heading into the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Lapuente, heavily criticized as Mexico struggled during Cup
preparations, switched from a 4-4-2 to a more offensive 4-2-4
alignment, bringing on Pelaez and Jesus Arellano. It had an
immediate impact, with Arellano causing havoc on the right and
Hernandez finally breaking free of Kim Tae-young's cover, and
Pelaez's goal, another fortunate strike, in the 51st minute turned
the tide.
</P>
<P>
   It came from a Ramirez corner kick from the left, one that
cleared Pelaez's head but struck Yoo-Sang-chul's foot and rolled
into open space in front of the goal. Pelaez ripped it home from 4
yards.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez scored the winner in the 74th minute, volleying
Ramirez's left-wing cross from close range, slipping the ball
between goalkeeper Kim Byung-ji and the far post.
</P>
<P>
   He got another 10 minutes later, firing past Kim from 18 yards
after a Cuauhtemoc Blanco feed.
</P>
<P>
   That had Gerland rocking, with the Mexican supporters at least
two-thirds, maybe more, of the 39,133 on hand singing ``Las
Mananitas'' and waving their flags in a frenzy. They made an
impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe the stadium,'' gushed Hernandez. ``I felt
so happy seeing my Mexican people. To hear them singing the Mexican
anthem (before the game) is something I'll never forget in my
entire life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, they were (ital) there (end ital),'' echoed captain
Alberto Garcia Aspe. ``It was amazing seeing all the people. How
did they get here?
</P>
<P>
   The same question could be asked of the Tri, who looked like
anything but a second-round candidate in its run-up to the
tournament. And while Belgium, their opponent next Saturday in
Bordeaux, and the Netherlands, whom they meet June 25 in
Saint-Etienne, will provide far greater challenges, the Mexicans
have no shortage of confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some people who don't think we're a very good
team,'' Hernandez acknowledged. ``We just need to constantly know
that we have talent, that we can play.''
</P>
<P>
   And that, the logic goes, could lead to the title?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have aspirations, of course,'' said Lapuente, ``but the
first one if to win the next game.''

DOOLEY SET TO FACE HOME COUNTRY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAINT-JEAN D'ARDIERES, France Thomas Dooley, like every good
German boy, dreamed of the day he'd walk onto the field at the
World Cup, captain's armband wrapped around his biceps, the
stirring strains of ``Das Lied der Deutschen'' echoing in his ears.
</P>
<P>
   That dream comes true on Monday, but with a twist: Dooley will
be lined up opposite the Germans at Parc des Princes in Paris, and
it will be the ``Star-Spangled Banner'' that brings tears to his
eyes, not the German anthem.
</P>
<P>
   The veteran sweeper, as German as sauerbraten for the vast
majority of his 37 years, can't hide his true colors, his true
emotions. And they have little to do with the land in which he was
born, bred and called home until last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't feel emotional (when the German anthem is played),''
he said, just days before he'll lead the United States into its
World Cup opener. ``I never had something to do for that country,
like in their army or with their national team. Now, over the last
six years in America, playing for my country, (hearing the U.S.
anthem) gives me more feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I play for the U.S., and I will fight for the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans' fight has been Dooley's since 1992, when U.S.
Soccer was tipped off to a German midfielder with a link to
America. Dooley's father, an American soldier who deserted his
German wife when Thomas was still an infant, provided his son a
bloodline and a birthright: As far as international soccer was
concerned, Dooley was as American as hot dogs and Coke.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have always talked to me about how I am, my
mentality,'' he says. ``They called me `Ami,' because my mentality
was American. I always felt I was American, and I liked America my
whole life.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a full-blown love affair these days, built during more than
half a decade as one of the country's finest soccer players,
although sport is only part of the equation. In his time in the
United States --- a year in Aliso Viejo while preparing for the
1994 World Cup, another year in Ohio, where he stars in Major
League Soccer for the Columbus Crew, frequent stops on national
team business --- Dooley has found something he'd been searching
for, something he'd never been able to pinpoint: Home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like an American who grew up in Germany,'' he says.
``I'm happy to go back to Germany for a vacation once a year, but
the more I live in America, the more I am in America, the more I
think I am more American than German.''
</P>
<P>
   It's his German experience --- nearly 10 years in the
Bundesliga, in stints with Kaiserslautern, Bayer Leverkusen and
Schalke 04 --- that has made him so valuable for the national team.
Since he received his passport, he's been a key figure for the
Yanks, a defensive midfielder and defender whose ability to read
the game, tackle with vigor and precision, and surge forward at the
most opportune times has helped in the Americans' climb from soccer
neophytes to burgeoning world power.
</P>
<P>
   Dooley's importance to the cause was rewarded after U.S. coach
Steve Sampson dismissed John Harkes, the Americans' captain, in
April. He didn't hesitate in passing the captain's armband Dooley's
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a wonderful captain and leader,'' Sampson praises. ``He
builds confidence in the players, and he gives quality information
to them; and he's such a settling individual, they can learn by his
composure on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He makes playing so much easier,'' notes defensive midfielder
Brian Maisonneuve, one of Dooley's Crew teammates. ``His
experience, the way he tells you things. ... And when he talks,
everybody listens.''
</P>
<P>
   Dooley's American experience nearly wasn't. Three times in the
early '90s, Germany invited him into its national team camp. Each
time, Dooley suffered an injury and had to decline the invitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so sad,'' Dooley says. ``My wife asked why I was so
upset. I told her that the biggest dream that I have is to play in
the World Cup. ... She said maybe it wasn't meant to be.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a philosophy Dooley had trouble accepting, until he got
the call from U.S. Soccer. But his first few months in America,
after he joined the '94 preparations, were anything but
illuminating. His son, Marco, then 12, missed his friends back
home, and his wife, Elke, was homesick.
</P>
<P>
   But after they returned to Germany following the World Cup, all
they could talk about was coming back to America. ``(Elke) told me,
when I was with Schalke, that when I finished playing, we were
going to move to California,'' Dooley says. ``Marco likes it better
here, and my youngest (6-year-old Dennis) came to us and said,
`Mom, Dad, I want to go to Germany only on vacation.' That was
great.''
</P>
<P>
   This is home now, his only home, and so when he leads the
Americans on Monday against a German squad many think will of
capture its fourth championship, he tries to downplay the emotion
of the moment. He is not totally successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be captain ... it's a big honor for me,'' he says. ``Of
course, to play against Germany is more exciting than to play
against Italy or Spain, but right now I think only about Germany as
an opponent, not as a country where I grew up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the first time we played against Germany, in Chicago
(in 1993), I was more excited than I am now, because now I have
much more focus for our game and for our goals. ... I don't want to
put too much emotion into this game, I just want to focus on the
opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a tough opponent, he knows, one few think the Yanks are
capable of knocking off. That's not a view Dooley shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything is possible,'' he says. ``We beat a couple months ago
the best team in the world. Germany is (according to the FIFA
rankings) the second best team, so why not? We need a little bit
luck and we have to play our game with a lot of confidence, a lot
of fighting, a very physical game. Then we have a chance. Of
course.''

!aolhead!Zeile hopes for brief Florida stay 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By Kevin Modesti, Daily News
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Todd Zeile always wished he could play for a
champion. He must have wished too hard.
</P>
<P>
   Here he was in the South Bronx, playing for a team the Yankee
Stadium marquee introduced as the ``World Champion Florida
Marlins'' but which was a world champion in name and uniform only.
Later that night, an electronic message board outside the ballpark
would report the score as ``Yankees 5, Tampa Bay 1,'' confusing the
1997 World Series winner with a 1998 expansion team.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins are that kind of club now, with a stripped-down
roster consisting of 14 rookies, a few cheap players and a $3.2
million veteran, Zeile.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pluses?'' the third baseman said in the dugout before the
game, talking about the effects of the May 14 trade that sent him
from the Dodgers to the Marlins, the trade Los Angeles knows as the
Mike Piazza deal. ``The pluses are what I'm trying to make right
now. I'm trying to make this into a plus.''
</P>
<P>
   For Zeile, a product of Hart PONY League, Hart High in Newhall
(he played in the 1983 Bernie Milligan All-Star Game) and UCLA, the
best thing about his banishment to the worst excuse for a baseball
team is it shouldn't last long. The Marlins, who are downsizing,
will unload Zeile and his major-league-size contract just as they
unloaded four players to the Dodgers and just as they unloaded
Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   Zeile, 32, is confident he'll be traded to a contender, and
because his contract runs through 1999, he believes that contender
will really want him and not just rent him. In the meantime, he
tries to make the best of a bad lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just in the last week, I've resigned myself to the fact I'm
going to be here until the (July 31 trading) deadline,'' Zeile
said, a bat in hand in the Yankee Stadium dugout. ``Now I'm feeling
better about the situation. It's not home, but it's more
comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   The pluses?
</P>
<P>
   It's a low-pressure job, that's one good thing, probably.
</P>
<P>
   And it's kind of fun to be the old guy on a team, the one the
rookies come to with questions like, ``What's to do in Chicago?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I may be wrong, but I think it's important for them to see how
I handle some adversity,'' Zeile said.
</P>
<P>
   And here's another plus: With any luck, by August he'll get to
see his family again. Which is the thing that makes you feel sorry
for Zeile even while you believe Piazza brought this on himself.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza turned down an $80 million contract offer (knowing he'll
get more this winter). Piazza is a single guy living a male fantasy
and if the worst thing about it is getting bounced from Los Angeles
to Miami to New York, well, poor him.
</P>
<P>
   Zeile accepted less than his market value in December 1996 to
play for his hometown team and to raise his son and daughter with
his wife, gymnast Julianne McNamara, in Westlake Village.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the personal side of the game and the business that's not
often paid attention to, and most of the time for good reason,'' he
said, careful not to sound like a complaining millionaire.
``(Signing for less with the Dodgers) was my choice and I did not
have a no-trade clause. That's the team's prerogative (to make a
trade).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just the irony of the timing. I put the best numbers of
my career last year,'' added Zeile, whose 31 homers and 89 runs
were personal highs, ``and I was off to an even better start this
year. That simple fact is probably what got me traded.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Dodgers' May 14 loss to Philadelphia, Zeile was about
to drive home to the house his family was living in temporarily
between the close of escrow on the their old house and the
completion of their new one. Fred Claire asked him to stick around
for 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I saw Fred in the clubhouse, I knew something was
up,'' Zeile said. The players had expected something _ not only
because Piazza's contract stalemate forced the Dodgers to seek a
trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team was floundering and we knew something was going to be
done. We didn't have a lot of guys who were doing what they were
capable of doing. We were scuffling scoring runs. Eric (Karros) had
just gotten back in the lineup but wasn't having the kind of
production he's used to. In the past, Dodger front-office people
were willing to give it time. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``It was sad, from the standpoint of a lifelong Dodger fan, that
the Fox influence showed in this trade. It was a move that would
never have been made in the O'Malley era. But Fox came in and paid
a lot of money and they want results.''
</P>
<P>
   In the clubhouse trainers' room, Claire told Zeile and Piazza
they'd been traded. They had expected something to be done _ just
not to them.
</P>
<P>
   Zeile, the lifelong Dodgers fan, thinks it was a good trade for
the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all honesty, a deal like that doesn't come along more than
once a millennium,'' he said. ``It remains to be seen, if you can
get two All-Stars (Gary Sheffield and Bobby Bonilla), a guy like
(Jim) Eisenreich and a guy like CJ (Charles Johnson). On paper it
seems like a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Good for the Dodgers. Bad for Todd and Julianne.
</P>
<P>
   He's in limbo. ``Dangled,'' as he put it. He waits for the night
Marlins general manager Dave Dombrowski shows up in the clubhouse
and asks him to stick around for 10 minutes. Trades to St. Louis,
Chicago _ Zeile has played for the Cardinals and Cubs before _ or
Texas have been rumored. Any of those would be fine with him.
</P>
<P>
   If he can't be a Dodger, he wants to help somebody be a
champion. Not help somebody tear one apart.

D-BACKS HIT POWERBALL, HOMERS TOP CARDINALS  
 LEE HOMERS TWICE, WILLIAMS ADDS 1 TO CAP RALLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic

<P>
   PHOENIX They came to Bank One Ballpark on Saturday, nearly
50,000 strong, expecting baseballs to fly off the bat of the first
baseman and out of the yard.
</P>
<P>
   The baseballs flew, to be sure. What came as a surprise was that
they were hit by the Diamondbacks' Travis Lee, not the St. Louis
Cardinals' Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's rookie sensation upstaged the incredible hulk with two
home runs, including a three-run shot in the bottom of the eighth,
as the Diamondbacks roared from behind for a 7-4 victory on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks raised their record to 22-46 entering today's
finale of the three-game series. The Cardinals fell to 31-35.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, 23, enjoyed perhaps the finest day of his brief pro career.
</P>
<P>
   He literally was a one-man wrecking crew. With two outs in the
third inning, he knocked Cardinals left-handed starter Kent Mercker
from the game. His one-hop smash came off the dirt strip that runs
from the mound to the plate and bounced off the back of Mercker's
left knee.
</P>
<P>
   Mercker was on the ground for a few minutes, limped off with the
help of team trainers and later had X-rays that proved to be
negative.
</P>
<P>
   With Arizona trailing, 2-1, and Jay Bell aboard as the result of
a walk with two outs in the seventh inning, Lee crushed a fastball
from right-hander Curtis King and sent it into the right-field
stands.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals regained the lead, 4-3, on Brian Jordan's two-run
homer off right-hander Russ Springer with no outs in the eighth. It
appeared Diamondbacks left fielder David Dellucci had a chance to
catch it, but the ball went just beyond his reach into the stands.
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander Lance Painter began the eighth for the Cardinals and
with one out, hit Brent Brede with his first pitch. Brede advanced
to third on a single by Karim Garcia, but Garcia was thrown out by
Willie McGee while trying to stretch it into a double.
</P>
<P>
   The call then went to right-handed closer Jeff Brantley. Bell
drew another walk, his third of the game, and Lee ripped an 0-1
pitch over the fence for his second homer and 13th of the season.
Third baseman Matt Williams followed with a home run to left on the
first pitch from Brantley (0-3), a former San Francisco Giants
teammate. It was Williams' 13th homer of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Lee said he knew the homer off King was gone, but wasn't sure
about the next one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw McGee move back, and I didn't know if he was going to
catch it or what,'' Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   But it was gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pitch was up and right down the middle, exactly where I
didn't want it,'' Brantley said.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd gave Lee a standing ovation and continued to roar
until he climbed a few of the dugout steps and tipped his cap. It
was the first curtain call for a Diamondbacks player and one Lee is
certain to remember for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know whether to go out there or not,'' Lee said.
``They (teammates) were saying, `They're calling for you.' So I did
it. It was great. It gave me goose bumps.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, who had a grand slam in a 9-4 victory over Arizona on
Friday night _ his 31st homer of the season, was held to a single
and a pair of walks (one intentional). He was impressed with Lee.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great talent,'' McGwire said. ``He's got a great swing
that's only going to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he isn't surprised at what Lee has been able to
accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Travis is a good player. There will be many of these kinds of
days for him. He has a very good idea of what he wants to
accomplish out there. He goes out and works hard and is not in awe
of anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Lee is a good player, Brantley said, ``Today, he was
pretty damn good.''
</P>
<P>
   After the heroics of Lee and Williams in the eighth,
right-hander Gregg Olson came on in the ninth to record his eighth
save. &QL;

NUN HELPED CARDINALS ROOKIE TURN LIFE AROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - Little Moose hit rock bottom the time he stole
$1,000 from his uncle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody understood,'' said Cardinals rookie linebacker
Marchant Kenney, whose father, ``Big Moose,'' nicknamed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just a rotten kid.''
</P>
<P>
   So rotten, he ran the New Orleans streets until his 88-year-old
grandmother called the police.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't call his parents. Kenney's mother, Gretchen,
committed suicide when her son was 8. His dad, also named Marchant,
died in prison when Kenney was 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police would come and put my bike on the top of the car
and take me home,'' Kenney said.
</P>
<P>
   Kenney wouldn't stay at his grandmother's for long. She couldn't
control him. Nobody could.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd steal money from her, anybody,'' he said. ``I was around
people dealing drugs. I saw gang activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could do whatever I wanted when I wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   That changed the day friends and relatives put the orphan in the
Boys Hope program, an international group home for academically
capable but at-risk children.
</P>
<P>
   It was there he met a nun who changed his life, Sister Francis
Regis Feise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Sister, without Boys Hope, I could be dead,'' he
said. &QL; 
Bob Ferguson, vice president of player personnel for the Cardinals,
knows Kenney's story is so improbable, he said, ``I'm going to
secure the movie rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Sister Francis said Kenney, an undrafted free agent, has told
her, ``I think we ought to write a book. No one would believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   The story would start on the Huey P. Long Bridge in 1981, the
day his mother jumped into the Mississippi River and died.
</P>
<P>
   ``She came home from work one day, and me and my father were
there,'' Kenney said. ``She said she was going out to visit a
friend. A few hours went by, and we wondered where she was. Three
or four hours later, there was a knock on the door and police
officers said they found her car on the bridge. They said there
were witnesses who saw her get on the bridge and jump.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenney doesn't have a lot of fond memories of his mother. He
remembers meeting her boyfriends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd see her cheat on my father,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He remembers his parents arguing much of the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was on edge all the time,'' he said. ``She wasn't in a
happy (marital) relationship. But I never thought suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenney said his dad was ``devastated'' by the suicide and turned
to alcohol and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   His dad, a former pro boxer, ran with a tough crowd. He was a
bounty hunter who was caught in an FBI counterfeit sting. Police
found $2 million in counterfeit bills, but Kenney's dad never
served jail time.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would bring me around things I shouldn't have seen,''
Kenney said. ``We go to hotels, and he'd take me to the game room.
It was kind of cool to me. He was `Big Moose.' I was `Little
Moose.' ''
</P>
<P>
   When Kenney was 11, he came home from school with his guardian,
Aloha Ingram, to find the front door kicked in. Police had come and
taken his dad away, this time on a drug charge.
</P>
<P>
   He was found guilty and, on March 7, 1986, entered prison in
Talladega, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that was unbelievable was that they never took
(Kenney) there to see his dad,'' Sister Francis said of Kenney's
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The next time Kenney saw him was in a coffin. Big Moose died of
a heart attack while jogging in prison. He was 51 and had been
imprisoned about a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would write me letters all the time, telling me to stay
straight,'' Kenney said. ``He said he had found God, and we were
going to move to someplace else, get away from the life we lived.
He loved me to death.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenney was shuffled from friends and relatives, eventually
winding up at his grandmother's house in Bridge City, La., a tough
town located just across the Mississippi River from New Orleans but
seemingly millions of miles away from the glitz of the French
Quarter.
</P>
<P>
   His grandmother was on welfare. He learned about food stamps and
welfare and wore ``the worst'' clothes to school.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The school I went to there, some kids were there just to sell
drugs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When Kenney wasn't in school, he was on the streets until late
at night. His grades failed.
</P>
<P>
   The mother of one of Kenney's friends, Chad Howat, called Boys
Hope in New Orleans to see if they'd take him. Cheryl Howat knew
Boys Hope might be Kenney's last chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandmother didn't want me to go,'' Kenney said. ``She
thought I was her angel, when I was just a bad kid.'' &QL; 
Kirk Utzinger, the executive director of Boys Hope in Phoenix, said
the program's motto is ``Saving kids one life at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenney, who was 14 at the time, didn't think he'd last there one
week. He hated being in the house with eight other boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first met Sister Francis, I was scared,'' he said.
``You know the (nun) stereotype _ black-and-white (outfit) with a
ruler in her hand. I didn't want to be there. I wanted to keep
doing what I had been doing. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, anything was better than where I'd been.''
</P>
<P>
   At Boys Hope, Sister Francis clothed and fed the boys and did
their laundry. She took little flak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marchant had to be pulled in and disciplined,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Their relationship changed during Kenney's sophomore year of
high school when the youngsters went on a retreat to Covington, La.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember (the priest) saying to me, `Marchant needs to talk
to someone and needs to talk to you,' '' Sister Francis said. ``We
found a room, and I said to him, `Let's get it out in the open.' He
spilled his beans.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenney's version is slightly different.
</P>
<P>
   ``She sat me down and told me it's time to stop holding things
back, stop being so mean,'' Kenney said. ``I started talking about
how I felt about everything _ life, God, the things that had
happened to me, how I didn't think life had been fair. We were
talking and talking, and tears started flowing. I needed to open
up, and she forced it out of me.
</P>
<P>
   ``From that night on, we had a bond _ a mother-son
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Sister Francis encouraged Kenney to find an outlet for all of
his energy, and he found it in football, which he never had played.
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans Saints offensive coordinator Danny Abramowicz was
Kenney's coach at Jesuit High School and remembers the teenager as
``ornery.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was like a caged tiger, undisciplined,'' Abramowicz said.
``He'd nail somebody, and I'd say, `That's great, but don't
overreact.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved his competitiveness. He was very likeable and a tough,
hard-nosed guy. He fought through so many things. He didn't wallow
around. He made something out of his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenney was all-state his senior year at Jesuit but wasn't highly
recruited because he was small. Only Texas Tech and Southern
Mississippi wanted him.
</P>
<P>
   Other recruiters didn't do their homework.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even after I had that talk with Sister Francis, there still
was a wild side to me,'' Kenney said. ``It was an enjoyable wild. .
. . Football is a nasty game. I like to play like the old-time
guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenney was the Defensive Player of the Year in Conference USA
last season. His junior year, he had 141 tackles, the most by a
Southern Miss player in seven years. But Kenney wasn't drafted
because he's only 6 feet 1, 232 pounds, small for a middle
linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson first noticed Kenney on film when he was scouting
prospects from Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were playing Southern Miss, and he was making all the
tackles, and I wondered, `Who is this guy?' '' Ferguson said.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson watched several more films of Kenney, and then
Abramowicz called after the draft and recommended the Cardinals
sign him. Abramowicz didn't have to do much selling.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this kid has gone through tells you he's the kind of guy
you'd like playing for you,'' Ferguson said. ``Everything in his
life goes into every play. He realizes how special it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is he big enough? Maybe not. Is he fast enough? Who knows. But
this game is about courage and heart and playing hard every down.''
</P>
<P>
   This spring, Kenney graduated from Southern Miss with a degree
in sports administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``What could have been with that child and what he is now, he
has come a long way,'' Sister Francis said.
</P>
<P>
   Kenney knows he's already a big success story but said he's just
not happy being in an NFL training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to do whatever I can to make this team,'' he said.
``Where I get that drive from, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Little Moose pauses and then acknowledges that he couldn't have
done it on his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sister Francis is like my mother,'' he said. ``Without her, my
life would be nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows Sister Francis. She comes to every game. She's
up in the stands and prays to St. Jude _ he's the saint for
hopeless causes.'' &QL;

   SALT LAKE CITY - Drama junkies. Adrenaline addicts. A basketball
team incapable of the routine.
</P>
<P>
   What, they don't have enough excitement in their lives?
</P>
<P>
   ``We blew an opportunity,'' Michael Jordan said. ``This has
happened before.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure has. More than they care to admit. And for all the mystique
and fire, all the cold blood and killer instinct, the Chicago Bulls
are a mere 5-4 with an NBA championship chilling on ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason, they didn't seem ready to play (on Friday),''
Utah Jazz reserve Shandon Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Up, 3-0, against Seattle, they fell asleep at the wheel. Up,
3-1, against Phoenix, they lost at the Chicago Stadium, allowing
Charles Barkley to preserve the city. Now this.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be very hard,'' Scottie Pippen said. ``I know no
one wanted to make this trip, especially the players.''
</P>
<P>
   True. But they just can't help themselves.
</P>
<P>
   As glorious as the Bulls look in the record books, their
appetite for chaos is both consistent and amazing. And if the past
is prologue, the only thing left is the unexpected assassin, the
microwave celebrity ready to zap the Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Hansen's been there. John Paxson's done it. Steve Kerr has
the T-shirt. So who's next? Who's going to emerge from behind the
curtain just when it appears a Game 7 is on the horizon?
</P>
<P>
   Or have the Bulls danced around the campfire one too many times?
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys have to remember, the (Jazz victory in Game 5) was a
two-point win,'' Bulls Coach Phil Jackson said. ``You don't throw
out the baby with the bath water in this situation. We're fine.
It's not a dramatic thing to say we lost a close game. We'll just
come at it, do it again, do it better.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the Bulls can feel good about the past. Their ability to
tease, prolong, escape. They can also feel good about Toni Kukoc,
who is rounding into the wrecking ball the Bulls envisioned when
they followed him across the globe looking for his signature.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Kukoc was supposed to take the last shot, except he
couldn't get open. So, in a moment where life imitated Nike, Jordan
heaved up a prayer and the world seemed to stop. Just like the
commercial where Jordan drives to the basket and everything else is
suspended animation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that was cute, just thinking about it,'' Jordan
said. ``I was sitting there thinking about the whole thing, and at
1.1 (seconds), I knew I wanted the ball but no one knew what was
going to happen. ``That's part of my personality, the way things
have always happened for me in my career. I'm sure everyone was
hoping that it would end that way, except for Utah people.
Everybody was holding their breath, which is kind of cute.''
</P>
<P>
   Cute? No, these guys aren't worried at all. This is all just
part of the pattern. Seize control, let up, refocus. Go back on the
road where life is less filling and conquer the drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty sure we don't have to worry about the traffic,''
Jordan said. ``I'm sure it's going to be a lot different focus, and
some of the distractions will be gone. But it's not easy, walking
into Utah and trying to win. I welcome the challenge, and I hope my
teammates will, too.''
</P>
<P>
   So who will it be? Luc Longley, a man so dejected that Jordan
told him on Friday to forget everything and get drunk? Bill
Wennington? Ron Harper, a man who once was stuck in the cell block
known as the Los Angeles Clippers? ``That wasn't jail,'' Harper
said. ``That was a high-priced facility.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Jackson should be slightly alarmed. The Jazz has yet to
unload its A game, its centers are finally waking up, and the Delta
Center is beckoning. And as silly as Karl Malone looks after
signing a deal to wrestle Dennis Rodman in San Diego next month, he
has been ridiculed once too often .
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got anger in his eyes,'' Antoine Carr said.
</P>
<P>
   Yep. The Bulls blew an opportunity. Maybe just a blip, a stage
for another unlikely hero. Or maybe cute starts looking
catastrophic. &QL;

WOODS-ELS RI VALRY UNLIKELY TO DEVELOP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 Analysis 
 By BILL HUFFMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whenever Tiger Woods and Ernie Els show up at one of golf's four
major championships, the question comes up:
</P>
<P>
   Will this be the major that launches the greatest rivalry since
Jack vs. Arnie?
</P>
<P>
   Television yearns for it. The fans would love it.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, chances of it happening this week at the 98th
U.S. Open seem about as likely as the sponsoring U.S. Golf
Association avoiding controversy. Alas, no San Francisco treat at
the Olympic Club.
</P>
<P>
   There are several reasons for this, the chief ones being that
Woods and Els are ailing. Neither will back into this Open title
(the way this major usually is won), because their backs won't let
them.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Tiger withdrew from the Kemper Open, citing
soreness in his lower back. It marked the first time in his
professional career that the 22-year-old Woods had pulled out
because of an injury.
</P>
<P>
   According to his agency, Cleveland-based IMG, the soreness was
not all that unexpected, considering the way Woods goes after the
ball, with a nuclear rotation that is second to none. Woods skipped
the Buick Classic and has been receiving treatment in Las Vegas
from his therapist, Keith Kleven.
</P>
<P>
   Els' announcement Wednesday that he would not defend his title
in the Buick was more unexpected. ``The Big Easy,'' as Els is
known, swings so slowly and smoothly that there would be no reason
to expect that his back would bear the brunt of the force at age
28.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Els' problem is different. He suffers from periodic
back spasms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, (this week) will be a day-to-day thing at this
point,'' said Els, who will be attempting to defend his Open title,
not to mention win his third national championship in the past five
years (he also won in 1994).
</P>
<P>
   Both probably will make it to the first tee on Thursday, but how
they fare is anybody's guess. Especially when you factor in cool,
even chilly, San Francisco weather that often includes rain and fog
this time of the year. Not good for bad backs.
</P>
<P>
   That's why a better pick to win the Open is David Duval, whom
many have called America's greatest player over the past year. When
you win five times in your past 13 starts, as Duval has done, it's
pretty hard to look at Woods and Els, who have just one victory
between them (Els at Bay Hill) during that same span.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Woods and Els have won majors, and Duval has not.
Only Justin Leonard, another favorite this week, can make that
claim among professional golf's young lions, a pride that also
includes Phil Mickelson.
</P>
<P>
   But of those five players, Duval's game _ fairly long and
straight, with a superb short game _ might be best suited for the
Olympic Club.
</P>
<P>
   This is a relatively short (6,797 yards), hilly course that
demands accuracy, as the rough will pinch the fairways down to 20
to 30 yards wide and run as deep as 5 to 7 inches. The subtly
sloping greens have been accused of being no bigger than
``hubcaps,'' but a more accurate description of their size places
them in the range of backyard swimming pools.
</P>
<P>
   ``What really makes it tough is there is not an level lie on the
course,'' Els reported after a visit last fall. ``Another thing,
there are not too many birdie-able holes (it's a par 70).
</P>
<P>
   ``It really depends on the weather. If the weather is going to
be wet, I can see the guys able to maybe shoot par or 2 under. But,
you know, if it is firm and the wind is blowing, I can't see a
score under par really winning.''
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the past three Opens at the Olympic Club have been so
unpredictable. In each (1955, '66 and '87), ``the wrong guy won,''
as sports author Dan Jenkins put it.
</P>
<P>
   The unlikely scenarios were Jack Fleck beating the legendary Ben
Hogan in an 18-hole playoff in '55; Arnold Palmer blowing a 9-shot
lead in the final round of the '66 championship, then falling to
Billy Casper the next day in another playoff; and Scott Simpson
eking out a 1-shot victory over Tom Watson in '87.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody keeps talking about the young guys (being the
favorites),'' Els warned before his back flared up. ``But I think
around a course like Olympic, you need experience. It wouldn't
surprise me to see the older guys come through again.''
</P>
<P>
   Or somebody coming out of left field, like a Lee Westwood or a
Stuart Appleby, or some other guy that might be golf's next Andy
North, who won two U.S. Opens and a total of three events in 25
years on the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Els said that whether he wins his third Open in five years or
not (a feat last accomplished by Ben Hogan in 1950, '51 and '53),
he plans to ``enjoy myself.''
</P>
<P>
   He also doubts that a major rivalry between himself and Woods is
in the making this week. And bad backs have nothing to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people make too much out of that,'' Els said.
``Besides, I'll be surprised a little bit if Tiger really plays
well. (The Olympic Club) is not quite his golf course. That is not
where his strengths are.'' &QL;

IT'S SOCCER, BE HAPPY WITH A TIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The philosopher who said a tie is like kissing your sister
obviously doesn't understand soccer.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing wrong with a tie. In fact, a scoreless tie can
be a positive experience. Paraguay and Bulgaria battled to a 0-0
draw in the World Cup the other day and while players from both
countries expressed their frustration and disappointment each one
whispered a secret prayer of thanks and told himself, ``At least
``I'' didn't ``blow'' it.''
</P>
<P>
   Soccer critics say the sport is boring. Not enough offense. Many
Americans are reluctant to embrace an endeavor which incorporates
the primary rule in bobbing for apples. No hands allowed.
</P>
<P>
   My only criticism is that it's too easy for a soccer team to
beat itself.
</P>
<P>
   The other day those two old rivals, Morocco and Norway, were
engaged in a close, fiercely-fought match when Morocco's Youssef
Chippo did something that made him feel just awful. While trying to
knock the ball out of danger with his head he accidentally
redirected the ball into the Moroccan net.
Goooooooooooooooooaaaal!!!
</P>
<P>
   Jubilant, the Norwegians ran around in circles, arms
outstretched, looking for someone to hug. Poor Chippo had scored
for them. An ``own goal'' they call it. His face burned with shame.
</P>
<P>
   The same misfortune befell a Scottish defender. Tommy Boyd
inadvertently put a rebound into his own net in the 73rd minute.
Goooooooooooooooooaaaal!!! Scotland lost, 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd wanted to do a highland fling off the Eiffel Tower. He felt
as badly as Andres Escobar did in the 1994 World Cup after the
Colombian player kicked the ball backward and scored an own goal
against the United States. The favored Colombians lost, 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days later, back home, Escobar was murdered. Gunmen shouted,
``Goal!'' after each pistol shot.
</P>
<P>
   Drug traffickers, known to be sore losers, reportedly had lost
millions of dollars betting on Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Chippo and Boyd may not fear for their lives. Neither has been
deported. But no words can undo what happened or deliver them from
their private purgatory. Their mistakes were embarrassing and
costly.
</P>
<P>
   The World Cup is unique. You won't see Michael Jordan
accidentally make a jump shot for Utah in the NBA Finals. Rarely
does a football player score for the other team, although it has
happened.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Riegels picked up a Georgia Tech fumble and ran the wrong
direction in the 1929 Rose Bowl _ in the stadium where Escobar
committed his gaffe. Riegels went to his grave known as ``Wrong
Way'' Riegels.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Marshall of the Vikings committed a similar blunder in a
1964 NFL game. The defensive lineman picked up a fumble, lost his
compass and took off toward the 49ers end zone, bound for glory. He
didn't stop until he got there.
</P>
<P>
   Time, they say, heals all wounds. Now, Marshall says, he is
asked about the play only three or four times a day.
</P>
<P>
   The frequency of own goals _ already there have been at least
three in the World Cup _ may be on the minds of our lads when the
United States makes its debut in the tournament on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Sampson's team opens against Germany. Next, the U.S. plays
Iran, which will be ready for this holy war against what the late
Ayatollah Khomeini called ``the Great Satan.'' Then, the U.S. faces
Yugoslavia. The Yugoslavian team's wealth of talent almost rivals
that of defending champion Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   How did we end up in Group F? Fate. A draw was held, similar to
the one staged in Las Vegas before the 1994 World Cup when comic
Robin Williams put on a surgical glove before dipping his hand into
the bottom of a glass bowl containing several blue balls. ``Turn
your head and cough,'' he cracked.
</P>
<P>
   Can we win a match? Two?
</P>
<P>
   Seems to me our realistic goal should be to play for three ties,
and not shoot ourselves in the foot, or any other appendage. &QL;

WIND NEARLY RECORDS A TKO  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL PASO _ A West Texas wind nearly scored the biggest knockout.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours before the  &UR; Oscar De La Hoya-Patrick Charpentier
fight on Saturday night, high winds rocked steel girding that
supported lights above a ring at the Sun Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Home Box Office executives noticed that the structure, suddenly
weaving like a sail mast in a storm, was about to collapse on
officials and media at ringside.
</P>
<P>
   A retreat was ordered to about 20 yards from the ring as lights
were lowered and the structure reinforced. The sportswriters' exit
was quicker than the one predicted for Charpentier. &QL; 
On parade &QL; 
 &UR; Michael Carbajal and  &UR; Louie Espinoza, former Ninth Street Gym
stablemates, were among several former and current Hispanic
champions honored before the opening bell.
</P>
<P>
   Espinoza, Arizona's first fighter with a major title, won the
World Boxing Association junior-featherweight championship in the
mid-1980s while training for the Valley's  &UR; Willy Borchert.
</P>
<P>
   Carbajal, the lightest fighter ever to win a $1 million purse,
held the International Boxing Federation's junior-flyweight title
twice and the World Boxing Council crown once.
</P>
<P>
   Carbajal's rival,  &UR; Humberto ``Chiquita'' Gonzalez of Mexico
City, missed the ceremony
</P>
<P>
   ``Wish he were here, I'd beat him right now,'' said Carbajal,
who knocked out Gonzalez at Las Vegas and lost controversial
decisions at Los Angeles and Mexico City
</P>
<P>
   He was joking. Sort of. &QL; 
On the undercard &QL; 
In the first of two bouts on the HBO telecast, Mexican  &UR; Cesar Bazan
(32-2-1, 23 KOs) won a dull split decision to take the WBC
lightweight title from previously unbeaten  &UR; Stevie Johnston (24-1,
13 KOs) of Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Before the wind delay, Puerto Rican welterweight
 &UR; Daniel Santos (15-0-1, 12 KOs) stopped Mexican  &UR; Juan Carlos
Rodriguez (32-11-2, 20 KOs) with a jackhammer-like shot for a
fifth-round KO.
</P>
<P>
   The wind continued, but the delay did not. After a 30-minute
interruption and beneath lowered lights,  &UR; Cesar Soto (51-7-2, 39
KOs), the WBC's No. 1-rated featherweight from Juarez, landed an
uppercut for a second-round KO of  &UR; Juan Polo-Prez (39-18-3, 22 KOs)
of Miami. &QL;

DE LA HOYA WINS IN 3  
 CHAMP MAKES SHORT WORK OF CHARPENTIER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL PASO _ He took the border out of this town.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar De La Hoya practiced some powerful diplomacy Saturday with
accurate punching that unified a delirious throng of 45,368 fans
and left one lonely Frenchman feeling like a pinata.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya's third-round victory by technical knockout was oh-so
predictable.
</P>
<P>
   The poor victim, Patrick Charpentier, never had a chance in a
U.S. city that borders Juarez, where the French have never had any
luck.
</P>
<P>
   From Juarez, the Mexicans successfully overthrew French rule in
1862, and they've been celebrating Cinco de Mayo on both sides of
the U.S. border ever since. De la Hoya represented just another
chance to celebrate a second time within a few months.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya, politician and diplomat, knew that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks, El Paso, for your support,'' De La Hoya (28-0, 23
knockouts) said as he grabbed the microphone while a wobbly
Charpentier (27-5-1, 22 knockouts) was being led away. ``I had a
wonderful, beautiful time. I promise you one thing. I will be
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long after Charpentier climbed into a ring at the Sun Bowl
with a French flag in one hand and another one carried aloft by a
corner man, De La Hoya arrived like a modern Pancho Villa.
</P>
<P>
   He wore a gold sombrero. From Juarez to El Paso, it could have
been a halo.
</P>
<P>
   Only the gun belts and pistols were missing.
</P>
<P>
   But De La Hoya has his own weapons. They are his hands. His
fists. They are lethal.
</P>
<P>
   Charpentier had no defense. Not much offense, either. There's
more power in a couple of croissants than there were in
Charpentier's hands. He landed only five of 111 attempted blows,
according to Punchstat, a ringside computer. De La Hoya landed 80
of 155.
</P>
<P>
   Charpentier was knocked down three times in the third round.
</P>
<P>
   The first came as the result of left-right combo.
</P>
<P>
   The second came after a wicked left uppercut by De La Hoya, who
retained his World Boxing Council welterweight title.
</P>
<P>
   The third was lightning _ a straight right hand. Referee
Lawrence Coles immediately ended it at 1:56 of the round. The
stoppage was not dictated by a three-knockdown rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, not at all,'' Coles said. ``I stopped it. He was hurt. He
was definitely dazed. After the second knockdown, I stayed close to
him.''
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya started to celebrate as Charpentier fell into him. De
La Hoya was already waving at the the crowd when Charpentier rolled
over onto his back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not hurt,'' said Charpentier, who collected $600,000,
more than $3 million less than De La Hoya's $4 million purse. ``It
was the head shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Charpentier wasn't talking about camera angles. De La Hoya's
shots were had laserlike accuracy and impact.
</P>
<P>
   There are lots of questions about Charpentier's qualifications
for a shot at the mighty De La Hoya, who is often called the
world's best fighter, regardless of weight.
</P>
<P>
   Those questions will dog De La Hoya until _ or if _ he faces
well-known welterweight contenders Felix Trinidad and Ike Quartey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt really good,'' said De La Hoya, whose next bout is
probably a rematch with Julio Cesar Chavez on Sept. 18 at Las
Vegas' Caesars Palace. ``I knew I was hurting him. I had no
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite doubts about Charpentier, De La Hoya can point to the
victory as something of a milestone. Before Saturday night, four of
De La Hoya's last five fights had gone the distance.
</P>
<P>
   There was talk that he had lost some power as he moved up in
weight class from 130 pounds to 135 to 140 to his current 147.
</P>
<P>
   His promoter, Bob Arum, now can say that he has not.
</P>
<P>
   More important, perhaps, is the public impact this victory will
have. De La Hoya has been haunted by boos from Mexicans and fellow
Mexican-Americans throughout his career.
</P>
<P>
   He was thought to be too slick or too well-groomed to be a
fighter.
</P>
<P>
   But on the night at the border, there was never a doubt.
</P>
<P>
   It was an Oscarfest. Or fiesta. They love him in any language. &QL;

BULLS KNOW THIS SITUATION  
 SERIES MIMICS 1993 FINALS AGAINST SUNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ There aren't many obstacles Michael Jordan and
the Chicago Bulls haven't faced and overcome in the 1990s while
accumulating five NBA championships.
</P>
<P>
   When the Bulls unexpectedly blew their opportunity to clinch a
sixth title by losing to Utah at home Friday night in Game 6 of the
NBA Finals, it wasn't unfamiliar territory for Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, we blew our opportunity,'' Jordan said. ``This happened
to us before.''
</P>
<P>
   That was in 1993, when the Bulls lost Game 5 at home but
defeated the Suns in Game 6 at Phoenix to clinch their third
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1993, I got on the plane with a cigar and celebrated a
little bit and got everybody else to enjoy themselves and relax a
little bit,'' Jordan remembered of that last unwanted trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be very positive.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's Finals have paralleled that championship series in
some ways.
</P>
<P>
   That was the last time the Bulls played in The Finals without
the benefit of home-court advantage. The Suns had finished with the
best regular-season record.
</P>
<P>
   That was the last year that Chicago lost a home game in the
championship round.
</P>
<P>
   And that was the last time Jordan (not to mention Phoenix
forward Charles Barkley) was seriously considering retirement.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Jordan did leave the game for two years after that
season to pursue a baseball career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, we have to go back to Utah,'' Jordan said
Friday night. ``It's a duplicate situation as in 1993.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls won the first two games of that series in Phoenix as
Kevin Johnson totalled only 15 points combined. Chicago appeared
headed toward an easy sweep.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns stayed alive by winning Game 3 in a classic
triple-overtime duel. But Chicago won Game 4 and preparations began
for a city-wide celebration after Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   Police and the National Guard were on call to quell the expected
riotous reaction.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted Suns Coach Paul Westphal to establish the club's
motto for the night _ ``Save the City!''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Barkley scrawled the words on a chalk board in the
Phoenix locker room, and after the Suns stole Game 5, they
gleefully yelled, ``We saved Chicago!'' as they ran into the locker
room.
</P>
<P>
   The script was similar this year. Chicago had the opportunity to
clinch the series in Game 5, and there was more talk about
champagne, riots, parades and the possibility of breaking up the
Bulls than about the possibility that the Jazz could force the
series back to Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Utah won Game 5, and now _ still trailing 3-2 in the series _
the Jazz have home-court advantage in Game 6 tonight and, if
necessary, Game 7 Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Game 6 is important for us,'' Chicago's Scottie Pippen said.
``We still have the advantage. We don't want them to tie the series
up, even though we're very comfortable going back on their home
court. We feel very good and feel like that we have a good grasp on
this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Jazz followers might question that.
</P>
<P>
   After all, while Chicago has a 3-2 lead in the series, Utah has
had the lead in the final five minutes in four of the five games.
The Jazz led in the final minute of Game 2, which Chicago won.
</P>
<P>
   And Pippen is right about how important tonight's game is for
Chicago. In that 1993 series, the Suns couldn't get to Game 7,
losing a late lead and then falling when John Paxson hit a
three-point shot.
</P>
<P>
   If Utah can win tonight, history at least is on the side of the
Jazz. No NBA team has won Game 7 of the Finals on the road since
Washington won Game 7 in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   That was 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And not even Jordan can claim he's been there, done that. In
fact, about the only thing the Bulls never have had to face is a
Game 7 _ home or away _ in the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least we have regained the home-court advantage,'' Utah
Coach Jerry Sloan said. ``And we worked for 82 games to achieve
that. That's why you play.'' &QL;

TALE OF 2 SLUGGERS  
 MCGWIRE GOT BETTER, CANSECO GOT LOST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   M &UR; ark McGwire isn't really doing anything different these days.
He's always been the decade's most prolific home run hitter. It's
just that McGwire now plays in St. Louis, arguably the best
baseball city in the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't that long ago that McGwire wasn't the best home
run hitter on his own club. True, he broke into the majors in 1987
and quickly blasted 49 home runs, a mark that may stand for some
time as the most home runs hit by a rookie.
</P>
<P>
   But even during his inaugural splash, McGwire took a back seat
to then-teammate  &UR; Jose Canseco, who was favorably compared to
 &UR; Mickey
 &UR; Mantle in those days. Canseco burst onto the baseball scene with a
flair that hadn't been seen in decades.
</P>
<P>
   He ran better than any big guy had ever run before. He drove the
ball to the far reaches of any stadium, even farther than McGwire
could in those days. Everyone remembers them as the ``Bash
Brothers,'' the pair of sluggers who helped lead Oakland to three
consecutive World Series appearances.
</P>
<P>
   But along the way the two players who seemed joined at the hip,
at least on the field in those days, separated. McGwire continued
working diligently, wanting to become a better baseball player.
Canseco was more interested in the nightlife and outside interests.
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, Canseco was the better player in those days,
someone who seemed headed toward a spot in Cooperstown. But then he
stopped working. He went from being an above-average right fielder
to a cartoon character who had balls bounce off his head for home
runs.
</P>
<P>
   He became so tiresome to the Athletics that the club traded him
away at age 28, a time when he should have been heading toward his
peak seasons. Canseco is finally playing like he cares again. He's
stealing bases and playing with the same abandon that made him the
American League MVP at age 24.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, when Canseco was pulling down the mega-contracts
and meeting with  &UR; Madonna late at night, McGwire worked like a
horse, wanting to continually improve as a ballplayer. Now he's the
one with an appointment in Cooperstown.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of unrelated foot injuries came much closer to ending his
career than most people realize. But McGwire eventually was talked
out of turning in his spikes by family and close friends. Fans of
big-league ball everywhere should be thankful.
</P>
<P>
   There are no extensive films of  &UR; Babe Ruth. We know how great he
was from firsthand accounts and the thousands of stories that have
been passed down. We'll be telling stories of McGwire one day,
telling our grandkids how we were alive to watch what may turn out
to be the greatest home run hitter of all time.
</P>
<P>
   Take note of McGwire, the only player besides Ruth to ever hit
50 home runs in consecutive seasons. We're fortunate to be watching
history. &QL; 
Taking their cuts &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Place several New York Yankees among those disgusted with the
deplorable actions of the owner of the alleged big-league club that
plays its home games at (Semi-)Pro Player Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to have a certain loyalty to the city that you're
in, and I think that (breakup) shows a lack of loyalty,'' Yankees
Manager
 &UR; Joe Torre said. ``You won the World Series. Great. Hooray. But if
you only did it for yourself, then it's not right. That's not the
right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Paul O'Neill was equally peeved: ``A lot of people feel there's
no defending champion right now. Part of the fun of winning it all
is trying to repeat. It was a big motivating factor for us last
year. The game is cheated of that right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Yankees owner  &UR; George Steinbrenner stood up for his
fellow owner,  &UR; Wayne  &UR; Huizenga.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to run your own show and your own team, so I'll
never criticize Wayne,'' Steinbrenner said. ``He's a businessman
and he felt his costs were excessive and he didn't think he could
continue . . . He needs a domed stadium, absolutely has to have
it.'' &QL; 
A FOX-y attitude &QL; 
It turns out Los Angeles did the New York Mets a tremendous favor,
only part of which was sending  &UR; Hideo Nomo to the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers agreed to assume all of the salaries of  &UR; Dave Mlicki
and
 &UR; Greg McMichael, the pitchers the Mets sent to Los Angeles in the
deal. Mlicki will earn $1.25 million this season and $2.25 million
next year.
</P>
<P>
   McMichael will earn $1.8 million this season and another $1.8
million next year if he pitches in another 29 games this season,
almost a certainty. &QL; 
The cigar room &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks followed Cincinnati into San Diego during an
early-season series. Arizona Manager  &UR; Buck Showalter complained of
the cigar stench in the visiting manager's dugout at Qualcomm
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Reds Manager  &UR; Jack McKeon, known for chain-smoking cigars, plans
to send Showalter a peace offering when the Diamondbacks visit
Cincinnati Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to send a cigar over to Buck's office,'' McKeon
joked. ``Lit.'' &QL;

2 D-BACKS WIGGLE OFF HOOK  
 LEE'S 2ND HOMER SAVES GARCIA, SPRINGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Between Mark McGwire hitting home runs when they
didn't count, and Travis Lee and Matt Williams hitting them when
they did, there was plenty of joy to be spread among the 48,172 who
saw the Diamondbacks come back to beat the St. Louis Cardinals,
7-4, on Saturday at Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   But probably the most powerful feeling was one of relief, and it
was concentrated in the Diamondbacks' dugout, wherever Karim Garcia
and Russ Springer happened to be sitting. And stewing.
</P>
<P>
   Both were removed from hooks of their own device when Lee's
second homer of the game, a three-run shot, erased a 4-3 Cardinals
lead in the eighth inning. Williams followed with a solo blast for
good measure.
</P>
<P>
   Just two batters before Lee, things looked bleak. With one out
and Brent Brede on first, Garcia, who had come in to play center
field in the top of the inning, laced a single to right off Lance
Painter. Noticing that Willie McGee had to come a long way to cut
off the ball, Garcia tried to leg the hit into a double.
</P>
<P>
   At 39, McGee doesn't cover as much ground as he used to, but he
got there quickly enough and fired a strike to second and cut
Garcia down. So, instead of the Diamondbacks having runners on
first and third and one out, opening a world of possibilities, it
was Brede on third and two out, with limited options. But Jay Bell
drew a walk, his third of the game, and Lee went deep off Jeff
Brantley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really upset,'' said Garcia, who continues to show
progress at the plate since his recall from Tucson two weeks ago.
``I was really (expletive) with myself, to put us in that
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia's teammates applauded his aggressiveness, ``but you've
got to pick the situation,'' he said. ``And that wasn't the right
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Springer, who had nine straight scoreless relief outings before
giving up a home run to Anaheim's Dave Hollins on Thursday, came in
for starter Brian Anderson to pitch the eighth inning with the
Diamondbacks ahead, 3-2. Springer walked the first Cardinals
hitter, McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   The next hitter, Brian Jordan, hit a ball that barely made it
over the fence in left field. The two-run homer put the Cards up by
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I had it set up to get the ball in on him,'' said
Springer. ``I got it in, but not enough. He didn't even hit it off
the meat of the bat.''
</P>
<P>
   Springer's fastball was clocked at 95 mph but had little
movement on it, he said. To his credit, he stopped the bleeding
right there, and then was able to marvel at Lee, like everyone
else.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's fun to watch,'' said Springer, who earned the victory and
improved to 4-3. ``He's got one of the prettier swings I've ever
seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson admired Lee's first homer, a two-run blast, that gave
the Diamondbacks a 3-2 lead in the seventh. He had been lifted for
a pinch-hitter, but stood to get the win after a clutch
seven-inning, eight-hit, two-run performance that kept the
Diamondbacks close.
</P>
<P>
   Before Lee came up, Anderson thought, ``Here we go. Be a hero
and get me a cheap win.''
</P>
<P>
   But after three straight victories, Anderson ended up with a
no-decision. He will, however, take it.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, who hit a grand slam on Friday, singled and flied out
against Anderson after another impressive batting practice display.
Then in the fifth, with two runs in, McGee at second and two out,
Anderson walked McGwire intentionally.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the crowd booed. Then they cheered after Anderson got
Jordan to fly out and end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it,'' Anderson said of the reaction to the free pass.
``They want him to swing the bat. I kind of want him to swing, too.
Pop it up or ground out.'' &QL;

HOMERLESS MCGWIRE STILL THRILLS FANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX A sellout crowd came to cheer him _ even during batting
practice although he is the ``enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been that way everywhere we've gone,'' said  &UR; Mark
McGwire, the man who figures to render moot  &UR; Roger Maris' asterisk.
``I don't know why, either. It's one of those unexplainable
things.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, after creating a hole in one of Bank One
Ballpark's center field scoreboards during an impressive batting
practice display, McGwire labeled a day in which he walked twice,
once intentionally, and had a single in two official at bats in a
7-4 loss as ``perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't do anything so I don't have to talk to anyone,'' he
said. ``It's one of those perfect days.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, fans cheered when his rocket to center field fooled them
into thinking home run, and booed when Diamondbacks Manager  &UR; Buck
Showalter properly ordered him walked. Strange. Perhaps as strange
as Friday's game, when Arizona fans cheered his game-breaking grand
slam at the expense of Diamondbacks pitcher  &UR; Andy Benes.
</P>
<P>
   Showalter was asked whether fan fickleness bothered Benes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andy understands. Fans recognize great plays and cheer them,''
Showalter said.
</P>
<P>
   Showalter believes that if McGwire, who already has 31 homers in
pursuit of Maris' record of 61, stays healthy, he'll break the
record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark has been healthy for an extended period of time, and it
has been awhile since he's been able to put together a streak of
healthy games '' he said. ``I don't think anyone doubts that he'll
get it if he stays healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a great support system behind him. (Cardinals Manager
 &UR; Tony
 &UR; La Russa) knows how to use him and rest him accordingly. I also
think he knows, whether he breaks it or not, he'll still have the
support of the hometown fans and the people he's playing for.''
</P>
<P>
   Maris didn't enjoy that luxury _ half of the baseball public
didn't want him to break  &UR; Babe Ruth's mark and let him know it. &QL; 
Short day &QL; 
On a day when he hit two homers, Diamondbacks first baseman
 &UR; Travis &UR; Lee's hardest shot might have been off the back of
Cardinals starter
 &UR; Kent Mercker's knee, which knocked the left-hander out of the game
in the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   The ball one-hopped off the dirt pathway leading to the mound
and struck Mercker's leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still can't feel it,'' Mercker said of his foot after the
game. ``I know it's there because my shoe is on it.''
</P>
<P>
   X-rays proved negative. &QL; 
Say bye &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Bob Wolcott knows that pro baseball is about
``What-have-you-done-for-us-lately.''
</P>
<P>
   After throwing eight shutout innings in his Diamondbacks
starting debut against Oakland last week, Wolcott was rocked for
seven runs in 3 innings against Anaheim in his second start and was
sent to Tucson on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona recalled right-hander  &UR; Bobby Chouinard from the
Sidewinders in his place. Chouinard, 26, was claimed on waivers
June 2 from Milwaukee and was set to start Saturday night's game
for Tucson, where he had a save and a 3.86 ERA in three
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Showalter has ticketed Chouinard for the overworked bullpen. &QL; 
Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Even though it was only 84 degrees when the first pitch flew
Saturday, the roof was closed on Bank One Ballpark, making it the
the second game completely played indoors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done tests with people sitting in the direct light of
the sun at 1 p.m. It's extremely uncomfortable,'' said  &UR; Bob Machen,
director of operations at the park. ``That's why the roof is there.
So we used it.'' &QL;

MAGAZINE TAKES STARR, PRESS TO TASK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Newly minted media critic Steven Brill Saturday attacked news
organizations' handling of the Monica S. Lewinsky story as a
``scandal'' and accused independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr of
``leaking the most damaging details of the investigation,'' in
possible violation of federal law.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-page ``Pressgate'' article in the first issue of the
media criticism magazine, called Brill's Content, was released
Saturday and contains numerous interviews with prominent
journalists who worked on the Lewinsky story.
</P>
<P>
   Brill's article was greeted as good news by the White House and
is likely to be the talk of today's Washington pundit parade, with
Brill appearing on C-SPAN, CNN, and CBS.
</P>
<P>
   The most eye-opening section is Brill's April interview with
Starr, in which the independent counsel says he ``talked with
reporters on background on some occasions,'' and that his deputy
Jackie Bennett Jr. did most of the talking to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Starr told Brill, the founder of Court TV and The American
Lawyer magazine, that there was ``nothing improper'' about those
conversations since they did not involve grand jury proceedings.
Federal law prohibits prosecutors from revealing information from
grand jury proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Starr also argued the leaks were needed to counter
``misinformation'' being spread about his investigation. Saturday,
he said the article ``recklessly and irresponsibly'' charged him
with improper contacts with the media.
</P>
<P>
   Brill writes that the conversations are ``clearly a violation of
both Justice Department prosecutorial guidelines and the bar's
ethical code.'' And though Brill called Starr ``an old friend of
mine,'' in an interview Saturday, he stated that Starr's defense of
those conversations proves ``he's lost perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, White House spokesman Jim Kennedy said, ``The article
raises grave concerns about Mr. Starr's entire investigation. There
are now very serious questions about the way this investigation
began and whether Mr. Starr has a conflict that prevents him from
investigating his office's conduct in this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy called for an independent investigator to evalute
Starr's pattern of ``violating grand jury secrecy.''
</P>
<P>
   In Starr's statement Saturday, he said his office ``does not
release grand jury material directly or indirectly, on the record
or off the record.'' He added that his contacts with journalists
``have been legal, appropriate and consistent with Department of
Justice policy.''
</P>
<P>
   In assessing the first three weeks of coverage of the Lewinsky
story that broke in January, Brill sees a series of events that
moved from Linda Tripp _ who he says taped Lewinsky in the hopes of
writing a White House tell-all book _ to an overreaching Starr, to
a press corps so eager for salacious scoops that it became
``corrupted to its core'' and ``an enabler of Starr's abuse of
power.'' Tripp's tape recordings led to an investigation into
whether President Clinton had a sexual affair with former White
House intern Lewinsky and asked her to lie about it.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Pressgate,'' Brill states that he saw internal memos from
three news organizations that ``cite Starr's office as a source.''
But he writes that reporters were unwilling to fully pursue the
issue of Starr leaks because they were the beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Brill's analysis also focuses on the role of Tripp and her
adviser, book agent Lucianne Goldberg, in peddling the Lewinsky
story to the media.
</P>
<P>
   Brill writes that ``it is impossible to imagine'' that the
Constitution's authors wanted a president impeached ``all because a
Linda Tripp and Lucianne Goldberg got an intern to talk into a
tapped phone about sex so they could put together a book deal.''
</P>
<P>
   In his scathing criticism of the press, Brill parcels out plenty
of blame. He reconstructs the history of such rumors as the
semen-stained dress and reports of witnesses to a White House
encounter between Lewinsky and Clinton, chalking them up to sloppy
reporting.
</P>
<P>
   The story is also harshly critical of television commentators
who speculated about the scandal. Among his targets are Newsweek's
Howard Fineman, who admits in the story to saying ``things that
were unfair or worse''; NBC's Tim Russert, who was telling viewers
in late January that Clinton had only a few days to offer a
complete explanation; and ABC's Sam Donaldson, who on Jan. 25
asserted that Clinton's presidency could be ``numbered in days.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The real point of this piece,'' said Brill in the interview,
``is that to me, this is a complete flip from the press's role in
Watergate.'' Not only were reporting standards stricter for
Watergate, he said, but in that case the press stood up to power.
In the Lewinsky episode, he accuses journalists of being a tool of
Starr.

requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,

list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To, and

criticism from publishing houses.)

   &UR; THE PERFECT STORM: A TRUE STORY OF MEN AGAINST THE SEA &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Sebastian Junger. Harper Paperbacks, $6.99.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, a 72-foot swordfishing boat and its crew of six were
hit in the Atlantic by a violent nor'easter with 120-mile-per-hour
winds and waves up to 100 feet high. The ensuing tragedy is
reconstructed in harrowing fashion, largely through the accounts of
survivors in other boats. ``The result is thrilling _ a boat ride
into and (for us) out of a watery hell,'' Anthony Bailey said here
last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PUBLISH AND PERISH: THREE TALES OF TENURE AND TERROR &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By James Hynes. Picador USA, $14.
</P>
<P>
   These novellas, driven by the monsters of pretension and
ambition that lurk in the groves of academe, meld post-modern farce
with old-fashioned cliffhanging narrative. ``Hynes is fearlessly
playful, a riveting storyteller and a graceful observer of human
folly,'' Cathleen Schine wrote last year in the Book Review.
Another satirical romp set in academia,  &UR; STRAIGHT MAN &LR; , by Richard
Russo (Vintage Contemporaries, $13), follows the misadventures of a
wisenheimer English professor at a third-rate college in
Pennsylvania. In 1997 our reviewer, Tom De Haven, called this ``the
funniest serious novel I have read since _ well, maybe since
'Portnoy's Complaint.' ''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SOUTHERN CROSS: THE BEGINNINGS OF THE BIBLE BELT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Christine Leigh Heyrman.
</P>
<P>
   University of North Carolina, $16.95.
</P>
<P>
   The itinerant evangelical preachers who swept through the South
as the Baptist and Methodist churches were taking shape in the late
18th century adapted their tone and theology in surprising ways to
win white male converts and broaden their appeal beyond women,
children, and slaves. This is a ``wonderfully told and beautifully
written story,'' Charles B. Dew wrote here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE SHARP TEETH OF LOVE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Doris Betts. Scribner, $12.
</P>
<P>
   A former anorexic and current medical illustrator named Luna
Stone ditches her handsome fiance as they head to Nevada to get
married, and flees to the mountains near Donner Lake, where she
takes up with a snaggletoothed boy and a dropout from a Lutheran
seminary. Last year in the Book Review, Maxine Chernoff said this
novel ``relates with considerable tenderness'' the story of how the
three wanderers ``emerge from their emotional wilderness.'' The
same publisher has reissued a collection of Betts's short fiction,
 &UR; BEASTS OF THE SOUTHERN WILD: AND OTHER STORIES &LR;  ($11). Whether
exploring the inner life of a girl in labor, a schoolteacher or a
disfigured bus passenger, the writing ``remains very much an index
of one woman's intriguing mind,'' Michael Mewshaw wrote here in
1973.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TREASURE HUNT: A NEW YORK TIMES REPORTER TRACKS THE QUEDLINBURG
HOARD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By William H. Honan. Delta, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   At the close of the Second World War, 12 priceless medieval
objects were stolen from a cave near an ancient German town by a
kleptomaniac American soldier. The author, a correspondent for The
New York Times, tells in colorful detail how he and a European art
sleuth turned up the loot in small-town Texas nearly 50 years
later. ``This exciting and often rather touching book'' is ''a very
good read, full of suspense,'' Lynn Nicholas wrote here last year.
 &UR; THE LOST MUSEUM: THE NAZI CONSPIRACY TO STEAL THE WORLD'S GREATEST
WORKS OF ART &LR; , by Hector Feliciano (Basic Books, $15), traces the
fate of thousands of plundered artworks from Jewish collections in
occupied France as they passed from top Nazi officials to
collectors and dealers in France, Switzerland, and elsewhere. This
disturbing account of opportunistic greed and the banality of evil
is an ``important and instructive book,'' Richard Bernstein said in
The Times in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE SPEED QUEEN &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Stewart O'Nan. Ballantine, $12.
</P>
<P>
   In a creepy death-row novel straight out of Oliver Stone
country, a young woman explains how she slipped off track and wound
up as a partner in a drug-fueled killing spree that left 12 people
dead. Last year our reviewer, George Stade, said this lurid
confessional displays ``an unfailing intelligence, a grim and
bracing humor, an unblinking eye for the telling detail.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MONSTER: LIVING OFF THE BIG SCREEN &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By John Gregory Dunne. Vintage, $12.
</P>
<P>
   The author recounts one of the many screenwriting campaigns that
turned him and his partner and wife, Joan Didion, into hardened
veterans. In showing how the creature of the title (money) and its
best friend (the star) control the ``creative'' process, this book
``offers a crash course in getting a script through the hazards of
the present-day studio system,'' Larry Gelbart wrote here last
year. The same publisher has reissued an earlier account of Dunne's
Hollywood adventures,  &UR; THE STUDIO &LR;  ($13), which details the inner
workings of 20th Century Fox and the moviemaking ethos in 1967,
when films like ``Planet of the Apes'' were taking shape. In 1969,
one critic admired how the author captured the ''Gothic mix of
greed, hypocrisy, shrewd calculation, mad hoopla and boundless
optimism that shapes American films.''

   &UR; COMFORT WOMAN &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Nora Okja Keller. Penguin, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   A young Korean-American woman discovers that her tormented
mother was sold by her family during World War II and forced into a
``recreation center'' run by the Japanese army. Switching between
the daughter's voice and the mother's, this ``accomplished first
novel ... beautifully evokes both their anguish and their love,''
Lise Funderburg said here in 1997.

   (Revised) CLINTON-DEVELOPING _ WASHINGTON _ On June 24 President
Clinton heads to China for the third of this year's five planned
presidential forays into the developing world. The 10-day China
visit, an extraordinary amount of time for a single country, comes
on the heels of Clinton's Africa trip in March and his visit to
South America in April. (Deans, Cox News Service).

   WRONG-GUY _ ATLANTA _ David Smith, a Delta Airlines mechanic
from McDonough, has been in trouble with the law repeatedly since
February. The only problem is, the real criminal isn't Smith, but
someone who has assumed his identity after getting a hold of his
Social Security number. (Hardie, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

<P>
   KIDNAPPER _ ATLANTA _Dorothy Leonard isn't sure of a lot of

before the end of World War II, scattering her brothers and sisters
into orphanages south of Atlanta. (Scruggs, Atlanta

   AUSTIN AMERICAN STATESMAN BATS PACKAGE
</P>
<P>
   These stories will move Sunday, June 14.
</P>
<P>
   BAT _ From caves in northern Mexico, three-quarters of a million
bats (mostly pregnant) females fly each spring to tiny slots under
the Congress Avenue bridge to give birth and awe tourists. But in
Mexico bats are seen as livestock killers and the
Austin-headquartered Bats International sends representatives into
the schools to convince Mexican families otherwise. We meet with
Mexican conservationists and visit Cueva de la Boca, one of our
bats' winter hide-outs. BEACH
</P>
<P>
   BAT-SCIENCE _ As a maternity ward and nursing station for
Mexican free-tail bats, the 16-inch-deep, 1-inch-wide expansion
slots of the Congress Avenue bridge couldn't be more perfect. The
concrete soaks up the day's heat and keeps the pups warm while
momma bats fly nightly sorties across Central Texas to consume huge
amounts of insects, mostly plump moths, not tiny mosquitos. (Beach,
Austin American-Statesman)
</P>
<P>
   BAT-BRACKEN _ Merlin Tuttle takes Ty and Beach to Bracken Cave,
home of the largest known colony of any mammal on earth _ as many
as 40 million Mexican free-tail bats _ and talks about getting
chased by cannibals, nibbled on by flesh-eating fish and the like.
Then the bats come out. We get a rare look. (Austin
American-Statesman)
</P>
<P>
   BAT-BRIDGE _ Bat Conservation International have made the
biggest urban bat colony in the country under the Congress Avenue
bridge a must-see for Austin visitors. (Beach, Austin
American-Statesman)
</P>

   ENTERTAINMENT/ARTS
</P>
<P>
   REM _ A report from the third Tibetan Freedom Concert, set for
June 13 in Washington D.C., is a coming-out of sorts for Athens
supergroup R.E.M. It's only the second time in their career they've
interrupted a recording session to make a live appearance. And this
one is the group's first public outing since drummer Bill Berry
quit the group last October. No doubt the band will test some new
material from the album-in-progress. Plus band members will be
available to answer questions. (MLongino, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) For release Sunday, June 14.

   U.N.-TRIBUNAL (Rome) _ In one of the most ambitious efforts ever

   INDIA-NUKE (United Nations) _ The man who is expected to become
India's next foreign minister says that the end of the Cold War has
left a power vacuum from central Asia to Africa that his government

environment, he said, that ultimately triggered India's decision to

   TEXMEX-ECON (El Paso) _ Four years after the North American Free
Trade Agreement lowered trade barriers, the cities along Texas'
long border with Mexico are struggling to become more than
glorified truck depots for the free trade era, a smoggy transfer
zone for the American economy thriving hundreds of miles to their
north. Elsewhere in Texas, as in most of the United States, the
economy is booming. But here along the border, unemployment
persists at two and three times the national rate and incomes
remain far below state and national averages. By Sam Howe Verhovek.

   GM-STRIKE-FLINT (Flint, Mich.) _ The people of Flint are tired
of both sides in the current strike against a GM parts plant here.

   (Coded w)
</P>
<P>
   REPUBS-TAXCUTTERS (Washington) _ It's been a tough year for
Republican tax cutters. Clinton effectively put the budget surplus
off limits by claiming it for Social Security. Efforts to pay for a
tax cut by slashing spending have run into a wall of political
opposition. Other potential sources, like the money generated by
the proposed anti-smoking bill, aren't yet certain. So it was
perhaps not surprising when Gingrich and his lieutenants lashed out
in frustration last week at the Congressional Budget Office, whose
estimates of the nation's fiscal condition over the past few years
have proven consistently too pessimistic. By Richard W. Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   WHEAT-SANCTIONS (Washington) _ Under pressure from farmers,
Congress is poised to skirt the nation's sanctions on India and
Pakistan by allowing the sale of wheat to those countries. This
would seem to undermine the administration's moral outrage against
India and Pakistan. By Katharine Q. Seelye.

<TEXT>
<P>
   With a rising number of the nation's Hispanic television viewers
now bilingual, a handful of programs are being broadcast that use
varying degrees of both English and Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of such programming on Spanish-language networks
and in high-profile local programming reflects efforts by
television executives to reach a younger, more culturally attuned
niche of the nation's 8 million Hispanic households. Though the
networks have been slow to attract this population, other media
like magazine publishing, radio and music are flourishing with
crossover content that reflects the Latin experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's overdue,'' said Bruce Silverman, executive vice president
of Western Media International in Los Angeles, a buyer of media
time.
</P>
<P>
   The newest program is from Telemundo Group Inc., which with a 17
percent share of the Spanish market is a distant second to
Univision Communications Inc., with 83 percent. Telemundo
affiliates in 60 markets recently began broadcasting a daily
variety show whose host is Cuban-born actress Maria Conchita
Alonso, who often strays into Spanglish, a hybrid of English and
Spanish. In the program's first month, Telemundo has seen national
ratings for its time slot increase about 10 percent, according to
A.C. Nielsen.
</P>
<P>
   The show was in the works even before the announcement in
November of Telemundo's planned sale to Sony Pictures Entertainment
and Tele-Communications Inc. But it reflects Sony's intent to
update the look and content of the network's programs, said Alan
Sokol, a Sony senior vice president. ``We think advertisers have a
tremendous hunger for programming other than novellas,'' he said,
referring to the lurid, low-budget, foreign-made soap operas on
both Spanish networks.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, ad agency representatives in New York will get a
look at Telemundo's first Sony-backed season lineup. Sony's
acquisition of Telemundo is expected to receive regulatory approval
next month.
</P>
<P>
   Sony is already a steady program supplier to network television
with shows like ``Dawson's Creek'' and ``Vibe.'' The company has
financed a dozen Telemundo pilots and intends to put into weekly
production enough programming to revamp at least one full night in
prime time. The shows will include one-hour dramas and be only in
Spanish. ``We hope and believe the bilingual audience will come
back,'' Sokol said, ``but we don't want to risk alienating the
Spanish-dominant audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Barry Diller's USA Networks Inc. began Citi Vision, a
local programming effort at the Miami station WAMI. Its lineup
includes ``Generation n,'' a bilingual magazine show based on a
locally popular English-language magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Univision's cable network, Galavision, began
broadcasting a group of programs on Sunday night that are nearly
all in English seasoned with Spanish phrases. The programs include
``Funny Is Funny,'' a comedy, and back-to-back reruns of ``Que
Pasa, USA?,'' a 20-year-old Miami-based sitcom from the Public
Broadcasting System.
</P>
<P>
   The results are telling. In the first six weeks, about 55,000
viewers tuned in who do not normally watch the Spanish-language
cable network, which is available to 1.7 million Hispanic homes,
said Anne H. Corley, a spokeswoman for Univision.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Economics and politics are forcing Hispanics to embrace English
more quickly, said Alex Nogales, chairman of the National Hispanic
Media Coalition, an advocacy group. The decision this month by
California voters to ban bilingual education in schools underscores
that, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media is 10 steps behind what the world is made out of,''
said Nogales, a former television producer who was consulted by
Sony on its Telemundo pilots. Because they rely on foreign shows,
Spanish networks are losing young viewers to mainstream networks,
he said, while insularity at national networks produces fare like
Fox's ``Culture Clash'' and ABC's ``Common Law,'' programs aimed at
Hispanic viewers that did not survive a season.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Valdez, producer of ``Funny Is Funny,'' added: ``We have
more Latinos than Canada has citizens. How can you ignore this
market?''

WASHINGTON POST'S NEW MANAGING EDITOR SETS QUEST

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A guest seeking Steve Coll, the managing editor in
waiting at The Washington Post, turns left on leaving the
fifth-floor lobby of The Post, bypassing the main section of the
newsroom. A circuitous path through the style section's desks leads
to Coll's office, currently a parking lot for binders full of memos
about the institution he will help lead, starting June 29.
</P>
<P>
   In the Post's geography, Coll's office is an outer suburb. It is
far distant from the muscular power centers where national,
metropolitan and foreign news is gathered, edited and published _
as distant, in psychic terms, as Coll's teen-age haunts in the
mall-filled precincts of nearby Rockville, Md., were from the State
Department or the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``My career has been a zigzag; there is no question about
that,'' Coll (pronounced to rhyme with the first syllable in
``holly'') said in a recent interview. It began at a music industry
trade journal in Los Angeles where he typed classified ads _ ``you
know, heavy metal lead singer seeks glam bass player'' _ and took
him to the Wall Street beat, then overseas. Now he wants to add a
new dimension to The Post, although he has little management
experience to call on.
</P>
<P>
   The stock-in-trade of the 39-year-old has been exploring
journalistic territory from unusual angles and with uncommon depth.
His boss, executive editor, Leonard Downie Jr., 56, made his name
in hands-on hard-news editing. Coll, despite plenty of hard-news
experience, looks at the world through a longer lens. ``He's more
creative and imaginative than I am, and he communicates better,''
Downie said.
</P>
<P>
   And when Coll talks about his vision for The Post, he speaks
about institutionalizing the quest for remarkable, in-depth nuanced
pieces that many journalistic institutions put on a pedestal but
fewer manage to get into print.
</P>
<P>
   ``An important part of what I want to do involves changing the
attitude in the newsroom about ambitious investigative work and
projects,'' Coll said. ``Far too many reporters and editors in the
newsroom today shy away from project work or approach it with great
trepidation because they feel that projects become flypaper for
demoralizing editing and second-guessing and end up falling short
of their original ambitions.''
</P>
<P>
   In a business of sound bites, Coll speaks in full, well-turned
paragraphs. A blues pianist by avocation, he is also immersed in a
chronological study of the American presidency (currently stalled
at Zachary Taylor). And at a paper whose main franchise is breaking
stories about government, Coll made his reputation inviting readers
to understand complexity, about subjects from nuclear
nonproliferation to the Securities and Exchange Commission. His
coverage of the commission brought him and his colleague David A.
Vise a Pulitzer Prize in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, he nearly left the paper for a book-writing
career that has already produced four books. His methodology in all
endeavors: clear-cutting his way through available information,
then molding a story, told around individuals, that makes
intimidating subjects accessible.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the newsroom wonder whether Downie, known for closely
monitoring much of the work there, will give Coll room to breathe.
Downie, however, sees no problem. ``I certainly have strong gut
instincts about where he will fill things out and where I will
recede,'' Downie said. ``Certainly he has a particular competency
in the whole business of driving enterprise reporting.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rick Atkinson, the paper's assistant managing editor for
investigations and projects, said: ``The prime attraction Steve had
for Leonard was that he was not Leonard. He's not a hard-news,
blood-and-guts, get-out-the-paper kind of guy. He has an
inclination for ways to work that won't simply be a matter of
following in Len's footsteps.''
</P>
<P>
   Coll came to The Post in 1985, writing for the Style section and
later covering Wall Street. By 1990, he was in India.
</P>
<P>
   From there, he wrote a magazine piece about the suburbs of his
childhood. `` `What village do you belong to?' they asked me again
and again in India,'' he wrote. ``It's an unsettling question. On
the subcontinent you aren't just `from' somewhere.'' Instead, ``you
`belong' to the place of your origins.''
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post's newsroom asks similar questions: which
desk do you come from? Coll's resume lists none of the big downtown
desks _ the metropolitan desk, with its 150 or so journalists, or
the national staff. As the heir to Robert G. Kaiser _ who will
return to writing this summer _ he is among the first top editors
at a large metropolitan daily whose training came from covering
Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest gap in Coll's resume is management
experience. The newsroom he will lead employs about 800 people. The
Washington Post Magazine, which he edited for about two years, has
20 editorial staff members. But even there, he broke molds. Coll
was the first editor of that magazine to serve as its publisher,
supervising about 10 advertising and circulation workers.
</P>
<P>
   Coll acknowledges that he faces a difficult task nursing the
institution and its new color presses through ``more manufacturing
change than any time in the paper's history'' in the next year. But
his first priority is understanding The Post's journalists.
</P>
<P>
   To encourage enterprise, he seeks to change the pessimism that
saps newsroom morale. ``You know, there's a lot of conversation in
the newsroom about our worst work,'' he said. ``Reporters say, `I
could be great the way you want me to be, but the problem is my
editors don't understand.' And editors say, `I could be great the
way you want me to be; the trouble is my reporters aren't
capable.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a way of failing to take responsibility,'' he said. ``I
want to avoid this discussion.''

underfinanced small market-teams hope to stay competitive by
discovering overlooked talent in the inner cities. We follow Jerry

<P>
   A potential anti-obesity drug being developed by Amgen Inc.,
which made headlines a few years ago by sharply reducing body fat
in mice, has now been found to contribute to weight loss in people
as well, scientists reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The results, the first clinical trial data presented at a
scientific meeting, could help lay to rest recent speculation that
the drug, leptin, would not work in humans. The results, however,
also seem to suggest that leptin will not be a sure-fire cure for
obesity.
</P>
<P>
   ``At appropriate doses it causes weight loss in some people,''
said Dr. Andrew S. Greenberg, who directs obesity research at Tufts
University and at the New England Medical Center in Boston. He was
the lead author of the study presented Sunday at the annual
scientific sessions of the American Diabetes Association in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   In the Phase I trial, mainly intended to test leptin's safety,
obese people who dieted and got the highest dose of leptin lost an
average of 15.6 pounds after six months, an 8 percent weight
reduction. Those who dieted but received a placebo lost an average
of only 3.7 pounds, a reduction of about 1.5 percent to 2 percent,
Greenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   But leptin did not work for everyone. Of the eight people who
got the highest dose, one had no weight loss and a second actually
gained weight.
</P>
<P>
   The variability is to be expected because obesity has many
causes, Greenberg said. He said the results were significant in two
respects. One is that weight loss increased as dosage increased, a
sign the drug is effective. Second, it removes the doubts as to
whether leptin would work at all.
</P>
<P>
   Leptin is produced by fat cells in the body and helps keep
weight in check, apparently by signaling the brain to suppress the
appetite or to burn off fat more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of leptin and the gene to produce it three years
ago created a stir because it seemed to point to a genetic basis
for obesity and a potential new therapy. Mice that lacked the gene
to produce leptin were obese. Moreover, both obese and normal mice
quickly lost body fat when given injections of leptin made by
genetic engineering. Amgen licensed the patents from Rockefeller
University in New York, where the initial discovery was made.
</P>
<P>
   But hopes that leptin would be an anti-fat potion dimmed when
subsequent research showed that obese people actually had higher
levels of leptin than others, suggesting that the problem is not a
lack of leptin but an inability to use it. If that were the case,
then giving even more leptin might be futile.
</P>
<P>
   But the study presented Sunday suggested that extra leptin can
help, as if giving more of it helps compensate for the inefficiency
in using it.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Dr. Xavier Pi-Sunyer, professor of medicine at Columbia
University, said the weight loss reported for leptin appears only
equivalent to that of existing weight-loss medications like Meridia
by the Knoll Pharmaceuticals unit of BASF. Also, the existing
medications are pills while leptin must be injected daily. Some
patients taking the highest dose of leptin needed three shots a day
and developed skin irritations from the injections.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I think you really have to show a better response with
injectables because you have to compete head to head with the
orals,'' Dr. Pi-Sunyer said. ``Leptin in my mind is a little bit of
a disappointment.'' But Amgen hopes that as a natural protein,
leptin will have fewer side effects than weight-loss pills, some of
which have been withdrawn from the market.
</P>
<P>
   Amgen, which is based in Thousand Oaks, Calif., has started a
Phase I trial with a second-generation leptin that it hopes will
allow for greater doses with fewer shots. It is continuing with
Phase II trials of the first-generation leptin to treat obesity and
to control blood sugar levels in overweight diabetics.
</P>
<P>
   Amgen is under Wall Street pressure to come up with a new hit,
after going several years without a significant new drug.

TECHNOLOGY: THE PRIMAL FORCE OF CHANGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DENISE CARUSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the most reliable human characteristics is aversion to
change. And when it comes to embracing technology, it is a
characteristic that even today's newest celebrity class, the
business executive, seems to possess in abundance.
</P>
<P>
   Whether they run banks or chemical companies or media
conglomerates, and despite the clear impact that technology is
having on their industries, many executives shy away from
technology. Often they seem reticent to do much more than apply it
as though it were some kind of medicinal leech, slapping on a Web
site here or an online database there when someone tells them they
have to.
</P>
<P>
   And especially in older, more traditional companies, they rarely
consider technology crucial to their survival.
</P>
<P>
   Who can blame them? Every other day, it seems, the technology
landscape changes and everything new is old again. But company
leaders may be inclined to reconsider this point of view after
reading ``Unleashing the Killer App: Digital Strategies for Market
Dominance,'' a new book by Larry Downes and Chunka Mui (Harvard
Business School Press, 1998).
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rather overheated title, these two Chicago-based
consultants have written a practical and persuasive guide that
focuses on how all businesses, even risk-averse old-line
organizations, have an opportunity ``not just to survive but to
exploit dramatic changes'' wrought in their markets by technology.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of shrinking from the hard problems facing existing
corporations, Downes and Mui attack them head-on with 12 technology
strategies to help build what the authors call ``killer apps.''
</P>
<P>
   By their definition, killer apps, or applications, are
innovative goods or services that establish an entirely new
category and, by being first, pay off lavishly for shareholders,
investors and, especially, customers.
</P>
<P>
   The way to unleash them, the authors assert, is to deploy some
radical strategies, including: ``cannibalize your markets,'' ``give
away as much information as you can,'' ``treat your assets as
liabilities'' and ``destroy your value chain.''
</P>
<P>
   They dissect many success stories, including Amazon.com, British
Petroleum, Fedex, Intuit and McDonald's. Others remain nameless but
are impressive nonetheless: For example, a home heating oil company
that is a small division of a larger oil and gas retailer. It owns
only 4 percent of its market for selling directly to homes, but
that share represents 75 percent of the company's revenue, and the
company sells at a much-reduced margin to independent local
dealers.
</P>
<P>
   With little to lose, it ``wrecked the business model for
everyone'' and designed Virtual Fuel Co. It will first sell
directly to customers via telephone and the Internet; long-term
plans are to connect sensors in home oil tanks to the production
plant over a network, so delivery orders are generated
automatically when fuel levels get low.
</P>
<P>
   Partners who are already warehousers and shippers for the home
oil business will allow Virtual Fuel to compete with local dealers
on price and, especially, on service, since the new company will be
online for its customers 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   Kicking sand in the face of local suppliers or using just about
any of these apparently outrageous strategies sounds like suicide
to most traditional retail or service businesses. But Downes and
Mui say the alternatives are grimmer still.
</P>
<P>
   Already, technology's most aggressive practitioners _ today's
digital commerce start-ups, which have no existing distribution
channels to alienate, no preconceived notions of how businesses
``should'' be run, no old anything _ are beginning to bulldoze
markets for existing products and are exploding traditional
relationships with suppliers, regulators and partners.
</P>
<P>
   These pioneers _ including Netscape Communications Corp., which
gave away its browser software and started the commercial Internet;
Amazon.com, the online bookseller; E-Trade, the all-cyberspace
stock trading company, and Auto-By-Tel, the online car seller _ use
technology to completely redefine service and value in their
industries.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the already tumultuous effect of such start-ups, both
Downes and Mui scoff at the spate of record-breaking mergers and
acquisitions that have been making front-page news.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other digitally savvy business experts, the authors
view recent deregulation laws for the cable, telecommunications,
media and banking industries as government entitlements to help old
industries protect their markets by sheer bulk _ what they call ``a
20th century industrial approach to a 21st century digital
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're learning that a lot of what we were told was
consumer-protective regulation is actually industry-protective
regulation,'' Downes said. For example, the authors wrote in a
recent article for American Banker magazine that the ``crazed
consolidation'' of banks in response to deregulation is ``like
mosquitoes mating in a giant cloud.''
</P>
<P>
   Any consolidation strategy, the authors say, locks companies
into the old ways of doing business, making them vulnerable in a
more efficient marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that the business guys get caught up in their
existing value chain _ the transfer of value between the layers''
of buyers, sellers and service providers, Mui said. ``They forget
that at the end of the value chain are billions of consumers with
much more negotiating power than any one of those layers.''
</P>
<P>
   And that negotiating power, the authors predict, will be fueled
by technology. Thus the core of their message is that the companies
must reach for a new understanding that technology itself is the
primal force of change today, no matter what the industry. That
unless they rebuild their businesses with this fact in mind, others
will do it for them. That in fact, they may already have.

ADVERTISING: PITCHING PRESCRIPTION DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn.)  (mk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The proliferation of prescription drug pitches aimed
directly at consumers has become one of the hottest topics in
advertising. So it was not unexpected that a seminar on the
subject, attended by more than 200 agency and pharmaceutical
industry executives, should generate its share of Zoloft zingers,
the Rx equivalents of Maalox moments.
</P>
<P>
   The seminar, grandly called the Health Summit Breakfast, was
held last week in midtown Manhattan as a cooperative project of
three magazines owned by the Time Inc. unit of Time Warner Inc.:
Time, Health and Hippocrates.
</P>
<P>
   There were speeches, a panel discussion and the release of
preliminary findings from what was described as the first major
study of consumer attitudes about prescription drugs since the Food
and Drug Administration shook up the field last August by relaxing
standards governing television spots for them.
</P>
<P>
   The highlight was an assertive keynote speech by Dr. David
Kessler, the commissioner of Food and Drugs from 1990 to 1997. He
said the drug industry might one day rue its rush to peddle
prescription products on TV amid claims that direct-to-consumer
advertising improves health care by more fully educating patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line, I will submit, is that no one today knows if
more benefit or more harm will be done by expanding
direct-to-consumer advertising,'' said Kessler, now the dean of the
Yale University School of Medicine. That is so, he added, because
the commercials may mislead or confuse the public to ask for drugs
that are inappropriate, unneeded or even dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prescription drugs are not just any consumer product; there
are real risks,'' Kessler said. ``Whenever you sell a product with
risks, you have a special responsibility. If you have doubts, ask
your lawyer.''
</P>
<P>
   Kessler predicted that one day there would be a product
liability trial centered on drug commercials, warning, ``In that
courtroom, I can assure you, someone is going to roll in that VCR
and that monitor and play the ad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You want people to want your product, and that's OK,'' Kessler
said. ``But the fact is if we move to a culture that increasingly
pushes prescription drugs, I ask you whether that is in the public
health interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Kessler, a longtime opponent of direct-to-consumer appeals for
prescription drugs, reminded the audience of his role in blocking
the loosening of the regulations for such spots while he was head
of the FDA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably more than any other individual stood in the way''
of the changes, he said, adding that he was ``in favor of giving
patients more information about drugs'' but only ``after the
medicine is prescribed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People like me will never say, `Gee, those ads are just
great,''' Kessler said. ``But you can tip the balance toward the
benefits if you focus an ad not only on the product you're trying
to sell but on the public health interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should be ashamed to run a prescription drug ad if it's
not in the public interest. You can take the high ground; you can
talk about the public health issue and also sell your product. If
you can't say your ad is in the public health interest, don't run
it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gay Kassan, marketing development director at Corporate
Marketing Intelligence, an in-house research unit at Time Inc.,
described the initial findings of the survey, which was conducted
among 1,500 consumers aged 18 and over in March and April; a
separate study of 2,760 physicians was conducted during that same
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers remain very reliant on health care professionals for
health care advice,'' Ms. Kassan said. She cited survey findings
that 66 percent of consumers said they looked to pharmacists for
advice; 65 percent said they looked to physicians; 34 percent, to
friends and relatives; 28 percent, to articles in newspapers and
magazines, and 26 percent, to television news.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what they wanted from direct-to-consumer drug advertising,
the consumers responding to the survey most often said (84 percent)
they wanted the ads to clearly state all the risks associated with
the medicine. That was followed by wanting all needed information
(76 percent); a toll-free telephone number (66 percent); time to
study the ad (65 percent) and preventing children from seeing the
ad (64 percent).
</P>
<P>
   As for the physicians surveyed, 79 percent said they were
concerned that the relaxed guidelines for commercials would cause
patients to ask for unnecessary or incorrect drugs. Only 40 percent
said they believed that the ads would help them provide the best
treatment for patients.
</P>
<P>
   And 65 percent of the doctors said they believed that the most
important purpose of direct-to-consumer advertising was building
awareness of diseases and their symptoms. That was followed by
educating patients about treatment options, at 53 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Since no seminar would be complete without a sales pitch from
the sponsor, Ms. Kassan shared results of the survey about various
media. ``Consumers rate magazines as the most appropriate medium''
for pharmaceutical advertising, she said, at 58 percent; television
had 27 percent and newspapers, 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Magazines like Time, Health and Hippocrates are keen to retain
their ads for prescription drugs and to slow the shift of such ad
dollars from print to TV, which has sharply accelerated since the
regulations were changed.
</P>
<P>
   That increase in commercials has fueled a substantial increase
in direct-to-consumer ad spending. A panelist, Maureen Regan, chief
executive at Regan Campbell Ward in New York _ a health care agency
that is part of the McCann-Erickson World Group unit of Interpublic
Group of Cos. _ predicted that such spending would total $1.6
billion this year, compared with an estimated $1 billion in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would mean outspending cereals, beer and hotels and
resorts,'' Ms. Regan said.
</P>
<P>
   So, imagine the possibilities for peddling drugs like those
products. How about a commercial sung to the tune of an old Post
cereal jingle:
</P>
<P>
   ``Most any antidepressant is fine with me as long as you spell
it Z-O-L-O-F-T.''

WITH A NEW SMART SUITE, LOTUS CHASES ITS RIVALS' SUCCESS

<TEXT>
<P>
   This week the Lotus Development Corp. will begin shipping the
Smart Suite Millennium Edition, which includes the latest version
of the 1-2-3 spreadsheet program, word processing, data base,
graphics and other productivity software. The question is does
anyone care.
</P>
<P>
   Battered by the relentless onslaught of Microsoft, Lotus has
seen its market share in desktop software dwindle so low that many
analysts no longer bother to track it. Although Smart Suite has
often been praised by reviewers and users as a cleaner,
less-cluttered alternative to Microsoft's Office 97, Microsoft's
ability to tie the applications to the Windows operating system has
proved an unbeatable advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Smart Suite is to be shipped on Wednesday at a suggested retail
price of $399; the upgrade price for users of older Lotus or
competing programs is $149. In addition to 1-2-3, Smart Suite
includes the Word Pro word processor, Freelance Graphics
presentation application, Approach data base, Organizer time and
contact manager and Screencam multimedia tool. It also includes
Lotus Mail e-mail as well as both the Netscape Navigator 4.0 and
Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 browsers.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of the original IBM personal computer were driven by Lotus
1-2-3, which combined an accountant's spreadsheet with a program
that could turn the rows of numbers into charts and graphs. But
Lotus stumbled as the PC evolved. It was late to market with a
version of 1-2-3 for the Apple Macintosh, allowing Microsoft Excel
to grab that market; late again when Microsoft Windows took off,
ceding the PC itself to Excel, and late again when the market
turned to the bundles of applications called suites. IBM acquired a
weakened Lotus in June 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's probably revenue there,'' said Jeff Tarter, editor of
Softletter, an industry newsletter. ``But a lot of it seems to be
stuff IBM's selling to existing accounts. Or, in some cases,
they're counting as sales stuff pre-installed on IBM PCs, which the
resellers promptly de-install. It's pretty much just a replacement
market _ anybody who's got 5,000 employees using 1-2-3 who doesn't
want to convert to Excel.''
</P>
<P>
   While Lotus 1-2-3 was once the world's leading software program,
Smart Suite is a distant third behind Office 97 and Corel Corp.'s
Wordperfect Suite, said Ann Stephens, an analyst with PC Data.
Measured in units, Lotus' retail market share is 3.7 percent,
behind Corel's 26.5 percent and Microsoft's nearly 70 percent;
Lotus' corporate market share is 2 percent, behind Corel at 2.6
percent and Microsoft with more than 95 percent. In dollar terms,
Lotus has 2.4 percent of the retail and 2.2 percent of the
corporate markets.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Papows, president and chief executive at Lotus, says
Smart Suite's global market share is higher than these figures
indicate, about 7 percent in dollars, 22 to 24 percent in units,
and higher than Corel's share. He said 7 percent of a $5 billion
market was still worth pursuing, and a profitable business. But he
conceded that Smart Suite had been battered by Office 97, largely
because Microsoft could offer it to PC makers along with the
Windows operating system at terms no one could refuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft, by means that one must argue are pretty predatory,
has clearly conquered a majority of the marketplace,'' Papows
asserted. ``But there's a certain percentage of the marketplace,
who because they are Notes or Domino users, or for whatever reason,
choose not to give their software dollars to Microsoft. The net of
this is we take a pragmatic view and look for meaningful ways we
can add value.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Reviewers have long praised Smart Suite's superior integration
with Notes, Lotus' popular groupware program, which allows several
users to collaborate on documents and other projects across a
network. The new release adds stronger support for Domino, which
extends Notes to the World Wide Web for e-mail and other functions.
It also adds tools that enable users to create Web sites without
programming, and it incorporates IBM's voice-recognition
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're using Notes or Domino, Smart Suite blows away
anything else,'' said John Head, technical director of Arton Inc.,
a consulting firm in Carol Stream, Ill., that creates custom
applications for large corporations using Smart Suite. He added
that there were still Smart Suite installations at Fortune 500
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Lotus counts International Paper, Abbott Laboratories and Mars
among major companies using Smart Suite. Analysts say many
companies still use 1-2-3 even if they have adopted Microsoft
Office for word processing and graphics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The types of people who are still using it have been working
with it so long, they've invested a lot of time and money in
building things with 1-2-3,'' said Roman Sochan, a consultant based
in Burlingame, Calif. ``Their biggest challenge is to work with
other customers and partners who are now using Excel.''
</P>
<P>
   Papows said he had no illusions about recapturing the market.
Indeed, Lotus works closely with Microsoft to make sure Smart Suite
can take full advantage of Windows 95, Windows 98 and Windows NT.
The Millennium edition is designed so that users can exchange
documents with Office 97 with no loss of formatting. ``No one here
wants to get in front of that freight train,'' he said.

   WASHINGTON _ Nearly one year after President Clinton disclosed a
list of ambitious goals to foster the commercial growth of the
Internet, critics say that the administration's contradictory
policies on data encryption and its slow progress on privacy
controls have left the nation's nascent electronic commerce
industry adrift on a rudderless ship.
</P>
<P>
   And critics contend that two major issues seem particularly in
disarray _ a policy for protecting consumer privacy online, and an
export policy on data-scrambling, or encryption, technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole area of e-commerce is going to come unglued unless
we solve the crypto policy, unless we resolve the privacy issue,''
said David Farber, a professor of computer science at the
University of Pennsylvania and a board member of the Electronic
Frontier Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Because electronic commerce _ buying and selling products and
services on line _ is widely considered the engine that promises to
drive commercial activity in the next decade, the stalemates on
those two key points have overshadowed an otherwise productive year
for the administration on information-technology issues.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's senior adviser on Internet issues, Ira Magaziner, in
an interview last week declared success in meeting most of the
one-year goals that he had set in drafting the president's
framework for a tax-free, self-regulated digital marketplace. Most
important, he said, the administration made considerable progress
on international accords to keep Internet commerce duty free.
</P>
<P>
   Magaziner also noted that pending legislation would put a
moratorium on domestic Internet taxes; that a framework had been
developed for making the issuing of Internet addresses a
self-governing and competitive system and that Congress was close
to putting into effect a treaty to protect digital copyrights in
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   In the private sector, companies and Internet consortiums have
developed a variety of filtering products and rating systems to
give parents options for controlling where their children can
venture on the Net. Those efforts have so far averted new attempts
at government controls over Internet content.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had asked me a year ago would we be as far as we are, I
would have been cautious about it,'' Magaziner said. ``I think we
have made tremendous progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, two weeks shy of the White House's own July 1 deadline for
initiating an effective code of conduct to protect consumer privacy
online, the administration is scrambling to address a report issued
last week by the Federal Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
   That report, the culmination of more than 10 months of hearings
and investigations, paints a dismal picture of the industry's
efforts to police itself on privacy issues. It proposes that
legislation be enacted to protect children online _ not just from
the usual suspects like pedophiles, but from predatory marketers
who gather information about children and their families with no
apparent regard for privacy rights.
</P>
<P>
   Industry groups generally praise the administration for staying
true to its vow to let the private sector lead. With a little more
time, they say, they will have the proper controls in place.
</P>
<P>
   But privacy advocates and academic observers say that the
administration has been inconsistent and passive. Worse, they say,
it has failed to provide the kind of leadership that would force
the private sector into the kinds of cross-industry agreements
needed to make self-regulation work.
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing everyone, including Magaziner, agrees on is
that the administration has made no progress in resolving its most
glaring policy contradiction: its continued support for government
regulation of encryption technology.
</P>
<P>
   Bowing to law-enforcement concerns about terrorists and drug
cartels using strong data-scrambling technology to conceal their
crimes, the administration has refused to let U.S. companies freely
export strong encryption. But the same kinds of computer security
that the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other police agencies
insist on controlling are exactly the kinds of security that must
be in place before credit card and other sensitive transactions can
be considered safe from hackers and online thieves.
</P>

<P>
   ``E-commerce cannot succeed without strong encryption to protect
people on the Internet,'' said Robert Holleyman, president of the
Business Software Alliance, an industry association whose members
include Microsoft Corp., Netscape Communications Corp., Novell, Sun
Microsystems and the nation's other top software developers.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of just how crucial encryption policy is to the
computer industry, Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates, and his top
rivals put aside their differences last week and traveled to
Washington for a closed-door meeting with Attorney General Janet
Reno and the FBI Director Louis Freeh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is fair to say this is one area where our policies are not
consistent with the rest of the approach, and the reasons are
because of the concerns of law enforcement,'' Magaziner said.
</P>
<P>
   As for privacy, Magaziner said it was too soon to call
self-regulation a failure.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the online business world agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have to understand that this is a fairly new
phenomenon,'' said Harris Miller, president of the Information
Technology Association of America, a trade group. ``The technology
is still being developed to give people the confidence that their
privacy is being protected.''
</P>
<P>
   What is more, says Henry H. Perritt Jr., dean of the
Chicago-Kent College of Law at the Illinois Institute of Technology
and president of the Center for Information Law and Policy, if
progress on self-regulation is slow, it is the administration that
is to blame.
</P>
<P>
   Lending a sense of urgency to that perception is the fact that
in October, strong privacy protections take effect in European
Union nations, and those measures could have a serious impact on
U.S. companies doing business overseas. Magaziner has been
globe-trotting for the last few weeks trying to dissuade other
nations from following the European model, assuring them that
self-regulation will work.
</P>
<P>
   An industry-administration summit meeting to help draft privacy
guidelines has been in the planning stages for months. Its final
dates, June 23 and 24, were set the day that the trade commission
issued its dismal findings about children's privacy online.

MEDIA TALK: SINATRA BOOKS RISE AND FALL; PBS DELEGATES IN FOR
SURPRISE; SISTER SOULJAH BEHIND THE MIKE; STOOGES GOING STRONG;
LEFTIES GO TO WALL STREET

<P>
   Between the time Frank Sinatra died on May 14 and the television
specials began, American publishers revved up the presses. In death
was the possibility of life, with out-of-print titles resuscitated,
existing books given extra sales and unpublished death-watch titles
finalized for quick release.
</P>
<P>
   When the news broke, a flurry of demand from retailers hit all
26 Sinatra titles listed at Ingram Book Co., the nation's largest
wholesaler. Booksellers say the biggest demand was for Shawn Levy's
``Rat Pack Confidential,'' published by Doubleday; ``The Way You
Wear Your Hat,'' by Bill Zehme, a Sinatra lifestyle tip sheet
published by HarperCollins; ``His Way,'' the Bantam paperback of
Kitty Kelley's unauthorized biography; Carol Publishing's
``Sinatra: Behind the Legend,'' by J. Randy Taraborrelli, and John
Lahr's ``Sinatra: The Artist and the Man,'' published by Random
House.
</P>
<P>
   Jody Kohn, a spokeswoman for Borders Inc., said: ``Whatever was
in the stores the weekend after he died sold very, very well.'' And
the books continued to move briskly for a week. But then came June.
</P>
<P>
   As Margaret Maupin, senior buyer for the Tattered Cover in
Denver, put it: ``The window of opportunity for this kind of book
is small. And when they stop selling, they drop like a rock.'' Two
weeks after the death, the book sales dropped, too.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, publishers could find themselves with thousands of
unsold Sinatra books returning to their warehouses. Some, like News
Corp.'s HarperCollins, are hoping that a Father's Day promotion
will move their books. But lady luck didn't entirely abandon the
pack. What's really swinging _ with no sign of slowing down _ is
Sinatra's music. Both Borders and Amazon.com say the music is not
only holding its own with established fans but also playing to new
generations.
</P>
<P>
   Just Talking: Public Broadcasting
</P>
<P>
   For a year, Rep. W.J. ``Billy'' Tauzin, R-La., has been
trumpeting his idea for how to keep money flowing to public
television and radio without draining the federal budget: a trust
fund, perhaps endowed by fees charged to commercial broadcasters.
But the proposal has attracted little support in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Tauzin, chairman of the House subcommittee on
telecommunications, will address delegates to PBS' annual meeting,
taking place this year in Miami. They expect to hear Tauzin
announce that he will introduce a bill proposing such a trust fund.
Indeed, last week's issue of Current, the journal covering public
broadcasting, said that Tauzin would announce just that.
</P>
<P>
   The delegates may be in for a surprise. Tauzin will indeed speak
to them live, by satellite from the PBS station in Baton Rouge. But
a staff member said that his bill would merely propose setting up
``a nine-member blue-ribbon commission to study the future of
public broadcasting'' and that it called for this panel to study
the trust fund idea, among others.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Tauzin's bill, which is co-sponsored by Rep.
Edward Markey, D-Mass., would only start the discussion about the
fund idea.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the bill tends to ``business as usual'' _
though with potentially a lot more money. Under current law, $250
million is budgeted for 1999 and $300 million for 2000. The bill
proposes reauthorizing federal money for public broadcasting
through the 2002 fiscal year at an amount equal to 40 percent of
the non-federal revenue raised by the system _ with a cap of $475
million. And it asks for a separate appropriation of $95 million a
year to help PBS convert to digital transmission.

<P>
   Dialing Sister Souljah
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sister Souljah, the musician, writer, political
activist and avowed ``outlaw,'' found herself as a guest host on
the noon talk show at WLIB-AM, the black-owned station in New York
City, in a week of particularly incendiary news. In New York, the
family of Yusuf Hawkins had received a letter of apology from Keith
Mondello, a member of a white gang who was recently released after
eight years in prison for his role in killing the black teen-ager
in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn in 1989. And in Texas, the
father of one of three white men arrested in the torture-slaying of
a black man apologized for his son's actions.
</P>
<P>
   How did Sister Souljah's week go? The incidents created a theme
that ran for several days: Is that all a black life is worth? An
apology?
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to be difficult for white society to do more than say
`sorry,''' Sister Souljah said. ``In the death of a black child or
person, the victim's family is expected to be eloquent.
Sympathetic. Because the value of that black child is less.''
</P>
<P>
   Listeners weighed in frequently and sometimes furiously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sick of forgiving,'' one woman said bluntly. ``Thank you
for speaking the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Another caller said: ``I'm very concerned with the Texas
incident. Black people should be prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   Listeners addressed and asked Sister Souljah to address other
issues as well.
</P>
<P>
   Of the Nigerian dictator who died suddenly, a caller suspected
foul play and a conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   What about the Bloods, the gang in Brooklyn? Were they on the
rise? another asked.
</P>
<P>
   What about rap music? ``It does perpetuate the chaos going on
today,'' Sister Souljah said. ``But it does not originate it.''
</P>
<P>
   How about the media's influence on young black women? ``Cute and
stupid are no accomplishment at all,'' the host said.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of her week, Sister Souljah was ready to accentuate
the positive. ``Let's see if we can make some type of a love
connection,'' she said. So the theme of the show was black love and
relationships. She said, ``We have to be as keen in our
observations of what's right as what's wrong.''

   A PBS Look at Press Behavior
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual agreement between a charitable trust and a news
program, ``The News Hour With Jim Lehrer'' on PBS has added Terence
Smith, the longtime CBS correspondent, to its staff to head a
special unit devoted to examining the performance of the news
media. The work will be financed by a two-year, $3 million grant
from Pew Charitable Trusts, an organization based in Philadelphia
devoted to supporting activities in culture, public education and
public policy.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who worked as a correspondent and editor for The New York
Times for 20 years before joining CBS in 1985, will leave his CBS
post and report on press-related issues regularly for ``The News
Hour,'' the weeknight news and analysis program. His work is
scheduled to begin appearing in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Rebecca Rimel, the president of Pew Charitable
Trusts, said: ``What is needed is a reasoned but impassioned
examination of press behavior on a regular basis. The `News Hour'
will provide that much-needed forum.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he expected to examine such subjects as the content
of the news, its packaging, issues of taste, the effect of money on
the news media, the trend toward tabloid treatment of the news,
consolidation in the industry and the debate over free broadcast
time for political candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Three Stooges Beer
</P>
<P>
   A company called Comedy III Entertainment is trying to bring
back the phenomenon of the Three Stooges with everything from a new
television release of the classic film shorts to items like Three
Stooges hair tonic and Three Stooges beer.
</P>
<P>
   Earl Benjamin, director of business affairs for Comedy III, said
Stooge business was surging again, as evidenced by a decision by
Columbia Studios to repackage the 190 short films made by the
Stooges from 1934 to 1959.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our licensing and merchandising business has quadrupled in the
past three years,'' Benjamin said. The images of the three classic
Stooges _ Moe, Larry and Curly _ now grace everything from
mousepads to screen savers to slot machines and lottery tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin expects business only to improve starting next year,
when Columbia begins syndicating the old films in a format designed
to fit the half-hour slots desired by television stations. ``Most
of the shorts are only 15 to 18 minutes long,'' Benjamin said. But
under an agreement between Columbia and Comedy III, new material,
like background stories about the making of the films, will be used
to fill out the time.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the shorts have been seen in bowdlerized form,
Benjamin said, with several sliced together illogically to make a
half-hour show. They have played most recently on the Family
Channel.
</P>
<P>
   Comedy III was formed by the Stooge actors Moe Howard, Larry
Fine and Joe DeRita. DeRita was brought in to fill the role created
by Moe's brother Curly, and was followed up by his other brother
Shemp. The Curly role was also played by Joe Besser in some of the
film shorts. All the actors who played the Stooges in their heyday
are dead, but Comedy III was reinstituted as the rightful licensing
agent for the Stooges' images in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   WBAI Makes a Home on Wall Street
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Listeners to WBAI-FM's morning show were encouraged
recently to call in with slogans to celebrate the left-oriented
radio station's first day in new offices in the citadel of
capitalism: Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard White and Amy Goodman, certainly the most patient
morning show hosts in New York City, at least that morning, were
treated to suggestions like ``Not just another brick in the wall!''
and ``Taking it to the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   WBAI is now housed with Ms. magazine and the Urban League in the
easternmost building on Wall Street, with a view of passing
schooners on the East River and the Brooklyn Promenade beyond.
</P>
<P>
   In the station's old site in the garment district, the
bookkeeper was once run over by a speeding clothing rack. There are
hazards of a different variety here, like creeping capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We miss the hustle of midtown, but maybe moving to the heart
of capital might help enhance our dreams to attain more capital,''
said Samori Marksman, WBAI's program director. ``Whether or not we
become capitalists is another issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The move comes at an interesting time: The union representing
workers at the station recently voted to prepare for a strike over
unresolved grievances.

slightest mystery about where the water went: For 85 years, gravity

sustain the artificially verdant sprawl of Los Angeles, and today
it still supplies just over half the water for the nation's second

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hey, did you hear the one about Mahatma Gandhi and
Aimee Semple McPherson? All right, maybe they aren't names that
crop up regularly in Letterman and Leno monologues. Maybe your
13-year-old niece doesn't have a clue who they are. Still, when
these long-dead spiritual leaders of India and the United States
meet in the Drama Dept.'s refreshing revival of ``As Thousands
Cheer,'' the Moss Hart and Irving Berlin revue from 1933, you
should have no trouble getting the joke.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say, can you do anything besides starve?'' asks McPherson,
described here as America's ``foursquare gospel lady'' and embodied
by a gimlet-eyed Mary Beth Peil. Gandhi, represented by B.D. Wong,
has been grinning his way through a hunger strike for
photographers, but he still has the energy to demonstrate a
two-step to ``Shuffle Off to Buffalo.'' McPherson joins in, and
it's suddenly clear that this could be the beginning of a beautiful
road show.
</P>
<P>
   When the original version of ``As Thousands Cheer'' opened at
the Music Box Theater for a run of 304 performances, critic Brooks
Atkinson of The New York Times interrupted his ode of praise to
observe that one shouldn't take its skewering of contemporary
headline makers too seriously, that Broadway likes ``to find
Broadway motives in every person it satirizes.''
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-five subsequent years, however, have demonstrated that
``Broadway motives'' and show-business spin have everything to do
with making the world go round. Religion as hard-sell
entertainment? Martyrdom as a photo op? Only the names, and the
technology used to promote them, have changed.
</P>
<P>
   Topical satire, especially the kind found in musical revues,
tends to age about as well as sushi. The surprise of this winningly
modest presentation of a vintage hit, which opened Sunday night at
the Greenwich House Theater under Christopher Ashley's direction,
is that it shows no sign at all of spoilage. The comic bite in
Hart's lines and in Berlin's lyrics still clicks crisply, and the
work's portrait of the pandering ways of celebrities and the
journalists who cover them remains spot-on. Yes, cynicism was
peppier in those days, but peppy cynicism is more fun on a stage
than the wearier, end-of-the-century variety.
</P>
<P>
   The two-year-old Drama Dept. has already established itself as a
vital force in the New York theater and, in its bold reworkings of
``Uncle Tom's Cabin'' and Tennessee Williams' ``Kingdom of Earth,''
an agile practitioner of the much-abused art of deconstruction.
With ``As Thousands Cheer,'' however, there has been no attempt to
look for subtext or to make hindsight part of the scenery.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Ashley and his eminently likable six-member ensemble
provide a limpid performance that lets the enduring merits of
Hart's sketches and Berlin's splendid songs sparkle without undue
interpretive interference. Each of the actors here sings and clowns
with skill, but without show-stopping aggression or descents into
camp. It's a smart, soft-pedaled approach, remarkable for letting
you feel that you have rediscovered Hart (sans Kaufman) and Berlin
on your own.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The original ``As Thousands Cheer,'' which did much to restore
Berlin's reputation as America's foremost popular songwriter, was a
much grander affair, with at least a dozen featured performers
(including Clifton Webb and Marilyn Miller) and a full dance
ensemble. This version is pared down to an intermissionless 17
sketches. It has jettisoned, among other things, the ``Easter
Parade'' number that was the show's big eye-popper and interpolated
(with considerable wit) ``Let's Have Another Cup of Coffee'' from
the earlier Hart-Berlin collaboration, ``Face the Music.''
</P>
<P>
   The production remains charmingly faithful, however, to the
work's central conceit of events springing to life from newspapers.
Allen Moyer's set makes ingenious use of silver-word-studded walls
that evoke the hot type once used to set hot copy. Kirk Bookman's
lighting, Jonathan Bixby and Gregory A. Gale's costumes and Wendall
K. Harrington's projections conspire expertly to summon a world of
smoke-filled newsrooms and black-and-white imagery.
</P>
<P>
   Hart and Berlin well understood that those who purveyed the news
were as essential to shaping the American sensibility as those who
made it, and that the lines between the two often blurred.
Accordingly, a Walter Winchell-like columnist (the appealing Howard
McGillin) slinks through shadows to sing of life framed ``Through
the Keyhole.'' A young woman (the dulcet-voice Judy Kuhn, in a
gossamer rendition) sends an abject musical prayer to a
lonely-hearts columnist. A prim weather reporter (Ms. Peil)
literally lets her hair down, as her hips sway, to report the
arrival of a tropical front, and ``Heat Wave,'' first performed by
the great Ethel Waters, finds new ways of working up a fever, with
a dancing chorus of newsmen and wily choreography by Kathleen
Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   The cast is rounded out by Wong, who is terrific doing an antic
confession of love for the funny pages; Kevin Chamberlin, the
evening's true natural comic, and Paula Newsome, who drolly
captures the cultural two-sidedness of Josephine Baker in the
wonderful ``Harlem on My Mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Other inflated public images that get punctured include those of
Barbara Hutton, Joan Crawford, the Herbert Hoovers and, most
deliciously, Noel Coward, whose languid, metaphor-strewn grandeur
is captured by the staff of a hotel on whom he has made quite an
impression.
</P>
<P>
   With David Evans (the show's musical director) on the piano and
Lou Bruno playing bass, the production numbers testify to the
astonishing (and often forgotten) scope of Berlin as a composer.
This is a man, after all, capable of both the blithe knowingness of
``Not for All the Rice in China'' and the haunting indirection of
``Supper Time,'' a ballad about a lynching.
</P>
<P>
   Not every sketch flies. And none of the actors (unlike, one
gathers, the original cast members) even try to impersonate their
famous subjects. This may be a mercy, and it's of a piece with
performances that never aspire to individual grandstanding. Like
all of the Drama Dept.'s productions, the first priority of this
one is to illuminate the original work that inspired it. For a show
about the American appetite for adulation, it is also remarkably
generous.

   SCOUT _ The Cincinnati Reds and some other small-market baseball
teams are looking for talent in an unusual place _ America's inner
cities. As more and more teams concentrate scoutingefforts in Latin
America and United States suburbs and college campuses,
underfinanced small market-teams hope to stay competitive by
discovering overlooked talent in the inner cities. We follow Jerry
Flowers, a recently hired scout for the Cincinnati Reds whose job
is to scout players in some of the toughest neighborhoods in inner
city Chicago and Detroit in hopes of finding the next Eric Davis,
Kenny Lofton or Darryl Strawberry. This story will give readers a
first-hand look at Flowers' unusual job and the challenges he and
baseball face in reviving the sport in the inner city. (Vinella,

   USCUP _ What is considered the best American team ever to reach
the World Cup takes the field in Paris today with the aim of
equalling a surprise second-round finish in 1994. But opening with
formidable Germany is the first of three highly charged group
matches _ including Iran and Yugoslavia _ that will make that task
very difficult. Just weeks after the U.S. Soccer Federation
outlined an ambitious $50 million developmental program to win the
World Cup by 2010, this American team already is reflecting some of
the changes envisioned for the future of soccer in the U.S. A good
showing in France will help continue the progress made in this
decade. (Parker, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   BAT-SCIENCE _ As a maternity ward and nursing station for
Mexican free-tail bats, the 16-inch-deep, 1-inch-wide expansion
slots of the Congress Avenue bridge couldn't be more perfect. The

momma bats fly nightly sorties across Central Texas to consume huge

 0615 &HT;    Wohlers talks about relief woes
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A day-and-a-half after Friday's horror, he sat at his
locker Sunday morning and pronounced himself, ''All right. I'm
surviving.'' Then Mark Wohlers opened up.
</P>
<P>
   ''As frustrating as it is, I'm fighting everything,'' he said.
''I'm fighting the situation, trying to get on track. The biggest
problem is I'm fighting myself. It'd be easy to throw in the towel,
but I'm not going to.''
</P>
<P>
   After temporarily losing his closer's job last Sunday, Wohlers
was encouraged Friday when Bobby Cox called on him in the ninth
inning with Atlanta leading 5-2. But after Wohlers promptly walked
Montreal's Chris Widger on four pitches (the second pitch hitting
the backstop), Cox pulled him in favor of Mike Cather. A hit
batter, a walk and a no-out, pinch-hit grand slam by DaRond Stovall
stunned the Braves 6-5 and left Wohlers dazed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was frustrated and upset,'' he said. ''It never happened to
me before. I'd never gone in there and faced one batter and come
out.''
</P>
<P>
   But then Wohlers, who's had periodic control problems in the
past, has rarely struggled like this. In eight appearances since
coming off the disabled list May 24, Wohlers has had just one 1-2-3
inning. He's allowed seven earned runs in his last 5-2/3 innings,
including four in the ninth inning May 28 when the Expos rallied to
win 9-5. Wohlers' wildness has been painful to watch. He's walked
nine in 6-2/3 innings. His ERA: 5.06.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he was ''grateful'' when Cox summoned him Friday. ''When
the phone rang, I felt good he had confidence in me, believed in me
in the ninth inning,'' Wohlers said. ''And I wish I could've taken
advantage of the situation. I felt good in the bullpen. I don't
know what it is. If I had the answer...It's just so frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly so because, ''When I struggled in the past, I'd
never had success in my career,'' Wohlers said. ''I didn't know
what I was missing. Now, after having a few successful years, it's
twice as bad. I know what I'm capable of doing and I want to do it
now.''
</P>
<P>
   What Wohlers knows he needs now is patience. ''Just slow stuff
down,'' he said. But he's pressing badly, overanalyzing everything.
''When I'm going good, my mind is completely blank,'' Wohlers said.
''When I see the (catcher's) sign, I go. Now, I'm worried about my
mechanics, worried about this and that. I've just gotta put a hose
in me now and flush it all out.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the fastball Friday that sailed to the backstop, ''It
happens,'' said Wohlers. ''When I was going good in '95, '96 and
'97, I threw some to the backstop. But I didn't freak out. I let it
happen. When I'm at my best, I bounce balls. Now, I overreact
instead.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Cox _ who used Dennis Martinez as the closer Saturday _
said, ''I'll just use him as I can. See how he's throwing on the
side, run him out there when I think he's ready. I just think it's
important to get some innings in now. What he needs is some
consistent innings.''
</P>
<P>
   Wohlers agrees. ''I want to pitch consistently and more often,''
he said. ''I think I've (only) got 25 innings this year and that
includes spring training.'' It's 24-2/3 innings, 9-2/3 in the
spring and 16 this season. ''I just want to get in there and pitch
and pitch and pitch and pitch. If it's the first inning, the fifth,
OK, and help this team. I know what I'm capable of doing. I just
want to pitch and get back on track.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've just got to keep working, keep fighting and not give up.
I'm going to try to do everything harder physically _ in the weight
room throwing on the side. Give it everything I've got and not
cheat myself or the organization. And I just have to not worry
about a whole bunch of stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   BACK TO BACK-TO-BACK BACK-TO-BACK: When Javy Lopez and Andruw
Jones homered back-to-back in back-to-back innings Saturday, it was
the fourth time in major-league history the feat had been
accomplished and the second in the NL.
</P>
<P>
   ''Really?'' asked Lopez, whose two two-run homers in the second
and third innings were immediately followed by Jones' solos. ''Most
impressive, (they were hit) in the same place.''
</P>
<P>
   The first two such big-league occurrences came in the AL: May
26, 1930 by the Washington Senators' Goose Goslin and Joe Judge,
then May 6, 1941 by Detroit's Hank Greenberg and Bruce Campbell. On
August 6, 1992, Fred McGriff was still a Padre when he and Gary
Sheffield homered back-to-back in back-to-back innings. Then came
Lopez-Jones.
</P>
<P>
   That was also the 19th time in major-league history the same two
players have homered back-to-back twice in a game; the 10th time in
NL history and the second time the Braves have done so. McGriff and
David Justice did it in the first and fifth innings off Bill Swift
in a 9-1 win over the Giants on August 25, 1993 in San Francisco.
That last time it happened anywhere: April 21, 1996, by Seattle's
Ken Griffey Jr. and Edgar Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   SMOLTZ UPDATE: John Smoltz worked his second outing of his
latest rehab assignment Sunday. Starting for the Braves' Class A
Macon affiliate, Smoltz went six innings against Capital City,
allowing seven hits and four earned runs. He struck out seven and
walked on. He left after throwing 82 pitches (59 strikes, 23 balls)
and trailing 4-3. Barring further elbow pain, Smoltz is set to
return to the rotation Friday in Montreal.

   MICROSOFT-MONOPOLY (Undated) _ The government's antitrust battle
against Microsoft Corp. has not tarnished the company's reputation

   Campbell Mithun Esty in Minneapolis, majority-owned by
Interpublic Group of Cos., has named James White as chief creative
officer. White, 39, succeeds David Tree, 57, who continues as vice
chairman and will take a more active role in business development.
</P>
<P>
   White comes to Campbell Mithun from Long Haymes Carr in
Winston-Salem, N.C., a unit of Interpublic, where he had been vice
chairman and chief creative officer since 1995, working on
campaigns for accounts like BellSouth Corp.; Hanes, sold by Sara
Lee Corp., and Winston, sold by the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. unit
of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. A successor to White has not been

   Georgia-Pacific Expands Its Roster
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific Corp. has expanded its agency roster by naming
the New York office of Fallon McElligott to handle an unspecified
branding assignment for its packaged products division. Billings
were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Fallon McElligott New York City, as the Minneapolis-based
agency's New York office is known, was selected after a two-month
review that also included the Merkley Newman Harty unit of Omnicom
Group and two agencies owned by Interpublic Group of Co.:
Carmichael Lynch in Minneapolis and Martin Agency in Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   Another Omnicom agency, the BBDO South unit of BBDO Worldwide in
Atlanta, will continue as the agency of record for the consumer
products sold by the division, which include Angel Soft toilet
paper and Coronet paper towels, as well as for corporate
advertising. BBDO South joined the Georgia-Pacific roster in March
when the previous agency for consumer paper products, Wells BDDP in
New York, announced plans to close.

 &HT;    Agent plays beat-the-clock with accused killer, retirementBy
Kathy Scruggs
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dorothy Leonard isn't sure of a lot of things after
her father's death shattered the fragile family just before the end
of World War II, scattering her brothers and sisters into
orphanages south of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in the back of her mind, she thinks there were six
children in her family, but she can only account for two brothers
and two sisters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somewhere along the line something happened _ something bad
happened,'' said the 63-year-old Florida woman. ``They say children
tend to block things out.''
</P>
<P>
   But her brother, Franklin Delano Floyd, wasn't so good at
blocking out the bad stuff. ``Franklin wasn't a survivor,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Orphaned about the time he started to walk, Floyd grew into an
explosive teenager and manipulative man who kidnapped children,
starting with a little girl from a Hapeville, Ga. bowling alley in
1962. Eleven years later, after serving a prison term for the first
abduction, FBI agents think he took another little girl from the
Atlanta area. He raised the delicate blond girl as his daughter
then married her and finally killed her in 1990, FBI Agent Joe
Fitzpatrick has said.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd is also believed to have killed at least two other people:
the woman's 6-year old son while in Atlanta in 1994 and a Florida
woman.
</P>
<P>
   The body of Michael Anthony Hughes has never been found, said
Fitzpatrick of the Oklahoma City FBI office.
</P>
<P>
   Although Floyd, 55, won't admit it to agents, his sister says he
has admitted he killed Michael. But Fitzpatrick says until they
find Michael's body, they can't make a case. He believes the
answers lie in the Atlanta area buried deep under Floyd's lies and
43 aliases.
</P>
<P>
   So the veteran agent is on a crusade to solve Michael's
disappearance and figure out who his mother was before he retires
in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really concerned that if we're going to do it, we need to
do it right away,'' Fitzpatrick said.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd has been in trouble with the law since he ran away from a
Hapeville orphanage when he was 15. By that time his sister,
Leonard, was married and living in Sumter, S.C. ``I imagine some
things happened (in the orphanage) that he couldn't deal with
emotionally,'' she said. ``He said he was sexually abused.''
</P>
<P>
   But he only stayed with Leonard for about 10 months. She was
forced to send Floyd away for good after he harmed her son. She
won't say what he did.
</P>
<P>
   Agents believe that Floyd kidnapped Michael's mother in 1973
between Feb. 2 and June 6, but they have no hard evidence such as a
missing person report. Floyd frequently moved and changed their
names, so investigators don't even know who she was. They do know
that she stayed with him until she was killed in a hit-and-run
accident in 1990. At that time she was going by the name Tonya Dawn
Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have absolutely no idea who she might be at all,''
Fitzpatrick said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, two years after taking her, Floyd enrolled the girl in
first grade in Oklahoma City. Nine years later he enrolled her at
Forest Park High School in Atlanta where she graduated with honors
and a scholarship to Georgia Tech in aeronautical engineering.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took her . . . not out of love, but just took her and
anytime she had a relationship, he just removed her from that
environment,'' Fitzpatrick said.
</P>
<P>
   Tonya had an affair with a man while she was working as a
waitress in an airport hotel bar in Phoenix, Ariz., and soon after
she became pregnant with Michael, Floyd moved the family to Tampa,
Fla. Michael was born in 1988 and the next year Floyd and Tonya
were married. Michael's biological father looked for Tonya, but
Floyd ``had pulled another one of his midnight departures,''
Fitzpatrick said. It was something Floyd did every time she got
close to another man.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had had her since she was 6 years old,'' Fitzpatrick said.
``What's she going to do?'' By April 1990, the pair were living In
Oklahoma City, where she had become a stripper. As she planned to
take Michael and leave Floyd, she was killed by a hit-and-run
driver, Fitzpatrick said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she was going back to Phoenix where she was happy,''
Fitzpatrick said. ``That was the only time in her life that she was
happy. She thought the world of that boy. If she had (run from
Floyd earlier), he would have killed her earlier.'
</P>
<P>
   Michael was taken into state custody, but in 1994, Floyd
kidnapped him from an Oklahoma elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   The next day he was in Atlanta, registered under a false name at
the Fulton Inn near Six Flags Over Georgia, west of Atlanta, where
he stayed a week.
</P>
<P>
   The kidnapping sparked a national manhunt for Floyd, and agents
trying to follow a road map of his life, immediately found it as
difficult as maneuvering a Mack truck around mountain switch-backs.
Many times Floyd led them around blind curves, and they've yet to
catch up.
</P>
<P>
   Since his Nov. 10, 1994, capture in Louisville, Ky., Floyd has
continued to dangle his secrets in front of agents. He is serving a
52-year sentence at Atlanta Federal Penitentiary for Michael's
kidnapping and is awaiting transfer to Florida on a charge of
murdering another woman, whose skeletal remains were found. Police
linked him to that murder when they found pictures of the woman
being tortured to death among Floyd's possessions. There were also
pictures of another brunette woman, whom authorities say may also
have been abducted from the Atlanta area, but they have not been
able to identify her.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Floyd has not officially confessed to killing
anyone. He claims the boy is safe and with a friend.
</P>
<P>
   After Michael's kidnapping, Fitzpatrick contacted the boy's
father and told him what happened. Both Michael's father and his
current wife told FBI agents they wanted Michael should he be found
alive. ``She said they had a good home and two other kids and they
would take him and love him,'' Fitzpatrick said.
</P>
<P>
   But that seems unlikely to occur.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael is dead,'' Leonard, Floyd's sister, insisted. ``It
took me so long to accept it. He shouldn't have told me. When he
did, he broke any ties.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard said that Floyd gave her grisly details of how he drown
Michael while molesting him in a bathtub in the Fulton Inn.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is telling me the truth,'' Leonard continued. ``I can't
tell you what a state it put me in. I don't know where the body is.
He told me there was a lake outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Agents searched all the lakes around the Fulton Inn, said
Atlanta FBI agent William M. Bray. By the time they learned Floyd
had stayed there, it was too late to gather evidence from the room,
he said.

 By ROBIN POGREBIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One thing is certain: Harold Evans at least looks
busy. He arrives at the Waldorf-Astoria's Peacock Alley for
breakfast in a blur of flyaway hair and distracted energy, his
briefcase bulging with that day's Daily News, which he has already
marked up with his scrawling critiques (this article is repetitive,
that one was underplayed). His manner is that of a charming,
absent-minded British professor, the type of important person who
needs to be introduced to someone he has already met several times
before.
</P>
<P>
   If people around town seem in the dark these days about just
what he is doing, Evans says, that is just the way he wants it.
``I'm the invisible man,'' he said. ``And if people say, `Harry's
doing nothing,' that's fine with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, Harry Evans lived in the public eye. As president
and publisher of Random House's trade group, he came to symbolize
the new era of glitz in publishing. His star-studded literary
breakfasts at Barneys department store, multimillion-dollar
writers' contracts and paparazzi-chronicled party attendance with
his wife, The New Yorker editor Tina Brown, made him the constant
subject of speculation: ``What's Harry up to now?''
</P>
<P>
   Now the question is more like ``Where is Harry anyway?''
</P>
<P>
   When he left Random House last fall and went to work for his
longtime friend, Mortimer Zuckerman, it seemed to many in the media
world that Evans had simply found a face-saving refuge in the nick
of time. His new job _ editorial director and vice chairman of The
Daily News of New York, U.S. News &AMP; World Report, The Atlantic
Monthly and Fast Company, a business magazine _ was widely assumed
to be a way to bow out before Random House, weary of his
high-spending, attention-getting ways, urged him out. His new job
was seen as a comfortable place for a media phenomenon who turns 70
later this month to live out the twilight of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Evans is clearly bitter about the way his departure from Random
House, which Bertelsmann AG is now buying from Advance
Publications, was often depicted in the press. Indeed, he went to
some lengths to challenge the conventional wisdom by threatening to
sue a British newspaper for articles portraying him as pushed out
of Random House. (The newspaper, The Spectator, ultimately
published an angry letter from him and Evans left it at that.) He
also says his low profile has been a deliberate attempt to feel out
a new situation and begin to define his place in it. ``Mort asked
me to take six months before I did a single thing,'' Evans said.
``To study the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The study period is just about over. But what he will do, or try
to do, is not clear. People working under him now generally agree
that he is not much of a visible presence at the publications. They
say that he flits in and out of The Daily News, the tabloid
newspaper; that he flies down to Washington to visit U.S. News, the
weekly news magazine, about once a week, and that he has
essentially ignored the other two publications: The Atlantic
Monthly, a literary magazine, and Fast Company, a business
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   As to how Zuckerman feels about Evans' contributions thus far,
Zuckerman will not say much. ``Harry is responsible for the
editorial supervision,'' he said. ``That's why I hired him. I don't
want to, in any sense, diminish his role by even talking about it.
He and I have conversations, and I basically just support what he's
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Evans has a vision and has the latitude as Zuckerman
maintains, he is in a position to make a significant impact, at
least at The Daily News and U.S. News. Although The News recently
won several editorial awards, including a Pulitzer Prize for the
columnist Mike McAlary, it has been struggling to stem a
circulation decline, particularly in its Sunday paper. And its
attempt to shift to color has proved something of a debacle as its
new presses barely work and full-color images appear only on
Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   In an age of fast information, U.S. News continues to try to
define its role as a newsweekly, particularly given that its
competitors, Time and Newsweek, have advantages of greater
resources and later closing deadlines. Moreover, just about every
publication now offers the service journalism _ ``News You Can
Use'' _ that had been a U.S. News franchise. (U.S. News has a
circulation of about 2.2 million; Newsweek, 3.2 million and Time,
4.2 million.)
</P>
<P>
   One thing Evans has clearly been studying is the field of
journalistic talent. He is in charge of hiring and firing at all
the publications and has made no secret of having met with about 70
people in the media industry, leaving the impression that perhaps
he is shopping certain positions around. ``I'm looking at
candidates for every single slot for the business,'' Evans said.
``I always want to know who is out there and who is good.''
</P>
<P>
   One editor who has been on the other end of Evans' fishing
expedition and insisted on not being identified described the
meeting as largely painless. ``It is not an interview in the
conventional sense,'' the editor said. ``It's a conversation in
which Harry comes across as a guy who's curious about what you
think about things.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans said some shifts could be expected. ``We'll have some
changes of people eventually,'' he said. ``We're discussing it.''
</P>
<P>
   About the fate of two of his top editors _ James Fallows, 48, at
U.S. News and Debby Krenek, 42, at The Daily News _ Evans is hardly
Shermanesque. ``I have no comment to make at this time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both editors have reason to be a little nervous. Churn has been
a fact of life in upper management under Zuckerman. At U.S. News,
Fallows' predecessors within 12 years included Marvin Stone, Shelby
Coffey III, David Gergen, Roger Rosenblatt and the husband-and-wife
team Michael Ruby and Merrill McLoughlin.
</P>
<P>
   Fallows sounds almost fatalistic about his situation. ``Like all
of my predecessors, I serve at the pleasure of the owner or the
owner's representatives,'' he said.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At The Daily News, Ms. Krenek is the fourth editor in less than
five years. She followed Pete Hamill, who left in September after
disagreements with Zuckerman. But Ms. Krenek said: ``I don't really
worry about it. I feel that Harry is very straightforward with me.
We do talk a lot, and I feel I know exactly where I stand.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite being vague about her fate, Evans described Ms. Krenek
as ``a pistol'' who has ``enlivened the news section,'' and he
characterized their current working relationship as a
collaboration. ``I didn't want to edit The Daily News,'' he said.
``I've edited every single type of publication as well as books. I
do not want to get back inside the minutiae.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans said he viewed The News as ``a serious newspaper in
tabloid format'' and predicted that its circulation would rise in
the fall. That is when he said he planned to beef up the business
coverage, give a new emphasis to the opinion section, reorganize
the sports pages and reorder the flow of the paper so that news
pages are not so often broken up by advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Tinkering has already occurred at U.S News. On June 5, the
magazine announced a new science section, and Fallows said last
week that the magazine would publish a redesigned ``News You Can
Use'' section that is more clearly departmentalized _ personal
finance, health, technology _ by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine also seems to be moving away from featuring
breaking news on its cover. Instead of the Arkansas school
shooting, for example, the magazine featured an enterprise article
on what life is like aboard a submarine; instead of the death of
Frank Sinatra, the magazine featured an article on why crime rates
are down.
</P>
<P>
   Evans does not seem to have much contact with the rank and file
at the publications he oversees, though reporters track his
movements carefully when he is in the newsroom, trying to glean
some significance from whom he stops to talk to. But several people
in the upper editorial echelons said that if they had to choose,
they would prefer Evans' courtly input to Zuckerman's abrasive
meddling. ``He's a journalist,'' one editor said. ``He knows how to
speak the language of journalists.''
</P>
<P>
   Fallows said he communicated with Evans every day, by phone or
e-mail, and discussed approaches to news coverage. Ms. Krenek also
said she talked to Evans at least once a day.
</P>
<P>
   Though Evans is perhaps best known in New York as a publishing
man about town, in many ways his current job is closer to what he
has done since he was 16: print journalism. He established a
reputation for tough investigations as editor of The Sunday Times
of London from 1967 to 1981. He resigned as editor of The Times of
London in 1982 after a dispute with Rupert Murdoch. He was the
founding editor of Conde Nast Traveler magazine in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has tremendous newspaper instincts _ the sense that
newspapers are out there to slay dragons,'' said Lars-Erik Nelson,
The Daily News' Washington columnist.
</P>
<P>
   Given what Evans has accomplished and the fact that he has two
young children and a new house in Bedford, N.Y. _ in addition to an
apartment on Sutton Place in Manhattan _ one might well wonder why
a man of his age would feel the need to take on anything new.
</P>
<P>
   But Evans said he had no intention of slowing down. He rises at
6 a.m. and swims for 40 minutes every day. He recently completed
his illustrated history of the United States, ``The American
Century,'' to be published in October by Knopf, a unit of Random
House. And he says he is having a wonderful time mucking around
back in newsprint.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how to spell the word retirement,'' Evans said,
his cuff link catching the light as he waved his arm dismissively.
``My attitude is, I keep running. And somewhere in the dark there's
a cliff. And I don't want to see it before I fall off.''

PATENTS: PERFECTING THE WRINKLE-FREE SHIRT; SLIDING ELEVATOR
DOORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SABRA CHARTRAND   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A cotton shirt is soft, comfortable and, very often, wrinkled _
especially right after it is pulled out of the dryer. The sleeves
and panels come out faintly lined, like a dry riverbed, but it is
the cuffs, collar and pockets that take _ and show _ the real
beating. A bit of time and effort with an iron and spray starch can
restore a smooth sheen, but nothing looks as neatly tailored as a
cotton shirt fresh from the dry cleaner.
</P>
<P>
   It costs more, too. Permanent-press polyester and then
wrinkle-free cottons were hailed as eliminating the need for
ironing or dry cleaning. But even when the best of those materials
went into a shirt, the seams would pucker. That is because thread
used to sew the shirt together shrinks at a rate different from the
fabric. So, fresh from the dryer, even wrinkle-free fabrics looked
rumpled around the edges.
</P>
<P>
   This makes a prototype shirt sewn with a patented seam
technology all the more remarkable. Half the shirt is made of
ordinary fabric and thread, the other half from wrinkle-free cotton
and treated seams. After washing in warm water and ordinary
detergent, the shirt comes out of a hot tumble-dry cycle looking as
if the right side had just been removed from the store packaging.
The collar and cuff are flat and flawless. There is a temptation to
throw it back in the wash just to make sure it's not an optical
illusion.
</P>
<P>
   The patented technology belongs to TAL Apparel Ltd., a Hong-Kong
based clothing maker that produces 30 million shirts a year for
companies like Calvin Klein, Eddie Bauer, the Gap, Banana Republic
and Burberry's. The inventor is the company's textile scientist,
John Wong.
</P>
<P>
   Wong perfected the wash-and-wear cotton shirt by embedding an
adhesive material into the seams to prevent threads from shrinking
or puckering. TAL's Washington patent lawyer, Bradford Kile, said
the adhesive was applied via a fusible tape about an inch wide. He
explained that the tape was laid between adjoining pieces of
fabric, and ``the thread is sewn through the outermost layer and
the fusible bonding strip and the layer beneath it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``After the stitch is made, the seam is placed under heat and
pressure, and the seam is fused together,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Kile said the adhesive tape adds only pennies to a shirt's cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have all my shirts laundered, and it costs a dollar a
shirt,'' Kile said. ``The starch tends to shrink the collar, and
that can be harsh and irritate the neck. The added cost to
manufacturing is saved after the first time you take the shirt to
the laundry.''
</P>
<P>
   The seam technology is designed to last for the life of the
shirt, Kile said, adding that TAL is ``using the technology
themselves and including it in all the seams that their clients
want.'' TAL makes shirts in Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia, Taiwan
and China. It has also licensed its patents to competitors like
Phillips-Van Heusen. Shoppers can already buy shirts with
maintenance-free seams, if they know what to look for.
</P>
<P>
   ``This just came out at the end of 1997, and it's going to have
a negative impact on the laundry industry, but I guess they'll
survive,'' Kile said. ``Brooks Brothers makes it in pink, blue,
yellow and white. But you have to ask for it, and they'll send it
to you in the mail.''
</P>
<P>
   Wong received patents 5,713,292; 5,590,615 and 5,568,779.
</P>
<P>
   New Way to Replace Elevator Doors
</P>
<P>
   The Americans with Disabilities Act stipulates that elevator
doors must open and close automatically. But many elevators in
older apartment buildings have swinging or telescoping doors or
gates that must be operated by hand. In New York City, high-rise
public housing buildings from the 1940s and 1950s still feature
their original swinging elevator doors. Past solutions for
replacing them included taking space from inside the elevator car,
or tearing out walls in the hallway to accommodate new equipment.
Making elevator cars smaller is inconvenient for all users, not
only the disabled, and removing walls during construction is
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Friedman says he has a better solution. Friedman owns
National Elevator Cab and Door Co. in New York City and has
patented a sliding elevator door assembly and installation process
that uses the space occupied by swinging door mechanisms. He came
up with the solution after ripping open a wall to replace a swing
door the traditional way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had an image of our company and my picture on the 10 o'clock
news because somebody fell down an elevator shaft,'' Friedman
explained. With his system, the old door assembly is replaced with
a frame for a sliding door. The frame is attached adjacent to the
car door, and a track and hanger system is added to the transom
area above the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``The door then slides into the frame like a pocket door,''
Friedman explained. The side and transom frames are covered with
the stationary panels. ``We can do it in one day.''
</P>
<P>
   The patented system has already been installed in older
buildings in New York City. Friedman received patent 5,673,770.
</P>
<P>
   Patents are available by number for $3 from the Patent and
Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.

`FISHING WITH JOHN': FISHERMAN'S STORIES WITH EXISTENTIAL SPIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
(lb) 
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fishing as performance art? For some of us that makes more sense
than the old fishing-as-a-metaphor-for-life routine. In ``Fishing
With John,'' John Lurie (leader of the eclectic jazz group the
Lounge Lizards) takes a few pals fishing and returns with one of
the quirkiest, most inventive television series you're likely to
run across.
</P>
<P>
   He and Jim Jarmusch drive out to Montauk, N.Y., to fish for
shark. He goes ice fishing in Maine with Willem Dafoe and asks the
existential question ``There's all water in my glove; am I going to
die now?'' He hooks up with Dennis Hopper in Thailand where, as the
hyperdramatic narrator intones, they go ``in search of the elusive
giant squid.''
</P>
<P>
   Each episode _ part cinema verite, part parody _ becomes an odd
little tale echoing the independent-film spirit that made these
fishermen famous.
</P>
<P>
   Lurie, who wrote and directed the six-part series is still best
known for his acting turn in Jarmusch's benchmark 1984 film,
``Stranger Than Paradise.'' The style of ``Fishing With John'' owes
even more to Jarmusch than to Marlin Perkins and ``Wild Kingdom.''
Lurie is not exactly an expert fisherman, and these are meandering,
low-key stories of the lost leading the lost, of men in city shoes
pretending to feel at home with nature.
</P>
<P>
   As they fish, they trade quick shaggy-dog stories that mock the
grandiosity of traditional fishing tales and nature shows. Jarmusch
tells of a woman whose cancer was discovered as a result of
dolphins nudging at her breast; Lurie tells a parable about a cow
and an ant. This series does not go for raucous laughs but for dry
wit, good music and satire of macho sportsmen in action.
</P>
<P>
   Though it makes sense for Jarmusch to be the series' first
guest, the first episode is not the strongest. The narrator (Robb
Webb) is more needlessly intrusive here than in other episodes,
though from the start he assumes the right tone. ``How deep is the
ocean?'' he wonders with deadpan melodrama. ``Nobody really knows
for sure.'' In this episode, the pace is too leisurely even for
fishing, not a high-speed activity to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   But the series comes together next week when the singer Tom
Waits goes ``Fishing With John'' in Jamaica. By then viewers are
more likely to have gotten in synch with the series' rhythm, but
the improvement comes mostly because Waits is so wonderfully
contrary.
</P>
<P>
   He gets queasy in rough waters. (``A game of cards on dry land
makes Tom feel much better,'' says the stentorian narrator.) He
accuses his host of never having caught a fish. Lurie doesn't care,
because he enjoys fishing and, as he observes, ``I can write it off
my taxes now.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the men catch a red snapper in calmer water, Waits ends
by saying: ``I don't know why I ever let you talk me into this.
It's the most absurd thing I've ever done in my life.'' And as they
glide along in a canoe, Waits sings of being on a ``River of Men,''
sounding one of the series' most pronounced parodic themes.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are real men doing real things,'' the narrator says in
the series' best episode (set for July 6), in which Lurie and Dafoe
try to survive subzero temperatures. The men build a shelter in the
middle of a frozen lake but prove to be dismal ice fishermen. Days
later they face malnutrition and delirium because their supply of
cheese crackers has run out and they haven't caught any fish to
eat. Gradually moving further into fictional territory, the episode
becomes a neat little surreal tale.
</P>
<P>
   There is no big-bang payoff at the end of these episodes; that
is part of what makes ``Fishing With John'' such an appealing
alternative to the high-volume, laugh-track world of network
television. It is also richly photographed by some first-rate
cinematographers (including Michael Spiller, who often works with
Hal Hartley). And, with music by Lurie throughout, the series
sounds better than any fish deserves.

`STUPID KIDS': CHURNING WORLD OF HIGH SCHOOL FANTASIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In ``Stupid Kids,'' a peppy little satire of high
school life, the playwright John C. Russell gets the opera of
adolescence to a T.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only sixth period, there's still time to do what's
right!'' says the hyperemotional cheerleader type who's dating the
high school hunk. ``Anything I say now,'' she exclaims in another
moment of wide-eyed melodrama, ``could be a lie in half an hour!''
</P>
<P>
   The stylized teenspeak of ``Stupid Kids,'' which opened on
Saturday night at the WPA Theater, suggests that Russell, who died
of AIDS in 1994, may have hidden a tape recorder under a desk in
study hall somewhere and then scoured the tapes for good
quotations. All four young actors in the piece, as a result, seem
like walking, talking yearbook pictures: Jim (James Carpinello), a
human caldron of testosterone; Judy (Shannon Burkett), his bulimic
steady; Kimberly (Mandy Siegfried), a professional misfit in nose
ring and black eye makeup, and Neechee (Keith Nobbs), the sensitive
author of execrable poetry who goes weak in the knees whenever Jim
walks by.
</P>
<P>
   They constitute the entire cast of ``Stupid Kids,'' and it is
the kids' insular, ceaselessly churning world, a pre-adult world of
Doritos and libidos, that the playwright seeks to lay bare. With
the help of Michael Mayer, the hot-hot stage director who currently
has two plays on Broadway _ ``A View From the Bridge'' and ``Side
Man'' at the Roundabout _ the work finds its purest expression in
the runaway fires of teen-age sexuality: in a clever fantasy scene,
Kimberly and Neechee get the erotic tumbles of their dreams with
the elusive objects of their affections. (At one point, the
athletic Carpinello actually juggles the smaller Nobbs.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, for all the care that has gone into this examination of
mere children with adult bodies and desires, there isn't much of a
story here, a fact Mayer seems well aware of. His breathless
production, on a set designed by David Gallo that gives the play
the appearance of taking place inside a television set, is flashier
than it is absorbing. The teen-agers recite their awful, heartfelt
poems one (or two or three) too many times, and go on endlessly
about their romantic crises, which could, in fact, be of addictive
interest to the ``Dawson's Creek'' set but may strike anyone else
as a long walk on the precious side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stupid Kids'' is concocted as a tale in which two smart gay
outcasts at a generically dull suburban high school _ here
christened Joe McCarthy High _ become best friends with two of
their more popular, physically beautiful peers, who in real life
would never have been seen at the same cafeteria table with them.
It's a geek fantasy of what high school might have been, had the
rigid social hierarchies not existed. Jim and Judy, the Ken and
Barbie of the story, float through life in a carnal, dimwitted
haze, oblivious to the flesh-craving anguish of Kimberly and
Neechee, who, the playwright assures us, will emerge the more
contented in the end, the end being after graduation.
</P>
<P>
   Mayer bounces his eager young actors around the stage like
cursors gone haywire on a computer screen: ``Stupid Kids'' is at
its best when bodies are in motion. The seams start to show only in
the moments of eye-rolling and mugging that the director encourages
to cover some of the script's thinner jokes. Among the actors,
Nobbs fares best; adept at expressing the turmoil of unrequited
love, he's the moony-eyed stand-in for anyone with a mortifying
childhood memory of going ga-ga for the one person guaranteed to
make you miserable.

KRAFTWERK: THE MAN IN THE MACHINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Germany)  (mk) 
 By BEN RATLIFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Perhaps there's nothing in the world so unfairly
typecast as the machine. There's a classic perception that we turn
to it in moments of paranoia, greed, envy, fear,
self-aggrandizement. It's second nature: Love is human, hatred is
enginelike; to become the perfect worker, to adopt a mind of gears
and switches, is futile and dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   The German electronic-music quartet Kraftwerk has devoted about
25 years to the theme of the machine, usually stressing the
man-made beauty within it. The group's concert at the Hammerstein
Ballroom on Saturday _ its first in New York City since 1981 _
amounted to an elegant, theatrical multimedia work. With gigantic
20th-century themes poking out from behind beautiful designs, it
provided an experience that was as much like reading a novel as
attending a concert.
</P>
<P>
   The four band members _ including two of the founders, Ralf
Hutter and Florian Schneider _ stood stock still, perfectly spaced
apart in a sort of ship's walkway, their synthesizers before them
and their computers behind them. They were mostly triggering
programmed music, but they collectively changed the hue of it as it
played; a couple of spots were improvised over steady beats.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in aerodynamic, close-fitting black suits, they looked
like the pit crew for a spaceship race. Initially they come off as
futurist technocrats. But there's a powerful subtext in Kraftwerk's
songs that explores the point where man connects with machine, and
not the other way around. The syntax of their songs, written like
road signs, with a vocabulary of internationally intelligible
words, is careful with this distinction: Hutter, through a headset
microphone, sang in his light monotone about the ``Man Machine,''
not the ``Machine Man.''
</P>
<P>
   With black-and-white clips from industrial films and
advertising, and song lyrics flashed in Constructivist lettering,
the show wasn't necessarily about ``newer is better''; rather, the
band's esthetic reviewed some of the greatest design impulses of
the 20th century, even if many of them were older than the 50-ish
band members themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The sold-out crowd _ racially, sexually, generationally mixed _
exploded even at the annunciatory beats of ``Numbers,'' ``Man
Machine'' and ``Trans-Europe Express.'' These rhythms were the
stirrings of several generations of youth, known not just through
Kraftwerk but through the early-80s hip-hop and New Wave records
that borrowed them, and the newer techno that has pervaded with
this motorized pulse.
</P>
<P>
   Everything else aside _ the animated Constructivist and de
Stijlist graphics, the subtle lighting, the rarity of the spectacle
_ the music, at sternum-rattling levels, sounded breathtaking. The
old songs were newly (digitally) programmed for the tour, with
Schneider continually altering the sound and weight of the
programmed beats, and there were two new pieces, melodically
narrow, unremarkable techno that nevertheless sounded gorgeous
through the well-mixed system.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The visuals, designed by the band, were a crucial part of the
concert; in retrospect, it's hard to understand the band without
them. ``Tour de France'' used old black-and-white clips of the
bicycle race, with fluorescent lights in the French tricolor
illuminating the stage. For ``Autobahn,'' old magazine
advertisements for Mercedes and Volkwagens were given lovingly
close panning shots. And in ``Trans-Europe Express'' (whose beat
was the basis for Afrika Bambaata's ``Planet Rock''), a color film
at least 30 years old showed the train _ an unprepossessing hulk,
nothing like the recent high-speed jobs _ heroically breaking
through landscapes like a mechanical ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   As an encore, the curtains opened to a stage empty of musicians;
on screen, we saw plastic-head representations of the band, stuck
on dull gray torsos with mechanical arms and metal-rod legs. ``We
are the robots,'' flashed the lyrics. ``We are programmed/just to
do/anything you want us to.'' The screens lifted, and there they
were: the robots. But, significantly, they didn't move in the
popping spurts that robots are famous for; they swiveled and moved
their arms slowly, thoughtfully, humanly, as if practicing tai chi.
</P>
<P>
   During the closing number, a new techno piece, you knew the band
members wouldn't wave to the crowd when they left the stage one by
one, just as you knew they wouldn't talk in between songs, or even
adjust a microphone. But they did smile, slightly.

   Gingrich, the speaker of the House, is joined in his opinion of

</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has ever stood in a movie line, stayed up half the
night watching an old film on television or argued a movie's merits
around the office water cooler has an opinion, often defended
passionately.
</P>
<P>
   So which are the best movies? To celebrate 100 years of American
cinema, the American Film Institute compiled a list of the top 400,
based on the recommendations of a 1,500-member panel, and then
turned to people like Heston and Clinton to vote on the 100 best on
secret ballots. It will present its findings on Tuesday night in a
three-hour television program on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Heston voted, but it is not known whether Clinton did. Vice
President Al Gore, who also got a ballot, did not vote, his staff
said. Heston was not pleased that Clinton and Gore even got
ballots. ``They don't know anything about movies,'' said Heston, a
former head of the film institute and new president of the National
Rifle Association. ``They will make safe choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Several people were asked by The New York Times to select the 10
best, a daunting task. Heston gamely submitted his list, as did the
actor Gregory Peck, who chose 10 without ranking them, and the film
critic Leonard Maltin, who listed them in order. Gingrich provided
a list of his 10 favorites, not necessarily the best, including
three not on the list of 400.
</P>
<P>
   Jodie Foster, the actor-director, declined to offer a list,
saying: ``I don't think I could do it. The films that influenced me
were French movies of the 1950s and '60s,'' including ``The 400
Blows,'' ``A Man and a Woman'' and ``Breathless.''
</P>
<P>
   Every movie that won the Academy Award as best picture is on the
list of nominees, except the Laurence Olivier version of
``Hamlet,'' which was made and financed by the British.
</P>
<P>
   The film institute restricted the list of nominees (the cutoff
date was 1996) to feature-length works of fiction in English ``with
significant creative and/or financial production elements from the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The financial provision allowed the inclusion of several movies
that many Americans won't recognize as American, like the 1939
``Goodbye, Mr. Chips,'' which Maltin describes in his annual Movie
and Video Guide as British. By the same token, money came before
art in the nomination of ``The Bridge on the River Kwai,'' which
was directed by David Lean and which Maltin lists as British.
</P>
<P>
   There are numerous commercial tie-ins to the institute's
project. Sponsors for the three-hour CBS program include the
Cadillac Division of General Motors. Its hosts will be Ms. Foster,
Richard Gere and Sally Field, and there will be interviews with
Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, Woody Allen, Clint Eastwood,
Dustin Hoffman, Candice Bergen, Richard Dreyfuss, Julia Roberts and
Heston.
</P>
<P>
   Starting next week, the TNT cable channel will present 10 weekly
one-hour specials, each devoted to 10 movies, grouped in categories
like family values and anti-heroes.
</P>
<P>
   In September, the Turner Classic Movies cable channel will hold
a weeklong film festival and show as many of the top 100 films as
it can get the rights to. Some will be readily available to Turner,
whose interests own most of the film libraries of MGM, Warner Bros.
and RKO. Warner Bros. is said to have 56 of the 100 selected films.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the 13 film studios and companies represented in the
project will rerelease videotape copies of the films in boxes with
commemorative stickers. This could produce a commercial windfall
for the studios, which have had little luck selling videos of some
of even the greatest classics. These will not be new prints of the
films but rather old movies in new boxes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Official Videos May Not Be Best
</P>
<P>
   The commercialization has its critics, like Jessica Rosner, who
rents copies of films to colleges and other institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a paid commercial for the studios,'' she said. ``It gives
them free publicity with the AFI's seal of approval. It has no
relation to great films but is a promotion by the studios and the
AFI to sell videos.''
</P>
<P>
   A film historian, who spoke on condition that he not be
identified, because he did not want to jeopardize his institution's
relations with the film institute and the studios, was also
dismissive of the project. The videos available from the top 100
list, he said, will not provide the best versions that are on the
market.
</P>
<P>
   If, as seems certain, D.W. Griffith's 1915 classic, ``The Birth
of a Nation,'' makes the top 100, he said, the print that will get
the film institute's sticker is the one sold by Republic, which
runs at the wrong speed and has missing footage. Another version,
which is sold by Keno International, runs at the proper speed and
is complete.
</P>
<P>
   And some of those who voted on the list had to overlook their
own interests in considering the best films. Peck, the first
chairman of the institute, who has six movies among the 400
nominees, had ``Casablanca'' on his top-10 list but took it off to
find a spot for ``Grand Hotel.'' He said he had to include
something with Greta Garbo, who memorably said ``I want to be
alone'' in a hotel where, it was said: ``People come, people go.
Nothing ever happens.''
</P>
<P>
   At first reluctant to put together a list, Peck compiled one
during a telephone interview, though he excluded from consideration
his own nominated films, which include ``Gentleman's Agreement''
and ``Twelve O'Clock High.'' Most of Peck's selections were from
the 1930s, but he included ``Raging Bull'' (1980) in homage to its
director, Martin Scorsese, whom he regards as outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   He wrestled with his selections, saying at one point: ``I didn't
include `Citizen Kane.' Oh, boy! But I don't want to give up `Mr.
Smith Goes to Washington.''' He removed ``The Big Parade'' and
added ``The Bridge on the River Kwai.'' He juggled two Chaplin
classics, dropping ``The Kid'' and substituting ``City Lights.'' He
also put Chaplin's ``Gold Rush'' on his best-10 list.
</P>
<P>
   Some hours after the interview, Peck telephoned back and
squeezed ``A Night at the Opera'' onto his list, saying, ``I've got
to have a Marx Brothers movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Heston, who recently completed filming his 75th movie,
``Gideon,'' also declined to select the 10 best, but later
weakened. Like Peck, he said, propriety dictated that he not select
any of his own; he, too had six movies among the 400 nominees,
including ``Ben-Hur,'' for which he won the Oscar as best actor of
1959, and ``The Ten Commandments,'' in which he played Moses.
</P>
<P>
   His selection of ``Citizen Kane'' as No. 1 is likely to be the
popular one _ Maltin also made it his No. 1 pick _ but omitting
``Casablanca'' from the top 10 may put Heston in the minority.
</P>
<P>
   ```Casablanca' has become a cult film, which perhaps makes it
more than it was,'' he said. ``I would not rank it with `The Grapes
of Wrath' or `Shane.'''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, an ally of Heston in conservative politics, made
``Casablanca'' his No. 8 selection.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a great romance,'' Gingrich said. ``It's totally camp,
but it's about a great moment in the history of the 20th century,
the triumph of good over evil. Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman!
Wouldn't every couple you know want to have spent that weekend in
Paris?''
</P>
<P>
   Most important, Gingrich said, ``I'm very big on good winning
over evil.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Foster, who has two movies _ ``The Silence of the Lambs''
and ``Taxi Driver'' _ among the 400, said the selectors ``tried to
be fair'' but included some movies that were not worthy. ``Great
filmmaking is not about special effects and pyrotechnics,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton may not have voted for the best movies, he is
known to be a film buff. In 1992, The Associated Press reported
that his favorites were ``High Noon'' and ``Casablanca.''
</P>
<P>
   Balancing Old and New
</P>
<P>
   Maltin picked both a Chaplin film (``Modern Times'') and one by
the Marx Brothers (``A Night at the Opera'') among his top 10.
Asked how he could account for the panel's not including another
Chaplin classic, ``The Great Dictator,'' among the 400 nominees,
even though Chaplin's ``Gold Rush'' and ``City Lights'' were on the
list, Maltin said he preferred to see the glass as three-quarters
full instead of one-quarter empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was heartened to find as many films of that period that I
did,'' he said. ``I thought they would pick pictures of recent
years. If you are talking about great important films, you could
put every Charlie Chaplin, every Buster Keaton, every John Ford,
every Preston Sturges, every Alfred Hitchcock film on the list and
be justified.''
</P>
<P>
   Maltin reflected on his selection of mostly older movies,
saying: ``People chide me for putting so many old films on my lists
of favorites. I admire a lot of films that I see today, but I don't
love them.''
</P>
<P>
   And he said of Clinton's choices: ``You can't go wrong when we
have a president who says his favorite films are `Casablanca' and
`High Noon.'''

`TOY WARS': PARADE OF THE PLASTIC SOLDIERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Publication notes at end of review.)  
(lb) 
 By GLENN COLLINS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Try to think of another global consumer-product giant blessed
with a leader as unconventional as Alan Hassenfeld, the chief
executive of Hasbro Inc. That's the company, based in Providence,
R.I., that makes GI Joe, Mr. Potato Head, Monopoly, Scrabble and
the Star Wars line, not to mention Trivial Pursuit, Candy Land and,
yes, Raggedy Ann.
</P>
<P>
   A tennis-addicted free spirit who harbored youthful dreams of
being a writer and world traveler, Hassenfeld unexpectedly took
over the family business from his older brother, Stephen, a
marketing whiz who transformed a hit-or-miss toy company into a
Wall Street high-flier before he died of AIDS in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   One of Hassenfeld's more improbable enthusiasms was to grant a
reporter virtually free rein in his company's corridors. It is a
happy decision that has benefited not only readers but also, in the
end, Hasbro itself.
</P>
<P>
   The result is ``Toy Wars,'' billed as ``The Epic Struggle
Between G.I. Joe, Barbie, and the Companies That Make Them.'' The
author, G. Wayne Miller, a staff writer at The Providence
Journal-Bulletin, set out to assemble a two-year, behind-the-scenes
portrait of that quintessential boy toy, GI Joe.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Miller found himself hanging about for five years,
and he was fortunate indeed in his timing. The book not only bears
witness to the company's desperate, and ultimately unsuccessful,
efforts to prop up grizzled old GI Joe but also presents other
milestones: Hasbro's purchase of powerhouses like Kenner, the
company's painful downsizing, the auto-da-fe of a $45 million
virtual-reality game and the fruition of deals with Steven
Spielberg and George Lucas.
</P>
<P>
   Currently Hasbro is the world's second-largest toymaker behind
its archrival Mattel Inc., of El Segundo, Calif., which offers _ in
addition to the Fisher-Price line, Hot Wheels and Tyco's Sing and
Snore Ernie _ its awesome Barbie brand, the world's most successful
toy.
</P>
<P>
   The book's denouement is a vivid chronicle of the hostile and
unsuccessful 1996 takeover bid by Mattel. Miller details Hasbro's
defensive campaign against John Amerman, Mattel's chief executive,
and Jill Barad, the queen of Barbie marketing who ultimately
ascended to the summit of Mattel.
</P>
<P>
   For all the surface sparkle, and despite the charm of its
venerable worldwide brands, toyland seems in this book to look more
like a salt mine: a fad-driven, hit-or-miss fashion business
propelled by the merciless necessity to fuel earnings with
continual innovation, as toy replaces toy in the rush to cash in
and move on.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps understandably, given Miller's access, the book's
portrait of Hassenfeld is sympathetic, if not adoring, save for the
executive's Hamlet-like dithering as he tinkers with the
organizational architecture of Hasbro. If Hassenfeld is hardly the
take-no-prisoners, drillmaster chief executive favored by
investors, he does display zest and courage and is described in the
book as being by turns ``warm, intelligent, temperamental and
sometimes endearingly goofy.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller seems squarely in the Hasbro camp in his description of
the battle for the toy market, a stance in part abetted by Mattel,
which _ perhaps fearing a Hasbro hagiography by a Rhode
Island-based reporter _ limited Miller's access to its executives.
In general, the book puts forth a chilling portrait of the
competitive corporate culture at Mattel, even as Miller highlights
the brilliance of Ms. Barad and the strong leadership of Amerman.
</P>
<P>
   Parents and critics of the industry have expressed anger at toy
companies for hawking gratuitous junk to innocent children, and
have railed against the hypermarketing of toys on television in
what appear to be show-length commercials.
</P>
<P>
   But the critics may be startled to learn, in ``Toy Wars,'' how
hard it is to turn a dollar selling toys to children. For while the
book's focus is on two successful business competitors, it is also
a Baedeker of failed toy lines, a saga of weary marketers whipsawed
by the fickle demands of juvenile customers demanding ever more
novelty.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Also affecting is a retelling of Hasbro's Black Tuesday, in
August 1995, when the company downsized 105 employees to save $7.5
million. It's a minor hiccup of a restructuring by the standards of
Albert J. Dunlap of Sunbeam Corp. but one that brought considerable
grief to Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   The great sadness of this book is that there is so much
agitation, angst and loathing inherent in the commerce of play.
Countless toy executives dance across the stage and then depart,
like the toy lines that jam retail shelves before they disappear.
</P>
<P>
   At its finest, ``Toy Wars'' is a primer on the toy business that
seems destined to enlighten the business-school marketing courses
of the future. But the book, skewed toward Hasbro and often
breathless in its prose, offers rather more undigested detail about
the toy business, and Rhode Island, than some general readers may
crave.
</P>
<P>
   The book's dramatic tension rides on the arc of Hasbro's
struggle for market share, rather than the urgency of a single
controlling event, like the battle in ``Barbarians at the Gate.''
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Miller has preserved for posterity many of the
toy wars' most risible moments, among them the spectacle of a sober
Dutch court as it takes measurements of the bust, waist, hips,
shoulders and legs of both Barbie and a Hasbro competitor, Sindy,
in an attempt to assess allegations of copyright infringement.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the preposterous (and failed) notion of hawking an
Elvis doll line with the head of the King fastened on GI Joe's
body. And preserved forever is the day when Hassenfeld appeared at
an internal meeting wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the slogan
``Barbie Is a Slut!''

 0615 &HT;    Braves pitcher a throwback to old days, ways
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It was a ''cabbage leaf day.'' It used to be that when
the weather got this miserably hot, oldtime ballplayers would ice
cabbage leaves and put them in their cap. It was hardly more than a
gesture, for in a few minutes the cabbage was sour kraut. But it
was that hot on a Sunday afternoon at the Turner ballyard, and the
kid pitching for the Atlanta Braves was straight out of the old
cabbage leaf school.
</P>
<P>
   So when they asked Kevin Millwood how he felt after the 7th
inning, he said, ''I feel fine. How do you feel?''
</P>
<P>
   He had just singled, run the bases and been thrown out sliding
home, trying to score on a wild pitch. ''I was a little winded, but
I had a little time to catch my breath . I didn't want to come out.
I was glad they had enough confidence in me to leave me in.''
</P>
<P>
   The scoreboard thermometer couldn't have been right. I read 86
degrees with 68 per cent humidity. I've been more comfortable
firing a boiler. Millwood looked a little like he'd been plowing,
but his break for home showed no sign of fatigue. It was a halfback
burst, and if you asked the man in the stands, he would have
overruled Joe West's call. Millwood hit the dirt with bullish
intent.
</P>
<P>
   He beat Montreal and won his 9th game. That tied Greg Maddux and
Tom Glavine. They, two multimillionaire Cy Young winners, had
started the first two games of the series against the Expos and the
worst hitting team in the league had scored 14 runs. Millwood was
such a puzzle they could muster only four hits, and in the meantime
he improved his batting average by 46 points. This was in reply to
the home run Carlos Perez struck off him in the third, briefly
establishing a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Perez _ that name may ring a bell. He's a Perez who could find
the ball park on Sunday. It was his brother, Pascual, then a Brave,
who couldn't, who circled the city so many times trying to find the
right exit he will be known forever as ''Perimeter.'' The numerous
Perezes total up to six, four others to go with Carlos and
''Perimeter.''.
</P>
<P>
   This one is a pretty good pitcher, led the league in shutouts
last season, but for two innings and a couple of ''dying quail''
triples by Ozzie Guillen and Tony Graffanino, they might be
pitching yet. His home run was Montreal's only run.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between the two is, while Millwood pitches to
stay in Atlanta, Perez pitches to get out of Montreal. The
Dominican pitcher is 27, and given another good season such as
this---he's 6-and-5---he can make an exit paved with gold as have
so many Expos before him. Larry Walker, Andres Gallaraga, Pedro
Martinez, Mike Lansing, John Wetteland, Randy Johnson, to name a
few. Not just players, but general managers and farm directors as
well. Have a good season and take flight, as if to beat the plague.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood, on the other hand, is only now beginning to feel like
a big leaguer. Strange as it seems, he never had a winning season
until last year, when he combined for 15-and-8 between Greenville,
Richmond and the home office. He's looking for a place to hang his
hat for a long time, not an exit. The Braves can afford him. The
Expos deal with a short treasury.
</P>
<P>
   It was ''Glove Day,'' but emphasis wasn't on defense. It was on
a tough pitcher, 23 years old, who was trained to finish what he
started.

 0615 &HT;    As series continues, ratings rise
 &HT;    By Prentis Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If Utah's win in Game 5 Friday night was somewhat
unexpected, there has been nothing surprising about the rising
viewership for the NBA Finals. Without counting Sunday's Game 6,
NBC is confident this rematch between the Jazz and Bulls will
finish atop the all-time list.
</P>
<P>
   ''We won't have the national rating for Game 5 until Monday,''
said NBC vice president Ed Markey, ''but the with an overnight
rating of 20.6, we figure Game 5 will be in the low 19.0s, which
puts the series on pace to be the highest-rated NBA Finals in
history.''
</P>
<P>
   The previous high of 17.9 came in 1993 when the Bulls played the
Suns. That one featured Michael Jordan against Charles Barkley.
Obviously, the bump in this Finals comes from the possibility that
this may not only be Michael Jordan's last year, but the end of the
Bulls' dynasty in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer boots the soaps
</P>
<P>
   You know ABC has a serious commitment to the World Cup when it's
willing to pre-empt popular afternoon soap operas like ''General
Hospital'' to show the U.S. play Germany today at 2:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   During the pregame show before the contest between Jamaica and
Croatia, ABC hypemaster Brent Musburger called the Americans'
opener against Germany, ''The biggest match the United States has
had in the last four years.''
</P>
<P>
   A not-so-startling revelation by Musburger, considering that's
how long it has been since the last World Cup in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Blowin' in the wind
</P>
<P>
   The gusting winds of 60 mph offered more resistance to Oscar de
la Hoya than Patrick Charpentier Saturday night at the Sun Bowl in
El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   To their credit, HBO announcers Jim Lampley, Larry Merchant and
Roy Jones Jr. didn't try to mask the lack of competition offered by
the French challenger.
</P>
<P>
   ''Charpentier is like a heavy bag. He lets Oscar do whatever he
wants to do,'' Jones said bluntly.
</P>
<P>
   HBO publicist Ray Stallone said the telecast was ''a bit
tricky'' because of the high winds. Needless to say, the coverage
included shots of the lights swaying in the wind, which caused the
technicians to drop it down closer to the ring. However, the lower
scaffolding did not have a noticeable impact on the coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Other notables
</P>
<P>
   During Friday's Braves-Expos telecast on TBS, the unflappable
Pete Van Wieren said of pinch hitting for ailing partner Skip Caray
on the pregame radio talk show, ''Now I know why he's cranky
sometimes.'' . . .
</P>
<P>
   The cameras of ESPN delievered a couple of terrific replays away
from the puck during Game 3 of the Red Wings and Capitals when it
captured Esa Tikkanen flattening Steve Yzerman at center ice and
Sergei Gonchar throwing a right-handed punch that would have been
impressive in the de la Hoya fight.
</P>
<P>
   After Sergei Federov scored the winning goal, underrated analyst
Bill Clement proclaimed, ''Federov has one thing in common with
Michael Jordan. Both do incredible things, and they both make it
look easy.''

 &HT;    Americans in Paris: Wins would be nice, but respect is real goal
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the last decade, they've made the giant leap from being a
Third World soccer nation and into the crowded ranks of World Cup
wannabes. But the Americans in Paris who will make their third
straight appearance on soccer's grandest stage against powerful
Germany today are seeking much more than a win, or a tie, and the
valuable points that can extend their visit to France.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S., with several heady results since playing host to the
1994 World Cup, has come to Europe demanding a certain amount of
respect since declaring itself the best American team ever put
together.
</P>
<P>
   In the last four years, both Argentina and Brazil have fallen to
the Americans _ the latter as recently as February _ and Mexico
suffered the indignity of a home tie during qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   But they will be judged primarily on their performance in the
World Cup, where Germany and Yugoslavia, two of Europe's best
teams, are favored in Group F.
</P>
<P>
   All week, U.S. coach Steve Sampson has taken potshots at German
coach Berti Vogts for an alleged lack of respect, although Vogts
hasn't said anything to that effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Publicly, they say all the right things,'' Sampson said on
Sunday. ``But I don't think the Germans respect the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   Brashness is not a German trademark. Detailed preparation has
yielded three World Cup championships and a spot in the finals
three straight times until a disappointing quarterfinal finish in
1994. Aging, injured and under duress with high expectations at
home, Germany has its own concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have taken steps forward (since 1994),`` German captain
Jurgen Klinsmann said of the Americans. ``We have no reason to
underestimate them.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike 1994, when wild card teams like the U.S. advanced in a
24-team field, the addition of eight new teams has changed the
format. Only the top two teams in each of the eight groups will
proceed to the Round of 16.
</P>
<P>
   The current U.S. team is sharply revamped from the
defensive-minded squad crafted by Bora Milutinovic in 1994, though
several key players _ especially emerging world-class goalkeeper
Kasey Keller _ will be working more to stop goals than score them.
</P>
<P>
   Sampson, Milutinovic's top assistant in 1994, will be the first
American-bred coach to lead a team into the World Cup, although he
was only the third choice as his successor. Since getting the job
three years ago, he has become the winningest coach in U.S.
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're playing a more sophisticated game now,'' Sampson
said. ``It was impossible to play that way in 1994. We expect to
get to the second round. That's our goal.''
</P>
<P>
   But his boss, outgoing U.S. Soccer Federation president Alan
Rothenberg, doubts the U.S. can make it out of group play. And
although Sampson's new 3-6-1 formation hasn't given up a goal in
four straight outings, neither has it produced a goal in two of the
last three warm-ups.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans have lost both times they played Germany, by 4-0
and 4-3 scores in the 1993 U.S. Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of insulting,'' said U.S. midfielder Claudio Reyna,
one of seven Americans with professional experience in Germany, in
response to Rothenberg. ``It's going to be tough for us to get out,
we know that. But everybody has to try to be positive.''
</P>
<P>
   No American is more positive than new captain Thomas Dooley,
until six years ago a German in every way. He took up citizenship
in 1993 as the son of a U.S. serviceman and is convinced the
Americans can exploit Germany's typically slow start in the World
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be another big step for us,'' said Dooley, who has no
mixed emotions about playing his former countrymen. ``We need to
have some more success at the World Cup. We have more experience,
we have a league that has made an impact and Americans are much
more knowledgeable about and support of soccer.''
</P>
<P>
   The creation of Major League Soccer in 1996 has produced a
number of young American stars. Eddie Pope, Brian Maisonneuve,
Brian McBride and Frankie Hejduk have come into their own, leaving
more familiar names like Alexi Lalas, Marcelo Balboa and Tab Ramos
to likely reserve duty.
</P>
<P>
   Sampson dumped disruptive captain John Harkes in April, and
without him, the U.S. beat Austria 3-0 in Vienna, its first win in
Europe since 1991. He'll have to find an answer for the lack of
goals, especially if forward Eric Wynalda, who leads the U.S. with
32 international scores, isn't fully ready following a knee
ligament strain in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried about the goals, because we have been creating
enough good chances,'' Sampson said. ``The goals will come. I
firmly believe we will be a surprise team in this World Cup.''

 0615 &HT;    Manager Cox ties wins record as Braves beat Expos 5-1
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Had he given an acceptance speech, Bobby Cox could've
thanked a lineup that looked like it was rolled out of a dice cup.
A tenacious, two-hour complete-game by Kevin Millwood, he of
beet-red face. Or a familiar, French-Canadian foil. But Cox didn't
even realize he'd managed another slice of history Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``See? I don't know,'' he said when told that Atlanta's 5-1 win
over Montreal was his 1,004th victory as the Braves' manager, tying
Cox with Frank Selee as the winningest manager in franchise
history. ``It's great to be in the lead in something. I'll take
that no matter what it is. I don't know that gentleman, though. I'd
just like to win enough games to win this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   He won his 1,004th not in his 13th season with the Braves. Cox's
record is 1,004-819 (a .551 percentage). As for Selee, ``What year
was that?'' Cox asked.
</P>
<P>
   That was 97 years ago. Selee managed the franchise for 12
seasons in Boston from 1890-1901, going 1,004-649 (.607). ``Well,''
Cox said, grinning, ``that's when they played 210-game schedules.''
</P>
<P>
   Had the Expos existed back then, those Braves likely would've
beaten them, too. Atlanta has taken 14 straight series from
Montreal since the start of the '95 season. This one came courtesy
of another strong outing by Millwood and some fortunate juggling by
Cox.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very, very strong individual,'' Cox said of Millwood,
who threw a four-hitter for his second complete game and ninth win,
matching teammates Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine for the NL lead.
``The ball's got to bounce your way to get wins. But Kevin's
pitched good enough to have nine wins.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I'd be 9-2,'' said Millwood, who gave up a
solo homer to Montreal starter Carlos Perez plus three singles,
struck out seven and lowered his ERA to 3.73. ``But I know I'm good
enough to be where I'm at right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet he also knows his place in this rotation. ``You see the
other four guys we have here,'' said Millwood. ``Even Dennis
(Martinez) has 243 wins. The other guys have Cy Youngs. I haven't
done half the things they have. But that doesn't mean I can't
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Or finish, even on a brutally hot day. Even after exerting
himself while singling in the seventh, taking third on Gerald
Williams' double, then trying to score when a pitch in the dirt
bounced away from Expos catcher Chris Widger. Millwood was thrown
out at the plate and was admittedly tired after the eighth. But Cox
let him come out for the ninth and he got the side in order.
</P>
<P>
   By then, help came from a lineup that included Williams leading
off and going 2-for-4 with an RBI, one run and two steals; Tony
Graffanino batting second and tripling in a run; Danny Bautista
starting in left and making a superb catch; and Ozzie Guillen
starting again at short, going 2-for-3 with a run and two RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys who haven't played that much always do good when they
get in,'' Cox said after a piece of managing even Frank Selee
would've enjoyed.

COMMENTARY: TAKING RISKS TO CREATE A SOCIAL VISION 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: note language in 10th graf; a quotation from the movie
contains a racial slur.) 
(mk) 
 By MARGO JEFFERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite all the reasons offered me, I just can't manage to feel
exploited or condescended to by ``Bulworth.''
</P>
<P>
   Is the senator, as written and played by Warren Beatty, just
another morally depleted white man who turns to African-Americans
for spiritual renewal? I have no problem with African-Americans
being seen as a source of spiritual renewal so long as there is a
trade-off based on a good deal more than patronization or
manipulation.
</P>
<P>
   Worse still, is J. Billington Bulworth (and by extension,
Beatty) a white Negro, who strides the meaner streets of black life
savoring its dangers for recreation? I think not. What is
intolerable about the true white Negro is that he plays _ just for
the thrill of it, just for the funk of it _ in the costume of race.
So intent is he on his own performance that he utterly ignores or
dismisses the actual Negroes in his path and ends up feeling that
when it comes to authenticity and hipness, he has just about
eclipsed them.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bulworth starts rapping _ even briefly dressing, and trying
to walk and gesture like a South-Central homeboy _ to deliver
no-holds-barred political views. Middle-class whites, blacks,
Asians and Latinos all over the world rap these days for all sorts
of reasons, including fun, profit and testosterone gratification.
</P>
<P>
   Bulworth's rapping has neither self-serving ambiguity nor
all-purpose piety. That puts it many cuts above the average
political speech. And he doesn't eclipse the blacks he meets. He
listens to their talk about their circumstances _ you can see him
taking it in with the shock of a man who has never had to think
there was something he didn't know _ and he does what politicians
are supposed to do. He takes those words to the larger world.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, this isn't a naturalistic movie. When Bulworth bursts
into rhyme, he is doing what people in musicals do: using some form
of song to say what can't be said in everyday speech.
</P>
<P>
   What we have here is partly an idealistic political fantasy,
Frank Capra style, and partly a nihilistic musical, rap style. And
if Beatty sounded like an authentically black rap virtuoso, he
would undercut the movie's point and its comic charm. He is
supposed to sound the way we all do when we come into contact with
things that shake us up: awkward, then ardent; ricocheting from the
embarrassing to the eloquent.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is filled with those little shivers of exotic-erotic
excitement that so often mark cross-racial and cross-class
encounters and so often distress people who feel them despite their
nobler intentions. It would be ridiculous to suppress these; the
less naturalistic a movie is, the more emotionally forthright it
has to be.
</P>
<P>
   Bulworth looks pretty silly in that after-hours South-Central
club, flailing around excitedly with the delicious young Nina
(played by Halle Berry), spinning records, happy to be taken for
Clint Eastwood and George Hamilton. But it's hardly surprising that
he might prefer it to his usual round of activities.
</P>
<P>
   And this goes both ways. The young black women who attach
themselves to him find riding around in a limo and providing rap
backup vocals at political fund-raisers a lot more interesting than
working at McDonald's. Blacks can have just as much fun with these
encounters as whites. ``You're my nigger,'' Nina tells him with a
smile, just the way black disk jockeys in the 1960s used to say,
``Here come our blue-eyed soul brothers'' whenever the Righteous
Brothers began to croon ``You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been said that most of the black characters in
``Bulworth'' are all-too-familiar caricatures. But are those two
loud, giggling South-Central girls, Shaneequa and her friend, any
more laughable than the senator's craven, hysterical campaign
lackeys? Is Don Cheadle's gang leader more broadly drawn than Paul
Sorvino's insurance lobbyist? Sometimes I think that caricatures of
middle-class people seem less broad than those of working-class
people because they remind us middle-class audiences of people we
know. Besides, ``Bulworth'' is a farce and a romance. This means
that all of the surrounding characters are types to some degree,
while the pair at the center begin as types and struggle to become
fully human.
</P>
<P>
   It was accidental but instructive to read Lani Guinier's book
``Lift Every Voice: Turning a Civil Rights Setback Into a New
Vision of Social Justice'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster) the same week that I
saw ``Bulworth.'' It, too, is a nasty but real-life political farce
that made just a few of the people involved more human in the end.
</P>
<P>
   The book begins with Ms. Guinier's account of how President
Clinton nominated her as assistant attorney general for civil
rights, then left her to twist slowly in the wind (say nothing to
the media, his people ordered her) as conservative opponents
unleashed a successful campaign to discredit her views. Whereupon
the president withdrew the nomination, declaring that while he had
been unacquainted with those views, he now found them unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Double-talk abounded. Political lackeys and emissaries scurried
through halls delivering coded messages. And real life delivered
some moments of pure farce that the best fiction can't top. (My
particular favorite comes when, having withdrawn Ms. Guinier's
nomination without ever, she says, telling her which views he
disagreed with, Clinton makes this impassioned declaration to
reporters: ``I love her. I think she's wonderful. If she came to me
and asked for $5,000, I'd go down to the bank and give it to her,
no questions asked.'')
</P>
<P>
   And if you think rap a low form of speech try some of the labels
given Ms. Guinier by right-wing media pundits and critics: Bill
Clinton's ``Quota Queen,'' ``Looney Lani,'' ``The Czarina of
Czeparatism.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Guinier spends the last two parts of her book re-examining
the civil rights movement. She looks at some crucial cases from the
1980s, when she worked with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund in the
South to make sure that the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was still
being enforced.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And she recalls crucial encounters with plain-spoken people she
was defending, the local and little-heard citizens whom civil
rights lawyers (like politicians) had to learn to speak with, not
just for.
</P>
<P>
   She also makes some proposals for how we might have some
national conversations on race that are more than touring
melodramas: People might talk until some kind of trust developed
and then be willing to go on talking. People might talk not only
about race but also about how race can be a lens on other issues,
questions and struggles. People might hope and plan not only to
bond and make friends but also to think about public problems and
about making changes.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing could be more different in tone than these two works:
``Bulworth,'' all wild farce, and ``Lift Every Voice,'' all sturdy
thoughtfulness. But Ms. Guinier survived a farce and Beatty put
plenty of thought into his entertainment. They have both taken
risks (Ms. Guinier's political, Beatty's cultural) to give us
something that can genuinely be called a social vision. And a
vision isn't supposed to be a fixed, perfect thing. A vision is
supposed to be a passionate, intelligent work in progress, whether
a film, a book or a life.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The storm system that produced over 10 inches of rain at a few
spots in New England this past weekend will gradually weaken over
southern Ontario. In its wake, New York and New England will have
limited sunshine as moist air remains in place near the ground.
During the afternoon, scattered showers will develop, especially
over the hilly terrain. Temperatures will remain below seasonal
levels, especially near the Atlantic coast where onshore winds will
persist.
</P>
<P>
   Potent thunderstorms with locally strong winds, heavy downpours
and isolated tornadoes will erupt in the warm, humid air from
southern Ohio to the Middle Atlantic Coast Monday afternoon.
Farther north, less intense showers and thunderstorms will develop
north of a warm front over the interior Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Southeast will be hot and humid. There will be
little chance for rain near the coast from South Carolina to the
Gulf of Mexico. A broken band of strong thunderstorms will form
during the afternoon from the southern Appalachians to the lower
Mississippi Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Locally strong thunderstorms will also develop under a jet
stream disturbance as it moves from eastern Nebraska toward the
Mississippi Valley. Weak high-level winds will result in some
slow-moving downpours that may produce local flooding. Farther
south, much of Texas will stay very hot, but cooler air will
prevail elsewhere in the southern Plains.
</P>
<P>
   A strong cold front will sweep into the Northwestern states with
a few showers and gusty winds from the north. Meanwhile, heat will
increase over the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Extreme Rain
</P>
<P>
   The rainfall records had to be rewritten in parts of eastern New
England on Saturday and early Sunday as torrential rain from a
slow-moving storm lashed the region. Saturday was the wettest June
day in Boston since regular readings began in 1872 as 5.69 inches
fell into the official rain gauge. Nearly 8 inches of rain were
recorded in some suburbs of Boston. Saturday's heavy rain is part
of a long-term nationwide trend. The percentage of the area of the
United States affected each year by extreme daily rainfall has been
increasing throughout this century; however, the reason for the
trend is a mystery. &QL;

 0615 &HT;    Nike wants consumers to wear products with eased conscious
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Just received a very slick packet from Nike.
Everything Nike does is slick. When CEO Phil Knight trims his
toenails, it is done with a high liklihood of slicknesss.
</P>
<P>
   It contained the latest effort by the Godzilla of the sports
apparal business to be seen as a nurturing employer. I felt it
aimed directly at me, since I often have been poked by guilt
whenever spending $80 for a pair of shoes, knowing that only
pennies were getting back to the workbench in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   This company has been irksome for a long time. A person could
readily accept the impression that it runs dingy little overseas
sweatshops and employs pre-schoolers for whatever change they might
find on the floor. Not because of any first-hand knowledge,
certainly. It's just that if Nike can buy Tiger Woods' soul, if it
can advertise during the Atlanta Olympics that the silver medal is
pointless, if it can back-door its way into college sports, then
surely it is capable of anything.
</P>
<P>
   On principle, I pooh-pooh Nike.
</P>
<P>
   Confession time. I still buy it, though.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, who can help purchasing the stuff? Especially the
father of an 11-year-old son who has been so thoroughly brainwashed
by the brand's saturation marketing and stable of superstars? If
the boy had his way, he'd be one big swoosh, with just his eyes
showing.
</P>
<P>
   The typical American kid would eat Brussels sprouts if Nike grew
them. Would gladly do all homework if Nike assigned it. Would
cheerfully floss were it possible to fit a swoosh on the string.
The power is frightening.
</P>
<P>
   You can learn more geography by reading the labels in the junior
department than by scanning a World Atlas. I don't know that Nike
is any more exploitative than the other companies -- it's just that
I'd like to think so.
</P>
<P>
   So, along comes this packet.
</P>
<P>
   It says that Nike is going to up the minimum age of workers in
its shoe factories to 18. For all other clothing manufacturing, 16.
</P>
<P>
   It says that minimum wage workers in the 12 Indonesian shoe
factories could be expecting a raise. Never said how much. Still
have the feeling the numbers would make what they charge for ugly
golf shoes seem all the more far-fetched.
</P>
<P>
   It says that workers will be offered free middle and high school
equivalency courses.
</P>
<P>
   It says that the workplace will be upgraded by, for example,
introducing non-toxic shoe glues. The air quality in all factories
will be brought up to OSHA standards.
</P>
<P>
   Nike is just too slick to make itself an easy target. It was not
going to give up on those few humanitarians who might need a pair
of running shorts.
</P>
<P>
   How can we know exactly what to make of Nike's response? Here is
a company built almost completely on image. It began, legand says,
out of the trunk of Knight's 1963 Plymouth Valiant and grew to be
the most omnipresent industry in sports. It is as much an attitude
as it is a product. Where the substance to any of it?
</P>
<P>
   We might be a lot more willing to accept Nike at its word if
only it wasn't so overbearing, if it didn't desire to set the style
for the games as well as for what the people wear to them.
</P>
<P>
   At least there's an effort. The slick packet says so. Someday,
perhaps, I'll be able to buy a stinking pair of basketball shoes
and feel completely good about it.

SPORTS COLUMN: AMERICANS IN PARIS HEAR THE ROAR OF NATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ They did not need the Eiffel Tower to tell them they
were in Paris. The loud noise outside their window was no longer
chickens and geese but rather cheering fans and bustling reporters.
The U.S. soccer players took that as a positive sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt we were back in civilization again,'' said Mike Burns,
the U.S. defender.
</P>
<P>
   When they arrived on the high-speed train from Lyons on
Saturday, they knew the significance of the quaint six-story
buildings and the taxis and the cafes: time for the World Cup, time
for them to take their four-year test, time to see if the level of
U.S. soccer has advanced in skill, or stood still, or perhaps even
dropped back, which is quite possible.
</P>
<P>
   They are in the last of the eight groups to play their first
game. Naturally, they were itchy out there in the vineyards, where
you could hear the Beaujolais growing in the adjacent fields.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night it will be noisier. Monday night they play Germany
in the Parc des Princes, the traditional stadium at the edge of the
Bois de Boulogne. Later they play Iran in Lyons and Yugoslavia in
Nantes.
</P>
<P>
   All the trials of the past four years are over now. They have
seen old age and injuries and bad karma take away their friends and
teammates. John Harkes, who had expected to be captain here, is
back home playing for D.C. United, lopped off the team by the
coach, with no warning. It is a cold world, and the players know
how fortunate they are to be here.
</P>
<P>
   These soccer players are different from other U.S. athletes.
They look outside their own borders for the ultimate prize, the
true recognition. The World Cup is the world's most important
sporting event, and these 22 players are grateful to be here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw the Belgian fans and the Dutch fans with their faces
painted, and it felt like the World Cup had arrived,'' Burns said.
</P>
<P>
   Their dreams and their justifications come in foreign languages
and on foreign soil. This is where they want to be, preparing to
stop one of the world's great soccer teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be greeted by hundreds of fans, waving flags, was a great
thrill,'' said Steve Sampson, the coach. ``Then the driver took us
the long way to the hotel, to show us the Arc de Triomphe, the
Eiffel Tower, the Champs-Elysee.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the players went for a walk outside their hotel, right
off the Champs-Elysee. Burns deliberately did not wear his U.S.
blazer, to avoid being identified, but he felt the energy of this
city, more beautiful than ever, with its banks of flowers lining
the grand boulevard, its glittering cafes, its stylish men and
women. The Yanks know they are at the center of the universe right
now.
</P>
<P>
   Sampson has tried to control them with all the psychological and
management tools that U.S. gym-teacher coaches tend to use. He has
goaded his players with statements that Germany does not respect
them, the way any U.S. basketball coach would do before playing
Kentucky or North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The players have been around. They are not innocents anymore.
Most of them have worked _ not played _ over here. Why should
Germany respect them as equals? Right now the United States has to
prove that its golden age is not fading away.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Soccer Federation's best move in recent months was to
move heaven and earth _ to say nothing of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service _ to endow citizenship on a Frenchman, David
Regis.
</P>
<P>
   There could not be a more clear sign that the U.S. pipeline is
down to a trickle. On the other hand, Regis is a terrific player,
by U.S. standards.
</P>
<P>
   So they are in Paris now, waiting for Klinsmann and Bierhoff to
come roaring down at them. Sampson said that he hoped the French
fans would root for the underdog, that is to say, his lads. Then he
was asked if facing the Germans in the first game was the stuff of
nightmares, and he responded by talking about his experience before
a big qualifying game in Mexico last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do a lot of visualizing,'' Sampson said. ``Before that game
in Mexico, I imagined us holding the ball, moving it back and
forth, and the Mexican fans were chanting, `Ole! Ole!' It's the
same thing here. It's so important that we hold the ball against
Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   In that case, Sampson was asked, what does he imagine the French
fans chanting tonight in the Parc des Princes? ``I don't know the
language,'' said Sampson, who is quite good in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   They all see the crowds in the streets, the painted faces, the
hopes and dreams of nations. They have left the countryside. The
four years are over.
</P>
<P>
   They are in the big city now.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is hard for most people, even those who know him,
to comprehend the magnitude of Halsey Minor's ambition.
</P>
<P>
   But Thomas Rogers, the president of NBC's cable and Internet
division, got to witness Minor in the full flush of confidence last
Wednesday at Le Cirque 2000 in Manhattan _ a victory lunch to
celebrate NBC's acquisition of a controlling stake in Snap, the
Internet directory and guide service created by Minor's company,
Cnet.
</P>
<P>
   After Rogers asked Minor to write his prediction for Cnet's
stock price a year from now on a slip of paper, a half-dozen NBC
executives around the table jotted down their own guesses of what
he had written. Knowing the 33-year-old Cnet founder's lofty regard
for his new-media vision, each picked a figure far above the $48
that Cnet shares were trading at that day _ a number that was
already a 45 percent jump from Monday, the day before the NBC deal
was announced.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, when Minor unfolded his paper, it had a figure much
higher than anyone had dared guess. (The price? No one would
comment for publication, but more on that later.)
</P>
<P>
   Rogers was surprised by the apparent hubris, he recalled later,
for even the most ambitious executives at General Electric, NBC's
parent, cloak their aspirations behind at least some false modesty.
And in Silicon Valley, near Cnet's headquarters in San Francisco,
executives typically sit in torn jeans and talk about how their
technology is improving society. (It is only on the sly that they
peek at the up-to-the-minute value of their stock options.)
</P>
<P>
   But Halsey Minor has always made his aspirations clear: He's not
out to save the world; he's going to conquer it. With a preppy
appearance masking a pit bull intensity, Minor is not embarrassed
to proclaim his intention to become the first media mogul of the
Internet, the Ted Turner or Rupert Murdoch of his generation.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on one's viewpoint, Minor is either a charismatic and
passionate visionary or an abrasive, egotistic upstart. Whatever
the angle, NBC decided to endorse Minor's strategic direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the sign of a guy with a true vision, someone who
doesn't mess around and mince words,'' Rogers said. ``He is very
creative, but he's also a businessman with two feet on the
ground.''
</P>
<P>
   In last week's $63 million deal, NBC agreed to acquire up to 60
percent of Snap's technically elegant but money-losing service and
to promote it on the air to the 73 million people who watch its
programs each week.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's seal of approval does not guarantee Minor's success, of
course. But the deal, and other recent evidence that his ideas may
be catching on, does at least validate a new-media approach that
until now has flouted conventional wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   His first Internet services, a series of Web sites about
computers that started in mid-1995, gambled that money could be
made producing new information for the Internet. Minor has expanded
Cnet's original programming even as the approach has fallen out of
fashion because it is expensive. Most of the successful content
sites, like CNN.com and Time Inc.'s Pathfinder, so far largely
reprint information created for other media or showcase content
created by users, as in chat rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in an even more controversial move, Minor diverted 150
people at a cost of $25 million to develop Snap, which was
introduced last fall, three years after the introduction of Yahoo,
Excite and other competing Web guide sites. So far, its ratings
have been minuscule.
</P>
<P>
   But Minor was proved right that Internet guide services would be
popular with users and more so with advertisers looking to find
people interested in their wares. And he predicted that big media
companies would decide that these sites, now known as portals,
would be the centerpieces of their Internet strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, before he reached the deal with NBC, which thinks its
prime-time promotion can make Snap a top-rated portal, Minor was
close to selling an interest in Snap, according to people close to
the negotiations. One interested buyer late last year was Rupert
Murdoch's News Corp. Early this year, he was also close to a deal
with New Century Network, a consortium of newspapers that is now
defunct.
</P>
<P>
   Things are also looking brighter for the computer Web sites as
well. With far less information than its archrival, the computer
publishing colossus Ziff-Davis Cnet's bright, easy-to-use sites
have remained the ratings leaders in their category. Its News.com
service has become Silicon Valley's leading source of
up-to-the-minute information about the technology business. And
because people who read about computers tend to buy them,
advertisers have been drawn to Cnet's sites, too.
</P>
<P>
   Ziff-Davis, fresh from a public stock offering, is trying hard
to overtake Cnet online. And it is beginning a 24-hour television
network about computers, which would compete with Cnet's five
weekly television shows that appear on some broadcast and cable
outlets. Still, with the financial drag of Snap lifted, analysts
expect Cnet to become profitable this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised at just how much we were hurt because the
market didn't see us as having a chance of surviving,'' Minor said
last week. ``But I believe in the end our strategy has been
vindicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors simply have not understood Minor's long-term
prospects, said Brian Oakes, an analyst with Lehman Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is very short-term oriented,'' he said. ``Building
media brands takes years.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Minor and a newly hired team of experienced media
executives will try to give Wall Street the profits it is
demanding. Earlier this year, budgets and sales goals were imposed
on Cnet's young staff for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately, Minor says, the history of the most successful
media tycoons is filled with bet-the-ranch deals and Hail Mary
passes, not by fastidious attention to quarterly earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ted Turner never made money, yet he sold his company for $15
billion,'' Minor said, somewhat oversimplifying the facts. (Turner
Broadcasting was marginally profitable before Time Warner bought it
for stock worth $7.5 billion when the deal was announced in 1995.)

 0615 &HT;    Georgia leader says submission call comes from Scripture
 &HT;    By Jennifer Brett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Controversy provoked by the Southern Baptist
Convention's call for women to ``graciously submit'' to their
husbands was unexpected and unfounded, the leader of the Georgia
chapter told his Lawrenceville, Ga. congregation Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But any man who thinks the convention's action ``gave him the
right to be a dictator in the home does not understand the word of
God,'' said the Rev. Frank Cox, president of the Georgia Baptist
Convention and pastor at North Metro First Baptist Church in
Lawrenceville. He attended the Salt Lake City convention where
members last week adopted the statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why they've chose to jump on `graciously submit' for the
women, I have not the foggiest idea,'' Cox said of detractors.
``There's a whole lot more to this amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   Reading from the statement, he said, ``A husband and wife are of
equal worth before God. A husband is to love his wife as Christ
loved the church.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox said that although the statement has prompted criticism, it
is based on Scripture and is therefore nothing new.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have said is we as Christians have a responsibility to
live according to the word of God,'' Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   The books of Ephesians and Colossians both mention submission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands,'' is the
beginning of both the 22nd verse of Ephesians's fifth chapter and
the 18th verse of Colossians' third chapter, according to the King
James Bible. Both passages go on to mention husbands' obligations
to their wives.
</P>
<P>
   Ephesians 5:25 says, ``Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ
also loved the church, and gave himself for it,'' and Colossians
3:19 says, ``Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against
them,'' according to the King James Bible.
</P>
<P>
   The Southern Baptist Convention's adoption of the submission
statement has proved controversial, though. Most of the 16,000
women gathered Saturday in North Carolina for a ``Renewing the
Heart'' rally roared their disapproval when a speaker asked if they
agreed with it. The gathering drew women from 44 states.
</P>
<P>
   Kim and Bob Hewitt of Alpharetta, Ga., who attended Cox's church
Sunday, said they approve of the statement. When they married two
years ago Kim Hewitt included the words ``love, honor and obey'' in
her vows.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's respect for your husband,'' she said, giving her
definition of submission.
</P>
<P>
   Cox says that during wedding ceremonies he performs, he stresses
the grooms' obligations toward their brides.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's to provide for her, he is to nurture her, he is to care
for her, he is to guide her, he is to nourish her along in her
spiritual walk,'' he said.

 UNDATED: in 1995. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Minor was intent on becoming a media baron even before he
founded Cnet in 1992. While an undergraduate at the University of
Virginia in the late 1980s, he installed four computers in public
places to let people search for rental apartments. Later, Minor,
along with Jeff Bezos, then both investment banking trainees at
Merrill Lynch in New York, almost persuaded the brokerage firm to
back them in a venture to deliver news electronically to
executives. In a cost-cutting move, Merrill killed the project.
(Bezos would go on to start Amazon.com, the online bookstore.)
</P>
<P>
   Minor was crushed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was hopeless. He was like a colt in the stable waiting for
the gate to open for a big race,'' recalled Russell Reynolds Jr.,
the well-known head hunter, who interviewed Minor for a position as
his executive assistant a few months after he left Merrill. Looking
for a smart aide to carry his bags and write speeches, Reynolds
offered this deal: If Minor worked for two years, Reynolds would
help him develop a plan for a new business.
</P>
<P>
   The ideas were flowing from the start.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day he came in with a stack of PC magazines, $279 worth,
that was three feet tall,'' Reynolds said. ``Halsey said, `Get it:
People are spending money on this stuff.'''
</P>
<P>
   But after his two indentured years, and despite introductions
from Reynolds, Minor's plan for Cnet was rejected by most of the
leading venture capitalists. Only after a year of living off money
from friends and credit cards did Minor attract $5 million from
Paul Allen, the billionaire co-founder of Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Cnet was in business, with an ill-formed plan to start
a cable network about computers and do something online as well.
Minor set up a studio in some unused squash courts in a health club
in the North Shore district of San Francisco, not far from many
advertising agency offices. In April 1995, Cnet began a half-hour
weekly program on the USA Network cable channel.
</P>
<P>
   In June of that same year, the company began Cnet.com, its first
Web site, a sort of electronic computer magazine with product
reviews, news and helpful tips. (Today, Cnet's four weekly
television shows operate at a break-even level and are meant mainly
to promote its Web sites.)
</P>
<P>
   It was a heady time as Minor began to hire a handful of
experienced computer journalists and armies of eager young workers,
all excited by the promise of inventing a new medium.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing sexier than a CEO who has a passion for his
product,'' said Christopher Barr, a top editor of PC World magazine
who quit to join Cnet in March 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Minor obsessively surfed Cnet's sites and those of its
competitors, looking for flaws and opportunities. As developers
worked, they would talk of the ``H-factor'' _ the likelihood that
Minor would bawl them out for missteps.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think I have an uncanny ability to find anything that
is broken,'' Minor said. ``I would say to the programmers, `If you
can't do it, I'll write it myself.' I'm no expert, but I can make a
credible threat.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the threats, accompanied by notorious temper tantrums,
have been too credible. And several senior editors, along with a
raft of junior staff members, have left Cnet in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was his decision in 1996 to slow Cnet's momentum by
building Snap that drew the most criticism to Minor inside and
outside the company. People said he was simply too late. But Minor
believed the game was only beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in college, I read a lot about Michael Dell,'' he
said. ``I felt it was too bad I wasn't as smart as he was and the
PC game was already over. But at the same time I was going through
that agony, Ted Waite was starting Gateway 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Minor found only limited success in his initial strategy
_ offering Snap as a home page to Internet service providers so
that they could appear to offer their customers as much content as
America Online.
</P>
<P>
   The online service Prodigy, for example, ultimately chose a deal
with Excite rather than Snap, even though Prodigy's chief
executive, Russell Pillar, is another friend from Minor's stint at
Merrill.
</P>
<P>
   ``My ears still ring,'' Pillar said of the conversation in which
he told Minor he had decided to link Prodigy to Excite rather than
Snap. ``Halsey likes to win at all costs.''
</P>
<P>
   And indeed, in order to get the deal done with NBC, Minor had to
confront the true cost of success. Initially, he did not want to
give up more than half the ownership in Snap. But NBC would not do
the deal if it could not own at least 60 percent, and Minor
conceded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, we said we would rather own 40 percent of No.1
than 50 percent of No. 3,'' Minor said. NBC has the option to buy
the 60 percent stake for $39 million. It has also bought 4.99
percent of Cnet's stock for $26 million. Most important, NBC will
provide extensive on-air promotion of Snap. Minor says the value of
that air time will be far higher than the $100 million over three
years that CBS traded for a stake in the Sportsline Web site.
</P>
<P>
   So what was the stock price prediction that Minor wrote on that
piece of paper? Neither he nor Rogers will say, citing laws against
promoting stocks.
</P>
<P>
   But Minor is happy to explain his thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yahoo is worth $5 billion,'' he said. ``With NBC's backing, we
can get as big as Yahoo within five years, so our 40 percent turns
into $2 billion.''
</P>
<P>
   And beyond that point, it is hard to comprehend the magnitude of
Halsey Minor's ambition.

 &HT;    Book pulled from public libraries in Georgia
 &HT;    By Milo Ippolito
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Gwinnett County, Ga.'s move to pull ``The Basketball
Diaries'' from its public libraries marks a victory for an
organized, conservative movement out to restrict materials on book
shelves around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the prime supporters of the county library board's vote
last week to consider banning the former best seller suggest the
action was a local decision reflecting community standards. But the
suburban Atlanta county's affiliate of a national library watchdog
group _ one led by conservative Christians with an anti-gay agenda
_ led the crusade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Basketball Diaries,'' published in 1978, is poet and
rocker Jim Carroll's autobiographical account of going from a young
New York City basketball star to a teen-age heroin addict who
prostituted himself to support his habit. He describes a variety of
sexual episodes that took place when he is 12 to 15 with men in
bathrooms and older women with peculiar tastes.
</P>
<P>
   The book was made into a movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio in
1995. Last year, a West Paducah, K.Y., youth claimed a violent
scene in the movie _ which was not in the book _ influenced him to
shoot and kill three classmates.
</P>
<P>
   The Gwinnett Co. library board voted 2-1 Monday to ask County
Solicitor Gerald Blaney to determine whether the book fits the
state definition of being ``harmful to minors.'' Blaney said he's
never reviewed a book or been asked for a legal opinion on any
topic before.
</P>
<P>
   The case also is unusual because libraries are exempt from a
state law restricting access to materials harmful to minors.
</P>
<P>
   One member was absent from Monday's meeting, giving two
conservative members _ Jennifer Toombs and Ann MacLeod _ a
majority. Debbie Tuschall voted against the measure, and Chairman
Andy Tourchier's hands were tied because he can only vote to break
a tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a very small group of vocal people that wants to
run the libraries,'' said Tourchier, who opposes the ban. ``If you
don't like a book, that's why they do the dust covers. Put it back
on the shelf.''
</P>
<P>
   Activist Judy Craft helped get about 40 residents to the
Gwinnett meeting to protest the book. Toombs called for the vote to
pull the book if the legal review determines it meets the state
standard.
</P>
<P>
   The pair founded Citizens for Family Friendly Libraries, which
has ties to the national Family Friendly Libraries, founded by
Karen Jo Gounaud of Fairfax, Va., and Phil Burress of Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are affiliated in the standpoint that we share the same
philosophies,'' Toombs said. ``We exchange information.''
</P>
<P>
   The stated goals of the national group and its Gwinnett
affiliate are to keep inappropriate materials out of reach of
children and to return control of libraries to the taxpayers they
serve. Burress is an anti-pornography activist who protested the
exhibition of Robert Mapplethorpe's homo-erotic photos at the
Cincinnati Contemporary Arts Center. Gounaud started out by
protesting against a homosexual newspaper displayed in Fairfax
County libraries.
</P>
<P>
   The Gwinnett Co., Ga. group was formed about three years to
remove the children's book ``What is a Boy? What is a Girl?''
because it contained nude pictures. It also succeeded in having a
parental advisory shelf installed at the Gwinnett libraries, which
holds 10 titles.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll was in New Mexico for a poetry reading and could not be
reached for comment, according to his booking agent, Bob
Fitzgerald. Carroll typically does not comment on controversies
surrounding his work, Fitzgerald said, and did not following the
Kentucky shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll was in Lawrenceville, Ga. on Jan. 21 for a poetry
reading at the Gwinnett campus of DeKalb College, his agent pointed
out. Carroll also has performed with his rock band in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald was unaware of the book ever being banned.
</P>
<P>
   The American Library Association, which monitors book banning,
also was not aware of the book being pulled elsewhere, said Cynthia
Robinson, associate director of the association's Office for
Intellectual Freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``For books to be taken off the shelves of a public library is
extremely uncommon,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gwinnett library system will keep the five copies of the
book and 11 copies of an audio tape version read by the author on
the shelves during the legal review .
</P>
<P>
   PULLOUT BOX INFO
</P>
<P>
   Under Georgia law it is illegal to make books that are ``harmful
to minors'' available to anyone under 18.
</P>
<P>
   Harmful to minors means sexually explicit materials that:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Appeals to the prurient ... interest of minors.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Is ``offensive to ... the adult community as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Is ... lacking in serious literary ... value to minors.''
</P>
<P>
   Public libraries, school and university libraries are exempt
from the law. The exemption protects these institutions against
penalty for inadvertently purchasing a book falling into this
category among their numerous acquisitions.

 &HT;    Confusion over assumed identity is nightmare for Georgia man
 &HT;    By Ann Hardie
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MCDONOUGH, Ga. _ Meet the two Dave Smiths.
</P>
<P>
   The first, a 42-year-old, has fixed airplanes for Delta Air
Lines for two decades and never been in trouble with the law. He is
the real Dave Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The second, 41, has dealt drugs, driven drunk, and burglarized.
The police also want him for making the first Dave Smith's life
miserable by assuming his identity and committing numerous crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The nightmare began last fall when Daniel Charles Smith,
arrested in Chatham County, Ga. for drunk driving, told police that
he was actually the Dave Smith who lives in McDonough. Police
believed him.
</P>
<P>
   Nine months, $5,000, two driver's licenses and a dozen
bureaucracies later, the real Dave Smith still is trying to make
sure his name is cleared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been in any trouble and to put up with this is
ridiculous,'' he says. ``This could go on forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith learned of his predicament in February when his license
was suspended. The notice from the Georgia Department of Public
Safety said the suspension was for drunk driving in Savannah, Ga.,
but he hadn't been there in more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Smith contacted his local sheriff's department in Henry Co.,
Ga., which sent his Social Security number to the Georgia Bureau of
Investigation's computerized system of criminal records and came up
with an extensive criminal history, including distributing drugs
and burglary. He even learned that he had spent November and
December in the Chatham County Jail for burglary and driving under
the influence.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, police say the crimes are the work of Daniel Charles
Smith, who uses at least three different birthdays, four Social
Security numbers and 10 identities, including Jeffrey James, Slim,
and now Dave Smith, law enforcement officials say.
</P>
<P>
   How Daniel Charles Smith got the information needed to
impersonate Dave Smith is unknown. But this kind of fraud is
becoming so common that police recommend dropping by your local
precinct to see if you have a record _ even if you've never
committed a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Henry County, Ga. officials needed less than a day to figure out
what was going on. They took Dave Smith's fingerprints, faxed them
to the GBI, and the computer determined he was not the man accused
of all these crimes.
</P>
<P>
   But it is unclear why Chatham County law enforcement officials
didn't catch on. They had access to a computer system that
identified Daniel Charles Smith, not Dave Smith, as the man who had
been fingerprinted after these arrests.
</P>
<P>
   ``That information was available to them,'' said John Bankhead,
a spokesman for the GBI. ``Whether or not they checked is the
question.''
</P>
<P>
   The Henry County Sheriff's Department went out of their way and
took Smith to Savannah to clear up the matter with local law
enforcement. ``When I left there, I felt pretty good about
everything,'' Smith says.
</P>
<P>
   The feeling didn't last. In March, Smith was notified that his
license had been suspended again because of the other Smith. He
hired lawyers who didn't help him. He missed work attempting to
straighten things out on his own.
</P>
<P>
   When Smith appealed to Chatham County police for help, they
threatened to come get him, he says. ``I know this man has a
legitimate concern _ that this has really put his life in
turmoil,'' said Capt. Doug Burkhalter of the Chatham County police.
``We are trying to help him.''
</P>
<P>
   The police are looking for the other Smith for criminal trespass
and forging Dave Smith's name, which has been cleared for now.
</P>
<P>
   But Dave Smith knows how easily the police can be fooled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this is going to be over until they catch this
cat and lock him up,'' Dave Smith said. ``I don't know if this will
ever be over.''

YUGOSLAVIA LUCKY TO GET 1-0 WIN OVER UPSTART IRAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST.-ETIENNE, France _ A lackluster Yugoslavia, looking more like
a bunch of irritable stars than a coherent team on Sunday, beat
Iran, 1-0, in the opening match of Group F, which also includes the
United States and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Only a series of squandered chances by the Iranians, who played
with verve and growing self-belief as they dominated the first
half, allowed the favored Yugoslav team to clinch the match with a
swerving, 30-yard free kick by sweeper Sinisa Mihajlovic in the
72nd minute.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslavs did not look like the often majestic and
free-scoring side that qualified for the World Cup from a difficult
group. The team's stars, including striker Pedrag Mijatovic of Real
Madrid, who scored 14 goals during the qualifying rounds, often
seemed more intent on pursuing petulant disputes with each other
than winning the match.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not satisfied with the team,'' said Slobodan Santrac,
Yugoslavia's coach. ``It's not easy putting together players who
play in different national leagues.'' Asked about the apparently
frayed team spirit, he said the squabbles merely reflected ``the
Yugoslav temperament.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Yugoslavia _ which now consists of the truncated
federation of Serbia and Montenegro _ may merely be starting
slowly, as Italy did in the 1994 World Cup. But the match suggested
that the United States, which opens its World Cup campaign against
the powerful German side in Paris on Monday, could have a difficult
time advancing to the second round.
</P>
<P>
   The victory, and the three points, give Yugoslavia some
breathing room while Iran will be playing a desperate game next
Sunday against the Americans. Perhaps the only positive thing the
United States can draw from the game is that Yugoslavia scored only
one goal. Goal differential is the tie breaker, if one is needed,
to determine who advances to the second round. So the United States
may have an increased chance for a surprise qualification in a
group where Yugoslavia and Germany are widely favored.
</P>
<P>
   The group features an unusual concentration of political
enmities. The games between the United States and Iran next Sunday,
United States and Yugoslavia on June 25, and Iran and Germany on
the same day will scarcely be friendly picnics. Still, players and
managers alike seem determined to keep the vitriol off the field.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Both teams started nervously Sunday in a blustery
Geoffroy-Cuichard Stadium in this old industrial town in
south-central France. In soccer terms, they were coming in from the
cold; Iran returning after a 20-year absence from the World Cup
finals, and Yugoslavia emerging from an eight-year absence marked
by a two-year international ban imposed because of the Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
   Iran strung four players across the back and another four in
midfield, leaving the two strikers, the towering Ali Daei and the
stocky Khodadad Azizi somewhat isolated. Still, the darting Azizi
was often dangerous and will clearly be a man who the United States
needs to watch closely.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Azizi, Savo Milosevic, the big Yugoslav striker
who played last season in England, seemed to have lead in his
shoes. The Yugoslav side looked strangely static, not even coming
to life after defender Goran Djorovic hit the bar with a looping
header in the 15th minute.
</P>
<P>
   As the first half progressed, Iran took charge, looking much
better than its last-ditch qualification for the World Cup
suggested. Put through on the left, midfielder Mehrdad Minavand
Chal had only the goalkeeper to beat, but blasted his shot wide.
</P>
<P>
   With the Yugoslavs looking shell-shocked, Daei shot straight at
the Yugoslav goalkeeper, Ivica Krajl, in the 36th minute. A big
Iranian crowd had started to believe in the unbelievable.
</P>
<P>
   Halftime brought relief for the Yugoslavs, and three
substitutions early in the second half finally brought the team to
life. Milosevic, who seemed to spend most of the game sulking, and
Captain Dragan Stojkovic, who had also looked in a permanent bad
temper, were both taken off, allowing the young Dejan Stankovic and
Perica Ognjenovic to inject some much-needed energy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it took a free kick for the Yugoslavs to break the
deadlock. Sinisa Mihajlovic's left-footed shot was good but
scarcely devastating, and the Iranian goalkeeper Nima Nakisa moved
the wrong way, perhaps screened by his team's defensive wall.
Perhaps unsighted by a teammate, he pounded the field in
understandable frustration as the ball hit the net.
</P>
<P>
   The Iranians tried to raise their game, but only once did they
worry the Yugoslavs with a sharp header from Daei that was saved by
Kralj.
</P>
<P>
   ``The result was not shameful for us,'' said Jalal Talebi,
Iran's coach. ``I thought we could win after 15 minutes, but it did
not happen, and now we look forward to winning against the United
States.''

IN TWILIGHT OF UNFULFILLED CAREER, WEGERLE SEEKS WORLD CUP GLORY 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAINT-JEAN ARDIERES, France _ The World Cup once seemed to Roy
Wegerle a brass ring that he would never grasp. He grew up in
Pretoria, the capital of South Africa, whose racial policies of
apartheid made it an international pariah and left it banned from
the Olympics and other major sports competitions.
</P>
<P>
   Inside South Africa, sport, like every other facet of society,
was played out along racial lines. Soccer was the preferred game of
the black majority, while rugby was favored by the white minority.
Still, from the age of 10, Wegerle was determined to become a
professional soccer player. It was a desire made more urgent at age
16 or 17, when he made his first trip to play against a team in one
of the black townships.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a creativity and flair that I hadn't seen before,''
Wegerle said. ``It changed my whole thinking about what it was
possible to do with the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   And it also intensified the feeling that if he wanted to play
internationally, he would have to leave South Africa. His one way
out was to come to the United States in 1982 as a college student
at South Florida University. From there, Wegerle began a sinuous
career that has carried both extraordinary promise and maddening
unfulfillment due to the vagaries of injury.
</P>
<P>
   He has been rookie of the year with Tampa Bay in the defunct
North American Soccer League. He has played 10 successful seasons
in England. He took advantage of soccer's murky eligibility
requirements, and given the choice of playing for five national
teams, he chose the United States, gaining eligibility in 1991
because he was married to an American. He has also endured nine
knee surgeries, which limited him to a reserve role in the 1994
World Cup and which threatened to end his career a year ago. The
scars crisscross his knees like a roadmap of his interrupted
career.
</P>
<P>
   But now, at 34, he has worked himself into remarkable shape and
is expected to replace Eric Wynalda in the second half Monday night
at forward when the United States opens World Cup play against
Germany. With his ability to hold the ball under pressure and his
willingness to play defense, Wegerle could play a crucial role in
providing at least a tie that the Americans feel they need to have
any chance of advancing beyond the first round.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key for us is not to give up a goal early,'' Wegerle said
Sunday. ``That would just give Germany more confidence. The longer
we can go without getting behind, the greater chance we have in the
later stages. It might force Germany to take a few risks, and it
might be our best opportunity to get a goal. I don't think we're
going to outplay them. But we might be able to steal it by striking
at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, South Africa is making its first appearance in
soccer's world championship. The team is affectionately known as
Bafana Bafana, which translates to the Boys, and which is a sharp
counterpoint to the Springboks, the national team mascot associated
with the former apartheid regime. If he had remained in South
Africa, Wegerle might very well be playing for Bafana Bafana, which
appears desperately to need a scorer after Friday's 3-0 loss to
France. But Wegerle prefers to look forward, not backward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any regrets,'' Wegerle said. ``I made my choice
in '92 to follow my World Cup dream. South Africa had been banned
my whole career. This was something I needed to do. I'm very
fortunate to have this opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States and South Africa have been placed in different
groups in the 32-team World Cup. There is only a remote chance that
the two teams would meet in a later round. Wegerle knows few
players among Bafana Bafana, but he wishes them the best of luck.
They deserve to succeed, he said, given that sports have provided
some of the most symbolic and visible racial healing in
post-apartheid South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa made its figurative re-entry into the world by
marching into the opening ceremony of the 1992 Summer Olympics in
Barcelona, Spain, after an absence of nearly three decades. In
1995, South Africa won the world rugby championship, and President
Nelson Mandela made an important, inclusive gesture, donning the
jersey of the Springboks, the once reviled athletic symbol of
apartheid. A year later, Bafana Bafana won the African Nations Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm convinced that sport, soccer in particular, was the
breakthrough against apartheid,'' Wegerle said. ``I hope the guys
have great success and can smile after the World Cup. It's the
least they deserve after everything they've been through.''
</P>
<P>
   His own career has been similarly rejuvenated. After nine knee
surgeries, his forward speed is still evident, but he lacks the
sharp cutting ability he once had. U.S. Coach Sampson would like to
see Wegerle be able to beat defenders one on one with explosive
power and to be able to shoot from distance with strength and
accuracy. But he provides vast experience and determination, an
ability to play with his back to the goal and to hold the ball
under pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago, I thought his international career was over,''
Sampson said. ``He deserves a lot of credit for having proved
himself again.''
</P>
<P>
   Wegerle provided two goals in a 3-0 victory over Canada last
November that secured the United States a berth in the 1998 World
Cup and also secured Sampson's job. In the weeks before World Cup
training began in early May, Wegerle hired a personal trainer to
keep him fit, and he reported to camp in the best shape of anyone
on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been disappointing that I haven't had the opportunity to
show my full talent on the world stage,'' Wegerle said. ``It was my
main fear that I would go out with a whimper. But I was determined
not to go out like that. That's what kept me going.''
</P>
<P>
   And what about the improbable chance of playing South Africa in
the World Cup?
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have asked me that, and I think it would be a
great way to finish my career,'' Wegerle said. Then he paused. ``As
long as the U.S. won, of course.''

 0615 &HT;    Williams proves to be clutch player off bench
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   About once every five games, the Atlanta Braves let Gerald
Williams start. They have yet to be disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, he merely turned a game around by himself in the early
stages, driving in a tying run, stealing two bases before scoring
what became the deciding run. Before that, he'd made a play in
right field that prevented an Expos run. It's almost enough to make
a guy wonder what Williams might do with more steady employment.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not something I'm happy about,'' Williams said. ''But
it's not making me unhappy.''
</P>
<P>
   That comment precisely strikes the tone with which Williams has
gone about his work in his first season in Atlanta. Manager Bobby
Cox says he's never had a reserve player better suited for the
role, saying, ''He's the most ready, prepared player I've ever met
in my life. Ever.''
</P>
<P>
   When given his chances, he has produced. Going 2-for-4 Sunday,
Williams' season average reached .278, climbing to .327 when in the
starting lineup. Facing the Expos' Carlos Perez, he pushed his
season average against left-handers to .360. This is his quiet
campaign for more playing time, a candidacy stacked against him
with the left-handed hitting Michael Tucker and Ryan Klesko making
over 80 precent of the starts against righties.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just have to try to beat the odds,'' Williams said. ''Since
I've only been playing in a limited fashion, I expect to play a
little more and obviously, Mr. Cox understands I want to play.
</P>
<P>
   ''So I want to be ready everytime I'm called upon. I don't care
what it is. I don't care if it's an opportunity to bring the bats
to the plate. If he calls on me, I'm ready.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Braves down 1-0 in the third inning, Williams tied with
game with a two-out RBI single and then used Perez. He stole second
base on the first pitch and then stole third _ the third Braves to
do so this season _ two pitches later, after Perez neglected to
check him.
</P>
<P>
   Said Williams, ''I think that was part of his miscalculation.''
</P>
<P>
   He subsequently scored for a 2-1 lead and Atlanta would need no
more. That came after he had closed down a Montreal scoring threat
in the first, quickly running down a Brad Fullmer single to right
and getting it to the cut-off man in time to stop Jose Vidro from
attempting to score from second. That's generally what's happened
every five games, when Williams takes the chance he's offered.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that I must,'' he said. ''Let's say, the options are
limited.''

 &HT;    U.S. vs. Germany
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOALKEEPERS
</P>
<P>
   Kasey Keller, U.S. _ Certainly among the finest keepers in the
World Cup, he usually shines in big matches, as evidenced by
spectacular saves in a 1-0 win for the U.S. over Brazil in
February.
</P>
<P>
   Andreas Kopke, Germany _ Steady and sure-handed, doesn't have
the flair or dramatics of Keller, but has a more proven defensive
line working in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   DEFENDERS
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Dooley, Eddie Pope and David Regis, U.S. _ The new
three-back alignment has camoflauged past defensive problems and
given Pope and new citizen Regis the burden of some heady
man-marking assignments. Captain Dooley is 37 at sweeper but
invaluable.
</P>
<P>
   Lothar Matthaus, Christian Worns and Jurgen Kohler, Germany _
Germany has a new, but old, face in the 37-year-old Matthaus,
called up after injuries at sweeper, and after a national team
absence dating back to December 1994. Thomas Helmer has been
limited this week because of an injury.
</P>
<P>
   MIDFIELDERS
</P>
<P>
   Brian Maisonneuve, Chad Deering, Cobi Jones, Mike Burns, Claudio
Reyna and Ernie Stewart, U.S. _ This is where the Americans hope to
use their speed, flexibility and numbers. Reyna is the creative
maestro, with Stewart acting more like a withdrawn striker and the
swift Jones causing havoc on the flanks. Burns, Maisonneuve and
Deering excel in defensive roles.
</P>
<P>
   Olaf Thon, Jens Jeremies, Jorg Heinrich, Christian Ziege and
Andreas Moller, Germany _ Moller could prove to be a handful for
the U.S. with his clever playmaking and timely passing. He might be
joined on attack by 1994 World Cup veteran Thomas Hassler. Ziege
has been hurt and may be replaced by Michael Tarnat, while Thon and
Jeremies will support the defense.
</P>
<P>
   FORWARDS
</P>
<P>
   Eric Wynalda, Roy Wegerle or Brian McBride, U.S. _ The most
troublesome position because it is the most unsettled. Wynalda has
been slow to heal from a knee injury, veteran Wegerle is a slow,
but better fit with the 3-6-1 formation and the untested McBride is
well-suited to tangle with Germany physically. If the offense needs
help, look for Preki Radosavljevic and his magical left foot.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Bierhoff and Jurgen Klinsmann, Germany _ The perfect
compliment up top, with the powerful Bierhoff and the elusive,
fluid captain Klinsmann. But if Klinsmann, who has been injured,
can't go, Germany can call on Olaf Marschall and Ulf Kirsten, two
of the Bundesliga's top scorers last season. It sounds like a tall
order for the revamped U.S. defense, but it is for most everybody
else.

WHY INDIA THINKS ATOMIC EQUATION HAS CHANGED 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The end of the Cold War left a power vacuum
from central Asia into Africa that India could not ignore, a senior
Indian official said this week in New York. It was that change in
the global security environment, he said, that ultimately prompted
the Indian decision to test nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Jaswant Singh, Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vaypayee's senior adviser on defense and foreign affairs who is
widely expected to become foreign minister when Vaypayee
relinquishes that portfolio, was at the United Nations to address a
special General Assembly session on narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   In meetings with influential U.S. audiences he took the
opportunity to present a broader picture of India's international
position, leaving the impression that the country has reasserted
its ambition to be the unquestioned power in a region that sweeps
from the Middle East to Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a lunch on Wednesday sponsored by the Asia Society,
Singh described the post-1989 world, in which India had lost the
automatic support of Russia, its former ally and arms supplier,
while the nuclear powers continued to protect themselves and their
closest friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``From Vancouver to Vladivostok there came into existence a new
club,'' he said. ``This club extended its reach to the eastern rim
of Asia and the Pacific. This left a huge gap, a vacuum, and that
vacuum lies in southern Asia and Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts on India have long assumed that the second-most populous
country saw itself as a major power thwarted since independence in
1947 from taking its rightful place among nations. As the United
States moved closer to China in recent years, with President
Clinton's using the phrase ``strategic partnership'' with Beijing,
the Indians grew increasingly frustrated that they were not
accorded the same attention.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Singh said, India was lectured about its unwillingness
to sign treaties against the spread of nuclear arms and against
testing weapons. He called Washington's priorities insulting.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't put a gun to India's head and say, `Sign this paper
and then we'll listen to you,''' he said. With a review of the 1996
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty due next year, he said, India knew
that it would come under renewed pressure to sign the pact and that
it had a narrow window of opportunity for testing.
</P>
<P>
   He said India was stunned by the Clinton administration's
denunciation of the nuclear tests that New Delhi conducted on May
11 and May 13. The United States, Singh added, seemed to misread
the end of the Cold War as the end of threats to national security
everywhere, while India remained between two potentially dangerous
nations, Pakistan and China.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The United States of America then proposed a new thesis, that
the principal dynamic or relations would be trade and commerce,''
Singh said. ``The United States assumed everyone thought the
same.''
</P>
<P>
   American officials who traveled to India in the months before
the nuclear tests did not agree that this was the message that they
conveyed. Clinton administration officials said they made it
extremely clear in talks with the Indians that they were looking
for a wider range of relationships, but they also stressed the
importance of India's refraining from testing or deploying weapons
and encouraged the Indians to be candid about their plans with the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The officials, stung by the flouting of reassurances from New
Delhi days before the tests, said they were now wary of any Indian
promises to adhere to treaties or to give up the option of
deploying nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have also joined in the Security Council condemnation
of India, which Singh said shocked Indian leaders. On June 6, the
council refused to accept a bid by India to be considered a nuclear
power.
</P>
<P>
   Singh, known for his quiet wit, as well as his analytical
skills, chided Secretary of State Madeleine Albright at a news
conference he held on Tuesday at the United Nations. Albright's
father, Josef Korbel, was responsible for demarcating the
cease-fire line between India and Pakistan half a century ago and
wrote a book on the issue. Albright, familiar with the region all
her life, remarked recently that India had ``dug a hole for
itself'' with its nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
   Singh, alluding to the Hindu practice of cremation, said
Albright had her metaphor wrong. ``Civilizationally,'' he said,
``we in India do not dig holes to bury ourselves.''

 0615 &HT;    Making his Mark: Martin surges to fourth win of year
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLYN, Mich. _ Mark Martin never has won a Winston Cup
championship, but he made another bold step in that direction
Sunday, winning for the fourth time and dominating the field over
the final 51 laps in the Miller Lite 400 at Michigan Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Martin never ran out of the top 10 and took the lead away from
Jeff Gordon on lap 150 and steadily pulled away. He built a
three-second margin with 10 laps remaining and took the checkered
flag 2.3 seconds ahead of Dale Jarrett. Gordon wilted to third.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first part of the race was a race for second,'' said
Martin, referring to Gordon's quick getaway. ``Then it seemed like
throughout the rest of the race they maybe lost the handle a little
bit, and we got ours a little better.''
</P>
<P>
   It definitely was a two-man contest from the green flag to the
checkered, with Jarrett, Jeff Burton and Jeremy Mayfield rounding
out the top five.
</P>
<P>
   Though Jarrett finished second, he never was able to pressure
Martin, who after taking the lead, never strayed from his line,
which most of the way was the bottom of the track. Once he broke
into the open on lap 150, the challengers faded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark was awful good. I don't know what we could have done to
catch him,'' Jarrett said. ``We were good, just not good enough,
again. Mark's car went to the bottom a little better than I could,
especially on new tires. I just couldn't quite make it stick down
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin feared early that he would be chasing Gordon all day,
rather than being chased. Gordon pulled away easily and led 89 of
the first 100 laps. Then his advantage went away just as quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we slowed up as much as they picked up,'' Gordon
said. ``Had Mark started up front where I did, he would have
dominated the whole event. We knew he had the best car, but we got
a little anxious there and thought we might be able to beat 'em and
hold 'em off. I knew once I got behind them it would be all over.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin knew it also.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a few times when I got under Jeff that I couldn't
make it stick,'' Martin said, ``but the last time I did it, I got
pretty pumped up to go on and hang on to that thing tight and step
on the gas enough to make sure I got out in front of him. And we
made it stick.''

 0615 &HT;    Miller Lite 400 Notebook
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLYN, Mich. _ Richard Childress gave his new team alignments
an overall A, but he wasn't as happy with the weekend's results in
the Miller Lite 400 at Michigan Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looks like the changes we made have us headed in the right
direction,'' he said of the crew chief swap that sent Larry
McReynolds to the Mike Skinner team and Kevin Hamlin to
Earnhardt's.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both teams communicated well today. But, Dale had to drive a
short track car on a superspeedway because of Saturday's crash. It
really hurt us because we think that was a real good car.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt finished 15th and Skinner was 29th.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel like the other car would have been a top 10 car,''
Earnhardt said. ''But, we'll get 'em next time. All the guys did a
good job, worked hard as a team and that's what we're looking for.
</P>
<P>
   ''Finishing 15th is not that great, but it's better than not
racing, or not finishing. Next week will be better. We've got a
good car for Pocono, so we'll have to try to pick it up. We're
headed in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Mysterious debris
</P>
<P>
   Somebody needed a caution Sunday and made sure it happened,
throwing roll bar padding onto the track on lap 119. It wasn't Jeff
Gordon's idea. Just the opposite. It was a momentum breaker and
changed the complexion of the race. From leading by 10 seconds,
Gordon's car suddenly tightened and never was the same. It had the
opposite effect on Mark Martin, who was able to pit and loosen up
his car. Where did the bar come from? An investigation will be
made.
</P>
<P>
   The points race
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Mayfield finished fifth and retained his Winston Cup
points lead. He has 2,023 points, 26 ahead of Jeff Gordon, who
moved up a notch, third to second. Mark Martin moved from fourth to
third and Dale Jarrett improves to fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Missing it
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Wallace had one of those days he can't afford. He finished
17th Sunday, dropping four places in the Winston Cup points
standings, 68 points behind Mayfield. ''We just missed it all
around today, shocks and springs,'' Wallace said. ''You don't see
that too often. We started loose, loose and adjusted on that. Then
it pushed real bad. We just didn't have anything for them today.
</P>
<P>
   Good day for Burton
</P>
<P>
   Ward Burton backed up his pole winning performance with an
eighth place finish, matching his season best. ''We had about a
sixth place car, and finished eighth because we were just too
tight. I hate a couple of those guys got by me, but that's the way
it goes sometime.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The government's antitrust battle against Microsoft Corp. has
not tarnished the company's reputation as an outstanding business
that makes high-quality products. But according to the latest New
York Times/CBS News poll, a majority of Americans do think that
Microsoft is a monopoly and that the Justice Department should
continue to investigate the company and its business practices.
</P>
<P>
   Both in a nationwide telephone poll last week and in follow-up
interviews, people again and again expressed deep admiration for
the accomplishments of Microsoft and Bill Gates, the company's
famous co-founder and chairman. Yet the same people repeatedly said
there was an important role for the government to play to make sure
that fair play was maintained in the high-technology economy that
Microsoft has come to symbolize.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Gates has made an enormous contribution to this nation's
economy, creating jobs and wealth,'' said Richard Denoyer, a
65-year-old education consultant in Evendale, Ohio. ``But you've
got to give others a real chance to participate in these high-tech
markets as well. And it's the government's responsibility to check
things out, to make sure that Microsoft is playing by the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   In the court of public opinion, the burden of proof clearly
rests on the side of the government to show that Microsoft has done
anything illegal. Fifty-five percent of Americans surveyed said
that they had a favorable opinion of Microsoft, while only 15
percent held an unfavorable opinion. (The remaining 30 percent had
no opinion on the matter.) Most people said their opinion of
Microsoft had not changed as a result of the Justice Department's
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``People give Microsoft enormous credit for what it has
accomplished, but they also recognize that bad things could happen
and that market power can be abused,'' said Nicholas Donatiello,
president of Odyssey, a market research firm that studies how
consumers view technology companies. ``It's pragmatic and entirely
sensible.''
</P>
<P>
   The Times/CBS poll, conducted June 7 to 9, surveyed 1,126 adults
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about Microsoft's business practices, 54 percent of
those polled said they agreed with the statement that ``Microsoft
uses legally acceptable business tactics to sell and distribute its
products.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, only 19 percent said they agreed that ``Microsoft
uses illegal sales and business tactics to force people to buy its
products and keep other products from being used'' _ a pivotal
point in the government's antitrust case. The remainder agreed with
neither statement or had no opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Even the 60 percent of people who say the Justice Department
should continue to investigate Microsoft are not necessarily
convinced that the government was justified in bringing a major
antitrust case against the company last month.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has contended that Microsoft has used
unfair practices to defend its monopoly in the market for
personal-computer operating-system software, the program that
controls the basic operations of a computer, and to try to gain an
edge in the new markets of Internet software and commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion, to be sure, plays no direct role in antitrust
policy. Yet it is inevitably a consideration when bringing a major
case like the suit against Microsoft. Congress controls the Justice
Department's budget, and a big case that is seen as too far out of
step with public opinion could bring pressure from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   So when the Microsoft suit was announced in Washington on May
18, Attorney General Janet Reno appeared before a battery of
television cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of that exercise is to convince people that what the
government is doing is in the interest of the consumer,'' noted
Robert Litan, a former senior official in the Justice Department's
antitrust division.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion, he added, also sets the limits of government
action. The Justice Department, for example, has not moved to break
up the big software company, as was done with the Bell System in
1984 and as some industry analysts have advocated in the Microsoft
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public is not ready for something that drastic, certainly
not yet,'' said Litan, who is the director of economic studies at
the Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   People are split almost evenly on whether the government did the
right thing in filing suit against Microsoft, with 35 percent
saying it was right and 27 percent saying it was a mistake. The
remaining 38 percent were undecided or were not aware of the case.
</P>
<P>
   People who said the investigation should continue but thought
the Justice Department was mistaken in filing the antitrust suit
tended to view the appropriate role for government as more a
referee than a prosecutor. They also regarded some of what they had
heard of Microsoft's aggressive business practices as part of the
rough-and-tumble of capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   Dianne Tytell, a 48-year-old office manager of a dental practice
in Virginia Beach, Va., said: ``Bill Gates probably did overstep a
few boundaries. If you're powerful and on top, that's what you do.
He should get the equivalent of a parking ticket for that. But I
don't think he's really done anything dishonest. And after all he's
achieved, I think it's wrong for the government to try to tear down
someone like Bill Gates.''
</P>
<P>
   The Times/CBS poll does illustrate the high regard that most
Americans have for Microsoft and for Gates. Nearly five times as
many people have a favorable opinion of Gates as have an
unfavorable opinion _ 39 percent to 8 percent, with the rest
undecided or unfamiliar with Gates. The favorable-unfavorable split
for President Clinton in the same poll is much more evenly divided:
at 45 percent favorable, 37 percent unfavorable and the rest
undecided.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   In the case of Microsoft, familiarity breeds respect _ or at
least familiarity with its products does. On almost every Microsoft
question asked in the poll, the more that people used computers,
the more pro-Microsoft their answers were. For example, among
people who not only use computers but have installed software on
their own, 78 percent had a favorable opinion of Microsoft compared
with 55 percent of all those questioned for the poll.
</P>
<P>
   The high approval ratings for Microsoft, according to
public-opinion analysts, owes much to the perception that the
company is a standard-bearer of a resurgent U.S. economy in the
1990s, led by high-technology industries. ``Microsoft is the
symbolic company and Bill Gates is seen as the personification of
America's recent success,'' observed Daniel Yankelovich, the
public-opinion analyst. ``The captain of our side is Bill Gates.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans are technological optimists, according to the
Times/CBS poll, with 59 percent saying that computers solve more
problems than they create, while 29 percent say they create more
problems than they solve. Among computer users, 71 percent see the
machines as solving more problems than they create. And two-thirds
of Americans now use a computer either at home or at work,
according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many Americans appear to be embracing the information age
tentatively, if not fearfully. More than half of all computer
users, 52 percent, say they have never installed a software program
_ a basic step in computing. While technology enthusiasts never
tire of extolling the virtues of computers as personalized tools of
empowerment, the Times/CBS poll suggests that a large share of the
computer-using public has no interest in tailoring their machines
or changing them.
</P>
<P>
   The portrait of many people as passive recipients of computer
technology may also cast some doubt on one of Microsoft's arguments
in its dispute with the government. The Justice Department,
Microsoft says, has overstated the advantage the company enjoys
because the main desktop screen that users see when they turn on
their machines is Microsoft's Windows. That first screen can be
easily changed or modified, Microsoft insists.
</P>
<P>
   It can, but the poll indicates that fine-tuning software is
beyond many people.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's market power is viewed with both ambivalence and
pragmatism, according to the Times/CBS poll. Monopoly, it seems, is
no longer regarded as an economic evil. A majority of those
questioned say Microsoft is a monopoly _ a label Microsoft itself
shuns _ but 77 percent also say Microsoft makes high-quality
products. And 58 percent of computer users and 67 percent of people
who have installed software themselves consider Microsoft's
dominant role in the software business to be good for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   A certain ambivalence about big, successful companies, and what
the government's role should be in policing them, has been a theme
of American public opinion for decades, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Christopher Rogers, a 25-year-old medical student in
Philadelphia, who seems little concerned by the dominance of
Microsoft's Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft's Windows is a great product,'' he said. ``It is a
monopoly but not in the traditional sense of controlling markets to
raise prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Rogers, like others polled, is skeptical about whether
consumers would benefit if Microsoft were to control the market for
software used for browsing the Internet _ a market that is a focus
of the Justice Department's case. Only 8 percent of those polled
said it would be a good thing if Microsoft dominated the browser
market, 41 percent said it would be bad, 39 percent said it would
make no difference and 12 percent had no opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft pushing its Internet browser onto the market with
every copy of Windows does seem like a domineering thing to do,''
Rogers said. ``And I do think that's something worth
investigating.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone
interviews conducted June 7 to June 9 with 1,126 adults throughout
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected
by a computer from a complete list of more than 42,000 active
residential exchanges across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a
complete telephone number, thus permitting access to both listed
and unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was
designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the
survey.
</P>
<P>
   The results have been weighted to take account of household size
and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for
variations in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, race,
age and education.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such
samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in
either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out
all American adults.
</P>
<P>
   For smaller subgroups the potential sampling error is larger.
For example, for the 315 most sophisticated computer users in the
sample it is plus or minus six percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of
conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources
of error into the poll. Variations in the wording or order of
questions, for instance, can lead to somewhat different results.

PARIS JOURNAL: EXORCIST OF NOTRE DAME DOESN'T LACK FOR CLIENTS 
</HEADLINE>
 (mk) 
 By MARLISE SIMONS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ At first sight, the exorcist of Notre Dame does not seem
capable of frightening anyone, let alone the devil. The Rev. Claude
Nicolas is portly and quick-witted and has a merry laugh, a sort of
Gallic Friar Tuck. But casting off demons is precisely his task as
the resident exorcist of Paris' great medieval cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   He practices this ancient tradition on most weekdays near the
great Rose-Window of Notre Dame's South Porch, unnoticed by the
stampede of passing tourists. There, behind a glass wall and a sign
saying ``reception, dialogue,'' the exorcist can be found, not
exhorting in Latin, hoisting a cross or splashing holy water, but
saying a quiet prayer, holding someone's hands or applying a drop
of holy oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of things brewing that disturb people,'' said
the priest, pausing between visits from the faithful and dressed
for the occasion in white cassock and purple stole. ``There are all
sorts of sects and black cults. Some people believe there is a
spell on them. Some openly talk about the devil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' he added, ``the evil spirit often disguises a
serious mental problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicolas is one of the 95 exorcists appointed by the Roman
Catholic Church in France. Notre Dame has always had an official
exorcist, but, nationwide, the number has not been this high for
about a century.
</P>
<P>
   With the approach of the millennium, the demand for exorcism has
steadily grown in France and across Europe, a consequence, priests
say, of social and cultural dislocation, the erosion of traditional
religion and the rise of sects and cults dealing in spiritism. As a
result, in recent years, the Vatican has quietly encouraged bishops
to name more exorcists.
</P>
<P>
   The practice, of course, is as old as Christianity itself _ and
even predates it _ but in Paris, at the offices of the French
Bishops' Conference, it is treated confidentially. A spokesman said
the church provides no list of exorcists or the yearly number of
rites. But he said the church in France now has five times more
exorcists than 20 years ago. There is one now in each diocese.
</P>
<P>
   It is Notre Dame, though, with its mighty Gothic vaults,
magnetic stained-glass windows and rows of gargoyles, including
some in the form of the devil himself, which has special drawing
powers. On an average day, Nicolas sees up to a dozen people who in
one way or another believe they are pursued by evil. Many are from
the Paris region, yet others come from as far away as Nice or
Bordeaux, in the south.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tell people they can make contacts locally,'' said Nicolas.
``But evidently they think Notre Dame is better.'' Then he adds
with one of his hearty laughs, ``Of course, it has a certain brand
name.''
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic Church, like many Christian churches, teaches that
the devil is real and evil spirits exist. But modern theologians
have been playing down Satan's influence as they have accepted
psychological and psychiatric explanations of abnormal behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Nicolas, 64, an ecclesiastical judge who has also studied
psychiatry and sexology, is among this modern group. In
conversation and in his recent book ``The Demon of Anguish,'' he
does not use words like ``demonic possession'' but instead speaks
of the ``confusion'' and ``suffering'' of people who have come to
ask for help.
</P>
<P>
   Among them are men and women, many in their 20s to 30s, from
Paris' multicultural mix _ some French and others immigrants from
Africa and the Caribbean where spiritual possession is part of the
culture.
</P>
<P>
   `'People come with all sorts of fears, of themselves and of
others,'' he said. `'Often they've been to a witch doctor or a
clairvoyant who has tricked them out of a lot of money.'' In Paris
or its outskirts, where many freelance lay exorcists operate,
casting off demons can cost from $200 to $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``True possession, where the person has lost his own will, is
very, very rare,'' he said, harking back to his eight years as an
exorcist. ``It may happen sometimes with very mystical people.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicolas, who combines compassion and skepticism, joking one
moment and then again turning dead serious, says he has seen his
share of people with unusual powers or strength, people who hear
voices or who suddenly bleed inexplicably. He described a woman of
about 40 who was screaming and had scratches appear on her arms.
Such cases, he said, usually represent a disorder that requires
psychiatric help and that an exorcist might make worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``An exorcist needs to be as undramatic as possible, not to be
part of the theater,'' he said, waving his arms in a mock ceremony.
``The point is not to aggravate people's anxiety.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicolas has seen the film ``The Exorcist'' but he laughed off
the Hollywood image.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I believe the devil exists, but not in the way he is
popularly presented,'' he said. ``The evil spirit exists in
people's hearts, it slips in through the mind's fault lines. It
destroys trust, causes despair, prevents people from loving, from
living a full life. It's not a matter of rolling on the ground and
crying.''
</P>
<P>
   In cases of severe mental disorders, he may send people to a
support team to which he belongs, which includes church workers, a
psychologist and a psychiatrist. Some Catholics who find the notion
of exorcism rather medieval and a bit embarrassing argue that
people seeking exorcism usually need more help than a priest and
should be attended to by psychiatric professionals.
</P>
<P>
   So how then does Nicolas, who believes in psychiatric help, see
his role? On this point he is adamant.
</P>
<P>
   `'A psychiatrist is not there to further one's spiritual life,''
he said. ``That's not his job. He does not give blessings. He does
not say, `Relax, trust in God.' But I, as a priest, believe in the
power of prayer.''

</P>
<P>
   The power of Satan over the human imagination has waxed and
waned through the ages, and for a time in France and elsewhere in
the West it looked as though the devil had fallen on hard times.
Exorcism was dropped from studies for the priesthood. When the
church, as part of Vatican II reforms, modernized most rites in the
1960s, it did not bother to update the 400-year-old Latin ritual.
</P>
<P>
   But since the '70s, charismatic Christians have been sweeping
through the ranks of mainstream Protestant and Catholic churches,
telling their followers they were possessed by the demons of
nicotine, alcohol, abortion, homosexuality and more.
</P>
<P>
   This charismatic movement has led to a dramatic rise in
exorcisms of a kind unauthorized by the hierarchy and in 1986
prompted the Vatican to issue new guidelines for exorcism to regain
control. Rome also encouraged bishops to name more authorized
exorcists.
</P>
<P>
   But Satan apparently managed to sow his discord in the Vatican,
which has yet to reach agreement over a new text that defines
``demonic possession'' and includes a new, more modern exorcism
ritual.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the archfiend may be making strides in France. A 1986
poll found that 25 percent of the French believed in the existence
of the devil, but in 1995 the figure had jumped to 34 percent.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Nicolas was doing what he usually does, listening to
people in his small glass side-chapel, placing his hands on theirs,
saying a short prayer. He uses his own text, he says, including
words like ``freeing from evil influence.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside his chapel, two young men from Martinique and two older
Frenchwomen waited. They said Nicolas had helped them before.
Earlier that day, the priest said he had seen a young man who was
very disturbed because he and his girlfriend had joined a satanic
sect and joined their blood as they devoted themselves to an evil
spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not everything, though, is about anguish,'' the exorcist went
on, recalling a recent visit by a woman who told him she was
hearing voices. She said a male voice was speaking to her that very
moment. So Nicolas asked what he was saying.
</P>
<P>
   She replied: ``He says you are a jerk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' the priest said, with one of his broad smiles, ``I
told her, `That voice may well be right.'''

NO MISMATCH: ARGENTINA DEFEATS JAPAN, 1-0 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOULOUSE, France _ It was halftime, and though Japan was already
trailing Argentina, 1-0, it was still a seller's market on the road
leading to the municipal stadium here.
</P>
<P>
   About 10,000 Japanese fans, some of whom had paid scalpers more
than $1,000 a ticket on Saturday, were already inside and cheering
louder than their Argentine rivals. But outside, there were still
hundreds of Japanese hoping to find a way into their nation's
first-ever World Cup match.
</P>
<P>
   Some were sitting on the sidewalk and holding up crumpled signs
in English or French: ``Want ticket,'' ``Cherche place.'' Others
with more energy and hope continued to question any pedestrian they
could find. But in the end, supply would not catch up with demand,
and Japan would not catch up with Argentina, either.
</P>
<P>
   The goal that striker Gabriel Batistuta scored in the 28th
minute Sunday would be the only goal of the afternoon, and it would
leave Argentina with three valuable points in Group H and Japan
with regrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't have any great sentimental feeling about this
being our first World Cup match,'' said the Japanese coach, Takeshi
Okada. ``We all knew that Argentina was stronger than us, but we
all believed we still had the possibility to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Argentina had more chances to score Sunday and was much less
hesitant to shoot in general, but this was no lopsided match
between a South American powerhouse and an overmatched Asian team.
Japan's national team is solid, and the influence of the many
Brazilians who have played and coached in Japan's domestic league
means that Japanese stars like 21-year-old midfielder Hidetoshi
Nakata also know how to please a crowd.
</P>
<P>
   What Japan lacked Sunday was not the ability to defend, pass,
dribble or cover ground in a hurry (``they run, run, run,'' said
Argentina midfielder Juan Veron). Rather, it was the ability to
finish, and that is what Batistuta still does as well as anyone in
the world, with the possible exception of a Brazilian named
Ronaldo.
</P>
<P>
   Since leaving Argentina for the Italian first division in 1991,
Batistuta, 29, has scored more than 100 goals for his club,
Fiorentina. Though Argentina's coach, Daniel Passarella, chose to
leave him off the national team for much of 1997, citing tactical
concerns, the perplexed Batistuta ultimately decided against
striking back and withdrawing his name from contention. After
Passarella brought him back on the team in March, he arrived in
Toulouse as his nation's career leading scorer with 38 goals.
</P>
<P>
   He scored his 39th after a forward pass ricocheted off
midfielder Hiroshi Nanami and bounced free in the penalty area.
Batistuta quickly took control of the ball and, with a ruthlessly
efficient swipe of his right foot, pushed it over the outstretched
legs of the sliding goalkeeper Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a young team,'' Batistuta said, ``and we needed to
break the ice.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Only one of Argentina's starters Sunday was over 30 _ defender
Roberto Sensini _ but it is not an inexperienced side. Batistuta,
Sensini and midfielders Ariel Ortega and Diego Simeone were all
members of the Argentine team that began the last World Cup
auspiciously by winning its first two matches. But after Diego
Maradona was expelled from the competition after testing positive
for ephedrine, the destabilized Argentines failed to win another
match.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very difficult for all of us to recover after the shock
of Maradona's suspension,'' Batistuta said recently.
</P>
<P>
   The Maradona era is finally over in Argentina. For the first
time since 1978, he is not playing for his nation in the World Cup.
Yet despite all the embarrassment he has caused his country and
sport in recent years, there were still adoring banners hanging
from the stands in Toulouse, declaring in Spanish, ``Diego, thanks
for everything'' and ``Maradona. There will never be another like
you.''
</P>
<P>
   The Argentine who now wears No. 10 is Ortega. Like Maradona, he
is small and fast and technically gifted, but despite some flashes
Sunday, the moments when he was most reminiscent of Maradona were
when he was being hacked or pushed to the ground by the
hard-tackling Japanese. But this World Cup is trying to be kinder
to creative players than World Cups past, and the Japanese paid for
their aggression by being called for 35 fouls and receiving three
yellow cards.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese still have much to learn about the world's most
popular game, but they and their enthusiastic fans are clearly
learning fast. The last time Japan played Argentina was in January
1995 in the Confederation Cup. It lost, 5-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Japan can play better than it did today,'' Passarella
said. ``But I know that Argentina can play better, too. The first
match is often one of the hardest, and we got what we wanted: three
points.''

U.N. CONFERENCE TO CONSIDER ESTABLISHING COURT FOR CRIMES AGAINST
HUMANITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ In one of the most ambitious efforts ever undertaken to
extend the rule of international law, the United Nations will open
a conference here Monday to thrash out rules for an international
court to prosecute crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations envisions a kind of global Nuremberg _ a
permanent court where individuals accused of atrocities and
genocide can be tried and punished. But even before legal experts
and delegates from 156 countries begin debating the fine points at
the monthlong conference, the most basic issues of jurisdiction and
accountability remain deeply contested.
</P>
<P>
   On one side, the United States and other nations hope to rein in
the court's prosecutorial scope. While supporting the notion of an
international criminal court where a leader like the late Pol Pot
or Saddam Hussein could be held accountable for their actions,
Washington wants to limit the prosecutors' independence.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, and most particularly, the Pentagon,
fears that unless the court is in some way answerable to the
world's leading democracies, American soldiers around the globe
could be hauled before international judges on politically
motivated charges.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council _ the
United States, China, France and Russia _ want the council to
decide which cases should be prosecuted. Only Britain, the fifth
member, does not.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, at least 42 nations in what has been called
the ``like-minded group'' are battling for a completely independent
court, arguing that unless the court and its prosecutors are free
from interference from the Security Council, its authority would be
toothless.
</P>
<P>
   The view for a strong court is supported by many in the U.N.
leadership as well as 260 non-governmental groups and human rights
associations, which are already in town lobbying intensely to keep
the United States and other countries with reservations from
prevailing.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian government, which is spending $3 million to sponsor
the event, and the city of Rome, which is its official host, are
keeping up the pressure with giant welcome signs all over the city
that say ``We expect concrete results.''
</P>
<P>
   It has taken 50 years for the United Nations to get this far
toward a criminal court. (The existing World Court, a U.N.
institution in The Hague, Netherlands, formally known as the
International Court of Justice, rules on disputes between
countries.)
</P>
<P>
   In 1948, the General Assembly created a commission to examine
the establishment of an international court modeled on those at
Nuremberg and in Japan after World War II. The cold war made
consensus impossible.
</P>
<P>
   But after Communism collapsed across Eastern Europe and the
Soviet Union, the proposal resurfaced in earnest as brutal ethnic
and religious conflicts exploded around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Prodded by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, the Security
Council set up in 1993 an ad hoc tribunal in the Hague that is
trying people accused of war crimes in the Balkans. In 1994, a
similar ad hoc international tribunal was set up in Tanzania to try
people charged with taking part in the genocide in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   But a permanent court of independent judges with broad powers to
indict and prosecute _ without the Security Council's blessing _
has raised doubts in the State Department and the Pentagon. And
there is already fierce opposition in some corners of Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Helms, R-N.C., who heads the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, has vowed that any plan for an international criminal
court will be ``dead on arrival'' in the Senate unless Washington
had veto power over it.
</P>
<P>
   No country is openly opposed to the notion of an international
court. For one thing, it is difficult to argue against the basic
principle.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have seen this century is the disastrous effects of
impunity,'' said Hans Corell, The United Nations' special
representative to the conference. ``We need to have a court that
can act as a deterrent to future genocides and that can also punish
those responsible for committing them.'' On Sunday, Pope John Paul
II gave his blessing to the project.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the American resistance lies in an age-old reluctance to
surrender sovereignty. An American official, who spoke on condition
of anonymity, expressed dismay over the idealism expressed by some
proponents of the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think that if they create a court which is totally
independent, everything will work out,'' the official said.
``That's unrealistic: these things work when governments such as
the United States use their clout to make it work.'' He added, ``If
there is going to be no role at all for the Security Council, then
we have a serious problem in Rome.''
</P>
<P>
   That view has prompted charges by some nations that the United
States and other powers are pursuing a ``neo-colonial'' policy in
which they alone determine where justice is needed.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Americans are telling the world that the only
acceptable safeguard against frivolous suits is the Security
Council, that is simply a non-starter,'' said Emma Bonino, Italy's
European commissioner for humanitarian aid, who has long advocated
an international court to try grave human rights abuses. ``I cannot
believe that a major democracy with so active a peacekeeping role
would want to have an image of insisting that its soldiers be given
license never to be investigated.''
</P>
<P>
   There is room for compromise. Singapore recently introduced a
proposal to allow the Security Council to stop or postone a case,
instead of deciding which ones to prosecute. State Department
officials have suggested privately that the Singapore option could
be acceptable to the United States. But related issues remain
contentious, like whether the court's prosecutors would retain the
right to investigate charges even after the Security Council had
delayed a trial.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the court's independence, including Canada and
Argentina, argue that the proposed treaty already has sufficient
safeguards to protect the United States or its allies from
politically motivated prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   Dismissing American concerns about risks to its own servicemen
as ``specious,'' Canada's foreign minister, Lloyd Axworthy,
described American policy as ``an exercise in realpolitik.'' He
said that ``there is a real danger that we create a court to
satisfy our consciences, but it will be a court without power,
teeth or reach.''
</P>
<P>
   The mechanisms for setting a trial in motion are deeply
disputed. Some countries, including France, have argued in favor of
``state consent,'' whereby a country whose citizens are charged
with war crimes or other atrocities would have to consent before a
trial could take place. This is viewed by court proponents as
fatally obstructionist _ for example, Saddam Hussein would have to
give his consent before the court could investigate charges that
Iraq committed genocide against the Kurds. The United States has
not yet stated its position, leaving Washington the option of
supporting such a measure if it is dissatisfied with the way the
overall treaty is shaped.
</P>
<P>
   If, as expected, the conference produces a treaty, to take
effect it would have to be ratified by the parliaments of all
member nations, including the U.S. Senate. Nobody expects that to
happen any time soon. But there are risks to both sides if the
Americans choose not to sign the treaty in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Without U.S. support, the international court would lose
considerable authority. But if America refuses to take part, it
runs the risk of one day having its citizens investigated by an
international court that it does not recognize, but that has a
stamp of approval from much of the world.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At the conference, which is being held in the headquarters of
the Food and Agriculture Organization, a marble palace built by
Mussolini, the U.S. delegation has to live with the paradox that on
some key issues of the court's jurisdiction its position is closer
to that of Iraq and Pakistan than such close allies as Britain and
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   American human rights groups are among the most outspoken
critics of the U.S. position. Richard Dicker, associate counsel for
Human Rights Watch, called it ``lamentable.'' Dicker said, ``The
Clinton administration wants to see a court emerge, as long as it
is a court they can control.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other critical issues to be resolved. Though there is
broad consensus that the court should step in only when national
courts cannot or will not, and then only on major charges like
genocide, there are loopholes in the draft treaty.
</P>
<P>
   For example, it leaves open the possibility for the court to
prosecute the crime of ``aggression,'' which in the U.S. view could
be used by judges to prosecute American soldiers engaged in
military missions. Most legal experts predict the aggression clause
will be dropped, but it is one of hundreds of articles in the draft
that will have to be hashed out before a treaty can be produced by
the close of the conference on July 17.
</P>
<P>
   Not even the most optimistic delegates expect the next month to
go smoothly. ``If we look into the future, cooperation with an
international criminal court should be just as natural as obeying
rules of international civil aviation and the postal service,''
Correll, the U.N. representative, said. ``For humanity's sake we
need to cooperate, but of course, politically, it is not so easy to
come to an understanding.''

COMMENTARY: BULLIES AT THE BORDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Double parentheses in 5th graf should be set as brackets.)  
(lb) 
 By ANTHONY LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Zdenek Geres is a young Czech who for years wanted to visit the
United States. He managed to save about $2,000, got a U.S. visa and
joined two acquaintances who were going to Florida for a holiday.
In March they flew to Atlanta. There an officer of the Immigration
and Naturalization Service took Geres to a room and questioned him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The name of the officer was Clinton,'' Geres said in a
statement. ``He had a badge with that name. He told me that he was
the brother of President Clinton, that he was speaking in the name
of the American people and that he had the right to lock me in
prison if I were to lie to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I answered every question honestly. I had nothing to hide. But
no matter what I said, he said `the computer' told him I was lying.
I told him I would go to New York to visit an American friend,
Donald Oliver, rejoin my Czech friends in Florida and return to our
country. The `computer' told Officer Clinton this was a lie. I
asked if I could call Donald in New York so he could confirm what I
was saying, but I was refused this request.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Clinton accused me of coming to the U.S. to look for work.
He told me that because he already `knew' the truth, I had only two
options: to confess, whereupon I would be free to go back home on
the next flight, or not to confess, whereupon I would be put in
jail for three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to tell him that I had a job in the Czech Republic,
that my job awaited my return and that I was on vacation and really
wanted a vacation. Mr. Clinton told me he knew `for sure' that I
was going to work ((in the U.S.)) cleaning the floors of some big
store or warehouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Under what they said was similar pressure, Geres' two companions
``confessed'' _ falsely, they maintain _ that they wanted to work
in the United States. Geres did not yield. He was a tourist, he
said, and that's all.
</P>
<P>
   The immigration officer canceled Geres' visa, barred him from
the United States for five years and put him on a plane back to
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   All that happened under the ``expedited removal'' provision of
the 1996 Immigration Act. It gives immigration agents at our border
the power to bar a person who has a valid U.S. visa but who the
agent believes will violate the visa's terms _ and to exclude him
for years. There is no appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Expedited removal'' occurs beyond the view of the courts, the
press or the American public. I know about this case because Geres'
American friend, Donald Oliver, was in Slovakia three weeks ago and
met him there.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver wrote to the district director of the INS in Atlanta,
Thomas Fischer, about the case. Fischer replied that he had
reviewed the case file and, ``Suffice it to say, there were
sufficient grounds to refuse entry.'' Geres and the other two, he
said, ``were not clearly admissible to the United States as
visitors for pleasure.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver also wrote to his congressman, Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y.
Nadler wrote to the commissioner of immigration, Doris Meissner.
She and her staff did not just brush off the complaint. They
referred the case to the internal audit bureau of the INS, which is
conducting another review.
</P>
<P>
   Could Geres have invented the account of his treatment? I think
that is highly unlikely. For one thing, there is a Clinton on the
INS staff in Atlanta _ Marvin Clinton _ and he was the agent who
questioned Geres. He has denied to his superiors that he boasted of
being the president's brother. But again, is it likely that Geres
could have made that up? Or the threat, with no legal basis, to
imprison him?
</P>
<P>
   This is by no means the only case of alleged abuse by INS agents
under the new law. Nadler said 20,000 people with visas had been
turned away under the expedited removal provision. A number have
told ugly stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``During our debate on the bill,'' Nadler said, ``everything was
directed at people who came with forged documents or none. It is
bizarre to apply the provision to someone who went to an American
consulate, answered the questions and got a visa. It is bad for our
tourist industry. And it is a terrible abuse of power. This country
should at least stand for due process.''
</P>
<P>
   Geres ended his account by saying he would still like to visit
America some day soon. ``I hope that once these facts become
known,'' he said, ``the American system of fairness and justice,
which I studied in school, will ultimately prevail.''

 &HT;    Commissioner took money after vowing not to
 &HT;    By Charles Elmore
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE _ Insurance Commissioner Bill Nelson accepted
contributions from senior State Farm officials despite a promise
not to take money from companies he regulates, a Palm Beach Post
review of campaign records shows.
</P>
<P>
   Also evident: Republicans backing challenger Tim Ireland are
taking five times as much ``soft money'' from insurance interests
as the Democrats in what promises to be the most expensive and
bruising Cabinet race of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said he would return $100 contributions from two senior
vice presidents of State Farm, the largest insurer doing business
in Florida, after the newspaper asked about them. The contributions
are legal, but Nelson, running for a second term, has voluntarily
pledged not to take any money from insurers he regulates.
</P>
<P>
   ``They slipped through the net,'' Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance companies and their officers are allowed to give no
more than $100 to a candidate for insurance commissioner. No such
limits apply on contributions to political parties, however.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP has already spent $230,000 on TV ads blaming Nelson for
rate increases up to ``300, even 400 percent'' _ charges which
Nelson dismisses as off base.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party of Florida has accepted $733,250 in
contributions from insurance interests leading to the Nov. 3
election, compared to $145,000 reported by the state Democratic
party.
</P>
<P>
   Some $164,500 of the GOP contributions came from Bankers
Insurance Group of St. Petersburg, Fla., a longtime party
supporter. The company has feuded with Nelson over regulatory
issues and once employed a private detective who admitted placing
an illegal tap on the home phone of a Nelson subordinate. Bankers
officials said they did not sanction the wiretap.
</P>
<P>
   Republican party spokesman Bob Sparks said a variety of
businesses have contributed, not just insurers, and there was no
direct link between those contributions and ads against Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no quid pro quo there,'' Sparks said. ``I don't
necessarily say we were saying in the ads that Nelson was the
industry's man. We were saying he hasn't done a good job in four
years and needs to be replaced.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson contends the GOP's acceptance of large company
contributions is significant: ``It says they are in the hip pocket
of the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican candidate Tim Ireland hopes to capitalize on public
discontent over rising property insurance rates, particularly in
South Florida. An insurance agent and former state representative,
Ireland lost by less that three percentage points to Nelson in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is going to be the Cabinet race to watch,''
Ireland said. ``Expect it to be close. Expect it to be expensive.
And I'm expecting to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Ireland called his party's ads ``a brilliant move,'' though he
conceded he might have allowed rates to rise as much as Nelson did,
or more, if that is what a free market dictated. He said he would
encourage more insurance companies to enter the market by reducing
paperwork and speeding up regulatory decisions. Eventually, he
said, competition tends to drive down prices and expand choices.
</P>
<P>
   A Florida Voter poll released this month shows Nelson, a former
U.S. congressman and astronaut, leading 43 percent to 28 percent
for Ireland, a loss of four points for Nelson since Republicans ran
ads against him in April in selected Florida markets including West
Palm Beach, Orlando and Tallahassee.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the same lead Nelson had a year ago. Republicans take
heart from their own polls, which show 70 percent agree with the
statement, ``Insurance in Florida is a mess.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican party spent nearly a quarter of a million
dollars, ``independently'' of the Ireland campaign, on TV ads
attacking Nelson for property insurance rate increases since
Hurricane Andrew. Nelson responded with ads of his own in the same
markets. He says the average increase has been 109 percent, and not
all of that came under his watch. He says the GOP-led legislature
wouldn't even hear his bill to lower rates 15 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of soft money has been evident at an unusually early
point for a Cabinet campaign. The $230,000 the state Republican
party spent on the TV ads is more than the $196,000 that Ireland
has raised on his own.
</P>
<P>
   Contributions from insurance companies, executives and agents
make up 26 percent of Ireland's total, more than twice that of
Nelson. Ireland says he proudly accepts money from the industry.
The figures include only companies with insurance in their names
and individuals who list their occupation. Givers of $100 or less
do not have to list their occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson says he accepts contributions only from agents as opposed
to insurance companies and officers. He has raised more money
overall, $1.7 million, but taken a lower percentage, 12.78, of it
from the industry.
</P>
<P>
   One of the State Farm executives who contributed to Nelson,
senior vice president Kurt G. Moser in Bloomington, Ind., said he
was not aware of Nelson's policy when he made the contribution in
September 1997. He said he was not solicited by Nelson's office.
</P>
<P>
   Another senior vice president in Bloomington, James E. Rutrough,
said he could not recall the circumstances of his gift, listed on
the same date. But he said it may have come during a trip he took
to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may have been an associate or friend of mine who was
working on someone's campaign,'' Rutrough said. He said he has
never met Nelson or anyone who works in his office.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson aide Don Pride said the $100 contributions ``were legal,
but they were not in keeping with his policy.'' They slipped
through because the list used to check the contributions failed to
list vice presidents from out of state corporations. A more
comprehensive list is in use now, Pride said.
</P>
<P>
   But Nelson does not exclude gifts from others connected to the
industry, such as attorneys, marketing firms and brokers.
</P>
<P>
   Records show Nelson accepted $5,500 in 11, $500-contributions of
$500 each from reinsurance broker E.W. Blanch of Dallas and
associated companies.
</P>
<P>
   Reinsurance is coverage that backs up insurance companies.
Blanch ``led the effort to restore capacity to the distressed
Florida property market'' after Hurricane Andrew, according to the
company's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Blanch split a $2,500 commission with another firm in 1996 for
acting as a reinsurance middleman for the state's Joint
Underwriting Association, said JUA executive director James Newman.
The firm also won business from ``three to five'' private companies
that agreed to take customers out of JUA, Newman estimated, but
said he could not immediately produce records showing how much
money Blanch made. Blanch officials did not return calls.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance agents are not clearly endorsing one candidate or
another, said Hal Marsolais, executive vice president of the
Professional Insurance Agents Association of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``A majority of people think Nelson has a good chance of winning
and want to bet on a winning horse,'' Marsolais said. ``On the
other hand, Ireland only lost by a very narrow margin last time and
a lot of people think he can overcome that margin because his name
recognition is better this time.''

<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Just as pressure is growing in the West
against the use of sweatshops in developing countries, the Asian
financial crisis is spawning such desperation that more people than
ever seem willing to take grim or dangerous jobs in such factories.
</P>
<P>
   While economic misery and differing labor standards have long
made sweatshops more prevalent in the Third World than in the West,
the trend had been toward improved working conditions. But now
scholars and labor organizers say that in Asia the trend has
sharply reversed, with the financial crisis forcing many workers to
compete for jobs that a year ago they would have scorned.
</P>
<P>
   A result is that increasing numbers of desperate workers are
lining up to take up precisely the kinds of jobs that are being
roundly condemned in the West. In the slums in Indonesia and in
Thailand, many workers even speak of sweatshop jobs as their
greatest aspiration.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the Indonesian capital, Mrs. Tratiwoon stood barefoot
recently in the vast garbage dump where she makes a living
scavenging through the rubbish and described her dreams for her
3-year-old son: She wants him to grow up to work in a sweatshop.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for Mrs. Tratiwoon, an uneducated woman who cheerfully
gave her age as ``20 or 30,'' the sweatshops in the area around the
garbage dump look so exalted now _ in the aftermath of the
financial crisis _ that she worries that a job in one for her son
might be too high an aspiration.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not going to get an education,'' said Mrs. Tratiwoon, who
like many Indonesians has just one name, ``so I don't know whether
he can ever get a job like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign against sweatshops has gained momentum in the West
in the last few years. Last month, for example, Nike Inc. bowed to
pressure and agreed to far-reaching changes in the labor practices
at the factories that churn out its shoes. Nike said it would raise
the minimum age for new workers to 16, admit outsiders to inspect
the factories, and improve air filtration to meet U.S. factory
standards.
</P>
<P>
   But market forces in Asia are pushing in precisely the opposite
direction. In recent years, the rising prosperity of countries like
Indonesia and Thailand encouraged workers to demand better
conditions and more safety, while businesses were doing well enough
that they could afford to improve conditions as a way of attracting
laborers. Now companies are trying to reduce costs to survive, and
surging unemployment means employees have lost their leverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result of the Asian economic crisis, there are lots more
people working in sweatshop conditions,'' said Lee Ji-soon, an
economics professor at Seoul National University in South Korea.
``We can get over this problem only if Asia recovers from the
crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee said governments can help by promoting free education to
reduce child labor and work to combat income disparities. But the
only way to eliminate dangerous conditions and child labor, he
emphasized, is to generate economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   There is no agreed-upon definition of a sweatshop, and so there
is no way of calculating how many people work in such places. But
scholars and social workers say that the financial crisis that
began nearly a year ago in Thailand has clearly extended the
longevity of factories that might have emerged from the pages of
Dickens.
</P>
<P>
   Mongkol Latlakorn, a 36-year-old laborer doing odd jobs in
northeast Thailand, said he worried about his youngest child,
Darin. She is working in a tiny sweatshop in Bangkok, the Thai
capital, making clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's dangerous work,'' Mongkol said. ``There's lots of
machinery, and sometimes it catches her hands. Twice the needles in
the machines went right through her hands. But the managers
bandaged up her hands, and both times she got better again and went
back to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Mongkol said that Darin, who is 15, works nine hours a day, six
days a week, and earns $2 a day. That is a considerable sum in the
slums, where a meal of street food can be had for about 25 cents,
and it is more than he earns from his odd jobs. So he worries not
so much about the possibility that Darin might get hurt as about
the risk that she might lose the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's all this talk about factories closing now, and she
said there are rumors that her factory might close,'' Mongkol said.
``I hope that doesn't happen. I don't know what she would do
then.''
</P>
<P>
   Some economists say the campaigns in the West against sweatshops
do have an impact on the workers lucky enough to be making branded
American merchandise. But for a great majority of Asia's labor
force the dominant reality is not the success of the campaigns
against sweatshops but the scarcity of jobs. Unemployment in the
nine countries most affected by the Asian crisis is expected to
reach 21 million this year, including 10 million in Indonesia
alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``On issues such as safety standards and health standards, the
governments may wink at violations now,'' said a longtime Western
analyst in Thailand. ``It's better to have an unsafe job than no
job at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The main problems, most experts say, are with locally owned
companies, particularly those that do not produce well-known
American brands. There is no evidence that well-known Western
companies are taking advantage of the crisis to take shortcuts on
safety standards.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Broadfoot, managing director of Political &AMP; Economic Risk
Consultancy in Hong Kong, said the pain of the crisis and the rise
of nationalistic sensitivities has made foreign companies very
careful to avoid criticism. ``If you're a foreign company
navigating the environment today, you don't want to be perceived as
a sweatshop,'' he said.

 JAKARTA, Indonesia: he said. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The most troublesome labor conditions often arise in small,
locally owned businesses far from a capital. They are places like
the sawmill where Sariman, a muscular man who says his age is
``maybe 40,'' worked in the city of Gresik, 400 miles east of
Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   Sariman moved from his village to Gresik a few years ago and
took a job as a day laborer. Because he was paid by how much he
did, he chose to work long hours, often from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m.,
earning the equivalent of about $3 a day. Then last year, he was
lifting beams when one slipped and shattered his left leg.
</P>
<P>
   The factory paid Sariman $50 in compensation, but since he was
not a regular employee it refused to pay his medical bills. Friends
carried him to the hospital, but the doctor said treatment would
cost almost $200.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't afford that, so I went home,'' Sariman recalled. He
went to a traditional healer, but ended up paying more than $150 in
medical expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Now Sariman is better, but he walks with a limp and will never
be able to do hard physical work again. So he sells fruit from a
pushcart and earns less than $1 a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not mad at the factory,'' he said, as he sat on a bench
outside his home. ``It was an accident, and nobody wants an
accident to happen. It wouldn't be good to get mad at them unless
they didn't try to help at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Sariman said he still thinks it was worthwhile to work
in the factory. ``There's no work in the village, and you only get
a harvest once a year,'' he said. ``What if your harvest is bad?''
</P>
<P>
   Sariman's standard of comparison is a common one. Indeed, the
term ``sweatshop'' is a bit of a misnomer, for the work often
involves much less perspiration than hoeing the fields or wading in
the paddies.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, from the perspective of garbage scavengers like Mrs.
Tratiwoon, who live day by day surrounded by the filth of the dump,
even a dangerous job in a dismal factory would mark one rung up the
ladder for her son.
</P>
<P>
   Employees often complain about the dreariness of their work or
the harshness of their supervisors. But these days the talk usually
turns not to the wretchedness of the work but the difficulty in
finding it.
</P>
<P>
   Some labor organizers say that accidents and resentment may
eventually create more momentum for labor unions. ``The workers
here may become so indignant that they become more active,'' said
one Indonesian labor activist.
</P>
<P>
   Because many economists say that the key to improving conditions
lies in boosting economic growth, some say that the best thing that
the United States could do would be to insure that its markets
remain open _ or open further _ to products made in poor countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you in America are really concerned with working conditions
in poor countries, maybe the best way to help would be to import
their products more freely,'' said Lee, the South Korean professor.
</P>
<P>
   American unions have resisted this, arguing in part that it is
difficult for American laborers to compete with the cheap wages
abroad. Indeed, the economics of factory work in Asia is dizzying.
</P>
<P>
   In Gresik, a middle-aged peasant woman named Mrs. Misri makes
sarongs six days a week on a heavy hand loom, earning about 42
cents a day for hard work on something that looks like a fiendishly
efficient exercise machine. Mrs. Misri sleeps free on the factory
floor, but she pays 20 cents a day for street food and 90 cents for
a weekly round-trip bus ride to her village to spend Sunday with
her husband and children.
</P>
<P>
   A result is that when she does not buy clothing or have medical
expenses, she can take home 42 cents to help the children go to
school and buy food. It does not sound like much for a week's hard
work, but if she were home in the village she would probably earn
nothing at all.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Mrs. Misri's wages are on the high side, because her
work takes skill and is physically exhausting.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hanifa, 48, runs a nearby factory in her home and employs
10 women to make red plaid dresses for little girls. She said she
pays her best employees about 35 cents a day, but she declined to
say how much she paid her worst employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are tough times,'' Mrs. Hanifa lamented. ``It's hard for
anyone to make money. And I'm paying good wages, at least for
around here.''

IN NORTHEAST, BILINGUAL EDUCATION IS STILL GOING STRONG 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., N.J., Conn., Calif.)  (lh) 
 By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ As California prepares to dismantle bilingual
education for immigrant children, New York, New Jersey and
Connecticut are moving in the opposite direction, with plans to
improve and even expand bilingual and intensive English programs in
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   One day after Californians voted last week to effectively end
the instruction of immigrant children in their native languages,
education officials in New Jersey approved new rules meant to
strengthen it, including one that would allow bilingual classes for
children as young as 3. And in New York, education officials are
planning to train more bilingual teachers and allow some students
to take college-preparatory examinations in their native languages.
</P>
<P>
   But while education officials in both states fiercely defend
bilingual education, they also agree with critics who say that many
students learn English too slowly. That is a particular concern in
New York City, where educators, politicians and parents have
debated for decades whether bilingual programs help or hinder the
mainstreaming of immigrant children.
</P>
<P>
   The debate has spread to Connecticut, where the legislature
recently appointed a task force to evaluate bilingual programs and
determine whether students were spending too much time in them. But
instead of limiting the time that students can spend in bilingual
programs, Connecticut will probably experiment with programs that
have worked in other states, task force members said.
</P>
<P>
   While New York and New Jersey have a history of providing
generously for immigrants, educators in both states say their
embrace of bilingual education is more pragmatic than
philosophical. Both states are introducing new curriculum standards
and more rigorous standardized tests, so immigrant students need to
learn English more quickly and thoroughly, the educators said. At
the same time, they said, many students need to study mathematics,
science and social studies in their native languages to grasp the
subject matter and meet the tougher standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no longer enough to finish a bilingual education program
and have marginal skills,'' said Richard P. Mills, New York's state
education commissioner. ``The expectations are now much higher. So
we're having a very focused effort to understand what works out
there and what doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   While the move to eliminate bilingual education in California
has rekindled the debate here, people on both sides say bilingual
education has had so many ardent defenders in the New York
metropolitan region, for so many years, that it is in no danger of
extinction. The teachers unions in the region are more united in
their support of bilingual education than those in California. And
advocacy groups for immigrants, which have waged successful court
battles to expand bilingual education in New York, have worked
consistently over the years to win parents and politicians to their
cause.
</P>
<P>
   This in stark contrast to California, where the rejection of
bilingual education is one of several recent initiatives that have
put immigrants and their supporters on the defensive. Politicians
in the Northeast have been less inclined to play to anti-immigrant
sentiments, and the champions of bilingual schooling say there is
no reason to expect things to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a totally different atmosphere out here, with divisive
policies and leadership on issues related to race and education,''
said Thomas Saenz, a lawyer for the Mexican-American Legal Defense
Fund, which fought to preserve bilingual education in California.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of bilingual education say it is on safer ground in New
York, New Jersey and Connecticut not only because of its vocal
supporters in the region but also because the three states do not
allow voters to decide education policy through referendums, as
California does.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legislators would have to take on the teachers' unions,
which they hardly ever do, and on top of that, they'd have to take
on the ethnic groups,'' said Jorge Amselle, a spokesman for the
Center for Equal Opportunity in Washington, a conservative research
organization that is opposed to bilingual education. ``The only
time you're going to see serious change in the Northeast is when
you see big grass-roots efforts that will serve as cover for
legislators who want the change.''

</P>
<P>
   Californians passed Proposition 227, which limits help for
non-native speakers to a year of intensive English instruction,
with 61 percent of the vote. But while a growing number of that
state's Hispanic immigrants have expressed deep concerns about
bilingual education, fewer than 4-in-10 of those who voted favored
the proposition, in part because most of California's Hispanic
lawmakers lobbied heavily against it.
</P>
<P>
   Still, immigrant parents in California have protested more
aggressively than those in the Northeast, who have yet to speak
with a unified voice on the issue. Critics of bilingual education
say that while many parents in the Northeast are convinced that it
slows their children's progress in English, they are loath to
challenge advocacy groups and educators.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parents get intimidated when so-called experts tell them
bilingual education is the right thing to do,'' said Sister Kathy
Maire, an organizer for East Brooklyn Congregations who helped a
group of immigrant parents file an unsuccessful lawsuit to curtail
bilingual education in New York state in 1996. ``But it's very fair
to say they understand that their kids are not learning English.
And it's very fair to say they are greatly disturbed.''
</P>
<P>
   The renewed attention to bilingual education comes as immigrant
populations in all three states are growing and school districts
are struggling to find enough certified bilingual instructors. New
York, where 18.7 percent of the population is foreign born,
compared with 25.1 percent in California, spends $88 million a year
on bilingual education for 194,000 students, most of whom live in
New York City.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey, where 15.6 percent of the population is foreign
born, spends $57 million a year on bilingual programs for 48,000
students. About 9 percent of the population is foreign born in
Connecticut, which spends $20 million a year on bilingual education
for 19,300 students.
</P>
<P>
   In all three states, the vast majority of students in bilingual
programs are Hispanic. Mandarin Chinese, Haitian, Korean, Polish,
Arabic, Portuguese and Urdu are also among the most common native
languages.
</P>
<P>
   Of the three states, New Jersey has taken the most concrete
steps toward improving and expanding bilingual and intensive
English programs. On June 3, the New Jersey Board of Education
voted to require school districts to monitor the achievement of
bilingual students to ensure that they meet the state's new
curriculum standards. It also voted to require districts to provide
bilingual or intensive English programs for preschool pupils not
proficient in English.
</P>
<P>
   The board also changed the wording of the state's bilingual
education code to encourage districts to provide instruction in
English as a second language for more than 150 minutes a week,
which is the minimum requirement in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Iliana Okum, who oversees bilingual education for the New Jersey
Department of Education, said the state's programs worked because
more than 90 percent of the bilingual students passed proficiency
tests in three years or less. Although the state in 1996 gave
parents more leeway in deciding whether to remove their children
from bilingual programs, less than 2 percent of the parents have
done so, Ms. Okum said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody is generally pleased,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the state Board of Regents voted last year to allow
students who enter the country in the ninth grade or later to take
most Regents exams in their native language. It also voted to
require bilingual students to take the Regents English exam in
English. Mills, the education commissioner, appointed a task force
last fall to determine whether bilingual students needed more
intensive English instruction to meet the new curriculum standards
and graduation requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ``The increase in requirements is humongous for somebody who is
learning English for the first time,'' said Alan Ray, a spokesman
for the state's Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   The task force will submit recommendations to the Board of
Regents next month, and Mills said they would probably include
increasing the minimum amount of time _ currently 180 minutes per
week _ that bilingual students spend in intensive English classes.
Other goals are to train bilingual teachers in the new curriculum
standards and to increase the number of teachers certified to teach
bilingual classes. Only 30 percent of the bilingual teachers are
now certified as such, Mills said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that while some students, particularly at the
middle-school level, were staying in bilingual programs far too
long, most finished in three years or less. Students who want to
stay in bilingual programs longer than three years must file for an
extension, and in the 1997-98 school year, only 12 percent of
bilingual students in New York City did so, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mills said he thought that California's strategy in Proposition
227 was ``a sound-bite solution.'' By examining bilingual programs
around the nation, he said, New York hopes to collect enough data
to determine what methods of teaching English work best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not satisfied with the data we have,'' Mills said.
``Bilingual education seems to work under certain circumstances,
but they are very demanding conditions. We have an obligation to
think this through because children who don't speak English, like
other children, must meet higher standards.''

<P>
   KEELER, Calif. _ ``It's not that you can't breathe,'' said Mark
McCall, with gallows humor befitting a prematurely grizzled
49-year-old resident of this dusty village in the Owens Valley.
``You just don't want to.''
</P>
<P>
   McCall's back yard abuts the dry bed of Owens Lake, a crusty
lunar landscape of brackish pools and flaky salts and toxins that
is the worst source of airborne pollution in the United States. The
parched patch of 110 square miles is all that is left in the center
of a once-fertile farming and mining community. Even the talc mill
where McCall once worked is closed, and he is unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   There is not the slightest mystery about where the water went:
For 85 years, gravity has pulled it through a a 223-mile man-made
aqueduct to build and sustain the artificially verdant sprawl of
Los Angeles, and today it still supplies just over half the water
for the United States' second-largest city.
</P>
<P>
   But for the first time in the history of the longest-running
water war in the West, Los Angeles, under intense pressure from
state and federal regulators, may be forced to put some of the
water back to help control dust storms that can carry 20 times the
particle pollution allowed by federal law. That would be a
precedent-shattering concession of complicity in one of the most
celebrated water grabs of all time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that this is sort of David and Goliath meets
`Chinatown,''' said Ellen Hardebeck, air-pollution-control officer
of the Great Basin Unified Air Pollution Control District, the
state-chartered agency here that last year ordered Los Angeles to
cover about one-third of the lake bed, partly with water, partly
with 4 inches of gravel, and partly with vegetation, in an effort
to hold down the dust.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the struggle is the stuff of legend, and Ms. Hardebeck
was referring to the classic 1974 movie. ``Chinatown'' was inspired
by the stealthy _ though legal _ efforts of Los Angeles city
fathers to buy up land and water rights here in the early years of
the century so the city could expand into land that they were
buying up outside Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   When William Mulholland, the visionary Los Angeles water czar
who saw the potential of the Owens River's mountain runoff,
officially opened the Los Angeles Aqueduct in 1913, he watched the
water gush down into the San Fernando Valley, then on the far
northern outskirts of his fledgling city, and proclaimed in what
remain fighting words here to this day: ``There it is. Take it.''
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1920s, Los Angeles was taking so much water that the
lake dried up, and, not surprisingly, the city has resisted giving
the water back. In December, it offered a counterproposal to do
less than half of what the Owens Valley wants. When officials here
rejected that, the city appealed to the state Air Resources Board,
which has the final say because the state owns the lake bed.
</P>
<P>
   The board took no action at its meeting last month and gave
negotiators for the valley and city until the next board meeting,
on June 25, to try to reach a compromise. If a state-approved plan
is not in place by fall 1999, the federal Environmental Protection
Agency has vowed to impose its own plan for bringing pollution
within acceptable levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, we have a responsibility to deal with the problem,''
said Gerald Gewe, executive assistant to the director of water
services for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. ``But
it's not a problem that was created overnight or that's going to be
solved overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials from both sides spent the end of this week in secret
negotiations, and the outcome is hard to predict. But their last
public positions were far apart, and the staff of the State Air
Resources Board has recommended a ruling in favor of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The staff did not feel that Great Basin's modeling work in
tests for the plan was really sufficient,'' said Allan Hirsch, a
spokesman for the board. The staff questioned whether there was
enough proof that the plan would reduce pollution.
</P>
<P>
   The basic problem is not in dispute. On most days, the air here
is splendidly clear, with breathtaking views across the valley to
Mount Whitney, at 14,496 feet the highest point in the contiguous
48 states, and in summer, the lake bed is as hard and dry as
concrete.
</P>
<P>
   But on some two dozen days a year, mostly in spring and fall,
residual moisture makes the lake's crust churn into crystals that
become a whirlwind _ of fine clay particles, salts, arsenic and
other substances deposited over geologic time _ covering cars,
seeping through windows and threatening the lungs of perhaps 40,000
area residents. The rough grass that fills McCall's yard is so
sharp, he said, ``that you can't walk barefoot; it's like razor
wire.''
</P>
<P>
   The trouble has come in agreeing on a solution. A 1983 law
requires Los Angeles to take ``reasonable'' measures, but city and
valley officials have distinctly different views of what that
means.
</P>
<P>
   In its order, Great Basin proposed treating the worst 35 square
miles of the lake with the mix of gravel, vegetation and water,
which it estimated would take about 50,000 acre-feet of water a
year, or about 15 percent of what the city takes from the valley
each year. An acre-foot is the amount needed to cover an acre of
land a foot deep, or about 325,000 gallons.
</P>
<P>
   After six months of negotiations, Los Angeles countered last
December with an offer to work on nine square miles, requiring
about 20,000 acre-feet of water, with a promise to assess its
progress and make adjustments after three years.
</P>
<P>
   The city says the valley's proposal would cost it $58 million a
year to replace Owens Valley water with other sources, probably
from the Sacramento Delta in the north, and to finance operations
at the lake, along with $25 million annual debt service on the
capital improvements that would be needed to put the plan in place.
</P>
<P>
   Gewe of the Los Angeles water agency said that would mean a
total cost of $75 million to $80 million a year out of the agency's
overall revenues of about $400 million, and he warned that such
increases would have to be passed on to customers in Los Angeles.
``That's a pretty significant hit,'' Gewe said. ``But my concern is
that it has not been demonstrated that these measures will work,
and then we've got to spend even more money trying to find a
solution.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Great Basin officials here contend that they are proposing
simple measures, ones that mimic the natural geologic processes of
nature. They say they have tested and rejected everything,
including spraying chemicals (environmentally unsound), rigging
sprinklers (the dust clogs them) and building low walls of sand as
windbreaks (wind patterns are hard to predict).
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tested a lot of things out there and some of them were
pretty pie in the sky,'' said Theodore Schade, the engineer who is
the Owens Lake project manager for Great Basin. ``The lake has been
dry since the mid-'20s, and in that time, there are some limited
areas that are starting to repair themselves, and generally by the
mechanisms we're proposing, through some natural revegetation over
time, for example.''
</P>
<P>
   Schade acknowledged that the sheer scale of the problem makes it
daunting. ``It's the size and the money,'' he said. ``If this was
somebody's vacant lot, they would just go out and fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gewe, the Los Angeles official, suggests one possible area of
compromise by noting that there may be substantial nondrinkable
groundwater percolating below the lake that could be pumped up to
help carry out some of the valley's proposed solutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to go forward in a phased approach that doesn't write
a blank check,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Hardebeck of Great Basin is impatient with such talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The district and the city have been jointly studying this
problem since 1979, so when they say, `We don't know enough,' or
`We need to study some more,' how long is long enough?''
</P>
<P>
   For all the intensity of the debate, residents here remain
skeptical that big changes will come. After all, even their
ancestors' early efforts to dynamite the aqueduct could not keep
the water from flowing away to serve a city of millions.
</P>
<P>
   ``That lake has been dry for almost 100 years,'' said Geizel
Rice, the postmaster in Keeler, where the roadside sign says the
population is 50 but she said it is actually a bit more. ``Do you
think they're going to really put it back? I don't think they ever
will. I think it's too late.''

WHEN $10 MILLION IS IN TROUGH, FEW WANT TO OVERTURN IT

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When a single dinner in this nonpresidential
election year can fetch more than $10 million, a record, it is no
mystery why legislation to overhaul the system of campaign finance
is in deep trouble in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   At a Republican fund-raiser scheduled for Tuesday night,
Washington's convention center will be packed with an assortment of
donors including lobbyists, corporate chiefs and longtime GOP
contributors. For a table of 10 and the chance to rub elbows with
Newt Gingrich, the House speaker; Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, the
majority leader; and other Republican luminaries, an array of
Washington trade associations and corporations are happily shelling
out contributions from $10,000 to $100,000 a table.
</P>
<P>
   This feast of money comes as the House debates legislation to
overhaul the way political campaigns are financed, and some of the
proposals would substantially slow the money chase in Washington.
Gingrich and his leadership team oppose the two major House
proposals, which would effectively ban the large, unregulated
contributions to political parties known as soft money. The Senate
has already killed similar proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Without unregulated contributions, which often come in single
$100,000 checks from big donors, it would be much harder for the
two parties to stage multimillion-dollar dinners like Tuesday's
because they would be limited to smaller contributions from
individuals and political action committees that are restricted
under the federal election laws.
</P>
<P>
   Prospects for passage of any far-reaching bill to overhaul the
campaign finance laws this year are extremely dim. The issue would
already have been declared dead if Gingrich had not reluctantly
allowed House debate after a rebellion was threatened among the
rank and file of his own party.
</P>
<P>
   As Tuesday's dinner proves, the campaign finance system, though
much-criticized and shot through with loopholes, works very well
for the GOP House leaders, who are counting on their financial edge
over their counterparts in the Democratic Party to preserve their
congressional majority in the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   The dinner's chairman, Armey, hit his $10 million goal a week
early in a blitz of check-collecting described as ``awesome'' by
Mary Crawford, spokeswoman for the National Republican
Congressional Committee, which will receive half of the dinner's
proceeds (the other half goes to Senate Republicans).
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there have been bigger one-night hauls: President
Clinton raised $12 million at a Democratic event in the fall of
1996 and the Republicans raised $15 million at a gala they held in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   For the past two months, Armey has spent at least one full day a
week dialing for dollars from the headquarters of the National
Republican Congressional Committee, just steps from the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's worked his tail off,'' Ms. Crawford said. Raising all
this money not only helps the Republican Party but also fortifies
Armey's political network. To remain politically competitive in
Washington these days, the congressional leaders must each build
fully diversified fund-raising machines.
</P>
<P>
   Armey also signed thousands of fund-raising letters. While
appealing for ``a generous contribution of $2,000, $1,000 or
$500,'' Armey's letters promised that Republicans would simplify
the tax code, keep the military strong and ``provide high moral and
ethical standards as leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority whip, is also ``pounding
the phones,'' said an aide, Michael Scanlon. Gingrich and Rep. John
Boehner, R-Ohio, who is chairman of the House Republican
Conference, have also been making a flurry of fund-raising calls,
as have several GOP committee chairmen.
</P>
<P>
   In last year's congressional inquiry into fund-raising abuses in
the 1996 election, both Clinton and Vice President Al Gore were
sharply criticized for telephoning donors. Although it is common
practice for House and Senate Democrats and Republicans to place
calls to donors, some election law watchdogs said it was unseemly
for Armey and others who controlled the House's legislative agenda
to put the arm on contributors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is inappropriate and dangerous,'' said Fred Wertheimer,
president of Democracy 21, a nonpartisan group in Washington that
advocates political reform. ``This has the exact same kind of
dangers for influence-buying that people raised about President
Clinton and Vice President Gore's calls.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Crawford responded that ``it's silly to say members
shouldn't make calls.'' Michelle Davis, Armey's spokeswoman, said
that once he agreed to be the chairman of the dinner he had to hit
the phones. Armey declined to provide the names of corporations and
other donors he had called.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress are prohibited from soliciting donations in
the Capitol, but the rule is little more than a minor
inconvenience. The four House leaders, for example, have separate
offices near the Capitol that house their extensive political and
fund-raising operations.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich is the model. Before the Republicans succeeded in
wresting control of the House in 1994, he had built a formidable
fund-raising operation, using his re-election fund and GOPAC, a
political action committee, to raise millions of dollars for
himself and other Republican House and state-level candidates.
Although Gingrich is no longer affiliated with GOPAC, he is
chairman of a new PAC, called Monday Morning, which has raised
$341,000 for the 1998 elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still the chief fund-raiser in the party,'' a Gingrich
aide, Michael Shields, said.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, Armey, DeLay and Boehner all oppose the more sweeping
campaign overhaul bills, each for slightly different reasons.
Gingrich and DeLay worry that the bills trample on political free
speech. Armey and Boehner oppose cutting back on corporate
contributions without limiting the financial power of labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   But these concerns are overshadowed by a simple truth: under the
current election laws, the Republicans enjoy a big financial edge
over the Democrats. For the 1998 congressional elections,
Republican Party committees have raised $204 million to the
Democrats' $125 million.
</P>
<P>
   And the House leaders each make out well under the current
campaign finance system because they can raise large amounts of
federal contributions for their re-election campaigns and
leadership PAC's and unregulated money for the party committees.
</P>
<P>
   So far in 1998, Gingrich has raised $3.8 million for his
re-election, Armey $1.6 million, DeLay $747,000 and Boehner
$650,000. Each has a relatively safe seat.
</P>
<P>
   Like Gingrich, the three other GOP House leaders have their own
leadership PAC's. Boehner's Freedom Project has raised $545,429,
Armey's Majority Leader's Fund has collected $519,682, and DeLay's
Americans for a Republican Majority has taken in $370,000,
according to Federal Election Commission records.
</P>
<P>
   After a year of tense infighting on Gingrich's team, these PAC's
give each leader a fund to dispense campaign money to political
friends and shore up their allies for future House leadership
contests. Should Gingrich relinquish the post to run for president,
Armey, DeLay and Boehner are all interested in moving up the
leadership chain.
</P>
<P>
   And Rep. Robert Livingston of Louisiana, the appropriations
chairman who is also angling to be speaker one day, recently
launched his own leadership PAC. Other Democrats and Republicans in
the House and Senate also have leadership PAC's and an early
compromise left them untouched in the current campaign finance
overhaul bills being debated.
</P>
<P>
   The House leaders also are chief fund raisers for the National
Republican Congressional Committee, which has collected $42 million
for the 1998 elections, compared with $18.5 million for the
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Contributors, meanwhile, feel obliged to give generous amounts
to all of these fund-raising committees. With vital issues before
the House, many cannot afford to say no when asked to give.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a logical target,'' said Bill McCloskey, director of
media relations for BellSouth, which forked over $70,000 for
Tuesday's dinner and has made generous donations to the leadership
PAC's and campaign committees of all the GOP House leaders. ``We're
active on all kinds of issues,'' McCloskey said. ``That gets us
buttonholed. If one didn't put the arm on us, someone else would
have.'' BellSouth has also given big contributions to the
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association is a $100,000 dinner
contributor and has also contributed to all the election funds
affiliated with the GOP House leaders. Blue Cross is fighting
legislation to overhaul managed care, a bill the House leadership
opposed. A spokesman for Blue Cross said the company's donations
were not connected to its lobbying against the patient's rights
bill. Blue Cross also contributes to Democrats.

CONGRESS MAY LIFT BAN ON WHEAT SALE TO INDIA AND PAKISTAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., Md., Alaska, La., Wis.)  (mk) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Under pressure from farmers, the government is
poised to re-allow the sale of wheat to India and Pakistan despite
economic sanctions by the United States against those countries for
their recent nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
   Allowing wheat sales would seem to undermine Washington's moral
outrage against India and Pakistan, but a movement to skirt the
sanctions on wheat has caught on in Congress, and President Clinton
encouraged the movement on Friday as he sought greater flexibility
in exercising sanctions around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have long believed that food should not be used as a weapon
to influence other nations,'' Clinton said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Although many in Congress have denounced the nuclear explosions,
they are also sensitive to their important farm constituents as the
November elections approach. The congressional action in each house
was introduced last week by lawmakers from wheat-rich Washington
state _ Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat, and Rep. George Nethercutt
Jr., a Republican, both of whom are up for re-election. The state
sends 37 percent of its wheat to Pakistan, which pays Washington
farmers about $500 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Murray and Nethercutt introduced bills to pass a waiver that
would allow wheat _ actually, wheat credits guaranteed by the
government and extended to farmers _ to bypass the sanctions, which
are automatically imposed on a country if it tests a nuclear
device.
</P>
<P>
   The Arms Export Control Act in 1994 cuts off trade credits,
private bank loans, loans from international institutions, and loan
guarantees to American companies doing business in the country in
question.
</P>
<P>
   But increasingly, politicians and foreign-policy analysts are
questioning the value of unilateral sanctions because they can
conflict with other national interests.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions imposed last month on India and Pakistan, for
example, came at a time when 11 percent of the world wheat market
was already off-limits to American farmers because of sanctions.
(There are 57 sanctions in place against more than 30 countries.)
Wheat prices have plunged to a seven-year low because of excess
supply, in part because of improved per-acre yield techniques but
also because of reduced exports. This tension has injected a new
urgency into the eternal questions of what purpose sanctions serve
and whom they hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of interests in any one country, not just the
one issue on which sanctions are based,'' said Sidney Weintraub, a
political economist with the Center for Strategic and International
Studies at Johns Hopkins University. ``The administration is trying
to take in the full range of interests, and not giving up markets
is one of the interests.''
</P>
<P>
   The halt in American wheat credits has prompted Pakistan to buy
wheat from Australia, said Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash. Every day
that the sanctions are in place, he said on Thursday at a meeting
of the Senate Appropriations Committee, ``we'll lose sales, and
they are sales we can't recover.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, chairman of the Appropriations
Committee, quickly decreed without a vote that the committee would
seek a waiver from the full Senate, provided it did not cost
anything.
</P>
<P>
   The House Appropriations Committee had a more heated debate.
That committee voted 7-5 on Wednesday to seek the waiver over the
objections of its senior members, including Reps. Robert
Livingston, R-La., chairman of the committee, and David Obey of
Wisconsin, the top Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Many said that the United States should stand firm on its
principle of exacting a price for what it considers a moral
outrage, regardless of the cost. Others, including many in the
administration, support a more pragmatic approach. This view holds
that the United States can influence a country more through
engagement, even on a limited scale, than by isolation.
</P>
<P>
   But complicating this picture are two other factors. Although
the law mandating sanctions was passed in 1994, the regulations to
implement them were never written. The Justice Department made an
internal ruling last week, in response to a request from the
National Security Council, that the wheat credits are covered by
the sanctions and would take an act of Congress to override. Thus,
the president cannot simply declare the wheat credits allowable.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, between the House committee vote Wednesday and the
Senate committee vote Thursday, the Congressional Budget Office
estimated that lifting the sanctions against agricultural products
would cost between $30 million and $50 million in government
subsidies for credits to the farmers. Many senators, though,
questioned whether the move would cost anything.

STERN JUDGE JOHNSON RELUCTANTLY IN POLITICAL SPOTLIGHT
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By JOHN C. HENRY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   c. 1998 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If not for the black robe and the polished wooden
bench that puts her at least a head higher than anyone else in
court, Norma Holloway Johnson could be holding forth in a
classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Johnson _ a former teacher who grew up in Lake Charles,
La. _ is chief U.S. district judge in Washington where her strict
command of the courtroom and tough talk on punishment has been
compared to a trip to the principal's office.
</P>
<P>
   Until early this year, she toiled in relative obscurity,
overseeing grand juries and presiding over trials _ some involving
high-ranking public officials _ that often included stern,
finger-pointing lectures.
</P>
<P>
   Now, one of Johnson's grand juries is investigating whether
President Clinton attempted to cover up an alleged sexual
relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, and
the judge is emerging as a key, yet enigmatic, figure with a
penchant for secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the shrouded windows of her second-floor courtroom near
the Capitol, Johnson has wrestled with more decisions about the law
and the presidency than any federal judge since John Sirica dealt
with Watergate a quarter-century ago.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Johnson has ruled that Secret Service agents and key
presidential aides must cooperate with the investigation being run
by independent counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson also has decided that Starr did not offer Lewinsky
immunity, that notes and other documents kept by her first
attorney, Francis Carter, must be turned over to the grand jury and
that a Starr subpoena seeking a list of the former intern's
purchases at a local bookstore was invalid.
</P>
<P>
   Elevated to the chief judge's post 11 months ago, Johnson brings
to the Clinton-Lewinsky case 18 years of experience as a federal
judge, 10 years as a superior court judge and a reputation for
bluntness and for siding with prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judge Johnson is a tough, no-nonsense trial judge,'' said E.
Lawrence Barcella, a former prosecutor who represents white-collar
defendants. ``We're talking about somebody who has had extensive
experience in lots of different areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who turns 66 in July, jealously guards her privacy. She
declines interview requests, refuses to pose for photographs or
provide the names of her current or former law clerks.
</P>
<P>
   After Johnson's brother, Lionel Holloway, was quoted in The New
York Times discussing their impoverished upbringing, the judge
called him to voice her displeasure.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a very private person,'' said her brother, a sheriff's
deputy in Lake Charles. ``She asked me not to talk to any reporters
about her, and I'm honoring that.''
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with lawyers, friends and family members provide a
portrait of a conservative, driven woman with little patience for
ill manners or foolish behavior. Even as a child growing up in Lake
Charles' poorest neighborhood, Johnson was studious and
well-mannered.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was always serious, always focused. She took a no-nonsense
approach to everything,'' recalled Frank Pryce, whose grandfather
ran a pharmacy where Johnson helped run the soda fountain during
her teen-age years. ``She always knew someday she would be a
lawyer.''
</P>
<P>
   Born to H. Lee and Beatrice Williams Holloway, Johnson was given
the name Normalie. Her parents separated when she was young, but
her father lived a short distance away and they visited frequently
until his death in the late 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   The dominant influence in Johnson's life was her mother, who
taught adult education classes and stressed the importance of
education. She demanded top grades and good behavior from her two
children, standards that with reinforcement from teachers had
become a way of life by the time Johnson reached W.O. Boston High
School.
</P>
<P>
   Pryce recalled Johnson leaving Lake Charles before graduation
and moving to Washington, where she lived with relatives. He moved
to the nation's capital to attend Howard University and frequently
ran into her on the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was always on her way to work or going from work to
school,'' Pryce said. ``That's all she ever did _ work and study.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson attended District of Columbia Teachers College and,
after graduation, taught junior high school while studying law at
night at Georgetown University. She was admitted to the bar in
1962.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief stint in private practice, Johnson was hired by
the Justice Department. In 1967, the municipal government in the
District of Columbia hired her as an assistant corporation counsel.
In 1970, she was appointed to the superior court bench.
</P>
<P>
   During his final weeks in office in 1980, President Carter
nominated Johnson to a vacancy on the U.S. District Court. She
became the first black woman to hold a federal judgeship in
Washington, and in 1997 _ just short of her 65th birthday _ was
elevated to the court's top administrative post.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1964, she married Julius A. Johnson, another assistant
U.S. attorney who later moved to the Labor Department as an
administrative law judge. The Johnsons have no children, but helped
put four of their seven nieces and nephews through college.
</P>
<P>
   While the Clinton-Lewinsky matter has drawn Johnson reluctantly
into the national spotlight, this is not her first high-profile
case.
</P>
<P>
   Saying she wanted to protect the privacy of victims' families,
Johnson ruled in 1991 that NASA should not release the audio tapes
from the final moments before the space shuttle Challenger exploded
on Jan. 28, 1986.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, she sentenced former U.S. Rep. Dan Rostenkowski,
D-Ill., to 17 months in prison after he pleaded guilty to mail
fraud. ``The guilty pleas don't reflect the breadth of your
crimes,'' Johnson scolded the former House Ways and Means chairman.
``In your important position, you capriciously pursued a course of
personal gain for you, your family and your friends. You have
stained them, as well as yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Later that year, she was riled by the behavior of Joseph
Waldholtz after he pleaded guilty to writing worthless checks and
lying on financial forms about the source of $1.8 million pumped
into the campaign of his wife, Rep. Enid Greene Waldholtz, R-Utah.
</P>
<P>
   While awaiting sentencing, Waldholtz continued to bounce checks
and stole credit cards from friends and family members, which
prompted Johnson to tack an additional four months onto his
33-month prison term. ``No sentence is sufficient to atone for your
crimes,'' the judge told Waldholtz.
</P>
<P>
   A June 1996 issue of Washingtonian magazine said Johnson's
``judicial temperament reminds many observers of a mean
principal.'' During a speech to a lawyers group earlier that year,
she said everything attorneys need to know about practicing in her
court they ``learned in kindergarten.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1993 Legal Times analysis of appeals court rulings on
decisions by Johnson and her district court colleagues found her
reversal rate at 19 percent, slightly higher than the average 17
percent.
</P>
<P>
   One of her reversals in 1996 was accompanied by a Court of
Appeals order transferring the case to another judge after finding
that her behavior was ``hostile'' to the defendant and her lawyer.
An appeals court tally found that Johnson had made 65 negative
comments to the defendant's attorney, 55 of those in the presence
of the jury.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court finding in that case does not surprise Sol Z.
Rosen, a former criminal defense lawyer who has seen Johnson send
some of his clients off to prison with a tongue-lashing. ``She's a
stern woman, very strong-willed and a very determined judge,''
Rosen said. ``She let's you know who's boss.''

IOWA MEETING SHOWS BUSH MUST WORK HARD TO EARN GOP NOMINATION
<TEXT>
<P>
   By BENNET ROTH &QL; 
c. 1998 &QL; 
Houston Chronicle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa _ If he runs for president, George W. Bush
may have to do some explaining to Lavon Zerley, a Republican
activist who showed up at her state party meeting this past
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Asked for her assessment of the Texas governor, Zerley, a
73-year old farm owner from Jasper County responded, ``He was not
my favorite president,'' confusing the younger Bush with his
father, who served as president from 1988 until 1992.
</P>
<P>
   While recent national surveys show Bush to be among the
strongest potential Republican presidential candidates, it is clear
from conversations with GOP activists here in a state which pays
more attention than most to presidential politics that he still has
his work cut out for him in defining an identity separate from his
father.
</P>
<P>
   While many of the participants who showed up at the convention
that featured a number of presidential hopefuls knew more about
Bush than did Zerley, they were largely unaware of his positions on
hot button issues such as abortion and taxes. Most had never heard
him speak and several confused the Texas governor with his brother
Jeb, who is running for governor of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bush did not attend the Iowa event, which was held the same
weekend as the Texas GOP convention in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really don't know much about him,'' said Arden Augspurger
of Des Moines, who attended the convention his wife, Donna.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is he governor of Texas or governor of Florida?'' asked Donna
Augspurger.
</P>
<P>
   The Augspurgers said they are currently backing former Tennessee
Gov. Lamar Alexander who made an unsuccessful bid for president in
1996. Although he has not announced another bid, Alexander has been
paying careful attention to the state that holds the first primary
caucus in the nation. At the event here Alexander not only feted
activists with a lavish barbecue buffet but also provided coffee
for them the next morning in his trademark plaid mugs.
</P>
<P>
   As with most of those who addressed the crowd of several
thousand, Alexander dished out a heaping dose of criticism of
President Clinton while stressing character and moral issues.
Alexander said Clinton had ``apologized for everything but turning
the downstairs of the White House into the upstairs of a fraternity
house.''
</P>
<P>
   The activists also heard from former presidential candidate and
magazine mogul Steve Forbes, who captured voter attention in 1996
with his call for a flat tax but now has put economic issues on the
back burner to stress social issues such as opposition to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' newfound interest in social conservatives was attacked
as ``phony'' by Alan Keyes, who roused the crowd here by condemning
politicians of both parties as ``squish who don't stand for
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Other prospective candidates who hadn't run before also showed
up including Sen. John Ashcroft of Missouri, Sen. Bob Smith of New
Hampshire and Georgia Congressman Bob Barr, who has made a name for
himself calling for Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Christian conservative activist Gary Bauer, the head of the
Family Research Council, impressed the participants by inviting
Green Bay Packer defensive end Reggie White to appear at his
reception. White recently caused a stir by making insensitive
comments about ethnic groups and gays in an address before the
Wisconsin Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said what I meant and I meant what I said,'' said White.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer later told the crowd, ``I stood with Reggie White. No to
same-sex marriages. No to saying that way of life is acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   However, some of the more prominent figures in the GOP did not
show up for the forum, including House Speaker Newt Gingrich,
Elizabeth Dole, and former vice presidential candidate Jack Kemp.
Former Vice President Dan Quayle also was absent, although his
wife, Marilyn, addressed the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   State GOP chairman Steve Grubbs said that the others including
Bush were invited to what was billed as the first national showcase
for presidential contenders. He said that Bush has indicated that
he would not consider visiting the state until after the Texas
gubernatorial election in November.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman said at this early point Bush was not hurting his
chances here but added that eventually he would have to spend some
time acquainting voters with his views.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not a known quantity in this state. He will have to come
to Iowa and give a good introduction,'' said Grubbs
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush has not visited the state, the amount of political
activity among GOP candidates in Iowa has been unusually intense so
early, according to Hugh Winebrenner, a Drake University professor.
According to Winebrenner's calculations prospective Republican
candidates have visited the state 112 days in 1997, and so far in
1998, almost double during a comparable period in the 1993-94
election cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Winebrenner attributed this early attention to the fact that for
the first time since the 1940s there is no ``heir apparent'' for
the Republican Party presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a wide-open race,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, where Vice President Al Gore is assumed
to be the front-runner, there have been far fewer visits.
Winebrenner has charted 27 days of visits by Democrats during this
period, with the most coming from Sen. Paul Wellstone of Minnesota
and House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Winebrenner said that the Texas governor's famous name has been
an advantage for him but he added, ``I don't there is a good
well-defined image of Bush in Iowa.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They think of him as a successful big state governor, the son
of a president who appears to be a bit more moderate than most in
the field,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For some of the more socially conservative activists, being
linked to President Bush is not an advantage. President Bush, who
was bested by evangelical leader Pat Robertson in the 1988 state
caucuses, was generally suspected of being too liberal and elitist
by the party's more conservative wing.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Bush was seen as a country club candidate. People would
assume that he (George W. Bush) would follow in his fathers
footsteps. That will not go over well with conservatives,'' said
Mike Jager, a businessman from LaPorte City.
</P>
<P>
   But the Texas governor also has his fans here, particularly
younger activists looking for a fresh face to lead the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the boss,'' said Jason Gross, a 27-year old political
consultant from Indianola. ``A lot of people in Iowa perceive him
as congenial as his father but a bit stronger conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   Katherine Larsen, a 29-year old schoolteacher, also said that it
may be to his benefit that Bush has not been spending time here so
early in the election cycle, arguing that he isn't subjecting
himself to criticism that comes with active campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   ``No news is good news,'' she said. ``Look at Dan Quayle. He
would be a great leader. But his image is already trashed.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSSINING, N.Y. _ Pat Garbarini has no answering machine. Why
should she? Anyone who wants her will call back. Nor does she
bother with cash machines. What for? She likes the chitchat with
the teller, and can't imagine needing money at night.
</P>
<P>
   But do not call Mrs. Garbarini, who is 81, a technophobe. She
struggled to the senior center here, just two weeks after having
hip replacement surgery, to take a computer course. And even before
the course ended she bought a computer and printer, turning her
scarred, leather-topped desk into a workstation for bookkeeping,
writing letters and electronic mail and surfing the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to do all of it,'' Mrs. Garbarini said with a resolve
that seems characteristic of a the small but growing number of
elderly men and women interested in the new technology.
</P>
<P>
   They are often slowed by the inevitable infirmities of age, and
the jargon of computing might as well be Sanskrit. Yet Americans
old enough to be the typical hacker's grandparents are clamoring
for computer instruction at community centers, colleges and
libraries across America. Classes fill as quickly as they are
posted, spillover sections are created, and still the waiting lists
are long.
</P>
<P>
   A shopping mall in Virginia, hospitals in North Carolina and
Illinois, community colleges in Missouri and Hawaii, universities
in Texas and California _ even cruise ships to Alaska and the
Caribbean _ have got into the act and are conducting computer
classes. Web sites for the elderly proliferate, with chat rooms
where they discuss health, travel and finances.
</P>
<P>
   Modern Maturity magazine plans its first technology issue in
November. And retirement communities in Akron, Ohio, looking for a
competitive edge and preparing for the next generation of
residents, are installing high-speed modems.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Garbarini's curiosity is typical. After surgery, a less
intrepid soul would have waited for the fall session. But she was
determined to attend, even if it meant using a walker and accepting
a ride from her granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to wait,'' Mrs. Garbarini said recently. ``Who
can tell how much longer I have?''
</P>
<P>
   Those who teach such classes and those who have researched the
habits of the elderly say their interest in computers is motivated
by a desire to keep in touch, via e-mail, with far-flung children
and grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   But the students themselves, at several classes at the senior
center here and another at Ossining High School, offer a less
practical and more existential reason: they do not want the world
to pass them by. When the conversation turns to Microsoft's
anti-competitive practices or the risk to children from
pornographic Web sites, they want to understand and contribute.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people talk, I want to know what they're talking about,''
said Carmela Trapasso, 83. ``Otherwise, you're lost in your own
world, one of those people saying, `We used to do this and we used
to do that.'''
</P>
<P>
   Alyane Simpson, 74, agreed. ``My feeling is, it's all becoming
more and more important,'' she said. If that's the case, how can
you be out of it?''
</P>
<P>
   The primary purveyor of computer classes for the elderly is
SeniorNet, a San Francisco nonprofit organization that began, in
1986, as a research project by Mary Furlong, a professor of
educational technology at the University of San Francisco and the
author of the book ``Computers for Kids Over Sixty.'' Ms. Furlong,
who has since started Third Age Media, a Web site for older adults,
toured retirement communities with a computer in the trunk of her
car. She found the residents both receptive and capable.
</P>
<P>
   Thus began a venture, funded by International Business Machines
and other corporations, to teach technology to the elderly, using
instructors of a similar age. It was begun with five teaching sites
and has since grown to 126, serving 100,000 pupils in 35 states.
Despite its origins in computer-savvy California, SeniorNet has had
its greatest success on the East Coast, where IBM, based here in
Westchester County, contributes not only money and machinery but
retirees to serve as volunteer teachers.
</P>
<P>
   SeniorNet has sites on the World Wide Web (www.seniornet.org)
and America Online (keyword: SeniorNet), with an array of chat
rooms. It charges for its classes _ a $35 membership fee and an
additional $30 for each seven-session course. The students at the
Ossining senior center, in a computer lab next to a gymnasium where
line dancers worked up a sweat to ``Elvira,'' were satisfied they
got their money's worth.
</P>
<P>
   Some had already taken a free class at the high school here, in
which 20 students were sent surfing the Internet by a young teacher
before they even knew how to turn on the machine. The class
frustrated more than it informed because it was too large and moved
too quickly, some of the alumni said. Even those who managed to use
their Web browsers could rarely find what they were looking for.
One man, the most facile in the class, found his way to The Florida
Living Network. His goal was to look for real estate in Daytona
Beach, but the map that linked him to local Web pages did not
include that city.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The two SeniorNet classes in Ossining, by contrast, have just
six pupils each, a teacher of comparable age and two assistants who
tour the room making sure everyone understands what is going on.
Ossining's SeniorNet made its debut in January with just one
section. Now, because of demand, there are two going at any given
time. The material is presented slowly and clearly, beginning at
the very beginning _ with a keyboard that few are familiar with
because they never learned to type.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wrote longhand or you had your girlfriend do it,'' said
one student, John Connell, whose skill level could best be
described as hunt and peck.
</P>
<P>
   Across the room, Bea Polivnick, 76, smiled at her husband, Sid.
``I taught myself to type so I could help him,'' Mrs. Polivnick
said, as he banged the keyboard with two fingers.
</P>
<P>
   In the early sessions, students are taught how to use the enter
and escape keys and the directional arrows, how to insert and
remove a floppy disk, how to maximize and minimize what is on the
screen and how to change a font size or slow the speed of the
mouse. Since facility with the mouse is a common problem, students
are encouraged to play computer solitaire, which provides an
entertaining way to practice how to point, drag and click.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the course is complete, they can write a letter,
locate an address on a CD-ROM map, sort a list of friends and
relatives by birth date and find Web sites about vacations, mutual
funds or family genealogy. Some read out-of-town newspapers on
line. Others make electronic greeting cards or calculate principal
and interest on a mortgage worksheet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a whole new world,'' Mrs. Polivnik said. ``And it's a
wonderful exercise for the brain.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of her seven sessions, Mrs. Garbarini had chosen a
mail-order Gateway computer. Anne Kenny, 65, and her husband,
Steve, 67, bought an ergonomically correct desk and were
researching computers. But Mrs. Simpson had topped them all. Even
before her classes began she had bought a powerful 300 megahertz
machine by Hewlett-Packard and was impatient to learn computer
graphics.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of a growing interest in cyberspace on the part of people
over 65 suggest that market researchers are a bit behind the curve
when they say that as people grow older they are less likely to
hitch a ride on the information superhighway. The most recent data
are at least a year old and are as outdated as last year's
software, according to computer consultants.
</P>
<P>
   The latest survey, conducted for the American Association of
Retired Persons, showed that 63 percent of adults between the ages
of 40 and 49 had used a computer in the last month, compared with
42 percent between the ages of 50 and 64 and a mere 13 percent over
65.
</P>
<P>
   That survey, based on data compiled between 1995 and 1997, found
a comparably precipitous drop-off after the age of 65 in computer
ownership and Internet use. Just 15 percent of that age group said
they owned computers, compared with a third of those between 50 and
64 and half of those between 40 and 49. And 1 percent said they
used the Internet, compared with 8 percent of 50-to-64-year olds
and 14 percent of those between 40 and 49.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Ossining classes there were plenty of enthusiasts,
already concerned about sharing online time with a
computer-literate spouse or alienating one who wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you get a computer, what else do you have time to do?''
Polivnik said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask my wife,'' said Mike Negrelli, the instructor, using the
hen-pecked cadence of the late Henny Youngman.
</P>
<P>
   Leroy Smith, 75, a retired prison guard at Sing Sing, had a
final thought as he stood on the brink of becoming a full-fledged
techie. ``Forget about fishing,'' he said.

COMMENTARY: DON'T CHILL ME OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Words in bold are set in italics.)  
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _  &UR; Brrrrrr! &LR;  Time was, journalists dealt directly
with sources or, after publication, irate subjects. Now we get icy
letters from lawyers out to inflict a ``chilling effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's one from William J. Murphy of Baltimore, counsel for
Bruce Lindsey, the White House lawyer desperately pleading special
privilege to avoid answering a grand jury's questions.
</P>
<P>
   After reading my recent description of the tight-lipped Lindsey
as President Clinton's ``notorious consigliere,'' Murphy consulted
his Random House Unabridged Dictionary: ``As I expected,
 &UR; notorious &LR;  is defined as `widely and unfavorably known' and
 &UR; consigliere &LR;  as `a member of a criminal organization or syndicate
who serves as an adviser to the leader.''' Thus lexicographically
armed, he calls my characterization of his client ``insulting,
baseless and defamatory.''
</P>
<P>
   But political lexicography is my  &UR; shtick &LR; . Ever since the
coterie of John F. Kennedy was named ``the Irish Mafia,'' the term
 &UR; consigliere &LR;  has had wide usage meaning ``intimate political
confidant.'' Ask Ted Sorensen. It may be that investigation of
Lindsey will revive the term's gangland connotation, but that is as
yet unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Such word-maven expertise stills my quaking at his mout'piece's
legally loaded word, ``defamatory.'' (As the spelling indicates, I
use  &UR; mout'piece &LR;  jocularly. However, Philip Weiss of The New York
Observer, who last week wrote a brilliant exegesis of the ``talking
points'' speculating that Lindsey may be the suborn-again author,
can expect a missive paralyzing in its forensic frigidity.)
</P>
<P>
   Another knee-knocker was zinged in by fax from William Alden
McDaniel Jr., lawyer for Sidney Blumenthal (and for James Carville,
a more forthright Clinton advocate), much of which The New York
Times properly published. I had opined that the actions of
Blumenthal, a Clinton official, may be comparable to that of
Charles Colson, a Nixon official who served jail time for leaking
disparaging information about Daniel Ellsberg.
</P>
<P>
   After denouncing this as ``a crude attempt to smear
Blumenthal,'' the lawyer noted that ``Colson pleaded guilty to that
charge, so it was never tested in the courts. It is difficult to
believe any American court would have sustained such a
conviction.'' Gee. At long last, Clinton defenders are holding up
Chuck Colson as an example of a man wrongly charged by a zealous
special prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   But the ``icebox strategy'' of lawyers seeking to chill out
newshounds yelping after our foxy quarry is not limited to
Clintonites. Some of the good guys are using bad means.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Klayman, an attorney whose Judicial Watch flushed out John
Huang of the China Connection, has also used the civil courts to
direct the spotlight of pitiless publicity on the perpetrators of
Filegate _ the abuse of FBI power against hundreds of people whose
offense was to be Republican. (Ken Starr has been a real flop on
this case.)
</P>
<P>
   But Klayman's legal harassment of Carville, George
Stephanopoulos and others is offensive because it inhibits robust,
wide-open and uninhibited debate. A federal judge wisely quashed
the lawyer's subpoena of a reporter's notes as ``overly broad,'' an
opinion New Yorker magazine editors applauded even as they must
have winced at its sexism.
</P>
<P>
   What can be done to counter the icebox strategy of lawyers?
Report retort; complain back; demand clients speak for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Praise lawyers who return calls. William Ginsburg did, and does
not deserve the derision being heaped on an outsider by snobbish
Washington insiders. One day we may learn how he was whipsawed by
Monica's conflicted parents.
</P>
<P>
   Zap lawyers who duck calls, like Hugh Rodham Esq., of Ferrel &AMP;
Fertel in Miami. How many millions will his firm get from the
tobacco settlement? What's his cut? What did he do for it? Who
steered him into the Fertel field? (Hoo-boy, will I get a
chiller-diller from Hillary's brother's lawyer.)
</P>
<P>
   So here we cringe, all a-tremble in civil liability's new ice
age, teeth chattering, foreheads clammy in cold fear, pointing
fingers frozen. But take heart, ye mucked-up muckrakers _ after the
Chilling Effect comes the Feverish Finish.

HISTORIC TALKS TO BEGIN ON PERMANENT INTERNATIONAL COURT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELIZABETH NEUFFER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE HAGUE _ This is the first war crimes tribunal since
Nuremberg, where judges now preside over cases of the most heinous
crimes of the war in the former Yugoslavia: genocide, crimes
against humanity, torture, and rape.
</P>
<P>
   But it is a temporary tribunal, with a limited focus. On Monday,
delegates from more than 100 UN member countries hope to change
that, as they begin historic negotiations in Rome aimed at creating
a permanent international criminal court.
</P>
<P>
   A permanent court, intended to levy justice against the world's
despots and mass murders has been under discussion for nearly four
years. Now, delegates have a July 17th deadline by which they hope
to have hammered out a treaty creating a court that could be based
in the Hague by the beginning of the next century.
</P>
<P>
   ``This court would say no head of state, no defense minister, no
president, no general is above the law,'' said Christopher Hall,
head of the Amnesty International delegation at the Rome talks.
</P>
<P>
   Yet success at the Rome talks is far from guaranteed. While
countries agree on the need for a court, they remain deeply split
over its aims, particularly over how independent the court and its
prosecutors can be.
</P>
<P>
   So contentious is the issue that it has pitted allies against
each other and threatens to scuttle negotiations altogether. On one
side are Canada, Germany, Argentina, and about 50 other nations who
argue that a permanent court cannot be effective unless it is
independent. But the United States, China, Russia, and France will
accept a court only if it answers to the UN Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   And even if a treaty can be achieved this summer, ratification
in each country is far from assured. The US Congress is already
geared for battle: Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, who heads
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has said he is
``unalterably opposed'' to a permanent court.
</P>
<P>
   Still, proponents are cautiously optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world community has embarked on a great effort,'' said
William R. Pace, chairman of the Coalition for an International
Criminal Court, composed of nearly 800 human rights and other
groups that support the court. ``The chances of partial success are
great, the chances of complete failure, very small.''
</P>
<P>
   Added a US official at the Rome talks: ``We may be able to
arrive at a statute for a permanent court, but it will require
enormous efforts on the part of many governments to reach common
ground. ... We must approach these negotiations as pragmatically as
possible, and not as exercises in theory.''
</P>
<P>
   First proposed in 1948, the idea of a permament criminal court
fell hostage to the Cold War. But in 1989, Trinidad and Tobago
reintroduced the idea to the UN General Assembly. Since 1995, UN
member countries have been meeting to sketch out the court's
details.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will send out a warning that impunity can no longer be
accepted,'' UN Secretary General Kofi Annan said this month. He
will open the conference Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Creation of the ad hoc International Criminal Tribunal for the
former Yugoslavia in the Hague and its sister court, the
International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, added a sense of
urgency. The growing pains faced by both ad hoc tribunals are one
reason delegates are anxious to get the permanent court just right.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Hague and Rwanda war crimes tribunals got off to a slow
start, hampered by a lack of funds and political will. The Rwanda
court has been mired by administrative mismanagement and
infighting. And the Hague court, until recently, had hardly any
defendants, as NATO troops in Bosnia were reluctant to arrest
indicted war criminals when Croatia, Serbia, and Bosnia refused to
turn them in.
</P>
<P>
   Most who advocate a permanent criminal court say that is because
the tribunals were temporary ones. Indeed, sentiments run high in
the corridors of justice in the Hague that unless delegates in Rome
can fashion a strong, effective, permanent court it is better not
to have one at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want a toothless tiger,'' said a Hague prosecutor,
Graham Blewitt.
</P>
<P>
   Facing delegates in Rome Monday is a 175-page draft treaty, with
hundreds of items still in dispute. Divisions center on a few key
issues, most relating to how independent the court can be.
</P>
<P>
   A group of about 50 ``like-minded countries'' envisions a court
in which prosecutors could initiate their own investigations,
without the consent of the country concerned or the UN Security
Council. A minority, including the United States, wants the
Security Council to give its consent before the permanent court can
act.
</P>
<P>
   That means that only the council could initiate cases, and that
it would maintain veto rights over what cases go to the permament
court. The United States also favors a country's right to refuse to
cooperate with the court, and wants limitations placed on the role
of the prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   To do otherwise, the United States has argued, is to undermine
the role of the UN Security Council. And a new court with unlimited
powers could be a dangerous political tool. Washington fears US
troops, increasingly asked to serve in complex missions overseas,
could become the subject of politically motivated prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not unreasonable for us to say, structure a court so the
reality of what the military is doing in the future is recognized,
so our military is not exposed to unwarranted prosecutions,'' said
a US official at the Rome talks.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say the US view implies two levels of justice, one
for large states with troops around the world and another for
smaller states. The permanent court would never hear the My Lai
massacre, for example. And giving the Security Council the right to
launch investigations could politicize and weaken the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``The US position is a non-flyer, no one will buy it,'' said
Emma Bonino, the official delegate for the European Commission.
``This solution will make the court a useless tool.''
</P>
<P>
   The EC, Britain, and others favor a proposal put forward by
Singapore, which allows the court to investigate any issue unless
the UN Security Council says no. That means council approval would
be needed to halt cases, but not begin them.
</P>
<P>
   Also under dispute at the Rome negotiations is whether the court
would have jurisidiction over war crimes committed during an
internal, rather than an international, armed conflict. The United
States supports this position, but Pakistan, Turkey, India, and
Iran do not, arguing such conflicts are not the court's affair.
</P>
<P>
   And still unresolved is the court's ultimate power and how to
make states comply with it. Countries remain divided over whether
the court must have a state's permission before arriving to
interview witnesses, for example. The United States supports the
position that prosecutions can be allowed only if a home country
consents.
</P>
<P>
   Others argue the court must be able to be more sovereign than
the country itself: ``Would we need the consent of Pol Pot to make
an inquiry in Cambodia?'' the EC's Bonino said. ``That seems
difficult to accept.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Hague, a defense lawyer, Michail Wladimiroff, said a
permanent court can be effective only if it can compel states to
comply. Wladimiroff, who represented Bosnian Serb camp guard Dusan
Tadic, says the defense and the prosecution had difficulty getting
countries to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you create a permanent court,'' he says, ``you must have
the mechanisms to enforce it. The tribunal was left to the
non-existent good will of the states. No one did anything to force
them to respect the court's decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Just what may evolve in Rome over the next five weeks is
anyone's guess. There is a sense that if a permanent criminal court
is to be created, it's now or never. ``It's anathema at the UN to
talk of carrying it on,'' said Ruth Wedgwood, a professor of law at
Yale University.
</P>
<P>
   But others argue that it's better to continue the talks into the
next century than to create an ineffective court.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to get it right,'' said Pace of the Coalition
for an International Criminal Court. ``There is a lot at stake
here.''

STATE WORKERS ARE FILLING WARCHEST OF ACTING MASS. GOVERNOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ARMSTRONG  
 AND TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Anthony J. Del Vento doesn't fit most people's image of
a big-time political contributor. Yet, Del Vento, who earns $52,490
a year as a construction coordinator for the Massachusetts Highway
Department, is one of the most enthusiastic donors to Acting
Governor Paul Cellucci's gubernatorial campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, Del Vento has contributed every year to the Cellucci
campaign. Members of Del Vento's family have chipped in as well,
including a son who also works for the Highway Department, most of
the time ``maxing out'' their contributions to the legal limit of
$500 annually and handing Cellucci a total of more than $5,000 in
campaign contributions over the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   Though Del Vento denies it, some of his colleagues believe that
his political activity helps explain his promotion in 1995, and at
least one has filed a grievance, which is still pending, alleging
that Del Vento was not the most qualified for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, employees say Del Vento simply figured out what
others have long suspected at the Highway Department: Campaign
contributions can help make a job secure and boost chances for a
promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Del Vento's case is not an isolated one. Cellucci, who rode into
office with former governor William F. Weld on a platform of
cutting state government and ridding the public payroll of hacks,
is digging into the pockets of state employees like Del Vento to
build his campaign war chest.
</P>
<P>
   State employees account for at least $1 of every $14 contributed
to Cellucci's campaign, according to an analysis of records. As a
group, the $353,649 given by state employees constitute Cellucci's
single largest source of financial support.
</P>
<P>
   The Cellucci campaign, which has raised more than $5.1 million
to wage its run for the corner office on Beacon Hill, says the
contributions demonstrate broad-based approval from which to judge
the acting governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a surprise that people who share the philosophy of
government with Cellucci would want to support his political
candidacy,'' said Cellucci campaign spokesman Andy Antrobus.
</P>
<P>
   But the numbers reveal that the acting governor is benefiting
from a patronage system that has placed scores of workers in state
jobs. The records show that some of those state employees, along
with their family members and the private companies with which they
conduct state business, are now among his most generous financial
backers.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is that more evident than at the Massachusetts Highway
Department, where the business of state government and campaign
fund-raising collide head-on.
</P>
<P>
   In promotional material, the agency is highlighted as a textbook
example of the Weld-Cellucci approach to government. Since 1990,
the number of state employees at the Highway Department has been
slashed by 25 percent, the budget has been reduced by $23 million,
and the agency contends that productivity is up. ``Doing More With
Less'' is the agency's motto.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in spite of the attack on state jobs at the agency,
employees have stepped up to support Cellucci.
</P>
<P>
   Highway workers have contributed at least $54,129 to Cellucci's
campaign since 1995 _ by far the most of any state agency.
Relatives of department employees have also donated at least $5,500
to the acting governor. Many of the employees have also contributed
to Cellucci's running mate, Jane Swift, who, records show, is
collecting money from state employees at a similar pace.
</P>
<P>
   Employees there insist that they give to Cellucci because they
are politically in tune with him.
</P>
<P>
   Del Vento says his political largesse had nothing to do with his
landing the job with the department in 1992 or the promotion he
received in 1995. He said he gives to Cellucci because, ``I like to
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Perullo, a Highway Department employee who contributed
$1,380 to Cellucci over three years, gave this response when
questioned about his contributions: ``I believe in him and think he
is sincere and genuine. I believe in what he stands for.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci is also benefiting from the support of private
companies hired by the Highway Department, many of which now
perform work formerly done by state employees. Those companies have
contributed at least $67,720 to his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   SPS New England in Salisbury, for instance, performs bridge work
for the Highway Department and recently won a contract to construct
a tourist information center on Route 495 in Chelmsford.
</P>
<P>
   The company has experienced a sharp increase in Highway
Department work, with payments rising from $6.72 million in fiscal
1996 to $10.96 million in fiscal 1997.
</P>
<P>
   As a group, employees of SPS contributed $20,425 to Cellucci
since 1995, an amount among the highest donated by private
companies. By comparison, employees of the state's largest auto
insurance company, Commerce Insurance Co., contributed $14,000 and
those from Fidelity Investments donated $12,900.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to contact SPS New England officials were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Close relationships exist between the Highway Department and
several of the politically active companies with state contracts.
Some Highway Department employees have left state employ to work
for the private companies.
</P>
<P>
   One firm, Middlesex Paving Co., was fined by the state Ethics
Commission in 1996 for illegally entertaining eight Highway
Department employees at corporate Christmas parties.
</P>
<P>
   Employees from Chelmsford-based Middlesex have contributed
$3,000 to Cellucci in the past three years. Robert Mabardy,
executive vice president and general manager of the company, said
the Highway Department contracts have ``nothing whatsoever'' to do
with the support. Rather, it is because of Cellucci's ``philosophy
and the way he runs the government.''
</P>
<P>
   Highway Department officials say there is no favoritism in the
awarding of contracts, noting that work is handed out only after
competitive bidding.
</P>
<P>
   As for the contributions from SPS New England and Middlesex
Corp., Cellucci spokesman Antrobus described the money as
``peanuts.''
</P>
<P>
   The Highway Department is not alone in giving to Cellucci. MBTA
employees have contributed $18,313 to his campaign; workers from
the Massachusetts Port Authority have given $9,721, and Registry of
Motor Vehicles employees have donated $6,835.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci has also received at least $71,672 from county and
municipal workers. City of Boston employees have contributed
$21,000 to Cellucci, and Suffolk County workers have donated
$11,650.
</P>
<P>
   Support in Boston can be traced, in part, to Cellucci's campaign
chairman, former city councilor and Suffolk County Register of
Probate, James Michael Connolly.
</P>
<P>
   A lifetime Democrat, Connolly has earned the wrath of some
Republicans for helping give out patronage jobs to members of the
opposition party.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who have landed jobs are former Suffolk County court
clerks Daniel F. Pokaski, who was appointed to the state-run Boston
Licensing Board, and Richard J. Rouse, who was appointed Suffolk
County sheriff. Pokaski gave $1,000 to Cellucci and Rouse gave
$700.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci and Swift are not alone in tapping state employees to
finance their campaigns. The Globe reported last year that State
Treasurer Joseph D. Malone, Cellucci's opponent in the Republican
primary, has received generous support from employees who work for
him.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign records indicate that Malone has received at least
$100,000 from state employees, primarily those who work for him at
the lottery and in the treasurer's office.
</P>
<P>
   A government watchdog agency lobbying for publicly funded
campaigns with $100 limits on individual contributions warned of
problems associated with large amounts of contributions from state
employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is something we do need to be concerned about,'' said
Joshua Friedes, executive director of Common Cause. ``Any time we
see large amounts of money being given by any interest, the public
should at the very least be aware that the candidate accepting
these large sums of money may in some sense be beholden to this
group.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Government workers tend to be concerned. It's reality. We're
all concerned about our jobs. We're all concerned that we're viewed
as team players. So I'm not surprised to see these types of
patterns emerging.''

ONE YEAR LATER, HONG KONG APPEARS TO BE IN DECENT HEALTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RON REDMOND  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Its economic vital signs weakened by Asia's lingering
financial flu, Hong Kong will get its first annual checkup under
Chinese rule at a two-day conference beginning Monday in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 China experts, business leaders and government
officials are expected to examine the economic and political impact
of Hong Kong's historic handover a year ago this month. ``Hong Kong
One Year After Transition'' is sponsored by the New York-based Asia
Society in association with the Hong Kong Trade and Development
Council and the Washington State China Relations Council.
</P>
<P>
   The prognosis is guardedly optimistic for the former British
colony despite a year of unexpected challenges ranging from
speculative assaults on its dollar-pegged exchange rate to
onslaughts of red tide and a deadly chicken virus.
</P>
<P>
   Economically, Hong Kong has been hit hard by Asia's financial
turmoil. It is experiencing its first negative growth rate since
1985 and the highest unemployment in 14 years. But its strong
economic fundamentals are expected to carry it through the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   On the political front, a small dose of democracy administered
in May 24 legislative elections has helped rejuvenate the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   All things considered, Hong Kong is holding its own, said Joe
Borich, executive director of the China Relations Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago there were a lot of doom-sayers out there _ in the
media, in Congress and elsewhere _ who said this can't possibly
work,'' said Borich, a former U.S. consul general in Shanghai.
``They thought Hong Kong was going to sink into the sea or
disappear into some sort of socialist morass. That patently has not
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   In the year since the handover ended 156 years of British rule,
Beijing has studiously avoided any appearance of meddling in the
affairs of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, as the
territory is now known. Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa
insists his government is making its own decisions under the ``one
country, two systems'' concept enshrined in the Basic Law governing
the region.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Secretary Anson Chan, Hong Kong's most senior civil
servant, had nothing but praise for Beijing during a visit to
Washington, D.C., last week. Chan will be a keynote speaker here
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no cause _ no cause, I repeat _ to in any way question
the exemplary manner in which (China's) leaders have left Hong Kong
alone and honored their promises of giving Hong Kong people a high
degree of autonomy ... And I say that without the slightest
hesitation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Solicitor General Daniel Fung, responsible for the Hong Kong
government's legal policy and human rights issues, agreed with that
assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not received a single phone call (from Beijing) telling
me what to do, and if any of us did, it would be all over town in
no time at all,'' Fung said during a recent visit to Seattle. ``And
I'm not hearing from Mr. Tung either.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the conference will focus primarily on Hong Kong, the
handover also has had some profound effects on China itself _
changes that will likely become increasingly evident in coming
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Predictions that Hong Kong's capitalist influence would
penetrate southeastern China's ``soft underbelly of communism''
surfaced even before the 1984 Sino-British accord on the colony's
future. Outlandish as that analogy sounds today, there is no
denying that Hong Kong has had a disproportionate impact on the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
   It's now hard to tell, for example, where Hong Kong ends and the
neighboring boom city of Shenzhen begins. Nearby Guangzhou and the
entire Pearl River delta are flourishing, much of the growth
sparked by Hong Kong influence and investment. In Shanghai,
officials constantly compare their city to Hong Kong, some of them
predicting it will eventually surpass its southern counterpart as a
financial and commercial center.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong is the largest external investor in China. Its
companies and joint ventures employing an estimated 5 million
people on the mainland. In addition, some 1,750 Chinese enterprises
operate in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hong Kong does not exist in a vacuum,'' Borich said. ``Its
impact on China has been going on for 15 or 20 years. It's
primarily economic in nature, but there are also a lot of other
spinoffs from this economic fusion. You can see it in the rising
expectations and rising living standards throughout southeastern
China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty years down the road, I think it will be more a case of
China resembling Hong Kong than of Hong Kong resembling China,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Solicitor General Fung says Hong Kong can influence China in
innumerable ways. He likens Hong Kong to a modern-day Marco Polo
bringing to China ``the wonders of the free-market system, the
laissez faire economy, the rule of law, the level playing field,
the joint stock market and its derivatives, the benefits of clean
government as well as the free flow of information via the media,
the Internet and satellite communication ...''
</P>
<P>
   Fung's optimism is not shared by everyone, however. Martin Lee,
chairman of Hong Kong's Democratic Party and one of Tung Chee-hwa's
most vocal critics, insists it is much too early to judge whether
the concept of one country, two systems will be successful.
</P>
<P>
   Citing China's history of periodic, radical shifts to the left,
Lee cautions that Beijing's current hands-off policy may not last.
</P>
<P>
   ``A reliable assessment of one country, two systems is only
possible when China's conditions change, and change they will,
unfortunately,'' Lee said in a phone interview. ``History tells us
that the pendulum in China swings to the left about every 10 years.
The early summer of 1989 _ just after Tiananmen Square _ was the
last time. If it swings again and we in Hong Kong don't get caught
up in it, then we can say one country, two systems is working. But
if we have to swing with it, then it's too bad.''
</P>
<P>
   The outspoken Lee, who was not invited to the Seattle
conference, is returning to Hong Kong's legislature after his and
other pro-democracy parties captured nearly three-quarters of the
popular vote in the May 24 elections. They now claim a mandate from
the electorate, saying the results reflect widespread discontent
with Tung's administration.
</P>
<P>
   But although Lee and his allies won 18 of the 20 directly
elected seats, they will still be a minority in the 60-seat
Legislative Council established last year under a three-tiered
system that critics say ensures a pro-Beijing majority. Still, it
marked a triumphant return for the democrats, many of whom were
unceremoniously thrown out of office when Hong Kong's previous
elected legislature was dismissed by the Chinese on July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Solicitor General Fung predicted _ and Lee confirmed _ that more
fireworks can be expected in the legislature now that the democrats
are back in force.
</P>
<P>
   The democrats, for example, say they will push for an
acceleration of the election timetable, which does not allow for
universal sufferage in Hong Kong until 2007.
</P>
<P>
   There's even talk of abandoning the Basic Law, a prospect that
would likely bring a strong reaction from Beijing, possibly ending
its hands-off policy toward toward the region.

   MILWAUKEE _ It was the last week of school, and students and
teachers were absorbed in final exams and celebratory field trips.
The biggest local story was the invasion of 100,000 motorcycle
riders for the 95th anniversary of Milwaukee's own Harley-Davidson
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly the perfect time for an education bombshell.
</P>
<P>
   So when the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that
taxpayer money could be used to send Milwaukee students to
religious schools, the most significant school voucher ruling in
the nation to date, the decision sent currents of excitement
through some parts of the community, and alarm through others.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents said it would completely transform education in
Milwaukee, letting parents choose where to send their children and
revitalizing parochial schools. One champion, Brother Bob Smith,
the principal of Messmer High School, a Roman Catholic school,
said, ``This is, in my mind, the equivalent of winning the Super
Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents decried what they saw as the breakdown of democratic
principles, the crippling of the public schools, the ascendancy of
religious agendas in education, and what they feared might be an
exodus of good students from the public schools or a streaming of
whites and blacks to what would become essentially segregated
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will a Timothy McVeigh start the next church in Milwaukee and
see this as a profit-making venture and solicit enrollment and
succeed?'' said John Benson, the state superintendent of Public
Instruction, Wisconsin's highest education official, who called for
a moment of silence after the decision to memorialize the loss of
religious liberty.
</P>
<P>
   Much still needs to be determined about how the court's decision
will be implemented, but it may be that in practice the changes
will be more incremental than either the heraldic trumpets or the
apocalyptic pronouncements suggest.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first blush we certainly were very concerned about it,''
said Alan Brown, the superintendent of the Milwaukee Public
Schools. ``Then when you start getting into the numbers, it doesn't
look as bad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take years,'' said Dan McKinley, the executive
director of Partners Advancing Values in Education, a group that
has been behind the school choice movement and has been using
private money to send public school children to private and
religious schools. ``A lot of the schools that we work with are
struggling. Many of them don't have good science programs ... Many
of them can't retain good teachers. They have a long way to go
before they're really strong vital schools.''
</P>
<P>
   The Milwaukee Parental Choice Program, begun in 1990 as the
nation's first voucher program, allows poor families to send their
children to the school of their choice, public or private, at state
expense. Currently about 1,500 students attend 23 nonsectarian
private schools.
</P>
<P>
   The crusade to expand Milwaukee's program to include religious
schools, which make up the majority of the city's private schools,
was waged by an unlikely coalition of habitual political enemies.
</P>
<P>
   There was state Rep. Annette Polly Williams, a black Democrat
from Milwaukee's inner city, whose legislation created the program.
Frustrated with a public system with a graduation rate of 45
percent and a controversial busing program, Ms. Williams said she
wanted to give ``low-income families some power'' to choose
schools.
</P>
<P>
   And there was a group of conservatives, including the Bradley
Foundation in Milwaukee, the Institute for Justice in Washington,
and Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel investigating President
Clinton, who led the legal team two years ago, when the state
Supreme Court deadlocked on the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``They needed us to legitimize them,'' said Ms. Williams, adding
that she is wary of conservatives' desires to promote religious
schools and to include people who are not poor. ``We needed them
because they control the media, they control the money, they
control everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Their opponents included teachers' organizations, the American
Civil Liberties Union, the NAACP and black leaders who feared the
draining or de facto segregation of the public schools. The
plaintiffs have said they will appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court,
but the expanded program is expected to start this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Under the expansion, up to 15,000 students, or about 14 percent
of the 104,000 students in the public school system, can attend
private schools, nonsectarian or religious. At about $5,000 per
pupil, that could mean that more than $70 million would be siphoned
from the public schools.
</P>
<P>
   This prospect makes people like Donelle Johnson, a fifth-grade
teacher at Elm Creative Arts School, an inner city magnet school,
feel ``like my legs had been cut out from underneath me. You're
going to have to have layoffs and huge, huge classes.''
</P>
<P>
   Others teachers, like Gary Hanneman, chairman of the physical
education department at South Division High School on the south
side, worry that because many private schools do not have programs
for special education students and do not have to take such
students, the public schools will end up with more difficult
pupils.
</P>
<P>
   Brown and others suggested that these effects are likely to
occur slowly, giving public schools time to compete for students.
</P>
<P>
   About 4,400 of the 15,000 potential slots would be filled by
students who are already in private schools, either through the
state's secular program or through the privately financed program
led by McKinley. While 110 schools will participate this fall,
McKinley said Milwaukee's private schools currently have space for
only about 3,600 more students. He predicts that other religious
schools will spring up to eventually accommodate the 15,000 total.

BRING ON THE BARRACUDAS FOR A REEL FEAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This cousin of mine reached a life decision along about the age
of 15. He was a box boy in a small-town supermarket. He didn't have
any savings. His parents were not in a position to finance a
college education.
</P>
<P>
   So this was his decision. He was going to be the best box boy
this supermarket had ever employed. And he'd see how far this would
take him. He'd be the first one to work, the last one to leave and
if there was an extra task everybody else was avoiding, he would
volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   He moved up to clerk, assistant store manager, then he had his
own supermarket and pretty soon he was called up into the corporate
offices and played a major role in international expansion. He and
his wife moved into a two-level rambler on a championship golf
course in Orange County.
</P>
<P>
   Today he's comfortably retired in another part of the country
and golf is his main preoccupation.
</P>
<P>
   On second thought, that is not completely true.
</P>
<P>
   He has another hobby that borders upon obsession. He likes to
shop for groceries.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was store manager, I was continually aggravated by the
barracudas, the cherry pickers who would show up each day to buy
the one or two top items we had on sale. The only things they ever
bought, it seemed, were items on which I made no profit,'' he
explained.
</P>
<P>
   Guess what? He is now a barracuda. Example. One recent day he
spotted a supermarket ad offering six-pack bundles of U.S. prime
strip steaks, ``limit of two per customer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So he went out and bought two packages, or 12 steaks,'' his
wife disclosed. ``But he made me get in a separate checkout line to
buy 12 more steaks. We shop there all the time. They know I'm his
wife.''
</P>
<P>
   My cousin stopped short of running out to his car, donning a
Nixon mask and returning to buy 12 more strip steaks. But he was
tempted.
</P>
<P>
   He is buying for two people. He has two freezers in the garage,
and both are jammed. His wife allowed us to inspect his pantry. It
looks like a newly filled shelf at the supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   I asked if he really needed 12 boxes of macaroni and cheese, six
jars of peanut butter, 10 jars of jam or four giant boxes of
oatmeal. My cousin didn't reply. He just smiled. If a flaming
meteor strikes the Earth and destroys all the crops, livestock and
warehouses in America my cousin and his wife _ Mr. and Mrs.
Barracuda _ are good for at least 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   Alice the Artist claims she sees a family resemblance. What do
you suppose she means by that? True, my cousin and I do share
Scottish grandparents. But I can't imagine buying 24 strip steaks
in one swoop through the checkout lines.
</P>
<P>
   Of course if my favorite seafood delicacy, halibut cheeks, were
on sale, I might test the store's indulgence. But to preserve my
reputation, I might ask Alice to wear the Nixon mask.
</P>
<P>
   Barracuda (or Halibut) Pie
</P>
<P>
   1 pound halibut cheeks
</P>
<P>
   4 teaspoons cornstarch
</P>
<P>
   1 12-ounce can evaporated milk
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup clam nectar
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon mustard powder
</P>
<P>
   One-eighth teaspoon cayenne pepper
</P>
<P>
   One-eighth teaspoon black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon canola oil
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup minced onion
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup chopped celery
</P>
<P>
   1 large garlic clove, minced
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sliced mushrooms
</P>
<P>
   1 cup diced red pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 cup frozen peas, thawed
</P>
<P>
   1 medium carrot, peeled and sliced
</P>
<P>
   2 to 3 small red potatoes
</P>
<P>
   1 pie crust, homemade or frozen
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure about barracuda. But you can use true cod or
halibut in this dish. If you don't have clam nectar on hand, mix
some anchovy paste with one-half cup of hot water.
</P>
<P>
   In a small bowl mix the cornstarch with one-quarter cup of the
evaporated milk. Stir until smooth, then add the rest of the milk,
the clam nectar, mustard powder, cayenne pepper and black pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Cut the potatoes in small cubes and boil in water, along with
the carrot slices, until tender. With a slotted spoon transfer the
veggies to a bowl. Into the same saucepan full of water toss the
halibut cheeks (or hunks of fish about 2 inches wide.) Bring water
to a boil, reduce heat and simmer five minutes. Remove fish and let
it cool.
</P>
<P>
   Grab your hat and hold on. We're about to make some fish pie!
</P>
<P>
   OK, heat the oil in a large skillet. Saute the onions and celery
for three minutes. Add the red pepper hunks, the garlic and
mushroom slices and continue cooking another two minutes. Pour in
the milk mixture and stir-cook until the sauce thickens. Then add
to the pan the potatoes, carrots and peas. Stir-cook for a minute,
then remove pan from heat and add the fish, flaking it with your
fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Dump this entire mess into a round casserole. Top with the
uncooked pie crust. The fit on the casserole doesn't have to be
perfect. Shove a sharp knife into the crust to create two slashes.
Paint the crust with milk, then shove the casserole into a
preheated, 350-degree oven and cook until the crust is brown, 20 to
30 minutes. Let the pie sit outside the oven for five minutes
before cutting.
</P>
<P>
   Serves three to four. If you're still hungry, I think my cousin
has 32 packages of Jell-O pudding in his pantry.

<P>
   But questions about what religious schools are required to do
may temper some schools' enthusiasm for the plan. The law says
students can decline to take part in religious observances.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the rules include abandoning religious observance, we may
not be able to participate,'' said Tom Hage, the principal of
Resurrection Catholic Academy, a school that has accepted so many
public school students whose tuition was privately subsidized that
they now make up about half the enrollment of 240. Hage said all
students attend church once a week during school hours.
</P>
<P>
   The program also does not require private and religious schools
to hire certified teachers or use standardized state curriculum and
tests, or to adhere to the same rules of accountability that public
schools do. It is not clear whether the state will try to change
those rules, or how changes would affect participation.
</P>
<P>
   It is also unclear how dissatisfied parents are with the
district, which, for all its problems, includes award-winning and
specialty schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is they're aren't that many parents you interview
who are really upset,'' said Emily Van Dunk, a research coordinator
for the Public Policy Forum, a nonpartisan group, which found most
parents say they are happy with their child's school, whether
public or private.
</P>
<P>
   Empirical studies have been less than conclusive. One, conducted
by a Princeton University economics professor, Cecilia Rouse,
considered politically neutral, found students in the school choice
program performed better in math, but showed no gains in reading.
</P>
<P>
   Rouse also compared ``choice'' schools with public schools that
had small classes and other enhancements and found the public
school students did as well in math and better in reading.
</P>
<P>
   That suggests to some on both sides that public schools can find
ways to compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will probably become more market-oriented now in terms of
how we display to the community our successes,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Parents' views vary. Some, like Jennifer Evans, a religious
education director at a Unitarian church, a public school parent
and a plaintiff in the voucher lawsuit, said she feared some public
schools would be cash-strapped and left with students ``whose
parents didn't have the resources, whether financially or
emotionally or whatever, to get them into a different school.''
</P>
<P>
   Others like vouchers because they promote religious schools.
</P>
<P>
   But several focused on their own pragmatic circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Vivian Watts, who serves food in a public school cafeteria,
pulled her sons out of public school three years ago because
Marquess, now 11, was suspended several times for discipline
problems and Remy, now 12, had very low grades. With PAVE's help,
she placed them in Resurrection Catholic Academy, where they ``have
more one-on-one with the teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   Claudia Coleman-Brown moved her sons, Kenneth, now 15, and
Trent, now 14, from public school to a secular voucher school to a
Roman Catholic school and back to public schools, depending on how
she felt about the teachers, the principal and her children's
needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When something doesn't work,'' said Ms. Coleman-Brown, an
administrative assistant for the county government, ``you move
on.''

MASS. RESIDENTS BEGIN CLEANUP AFTER HEAVY RAINS, FLOODING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH DALEY  
 AND PATRICK J. CALNAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ As torrential downpours gave way to scattered showers
Sunday in one of the decade's most severe rain storms,
Massachusetts residents pumped out water-logged basements, wrinkled
noses at raw sewage littering roads and rivers, and braced for a
predicted nightmare commute Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Flood warnings were still in effect late Sunday as
meteorologists forecast sporadic rain showers through Tuesday. But
even without more rain, Saturday's downpour was enough to mark the
June weekend as one of the rainiest on record. In Boston, 5.69
inches of rain fell Saturday, coming close to the record one-day
rainfall of 6.11 inches set Oct. 20, 1996. The previous single-day
record in June was 4.36 inches in 1881.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past three days, West Mansfield had the highest
recorded rainfall in the state of 9.65 inches as of Sunday
afternoon, with Logan Airport reporting 7.10 inches as of last
night.
</P>
<P>
   And even when the rain stopped for a period Sunday, the water
kept pouring into swollen rivers and flooded roadways from
overtaxed drainage pipes. Almost every outdoor event in the state
was canceled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen rain like this before, it's amazing,'' said
Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino, whose own Christmas decorations and
golf clubs were soaked when his Hyde Park basement flooded. ``There
are places that are flooding that never flooded before.''
</P>
<P>
   In Revere, police are investigating whether weather played a
part in a single-car accident that killed three people early Sunday
morning. Rhode Island police called the storm a ``contributing
factor'' in a head-on Cranston crash that killed 69-year-old Hilda
Scaralia. Across New England, police reported dozens of car
accidents and stalled cars in the storm.
</P>
<P>
   Nine people from a an apartment complex in Boston's Dorchester
section were treated at area hospitals for carbon monoxide
poisoning after becoming overcome by fumes from a gas-powered
generator, city officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In Norwood, the Neponset River was 2 feet over flood stage at 4
p.m. and officials were also worried about severe flooding in
Milton, Dedham, Quincy, and Walpole. The Assabet, Blackstone,
Nashua, and Charles rivers were also threatening to overflow
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In Maine, fast-rising water in the Saco River stranded 17
canoeists, some from Beverly and Worcester, when their boats were
washed downstream in Fryeburg. As the group slept, nine of the
canoes floated away and a canoeist called police on a cellular
phone to rescue the group. No one was hurt. On Sebago Lake, dozens
of boats sank or were tipped over as winds stirred up 4- to 6-foot
waves.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, a state of emergency was lifted late Sunday
afternoon, but many of the 17 other Massachusetts towns that
declared emergencies this weekend still had them in effect. Even
after the heavy rains let up Sunday afternoon, Salem, Saugus,
Norton, Plainville, Boxford, and North Attleboro declared states of
emergencies, largely because of flooding concerns, said officials
from the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Nine temporary shelters for residents displaced by the storm
remained open in Boston, although few people were at them Sunday
afternoon. Flooding at West Roxbury's Star of David Rehabilitation
and Alzheimer's Center will keep 139 residents displaced until
later this week as staff workers try to drain 5 feet of water from
the ground-floor administration offices. All residents are in
sister facilities and are doing well, a spokeswoman said last
night.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the rain tapered, scattered and small power outages
continued across New England, with most residents' power restored
by last night. Separate power outages were reported Sunday morning
in Cumberland and Burrillville, R.I., leaving about 3,000 customers
without power, according to Todd McLeish, a spokesman for Eastern
Utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts Electric and Boston Edison reported that about 300
homes were still without power Sunday afternoon in the Boston and
Merrimack Valley area, and expected most to have power restored by
early Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Police reported numerous lightning strikes of homes, but no
serious injuries. The Norwood police station was deluged with 5
feet of water, destroying valuable papers in the evidence room. The
Somerville police headquarters was also flooded, forcing officers
to operate out of a temporary unit until late Sunday. In Melrose,
the Middle School and Roosevelt Elementary School will be closed
Monday because of severe flooding, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, sump pump rentals around Boston were booked solid for
the next three days as residents prepared to pump out thousands of
gallons of water in basements, some of which had never flooded
before.
</P>
<P>
   And in many basements and almost anywhere there was water, there
was also smelly raw sewage sludge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's everywhere,'' said Janine Noble, a tourist from Houston
braving Sunday morning's rain to walk through Boston Common. ``It
was pouring out of manhole covers when we drove over them. It's
really brown and yucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Many communities' residents reported similar sightings as
overloaded sewage systems failed to handle the amount of volume
pouring into treatment plants. In many towns, the same pipes that
carry storm water carry sewage to treatment plants. When there is
too much water, the sewage does not have a chance to get to the
treatment plant. Instead, it mixes with the water and winds up
pouring into rivers, streams and, in some cases, up through manhole
covers onto roads.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, a thick film of the sludge was seen on the Charles
River and in Boston Harbor. The Saugus River in Saugus and the
Rosemary River in Needham had severe sewage problems, state
Emergency Management Agency officials said. State workers will test
the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``The water is chocolate brown,'' said Bruce Berman, director of
the Bay Watch program for Save the Harbor/Save the Bay. ``I urge
boaters, swimmers, and fishermen to exercise care and caution.''
</P>
<P>
   Berman said efforts to clean up the bay have been good, but when
severe storms cause such massive dumpings of sewage ``this is a
sobering reminder of how much more we have to do to solve the wet
weather monster.''
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts Water Resources Authority officials said they were
pleased with what the treatment plant did take in, and noted that
within a few days, most of the sludge would be gone.
</P>
<P>
   But until that happens, the commute to work, or a run along the
river, may not be the most pleasant-smelling one. Officials urged
caution this morning because some roadways are still expected to be
flooded. Construction will be ongoing on Archdale Road in
Roslindale, where a rising water table caused the road to buckle
over the weekend, city officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The MBTA had minor delays in the commuter rail Sunday night
because of the weather. Those delays may extend to Monday. Buses
shuttling passengers on the Green Line between the Reservoir and
Kenmore Square stops may still be operating Monday because of
flooding. Buses were also running between Wellington and Oak Grove
on the Orange Line Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   And across the city, residents and commuters were expected to
look upward, hoping to glimpse any small sign of the sun. Knowing
that the rainfall was a record did not comfort many.
</P>
<P>
   ``My basement is completely flooded, everything got rained out
and the kids are going crazy,'' said Shandra Kelly of the South
End. ``I just want the sun to come out and dry everything off.''

WASHINGTON COLUMN: TRYING TO ENSURE OPTIMISM 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It has been a tough year for Republican tax
cutters. President Clinton effectively put the budget surplus
off-limits by claiming it for Social Security. Efforts to pay for a
tax cut by slashing spending have run into a wall of political
opposition. Other potential sources, like money that would be
generated by the proposed anti-smoking bill, are not yet certain
enough to be counted on.
</P>
<P>
   So it was perhaps not surprising when Speaker Newt Gingrich and
his top lieutenants lashed out in frustration last week at the
Congressional Budget Office, whose estimates of the United States'
fiscal condition over the past few years have proved consistently
too pessimistic.
</P>
<P>
   Angry that the budget office's projections have regularly
underestimated the room Congress has to cut taxes even after
dealing with Social Security's looming insolvency, Gingrich and his
team vented in the form of a letter to the House Appropriations
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than just listing their criticisms, Gingrich and the
leadership team suggested that they would seek to cut the budget
office's financing if its tax and spending estimates were not
revised to show bigger surpluses in coming years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The CBO must address this problem,'' Gingrich wrote. ``If it
does not, I believe we must review the structure and funding for
the CBO in this appropriations cycle.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure campaign brought a storm of criticism from
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three years ago,'' said Rep. John Spratt Jr. of South
Carolina, the ranking Democrat on the Budget Committee, ``the
Republican Congress shut down the government, insisting that the
president use CBO estimates. Now the House Republican leaders want
to shut down CBO because they do not like CBO estimates.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic leader in the House, Dick Gephardt of Missouri,
called the letter ``just another blatant attempt by the Republican
leadership to artificially pump up the surplus to serve as a
political piggy bank for their grab bag of special-interest tax
cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of the morass they risked being pushed into, the
Republican leaders on the Appropriations Committee sidestepped
Gingrich's demands. Rep. James Walsh of New York, the chairman of
the subcommittee that finances the budget office, agreed to put in
this year's spending bill a demand that the budget office report on
why its forecasts have proved wrong. But he took no steps to review
or cut the office's $25.7 million budget for next year.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's criticism was brushed aside by June O'Neill, the
director of the budget office, who said that coming up with a
totally accurate surplus or deficit forecast for a $1.7 trillion
budget was no easy task in an ever-changing economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``CBO is used to being a scapegoat and a punching bag,'' she
said in an interview. ``We're the accountants, and while your
personal accountant might be directed to provide an answer that's
beneficial to you, we can't do that.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bashing the budget office is a time-honored tradition, indulged
in over the years by Democrats and Republicans alike. (Ms. O'Neill
noted that years ago a Democratic Congress had been miffed at one
of her predecessors, Alice Rivlin, now the vice chairman of the
Federal Reserve Board, and denied the budget office use of a car to
take officials around town _ a prohibition that remains.)
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich has consistently pressed the budget office to adopt a
new way of estimating tax receipts, one that assumes that tax cuts
will unleash higher rates of economic growth and therefore generate
more revenue for the government.
</P>
<P>
   But in this case his pique seems mostly a manifestation of
frustration over how difficult it has been to accomplish something
that Republicans had assumed would be so easy: returning to
taxpayers at least some of the projected budget surpluses, which,
after all, are nothing but excess tax payments.
</P>
<P>
   And if there was a lesson for both sides, it was that budget
politics in the age of surplus are proving just as rough-and-tumble
as they were in the dark days when fiscal profligacy seemed
destined to reduce the United States to an economic has-been.
</P>
<P>
   Then the budget office usually took a dimmer view of the economy
than did presidents of either party, and deficit hawks praised its
restraint, accusing administrations of falling to the siren song of
someone called Rosy Scenario.

CITY GM BUILT LOOKS AHEAD WARILY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By NICHOLE M. CHRISTIAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLINT, Mich. _ It is easy to overlook the two major highways
crisscrossing this city as just a pair of well-worn roads.
</P>
<P>
   But these roads are emblems of a rich slice of U.S. history. One
is named the Chevrolet-Buick, in honor of General Motors, which
began its automobile empire here, putting food on the tables and
cars in the driveways of generation after generation. The other
highway is called the UAW, a tribute to the labor giant, the United
Auto Workers, that rose here in a legendary 1936 sit-down strike on
the factory floor of a now shuttered GM assembly plant.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the roads are ordinary yet glaring symbols of just how
tightly this city is gripped by its two most famous offspring.
</P>
<P>
   ``GM owns Flint,'' said Brad Kirfan, who co-owns a chain of
convenience stores, ``and the UAW is the town sheriff.''
</P>
<P>
   The history that binds Flint, GM and the UAW is as long and
layered as the miles of factory smokestacks that dot this city's
desolate landscape. Depending on whom you talk to here, their
tortured relationship is either wholly or at least partially at
fault for the bitter tone of simultaneous strikes by 8,200 auto
parts workers at two GM plants.
</P>
<P>
   The disputes have led to the layoffs of more than 50,000 auto
workers throughout North America. And they have focused the eyes of
the nation on Flint in a way that has not been done since the 1989
documentary ``Roger and Me,'' the film by Michael Moore that
chronicled his efforts to find out why Flint was losing tens of
thousands of GM jobs.
</P>
<P>
   These days, everyone here seems to think they have the answer to
what is going on in Flint. On one side are residents and GM
employees who say that GM is trying to abandon the town it built.
On the other side are small-business owners who talk in whispers
about how the UAW seems to be determined to drive Flint's largest
employer out of town. Both groups blame city officials for not
doing more to wrest Flint from under the shadow of the automaker
and the union.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows it's coming,'' said Kevin Jennings, referring
to the widely held belief that GM is quietly preparing to close its
18 factories and offices here. Jennings, 30, is the manager of
Dale's Food for Health, one of only a handful of businesses
scattered in a three-block area of boarded-up storefronts in the
downtown section. ``I wish they would just leave and get it over
with,'' Jennings said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When Jennings was a boy, GM's presence loomed so large that
Jennings and some friends, also children of GM employees, nicknamed
the company Mother Motors. ``GM has left Flint with a plant
mentality,'' he said. ``Most people can't see past the lure of the
money and cars to even think of doing something different with
their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it is difficult to find anything here that has not been
created or influenced by the world's largest auto maker. GM and its
33,000 employees in Flint contribute about 60 percent to the local
economy. Many of the classrooms in the five colleges and
universities here are filled by GM employees and their families,
all of whom receive tuition assistance from the automaker. One of
the schools was started by GM to help train its workers for
management and engineering positions. Now privately run, the school
is the alma mater of at least 16 current GM executives, including
the two men who head the divisions that operate the plants on
strike.
</P>
<P>
   And with more than 41,000 GM retirees and surviving spouses in
the Flint area, GM and the UAW supply much of the customer base for
the city's growing health care industry. Auto workers enjoy one of
the most generous health care plans in the nation, paying for
virtually nothing even after they retire.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Woodrow Stanley says GM has been both savior and oppressor
to Flint. ``The very large presence of GM has retarded the growth
of this community,'' he said. ``It's not something you can change
overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how long the strikes linger or how they are resolved,
Stanley says the outcome for Flint is clear: ``There is no greater
microcosm of the auto industry than Flint. And if that industry is
steadily leaving America, as we're seeing, it only stands to reason
that they're going to leave Flint.''
</P>
<P>
   Union officials predict that Flint will lose 11,000 jobs over
the next two years if workers do not win job security demands at
the striking plants and other factories.
</P>
<P>
   It seems to matter to almost no one that GM plans to invest $1.5
billion here through 2001, including a $500 million engine plant.
The flight from Flint is all that people here seem to talk about,
with many of them trading stories about how they plan to beat GM
out of town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to New York; I'm going to be a singer,'' said
Tanesha Fanter, a 22-year-old welder walking the picket line. Ms.
Fanter, who lives with her parents, went to work for GM three years
ago straight out of high school. Last year, she earned $50,000. Ms.
Fanter said that although she supports the strike, she doubts GM
will always be in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could be like everybody else,'' she said, ``stay here and
collect a paycheck, but it's not worth it. This work is hard. I've
got burns all over my chest. I don't want to spend my whole life
fighting just so I can keep working in a plant. There is more to
the world than GM and Flint.''

COUNSEL'S ADMISSION ON LEWINSKY CASE SPARKS DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 AND BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr's surprise
admission that his office discussed the Monica S. Lewinsky case
with reporters has become one more subject for fierce and confusing
partisan debate in scandal-ridden Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The White House Sunday amplified its call for an independent
investigation of Starr, while Steven Brill _ whose magazine article
sparked the latest controversy _ defended his contention that Starr
violated ethical and possibly criminal boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, the independent counsel attacked Brill's article as
shoddy, and members of the Washington press corps bristled at
Brill's suggestion that they had been eager dupes of Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the crucial issue of the propriety and legality of
conversations between journalists and Starr's office remains a
matter of debate and disagreement. And as the argument rages, all
sides of the controversy are waiting to see how the latest
developments will affect Starr's long-running investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a bombshell. It is grave. It is very serious,'' senior
White House aide Rahm Emanuel said Sunday on NBC's ``Meet the
Press.'' He was referring to the article written by Brill for his
new media-criticism magazine Content.
</P>
<P>
   Released Saturday in time to dominate Sunday morning's
television news shows, Brill's 30-page article on press coverage of
the Lewinsky case assailed Starr's tactics and a scandal-hungry
media that became, he wrote, ``an enabler of Starr's abuse of
power.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately, White House aides expressed shock that Starr would
acknowledge his contacts with the news media in such a public forum
as a magazine.
</P>
<P>
   A White House official said that Charles Ruff, the White House
counsel, and David E. Kendall, Clinton's personal attorney, were
reviewing the article and weighing the next step. The aide said
that with Starr's acknowledgment, the issue has ``taken on a tone
of greater seriousness.''
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel's office reiterated its earlier
statement that Brill ``had recklessly and irresponsibly'' accused
it of ``improper contacts with the media.''
</P>
<P>
   The source of the controversy is Starr's interview with Brill,
in which Starr said that he and his deputy, Jackie Bennett Jr.,
gave reporters background briefings on the Lewinsky matter. Starr
defended those conversations as proper because they did not
directly deal with grand jury proceedings and were intended to
counter ``misinformation'' being spread about his investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In the article, Brill raised the possibility that Starr violated
Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which
prohibits government lawyers and agents from disclosing any
``material occurring before the grand jury.'' Brill believes the
rule prohibits ``leaking information about prospective witnesses
who might testify at a grand jury.''
</P>
<P>
   Legal precedents don't provide clear guidance on this matter.
Some courts, including the federal Appeals Court in Washington,
agree with Brill on interpreting the rule. But other courts have
taken Starr's less-restrictive view.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Brill hit the talk show circuit with a ferocity not seen
since William H. Ginsburg was heading up the Lewinsky defense. On
C-SPAN, he said that Starr ``did not dispute any of the quotes in
the article,'' and that the two disagreed on the applicability of
Rule 6(e). On CBS's ``Face the Nation,'' Brill wondered why Starr
and Bennett hadn't talked to reporters on the record if they
considered the conversations appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the furor, the idea that Starr's office was talking to
reporters is not a novel one. In February, Kendall appeared so
angry about a series of leaks in The New York Times that he hastily
arranged a sidewalk press conference, read a sharply worded
statement denouncing Starr, and stalked off.
</P>
<P>
   The subject of leaks from the prosecutor also has been discussed
in numerous media stories on the Lewinsky episode, and at one
point, Time magazine ran a cover story headlined ``Trial By
Leaks.''
</P>
<P>
   On MSNBC Sunday, Newsweek reporter Michael Isikoff, who broke
the Lewinsky story, intimated that leaks from prosecutors to
journalists _ from the federal to the local level _ are a fact of
life in both journalism and law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   He also accused Brill of ``slanted'' and ``selective'' reporting
that displays ``quite a bit of naivete'' about the relationships
between prosecutors and journalists.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post's Bob Woodward, who helped crack the
Watergate mystery a quarter-century ago, asserted that Starr was
within his rights to talk to reporters under certain circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is within the guidelines when it's a public controversy''
and the goal is to ``give people direction'' about the path of the
investigation, Woodward said on ``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue also became the subject of a spirited debate between
Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University,
and Stanley Brand, a former US House counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it extraordinary,'' Brand, on ``Face the Nation,'' said
of Starr's actions. ``Whether they are `6(e)' or not, they are
inextricably'' woven into grand jury proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Countered Turley: ``There is nothing sinister about it. I'd be
suprised if the (Brill) article made it past the copy editor of a
small town paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Isikoff, whose role in helping Newsweek break the Lewinsky story
receives much ink in Brill's story, criticized that article as ``an
editorial more than anything else. He doesn't seem to think the
investigation was worthwhile. I do think the article is pretty
slanted. ... It doesn't address at all the evidence in the case.''
</P>
<P>
   And Lucianne Goldberg, the book agent whom Brill puts in the
middle of the plan to peddle the Lewinsky scandal to the press,
reacted angrily in an interview on the Fox News Channel Sunday. If
Brill is setting himself up to be a media watchdog, she said,
``this dog won't hunt.''
</P>
<P>
   Brill repeatedly was asked why he didn't spend as much time
scrutinizing the White House's role in manipulating the media as he
did Starr's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I quickly decided the most important aspect of this story
wasn't the White House,'' he said on the CBS program, stating that
the White House spin was being drowned out by opposition leaks in
the days immediately after the story broke in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the public recognizes what has gone on here more than
the press,'' he said.

WHY INDIA THINKS ATOMIC EQUATION HAS CHANGED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Corrects spelling of ``Vajpayee'' in 2nd graf.)  (lb) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The end of the Cold War left a power vacuum
from central Asia into Africa that India could not ignore, a senior
Indian official said this week in New York. It was that change in
the global security environment, he said, that ultimately prompted
the Indian decision to test nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Jaswant Singh, Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee's senior adviser on defense and foreign affairs who is
widely expected to become foreign minister when Vajpayee
relinquishes that portfolio, was at the United Nations to address a
special General Assembly session on narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   In meetings with influential U.S. audiences he took the
opportunity to present a broader picture of India's international
position, leaving the impression that the country has reasserted
its ambition to be the unquestioned power in a region that sweeps
from the Middle East to Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a lunch on Wednesday sponsored by the Asia Society,
Singh described the post-1989 world, in which India had lost the
automatic support of Russia, its former ally and arms supplier,
while the nuclear powers continued to protect themselves and their
closest friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``From Vancouver to Vladivostok there came into existence a new
club,'' he said. ``This club extended its reach to the eastern rim
of Asia and the Pacific. This left a huge gap, a vacuum, and that
vacuum lies in southern Asia and Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts on India have long assumed that the second-most populous
country saw itself as a major power thwarted since independence in
1947 from taking its rightful place among nations. As the United
States moved closer to China in recent years, with President
Clinton's using the phrase ``strategic partnership'' with Beijing,
the Indians grew increasingly frustrated that they were not
accorded the same attention.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Singh said, India was lectured about its unwillingness
to sign treaties against the spread of nuclear arms and against
testing weapons. He called Washington's priorities insulting.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't put a gun to India's head and say, `Sign this paper
and then we'll listen to you,''' he said. With a review of the 1996
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty due next year, he said, India knew
that it would come under renewed pressure to sign the pact and that
it had a narrow window of opportunity for testing.
</P>
<P>
   He said India was stunned by the Clinton administration's
denunciation of the nuclear tests that New Delhi conducted on May
11 and May 13. The United States, Singh added, seemed to misread
the end of the Cold War as the end of threats to national security
everywhere, while India remained between two potentially dangerous
nations, Pakistan and China.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The United States of America then proposed a new thesis, that
the principal dynamic or relations would be trade and commerce,''
Singh said. ``The United States assumed everyone thought the
same.''
</P>
<P>
   American officials who traveled to India in the months before
the nuclear tests did not agree that this was the message that they
conveyed. Clinton administration officials said they made it
extremely clear in talks with the Indians that they were looking
for a wider range of relationships, but they also stressed the
importance of India's refraining from testing or deploying weapons
and encouraged the Indians to be candid about their plans with the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The officials, stung by the flouting of reassurances from New
Delhi days before the tests, said they were now wary of any Indian
promises to adhere to treaties or to give up the option of
deploying nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have also joined in the Security Council condemnation
of India, which Singh said shocked Indian leaders. On June 6, the
council refused to accept a bid by India to be considered a nuclear
power.
</P>
<P>
   Singh, known for his quiet wit, as well as his analytical
skills, chided Secretary of State Madeleine Albright at a news
conference he held on Tuesday at the United Nations. Albright's
father, Josef Korbel, was responsible for demarcating the
cease-fire line between India and Pakistan half a century ago and
wrote a book on the issue. Albright, familiar with the region all
her life, remarked recently that India had ``dug a hole for
itself'' with its nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
   Singh, alluding to the Hindu practice of cremation, said
Albright had her metaphor wrong. ``Civilizationally,'' he said,
``we in India do not dig holes to bury ourselves.''

 &HT;    Conservationists work to protect bat habitat by driving stake
through vampire myth
 &HT;    By Patrick Beach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NUEVO LEON, Mexico _ There's no bell, but a nearby rooster is
kind enough to crow at about the appropriate time, and the
straggling children dash into their sea-foam-green schoolhouse in
the Sierra Madre .
</P>
<P>
   Visitors Maria Jesus Teniente and Maria Luisa Franco are
tag-team teaching the class, giving the 20 or so fourth-, fifth-
and sixth-graders at Francisco Cirilo School an update on their
friend Marcelo el murcie(accent)lago _ Marcelo the bat.
</P>
<P>
   Do you remember when we were here before, the two teachers ask?
</P>
<P>
   Si(accent), the children say.
</P>
<P>
   They were here about 18 months ago. And they're back to
reinforce the message they delivered then: that the bats in nearby
Cueva de la Boca _ the winter home for a portion of the Mexican
free-tail colony that summers under Austin, Texas's Congress Avenue
bridge _ are benevolent, bug-eating critters that don't need to be
harassed out of the cave.
</P>
<P>
   The two teachers are affiliated with the Program for the
Conservation of Migratory Bats, called PCMM after its Spanish name.
Begun with wishful thinking, good intentions and precious few pesos
in 1991, the program, affiliated with the Austin-based Bat
Conservation International, now has a budget and a mission that
combines research, education and habitat preservation. Along with
Bat Conservation International, the program is plugged into a
network of similar groups across North America.
</P>
<P>
   The front line for all this work is rural schools such as this
one in Nuevo Leon and elsewhere in northern Mexico, a critical area
for migratory bats across the continent. By making the bat a
kid-friendly cartoon mascot such as the smiling Marcelo, the group
hopes to begin scouring away centuries of myth, superstition and
disproportionate fear directed at the animals.
</P>
<P>
   This prejudice has led to a precipitous decline in bat
populations through the region. A 1991 check found populations
dropping in eight of the 10 caves surveyed. Once home to as many as
6 million bats, making it one of the biggest colonies in the world,
Cueva de la Boca now has between 100,000 and 500,000.
</P>
<P>
   So, as Bat Conservation International does on this side of the
border, PCMM does on the other side, preaching the benefits of
bats: The representatives point out thatbats eat tons of
crop-eating pests. They identify the dramatic mass exits made by
Mexican free-tails as a potential tourist attraction. Another
species of bat pollinates the agave plant, from which tequila is
made.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to show clearly that there are different bats. The
major fear is vampire bats,'' says Joaquin Arroyo-Cabrales, one of
the program's co-founders. ``Here there are no vampire bats, but
people fear them in la Boca.''
</P>
<P>
   The fear of vampire bats isn't entirely unfounded. Having the
habit of feeding on the blood of vertebrates, particularly
livestock, and employing an anticoagulant in their saliva to keep
the blood flowing , vampire bats have the potential to make their
food sources vulnerable to infection and disease, including rabies.
However, vampire bats usually don't forage far from where they
roost.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that vampires aren't among the nine species identified
as living in Cueva de la Boca hasn't deterred locals from trying to
eradicate them . Shotgun shells have been found inside the cave.
Kerosene-soaked tires have been set ablaze in caves, a particularly
destructive way of smoking out bats.
</P>
<P>
   Several other factors also contribute to the decline: Certain
pesticides, banned in the United States, poison the bugs that bats
eat. A phosphorous mine, now abandoned, used to operate just under
the cave floor. Dynamite is regularly used at a nearby quarry.
</P>
<P>
   But the cave is already something of a draw for tourists, and
that may ultimately be what restores the colony to something like
its size 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Cueva de la Boca is an easy 45-minute drive from Monterrey, near
the town of Santiago, which is in the nascent stage of an
eco-tourism boomlet. Weekend traffic from Monterrey to Presa la
Boca, a man-made lake, and Cola de Caballo, a natural waterfall, is
heavy, and a fair number of visitors also trek to the cave, though
for the view, not for the bats.
</P>
<P>
   Round a corner on the winding road and you can't miss it. The
limestone cave's entrance is 100 feet high and almost as wide,
improbably rectangular in shape, like an airplane hangar blasted
out of the rock. It's a wind-sucker of a climb, nearly vertical, a
couple of hundred yards to the entrance on a trail rugged enough to
challenge a mountain goat. The payoff is the view, and it is an
astounding one.
</P>
<P>
   Such a setting attracts a fair number of romantic teen-agers ,
although the exertion of the climb (and the bat odor inside) must
dampen the mood for some. It also attracts vandalism. The inside
walls of the cave are thick with graffiti. Bat Conservation
International originally proposed a gate over the entrance of the
cave to keep people out but allow free access for bats.
</P>
<P>
   Another idea has emerged: a nature trail to the entrance, with
information along the way on bats and other native plants and
animals. With the backing of some business people in Monterrey, the
Mexican conservationists are on the verge of hiring an architect
for the project.
</P>
<P>
   Will it happen?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't doubt it,'' says Arroyo, standing inside the cave.
``The doubt may be when exactly. I was talking with (BCI's) Steve
Walker, and we said someday it will be nice to be down there in our
rocking chairs and see all the people up here watching the bats.''
</P>
<P>
   Deeper into the cave, where the smell gets stronger and the
powdery guano resembles lunar soil, teachers Teniente and Franco
don masks as a precaution against histoplasmosis, a disease caused
by a fungus that sometimes turns up in droppings. Here the ceiling
rises like a cathedral, high enough that it's impossible to spot
bats even with powerful flashlights.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, there are not all that many of them to spot. When
the free-tails begin their nightly chow run around dusk, they form
a streaming column that hugs one wall before it disperses into the
night. The flapping wings make a sound like a light rain shower.
</P>
<P>
   But it's over in five minutes or so.
</P>
<P>
   This is an improvement over the early '90s, Arroyo says, but
there's plenty of work remaining. Among the tasks facing
researchers is more extensive study of the bats' migratory habits.
</P>
<P>
   Arroyo, who holds a doctorate from Texas Tech University, had
spent a portion of the previous week catching bats in another cave
in northern Mexico and taking small samples of membrane for DNA
analysis. It's hoped that the tracking of migratory patterns
through such analyses over generations will yield more data than
has been available from tagging bats with the hope of later
retrieving them.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to what is known about birds, knowledge of the
migratory habits of most bat species is spotty. remain a
combination of speculation and sheer mystery.
</P>
<P>
   It's mostly a summer colony at Cueva de la Boca, and it's
believed some of the Congress Avenue bats use the cave as a
stopover during migration.
</P>
<P>
   The bats aren't the only migrants in the region. About this time
of year, billions of corn earworm moths _ the top agricultural pest
in America _ ascend and catch winds that carry them far to the
north _ more than 250 miles in a single night, said Gary F.
McGracken, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the
University of Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, those bugs lay eggs on corn, cotton and other
crops west of San Antonio. A few weeks after that, the young moths,
having feasted on the crops, continue the leap-frogging northward
movement, chewing up plenty of vegetation along the way.
</P>
<P>
   The bats fly at the same altitude as the moths, and the moth
migration begins at the time when female bats are pregnant and need
the most food. Thus, by interrupting the moth migration cycle at
the beginning, the Mexican free-tail bats have an agricultural
benefit far beyond their foraging range. Free-tails in just a
handful of Central Texas caves eat close to 2 million pounds of the
same migrating moths every night, biologists estimate.
</P>
<P>
   None of this matters much to the children of Francisco Cirilo
School, who occupy themselves decorating a huge banner _ using
paint, markers, crepe paper and whatever else is handy _ with
pictures of Marcelo, the lake and Cueva de la Boca. It's a crafts
project, but there's evidence the repeat visits are working: A bat
exhibit in Santiago drew more visitors than any other traveling
exhibit. The kids get Marcelo books, erasers, puzzles and rulers.
And they learn that Cueva de la Boca is one of a series of caves in
the region.
</P>
<P>
   Arroyo brings in the poster made by schoolchildren near another
cave, Cueva de Quintero. The Cirilo kids snicker and declare that,
in their estimation, la Boca is considerably nicer.
</P>
<P>
   As the session winds up, a class of younger children _ not in on
the morning program _ takes a break . Even though she missed the
program, 8-year-old Savannah Kay knows about the bats: Her father
sometimes leads groups to the cave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they eat insects,'' she said. ``That's how they live.
That's their food.''
</P>
<P>
   The bat conservationists can talk eco-tourism and agricultural
benefit all they want, but many of these children have a simple,
practical reason for wanting to protect Marcelo. An energetic
10-year-old boy named Eli is asked if he likes bats. Si(accent), he
says. Why, he is asked.
</P>
<P>
   Because they eat mosquitoes, he says, and mosquitoes eat me.

 &HT;    Rem performs Sunday at Tibet benefit concert in DC
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ R.E.M. fans can stop holding their collective
breaths: the band is back and bold as ever.
</P>
<P>
   Eight months after losing longtime drummer and founding member
Bill Berry, the legendary Athens group made its first public
appearance as a trio here in front of 60,000 sun-toasted rock fans
at the second day of the Tibetan Freedom Concert. The eight-song
set included four new tunes from the closely guarded CD the band
has been recording in San Francisco and Athens, Ga., set for
release in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   R.E.M. was originally scheduled to play Saturday, but the
concert was abruptly cancelled shortly before their set when a
freakish bolt of lightening struck 11 concertgoers, leaving one in
critical condition. The band decided to reschedule, apparently
because of their deep commitment to the Tibetan cause.
</P>
<P>
   The look wasn't so new. Bassist Mike Mills, guitarist Peter Buck
and lead singer Michael Stipe took their usual spots front and
center, although Stipe created a bit of buzz when he walked out in
a tight, midriff baring top and hip-hugging sarong skirt. (``I felt
like being foxy,'' he later joked.)
</P>
<P>
   The sound, however, was very different. In what appeared to be
an in-your-ear answer to all those fans and critics speculating how
the loss of Berry's signature drumbeat would be handled, R.E.M.
opened its set with the new song ``Airport Man,'' featuring a
plethora of alternative percussion _ drum machine, bells, maracas
and a xylophone. The eastern-influenced song was as mystical as the
Dalai Lama himself, a slowly ethereal tune that was a vast
departure from the pop radio sounds of ``Losing My Religion'' or
``Man in the Moon,'' the only two ``greatest hits'' R.E.M. played
for the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The other three new songs R.E.M. rolled out in this sneak
preview were equally transcendental. Drummer Joey Waronker (Beck),
who will tour with R.E.M. in the fall, provided the beat.
</P>
<P>
   But the skins were certainly secondary in the set. After the
show, Stipe underscored the definition of the band he adamantly
stuck to when Berry left. ``This band is _ and will be until we
quit making music _ Mike Mills, Michael Stipe and Peter Buck,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of the boisterous festival atmosphere, Stipe said the
group intentionally decided to try the new material at this gig in
spite of its introspective and somewhat private sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're like dinner theater now,'' he quipped, when asked about
the new material. ``We aren't always going to be
bash-you-over-the-head rock. I hope people understand we like to
push the envelope.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans seemed to have liked what they heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're still good. I thought the new stuff kept the same sort
of feeling as (the band's last CD) `New Adventures in Hi-Fi,' ''
Jeff D'Agostino, a 36-year-old software engineer for NASA, said
after the short set. ``It sounded like there was a certain
weariness to the songs. I certainly wouldn't call it mosh pit
music. I'm anxious to hear the new album.''
</P>
<P>
   The only complaint after the band's set came from longtime fans
who were particularly upset with the horrendous sound in RFK
Stadium, where the concert was held.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should fire their sound man,'' said 43-year-old Alan
Stubbs, a government computer manager. ``I can't tell you whether
or not I like the new stuff, because I couldn't really hear it. But
I have every one of their albums, and I'll try this. You know
R.E.M. fans aren't just fans _ we're cerebral.''
</P>
<P>
   The set:
</P>
<P>
   1. ``Airport Man,'' a new, bell-drenched tune with a heavy
Eastern influence.
</P>
<P>
   2. ``Losing My Religion.''
</P>
<P>
   3. ``Suspicion,'' another new one, layered over eerie keyboards,
Peter Buck's fat Duane Eddy guitar, with a melody that sounded a
bit like Roy Orbison's ``You Got It.''
</P>
<P>
   4. The new tune ``Sad Professor,'' weaving the V-8 Rolling
Stones-inspired organ from ''You Can't Always Get What You Want''
with acoustic guitar.
</P>
<P>
   5. ''Be Mine,'' featuring a guest appearance from Radiohead lead
vocalist Tom Yorke.
</P>
<P>
   6. ''Parakeet,'' with Mike Mills on a slow and dark piano.
</P>
<P>
   7. ''E-Bow'' from ''New Adventures in Hi-Fi,'' also with Yorke.
</P>
<P>
   8. ''Man on the Moon.''

HELMS PULLS DIPLOMATIC LEVER TO MOVE CLINTON ON U.N. BILL
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When a foreign embassy needs a favor from Congress,
diplomats can appeal to no higher authority on international
affairs than Sen. Jesse Helms. But private audiences with the
powerful North Carolina Republican, who heads the Foreign Relations
Committee, and his top aides are hard to come by.
</P>
<P>
   So when Helms' staff members took the rare step of inviting
diplomats from 10 countries for coffee and cookies in the
committee's ornate briefing room at the Capitol last Wednesday and
asked them for help _ well, eyebrows went up. ``It was an
interesting phenomenon,'' said one European diplomat who attended
the 45-minute meeting.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that Helms has a plan to outfox his old foe, Bill
Clinton. And he thinks the Washington diplomatic corps can help.
</P>
<P>
   Helms, who is no fan of the United Nations, has oddly enough
begun lobbying on behalf of a bill that would pay nearly $1 billion
in dues that the United States owes the United Nations, something
Clinton himself has pushed Congress to do.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a catch. The legislation includes an anti-abortion
provision that the president so opposes that he is threatening to
veto the entire bill because of it.
</P>
<P>
   The reason Helms cares so deeply about the bill is that it also
has provisions for overhauling the government's diplomatic
bureaucracy, which Helms sees as one of his most important
legislative legacies. The overhaul would fold the Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency and the U.S. Information Agency into the State
Department.
</P>
<P>
   While Helms personally opposes abortion, he has criticized the
anti-abortion provision in the bill, which was attached at the
insistence of House conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   But he has been writing op-ed articles to press Clinton and has
indirectly enlisted Kofi Annan, the U.N. secretary general, who
urged Clinton again last Monday to pay the back dues to the
organization. And with the briefing Wednesday, Helms and his aides
took their case to some of America's staunchest allies.
</P>
<P>
   Both the House and the Senate have approved the bill, but Helms
is delaying sending it to the president in the hope that the
impasse can be resolved. Asked when that might be, the senator
said: ``When the president tells me he's going to sign it. The
president's been silent in seven languages on this. He can't have
his way every time.''
</P>
<P>
   In the effort to salvage a State Department overhaul and to
shield congressional Republicans from blame if the legislation
dies, Helms and his aides invited diplomats from Australia,
Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain
and the Netherlands to the Wednesday briefing.
</P>
<P>
   The targeted countries have a sizable financial stake in how the
dispute plays out. The United Nations owes the 10 nations more than
$500 million for contributions to peacekeeping operations. The
sooner the United States pays up, the sooner the United Nations can
pay them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Helms is obviously trying to use us to pressure the
administration,'' said an official from one embassy that sent a
diplomat to the meeting. ``We don't want to get involved in the
partisan battle and we're not being narrowly mercenary, but
obviously we want to get our money.''
</P>
<P>
   The briefing was led by James Nance, a retired Navy rear admiral
who is not only the committee's staff director, but also Helms'
boyhood friend and alter ego. Helms did not attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   A three-page memorandum, ``Status of the U.N. Arrears
Legislation,'' given to the diplomats describes Helms' views on the
legislation's status, the anti-abortion provision and Clinton's
choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration has refused any compromise and is demanding
total capitulation,'' the document says, meaning that the president
wants the provision on abortion dropped entirely. ``Helms now
blames the administration intransigence for the current impasse.''
</P>
<P>
   The anti-abortion provision bars federal financing for
international groups that lobby foreign governments to change their
abortion policies. Republicans say it is a watered-down version of
an executive order that Clinton struck down in 1993. The White
House says the provision still goes too far.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason for the veto threat: catering to `women's
groups,''' the memo said. ``White House is unwilling to make even a
symbolic concession on abortion that might anger these groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Helms has said this is the last chance for the U.N. payment
issue to be addressed this year. The memo states that the bill will
not be sent to the White House until Clinton agrees to sign it or
until ``the most uncomfortable moment for the President to veto
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Helms' aides said they hoped the briefing would unleash a quiver
of diplomatic cables back to foreign capitals, which would increase
pressure on Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the half dozen diplomats interviewed said they had
dutifully sent dispatches to their superiors. But diplomats said
they were struck more by Helms' approach. ``They were definitely
trying to woo us,'' said one European official.
</P>
<P>
   At least one participant said the episode was a lesson out of
American Civics 101. ``This is how the system works in the U.S.,
except that we're the ones usually doing the lobbying,'' said one
European diplomat. ``We won't let ourselves be used.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The federal government has agreed to settle a
class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of 1,200 Latin Americans of
Japanese descent who were forcibly brought to the United States and
placed in internment camps during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs and their advocates said they were disappointed with
the settlement, announced on Friday, because the reparations the
former internees stand to receive are less than the amount paid to
Japanese-Americans who suffered the same fate.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement, which comes after four months of lobbying by
plaintiffs' representatives and negotiations between lawyers and
the Justice Department, will include an acknowledgment of
wrongdoing by the government and a letter of apology from President
Clinton to each of the plaintiffs. Those who file claims to be
included in the settlement will receive a payment of $5,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   The government's offer marks a significant change from the
Justice Department's previous stance. The department had wanted the
case dismissed and did not want to conduct settlement talks.
Representatives for the plaintiffs said Bill Lann Lee, the acting
assistant attorney general for civil rights, who was appointed by
Clinton in December, was influential in that change. He agreed to
meet with them in February for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Some 2,264 Latin Americans of Japanese descent were taken by
U.S. troops from 13 countries, mainly Bolivia, Colombia and Peru,
during World War II. According to a 1982 report to Congress, the
arrests and transfers were carried out on the orders of President
Franklin D. Roosevelt to ``secure the Western Hemisphere from
internal threats'' and to supply the United States with bargaining
chips for U.S. citizens held hostage by the Axis powers.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, surviving
Japanese-Americans who were placed in internment camps received
reparations of $20,000 each. But Japanese Latin Americans were not
offered reparations under that law because they were not U.S.
citizens. Most of them now live in Japan or South America.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Toma, one of the lawyers who filed the case in 1996, said
the comparatively small amount of money for Latin Americans was
``another symbol of inferior treatment, of being discriminated
against once again.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee called the episode an ``inglorious chapter in the nation's
history.'' But he said he thought the settlement was fair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what you're hearing is, like many settlements, this is
a compromise,'' Lee said at a news conference here. ``And the
essence of a compromise is not having your highest hopes
realized.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Congress has the right to define a class of people as eligible
for reparations, which was a major legal issue considered by the
lawyers who pressed the case. An uncertain future in court, in
addition to the age of the surviving internees, played a role in
the acceptance of the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   There is some concern that there will not be enough money in the
redress fund to cover the settlement, though Lee said the
government would find a way. The Civil Liberties Act expires on
Aug. 10, and most claims for reparations must be made by that date.
Those who are not satisfied with the settlement offer can opt out
of the case and pursue their own remedies.
</P>
<P>
   One internee who now lives in Gardena, Calif., Alicia Nishimoto,
was taken to New Orleans from Peru by ship with her parents and
five siblings in 1944. At a warehouse, she was told to strip and
was sprayed with DDT, put on a train bound for Texas with other
detainees and placed in a camp encircled with barbed wire. It was a
relief to see Japanese-Americans in the camp, she recalled, because
she had thought she would be taken to a jungle and killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, we are making history today,'' Ms. Nishimoto said
tearfully on Friday. ``But I would be lying if I said I were happy
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even to this day, I can't believe this happened to us,'' she
added. ``How can the U.S. government do this?''

STARR ADMITS ROLE IN LEAKS TO PRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At the core of the bitter dispute over whether
Kenneth Starr improperly disclosed information about the
investigation of President Clinton are Justice Department
regulations and court decisions involving how much prosecutors may
tell the public and the media about their work.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, the Whitewater prosecutor, said in an interview with
Brill's Content, a new magazine, that he and his aides have given
information about the Monica Lewinsky matter to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The White House immediately responded that the article
buttressed its complaints that the independent counsel's office has
improperly leaked information to the press. But Starr said that he
and his prosecutors had not violated rules about grand jury
secrecy, and said that the actions were permissible because they
were done to protect his office from attacks that undermined public
confidence in his work.
</P>
<P>
   He was apparently referring to Justice Department regulations
that prohibit prosecutors from disclosing any information about a
grand jury investigation, but include an exception for instances in
which there is a need to reassure the public that an investigation
is being conducted properly.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with former and current Justice Department officials
suggest that it remains unclear if the exception in the department
guidelines applies to Starr's actions. The battle between Clinton
and Starr has become not just a legal but a political one, in which
both sides have sought to win the public's support.
</P>
<P>
   Different federal appeals courts have disagreed over the scope
and limits of the law that prohibits grand jury disclosures by
prosecutors. The Supreme Court has never directly addressed the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Starr told the magazine that he and his deputies talked to
reporters ``on background on some occasions'' _ that is, they spoke
on the condition that the resulting news articles not mention that
the information came from the prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Starr said that those contacts were ``legal,
appropriate and consistent with Department of Justice policy,''
which provides for informing the public about the activities of
law-enforcement officers.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department policy to which Starr apparently referred
is in a manual given to federal prosecutors and contains a wide
variety of rules covering such divergent topics as how to handle an
arson case and what is an acceptable plea bargain.
</P>
<P>
   The manual forbids a prosecutor to discuss many grand jury
matters, but offers three general exceptions. The one on which
Starr appears to rely, included in Section 1-7.530, allows for
disclosure ``about matters about which the community needs to be
reassured that an appropriate law-enforcement agency is
investigating the incident.''
</P>
<P>
   The other exceptions in the regulations are for the public
safety, that is to save a life, or when there has already been
substantial disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Justice Department officials said it was unclear whether
Starr's reasoning _ that he made clarifications to reporters to
protect the reputation of his office from unrelenting attacks _
qualified under the guidelines as a permissible exception to rules
against disclosing grand jury material. ``He might well be able to
make that argument,'' said one official who spoke on the condition
of anonymity.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors are occasionally disciplined or even
dismissed when they are found to have improperly leaked material to
reporters. Yet even in such cases, the underlying indictments are
never dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, a prosecutor who wants to speak in public or to a
reporter about an investigation must seek permission from
high-level Justice Department officials. As an independent counsel,
Starr does not report directly to the Justice Department and is, in
the first instance, the judge of his own behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno may remove Starr if he has behaved
improperly, but she has resisted all calls to criticize him. She
had no comment through a spokesman Sunday on the issue of the
magazine interview.
</P>
<P>
   David Kendall, Clinton's personal lawyer who has already asked a
federal judge to hold Starr in contempt for allegedly leaking grand
jury material, reacted sharply Sunday to the magazine article.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are studying it carefully,'' he said. ``It contains
astonishing admissions and it has very serious implications.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr is quoted in the magazine as saying that none of the
comments to reporters on background involved grand jury
information, describing the material as relating to what witnesses
told agents from the FBI before they testified before the grand
jury.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine notes, however, that the District of Columbia U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals just last month issued an opinion
disputing that view as it offered a wide definition of what
constitutes grand jury material. But other courts, like the 3rd
Circuit Court of Appeals, ruled in 1990 that the secrecy policy is
only designed to protect what takes place in the grand jury room.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Justice Department officials also disputed one element of
the article, that Starr had maneuvered Reno into expanding his
jurisdiction to investigate whether Clinton lied about having had
an affair with Ms. Lewinsky and then encouraged Ms. Lewinsky to lie
about it. The officials said it was clear that the matter had to be
investigated by Starr.

CABLEVISION TO RESTORE AND UPDATE ART DECO LANDMARK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By GLENN COLLINS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Radio City Music Hall, one of New York City's more
enduring show-business icons, will be closed for at least six
months next year for a $30 million restoration, the most extensive
in its 65-year history.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Radio City's art-deco opulence and theatrical
spectacles attract 2 million visitors a year, its operator,
Cablevision Systems Corp., is convinced that its power as a tourist
destination and brand name has not been fully exploited.
</P>
<P>
   So while Radio City will be painstakingly restored for live
theater _ the Rockettes included _ it will also become a production
center for television specials. And Cablevision is planning to
expand the Radio City name to a cable channel, a record label and
an FM radio station.
</P>
<P>
   The renovation is to take place from March to September, during
which Cablevision plans to restore Radio City's block-long marquee,
with its six miles of red-and-blue neon tubing, and the legendary
backstage hydraulic system, which has transported elephants,
Rockettes and whole orchestras across and under the stage.
</P>
<P>
   According to a plan that is still evolving, Cablevision will
also replace seats, carpets, wallpaper and curtains; clean and
restore murals; enhance lighting and sound systems, and restore the
auditorium's pipe organ.
</P>
<P>
   A vast new gold-threaded curtain for the 144-foot-wide stage is
to be embedded with fiber-optic lighting that will generate a
rainbow of changingcolors and patterns. This will allow both the
curtain and the organ to be used in preperformance shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the work is finished it will be like going back six
decades and taking a walk through time,'' said James Dolan, the
chief executive of Cablevision. ``We're going to take the building
back to 1932, but bring its infrastructure forward past the year
2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Last December, Cablevision leased Radio City Music Hall from its
owner, Tishman Speyer Properties, and bought the rights to both the
Rockettes and the Christmas pageant from Mitsubishi Estate Co.
Cablevision operates cable channels, produces television shows and
provides cable service to 2.6 million customers in the metropolitan
area.
</P>
<P>
   The music hall's revival is part of the master plan of Jerry
Speyer, the manager and part owner of Rockefeller Center, to
resuscitate what he has called ``the world's most famous address.''
He sees Radio City driving the center's nighttime activities in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   As architects for the project, Radio City has hired Hardy
Holzman Pfeiffer Associates, which oversaw the complex renovations
of the New Amsterdam and New Victory theaters on 42nd Street, and
the Rockwell Group, which has designed projects ranging from 60
Planet Hollywoods to Manhattan's Monkey Bar and Nobu restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the most comprehensive renewals ever undertaken
in a theater,'' said Hugh Hardy of Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer.
</P>
<P>
   Dolan said the cost of the project would be $30 million to $40
million.
</P>
<P>
   The exterior of the music hall and its public interior spaces,
as well as some furnishings, were designated New York City
landmarks in 1979 and the structure was designated a National
Historic Landmark in 1987. As a result of the city's landmarks
designation, the renovation work will require the approval of the
Landmarks Preservation Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The music hall renovation is part of an ambitious plan of
Cablevision _ which owns the 18,000-seat Madison Square Garden and
its 5,600-seat theater, and leases the 5,901-seat music hall _ to
consolidate the booking of its entertainment events under Radio
City's management.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our ambition is nothing less than to relaunch Radio City as
the most prestigious, innovative and active theater in the world,''
said Arlen Kantarian, president of Radio City Productions. ``Radio
City is one of the most underdeveloped of brand names,'' said
Kantarian, who is expected to head Radio City Entertainment, a new
corporate entity that will centralize entertainment-event booking
for the Music Hall and Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Renovation plans also include a suite of television studios,
possibly in the nonlandmarked space above the auditorium that now
contains rehearsal halls for the Rockettes. The studios will be
used by Cablevision's American Movie Classics and Bravo cable
channels; the classic movie channel has already been taping its
introductory segments in the Music Hall.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Plans for restoration of the marquee include a return to the
sequential lighting of the ``Radio City'' sign, which originally
blinked letter by letter. The architects will propose searchlights
to give the marquee opening-night glamour and will seek to install
touch-screen computer kiosks under the marquee that would offer
theatergoers information about future performances.
</P>
<P>
   The 60-year-old backstage hydraulic system with its three
70-foot-long elevators, which was studied by Navy aircraft-carrier
designers during World War II, has long since run out of
replacement parts. It will be overhauled and reconfigured so that
the mechanical systems can be computer-controlled, making possible
more stage effects of the kind used in Broadway shows like
``Phantom of the Opera'' and ``Beauty and the Beast.''
</P>
<P>
   New carpeting and fabric panels are planned to replace the
originals in the Grand Foyer, and the three-story-tall mural by
Ezra Winter, which looms above the grand staircase, will be cleaned
of decades of grime and varnish and restored. Brighter lighting
will be installed, and five new concession stands are planned for
the ground floor and mezzanine levels.
</P>
<P>
   Computer-controlled lighting with color-sequenced programming is
planned to illuminate the auditorium's ``sunrise'' rings, which
radiate from the proscenium arch.
</P>
<P>
   Architects are also drawing up plans for a restaurant on the
mezzanine space overlooking Avenue of the Americas, to be called
The Radio City Club or The Marquee Club.

<P>
   HANOVER, N.H. _ When James Freedman called his mother, the
impossible-to-please Sophie Freedman, to tell her that he had been
named president of Dartmouth College, her response was: ``Why not
Harvard?''
</P>
<P>
   At Dartmouth, meanwhile, a lot of people were saying: ``Why Jim
Freedman?''
</P>
<P>
   He was hardly the stereotypical Dartmouth man. Not only was he a
graduate of Harvard College and Yale Law School, but he was Jewish,
he didn't drink and he preferred reading to skiing, rowing, hiking
or any other outdoor activity. His idea of exercise was browsing
through a good used-book store.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after 11 years, Freedman, 62, is stepping down, and this
past weekend, at his final commencement, the college community
showed how much minds had changed. It celebrated the self-effacing
idealist as the model for a new kind of Dartmouth man, and woman
(under Freedman, the student body has achieved increased gender
parity).
</P>
<P>
   The board of trustees thanked him for transforming Dartmouth
into a haven for intellectuals, and making it one of the top
schools in the Ivy League. The freshman class that will arrive on
campus this fall has the highest academic credentials in the
school's history, with median SAT scores of 1440. A perfect SAT
score is 1600.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's upped the intellectual ante,'' said Susan Ackerman, a
professor of religion, talking after a farewell dinner for Freedman
here Saturday night. ``The students are brighter and brighter, and
now they're not afraid to admit that they're bright. He's made it
OK to talk about books and ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Dartmouth sent Freedman off with an honorary degree _ it also
awarded one to his wife, Sheba, who has a Ph.D. in human
development from Bryn Mawr _ an endowed chair in his name, and,
fittingly, first editions of books by two of his favorite writers.
</P>
<P>
   Freedman, a passionate book collector, did not contain his joy
Saturday as he showed off his gifts: The Collected Letters of
William Carlos Williams _ inscribed by the poet to his wife,
`Flossy dear from Bill, July 31, 1957' _ and James Joyce's
Finnegan's Wake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finnegan's Wake!'' said Freedman, opening the book. ``Oh gosh,
I would have died for this.''
</P>
<P>
   He was relaxing with his wife at the president's home on campus,
sipping a diet soft drink and talking about how much he is looking
forward to having extended time to read, and write, again. He will
spend next year at Harvard working on a second book about liberal
education before returning to Dartmouth to teach, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got impatient at being at everyone's beck and call,''
he said. ``Every morning my secretary would hand me a card with my
schedule. It was like a dentist. There was somebody every
half-hour.''
</P>
<P>
   In another era, college presidents regularly stayed on for 20 or
30 years. But these days the pressures are such that many college
presidents endure less than seven years. Freedman lasted 16 _ five
at the University of Iowa, and 11 at Dartmouth.
</P>
<P>
   Freedman leaves to his successor, James Wright, the Dartmouth
provost, a vastly changed college. It is richer, with a $1.28
billion endowment, and the curriculum has been overhauled for the
first time in more than 70 years.
</P>
<P>
   But Dartmouth has also changed Freedman, forcing him to speak
out, despite a retiring nature. Early on, he took a stand against
The Dartmouth Review, a neoconservative off-campus student
newspaper. He talked publicly about his successful struggle with
cancer. And he spoke about the anti-Semitism in the college's past.
</P>
<P>
   In his first book on liberal education, Freedman wrote about
college as a time for young people to nurture their private and
public selves. He quoted Thomas Mann's ``Doctor Faustus.''
</P>
<P>
   The same quote, he said, could apply to him now, as he moves on:
``There is at bottom only one problem in the world and this is its
name. How does one break through? How does one get into the open?
How does one burst the cocoon and become a butterfly?''

CALLERS TO CANCER INFORMATION LINE OFTEN GET BUSY SIGNAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Fla., N.C., Texas, Calif., Md., Okla.)  (lh) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nearly one-third of the people who call the
government's toll-free telephone number to obtain information about
cancer get a busy signal or simply hang up because they have to
wait so long, federal investigators say.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators said that the telephone service, run by the
National Cancer Institute at a cost of $21.4 million this year, was
``the most comprehensive and credible source for cancer
information'' in the United States. But, they said, it has been
operating far below the standards of customer service set by
private industry and promised by President Clinton, with his pledge
to reinvent government.
</P>
<P>
   The toll-free number is 800-4-Cancer (800-422-6237). It receives
600,000 calls a year from cancer patients, their friends and
relatives, as well as from doctors and other health professionals.
</P>
<P>
   In a report to be issued next week, June Gibbs Brown, inspector
general of the Department of Health and Human Services, said: ``In
1997, almost one out of every three attempted calls to the Cancer
Information Service failed to reach an information specialist. Busy
signal rates for the individual contractors ranged from 10 percent
to 52 percent. Networkwide average busy signal rates for 1995 and
1996 were similar.''
</P>
<P>
   The government operates the service through contracts with 19
organizations including the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center
in New York, the Duke Comprehensive Cancer Center in Durham, N.C.,
the University of Texas and the Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center
in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Florida had the highest busy rate, with half the callers getting
busy signals last year. ``We recognize that we have a problem,''
said Jo Beth Speyer, director of the Miami office of the Cancer
Information Service.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that callers, especially cancer patients, were
often desperate for information, and that some were ``highly
emotional.'' They ask, for example, about treatment options, the
genetics of breast cancer and how to enroll in clinical trials
testing the safety and effectiveness of new cancer therapies.
</P>
<P>
   Christy A. Thomsen, chief of the Cancer Information Service at
the National Cancer Institute, said: ``The calls often involve
life-and-death situations. The callers may be in crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   The information service answers questions about all types of
cancer, using data and literature reviewed and approved by the
cancer institute, a unit of the National Institutes of Health in
Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown, the inspector general, said the cancer institute had
not established performance standards for its contractors. As a
result, she said, ``contractors are not required to keep their busy
signal rates or wait times under any specific threshold.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Thomsen accepted many of the inspector general's findings
and recommendations and said that the cancer institute would take
action to address the problems. ``There are more people calling us
than we've been able to serve,'' she said. ``We are concerned about
that. We are working hard to decrease our busy signal rate. Our
goal is to have a busy rate no higher than 10 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   The waiting time averaged 7.2 minutes last year and 5.3 minutes
in the first five months of this year, Ms. Thomsen said. ``We'd
like it to be under two minutes, but it's not,'' she added.
Information specialists said that callers sometimes had to wait 20
minutes or more.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators said the regional structure of the
telephone service was inefficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``Callers are not routed to the first available information
specialist,'' but are sent to the regional office serving their
geographic area, the inspector general said. ``We observed at least
one contractor with phone lines open for most of the day, while
other offices had persistent queues of waiting callers.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Brown said that money and other resources of the Cancer
Information Service were not ``equitably allocated'' among the 19
regions, which have populations ranging from 1.2 million in Hawaii
to a 22.7 million in Texas and Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   One contractor serves 3.9 million residents per telephone line,
while another serves only 1.4 million, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Information specialists are genuinely concerned about the busy
signal rate,'' the report said. ``In at least two contractor
offices, information specialists have resorted to covering up the
queue indicators on their phones because they get `stressed out'
when they see them while on a call.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown said the Cancer Information Service could answer more
calls if it increased the number of telephone lines and sent
callers to the first available information specialist.
</P>
<P>
   In her report, the inspector general also made these points:
</P>
<P>
   _ The average call lasts slightly more than 12 minutes.
Operators ``cannot move quickly from call to call'' because they
have to make a detailed record of every call, showing the reason
for the inquiry and the nature of the response, and they have to
collect demographic data on the age, race and education of half the
callers. The government could save time and provide better service
if it collected such information on a random sample of 6,000 to
10,000 calls.
</P>
<P>
   _ While the Cancer Information Service provides excellent
scientific information about cancer, there are problems with the
computerized database listing clinical trials. This database, known
as the Physician Data Query system, contains ``incomplete,
incorrect and outdated information.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Contractors refer one in five callers to local hospitals,
hospices, home health care agencies, pain clinics, genetic
counselors and providers of social services. But, Ms. Brown said,
the contractors' information on such community services is often
inaccurate and outdated.

   NEW YORK _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   As an 80th birthday celebration, Jan Tofty, a Chicago friend,
took her mother to New York City for the first time, dazzling her
with sights and sounds from Fifth Avenue to the Battery.
</P>
<P>
   Mom, who lived all her life in northern Minnesota, gaped and
gasped in wonder at every turn, commenting on the staggering
difference between New York and home. But there was one thing that
apparently was familiar.
</P>
<P>
   At the corner of Madison Avenue and 57th Street, she said in
amazement, ``Oh, look, they even have hitchhikers in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Her daughter followed her pointing finger. There, arm raised,
was a woman hailing a taxi.
</P>
<P>
   _JOSEPHINE BASKIN MINOW
</P>
<P>
   After arriving at Kennedy International Airport on a red-eye
flight from the West Coast one morning, a co-worker of Jack Lucid
decided to go home, shower and see his 6-year-old son before
heading into the office. Soon after the man arrived home, his son
asked, ``Did you run to catch your taxi?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I did,'' his father said.
</P>
<P>
   The little boy wasn't finished: ``Were you late getting to the
airport? Did you just catch your flight?''
</P>
<P>
   His father was becoming increasingly puzzled by the questions,
but he acknowledged that he had just made the plane. How did his
son know about his timing on the Coast _ the late arrival at the
airport and squeaking onto the plane minutes before departure?
</P>
<P>
   No mystery there to a sharp kid. ``Because if you hadn't been
late for the taxi and the flight, I'd be playing with the new toy
you would have bought me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It has been many years since Ira Barrows lived in New York, but
according to his wife, Carol, he hasn't lost the attitude.
</P>
<P>
   The couple were recently in Manhattan waiting at the taxi stand
at Pennsylvania Station when they noticed another couple sneaking
to the front of the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excuse me, but there's a line and it goes back there,''
Barrows said firmly. The couple grumbled and gestured but moved to
the end of the line.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, a cab pulled up and the couple bolted the
line, threw their bags into the trunk left open by the passengers
just discharged, and started getting in. There was murmured
grumbling but no action. Barrows informed the driver that the
couple hadn't been first in line. The driver shrugged and prepared
to take off.
</P>
<P>
   Barrows' dander was up. He rallied the line to a concerted
protest. The driver gave in. He pulled the bags out of the trunk
and banished the couple from his cab.
</P>
<P>
   What Mrs. Barrows may not know is that although her husband
hasn't lost the New York attitude, the couple who cut ahead of the
line were undoubtedly the real thing _ true New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   On the subject of real New Yorkers, there's Elaine Britvan's
2{-year-old grandson, Dylan, who was in a sneaker store with his
mother and grandmother. He wanted to go outside and play, and his
grandmother, to divert him, began counting ``1-2-3-4-5.'' He
carried on: ``6-7-8-9-10-11-12-Penthouse,'' he announced.
</P>
<P>
   It was a balmy evening and Clare Garfield was walking down
Lexington Avenue, carrying on an animated conversation with her
cousin about her love life. ``He's been back for four days and he
still hasn't called me,'' Ms. Garfield said. ``I don't know what to
think.''
</P>
<P>
   A man who had just walked by the two turned around. ``I'll tell
you what to think,'' he said. ``Next!''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Garfield took the advice and went on to a ``next.''

   Jean Cottam and Gregory Allen were having a quick bite at the
Carlyle Hotel before an appearance there by Bobby Short, when they
overheard an obviously exasperated waiter talking to himself.
``Viagra, that's all they talk about,'' he muttered. ``That's all I
hear, Viagra, Viagra.''
</P>
<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   I was walking home one evening along Third Avenue when I fell
into place behind two young men dressed in business suits. They
were talking about bad relationships, and each man was trying to
top the other's story. At the corner of 51st Street, they stopped
for the light, and one turned to the other and said, ``Look, you
don't know desperation like I've known desperation.''
</P>
<P>
   _PATRICIA RODENBURG
</P>
<P>
   A vendor selling sunglasses didn't take part in the street fair
on 52nd Street last month, but he had his marketing down pat.
``Sunglasses $6,'' he intoned, ``cheaper than you could get them at
the fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Too cheap? ``If you need self-esteem, $12,'' he offered.
</P>
<P>
   Arline Sciortino thought that both prices sounded like bargains,
but she already had sunglasses and, she said, her self-esteem was
pretty good that day.
</P>
<P>
   A school eye test revealed that Dr. Herbert Abramowitz's
granddaughter, Hannah, a second-grader, might need glasses. The
news didn't bother her in the least. She wanted glasses because her
classmates who wore them apparently got a lot of attention.
</P>
<P>
   She was taken for an eye examination, read the chart in the
doctor's office and was told that her eyesight was fine. Obviously
dissatisfied with the diagnosis, she turned to the doctor. ``How
many do you need to get wrong to get glasses?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's possible to exit the subway grinning. Stephan T. Mayo
didn't pay too much attention to the familiar ``Let 'em out _ step
lively! _ use all available doors,'' until the man next to him made
his own announcement. In a barely audible voice, he advised: ``And
don't use the unavailable doors.''
</P>
<P>
   Annette Horstman received a telephone call from the receptionist
in her chiropractor's office after her husband had made his first
visit there. The young woman wanted to know, for insurance
purposes, his date of birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``October sixth, 1914,'' Mrs. Horstman replied.
</P>
<P>
   There was a pause and the receptionist repeated, ``I need the
date of birth.'' Mrs. Horstman recited the information again.
Another pause. ``I need to know the exact date,'' the receptionist
said.
</P>
<P>
   By now, Mrs. Horstman was wondering if they were speaking the
same language. ``October, sixth day, year 1914,'' she enunciated
slowly.
</P>
<P>
   There was a sigh of exasperation at the other end. ``Look,'' the
receptionist carefully explained, ``my date is 3/20/80.''

 &HT;    Not all submit to statement
 &HT;    (EDS: Corrects to new headline, changes ``disapproval'' to
``approval'' in 10th graph)
 &HT;    By Jennifer Brett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Controversy provoked by the Southern Baptist Convention's call
for women to ``graciously submit'' to their husbands was unexpected
and unfounded, the leader of the Georgia chapter told his
Lawrenceville congregation Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But any man who thinks the convention's action ``gave him the
right to be a dictator in the home does not understand the word of
God,'' said the Rev. Frank Cox, president of the Georgia Baptist
Convention and pastor at North Metro First Baptist Church in
Lawrenceville. He attended the Salt Lake City convention where
members last week adopted the statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why they've chosen to jump on `graciously submit' for the
women, I have not the foggiest idea,'' Cox said. ``There's a whole
lot more to this amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   Reading from the statement, he said, ``A husband and wife are of
equal worth before God. A husband is to love his wife as Christ
loved the church.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox said that although the statement has prompted criticism, it
is based on Scripture and is therefore nothing new.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have said is we as Christians have a responsibility to
live according to the word of God,'' Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   The books of Ephesians and Colossians both mention submission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands,'' is the
beginning of both the 22nd verse of Ephesians' fifth chapter and
the 18th verse of Colossians' third chapter, according to the King
James Bible. Both passages go on to mention husbands' obligations
to their wives.
</P>
<P>
   Ephesians 5:25 says: ``Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ
also loved the church, and gave himself for it,'' and Colossians
3:19 says: ``Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against
them,'' according to the King James Bible.
</P>
<P>
   The Southern Baptist Convention's adoption of the submission
statement has proved controversial, though. Most of the 16,000
women gathered Saturday in North Carolina for a ``Renewing the
Heart'' rally roared their approval when a speaker asked if they
agreed with it. The gathering drew women from 44 states.
</P>
<P>
   Kim and Bob Hewitt of Alpharetta, who attended Cox's church
Sunday, said they approve of the statement. When they married two
years ago Kim Hewitt included the words ``love, honor and obey'' in
her vows.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's respect for your husband,'' she said, giving her
definition of submission.
</P>
<P>
   Cox says that during wedding ceremonies he performs, he stresses
the grooms' obligations toward their brides.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's to provide for her, he is to nurture her, he is to care
for her, he is to guide her, he is to nourish her along in her
spiritual walk,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Radio City Music Hall, one of New York City's more
enduring show-business icons, will be closed for at least six
months next year for a $30 million restoration, the most extensive
in its 65-year history.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Radio City's art-deco opulence and theatrical
spectacles attract 2 million visitors a year, its operator,
Cablevision Systems Corp., is convinced that its power as a tourist
destination and brand name has not been fully exploited.
</P>
<P>
   So while Radio City will be painstakingly restored for live
theater _ the Rockettes included _ it will also become a production
center for television specials. And Cablevision is planning to
expand the Radio City name to a cable channel, a record label and
an FM radio station.
</P>
<P>
   The renovation is to take place from March to September, during
which Cablevision plans to restore Radio City's block-long marquee,
with its six miles of red-and-blue neon tubing, and the legendary
backstage hydraulic system, which has transported elephants,
Rockettes and whole orchestras across and under the stage.
</P>
<P>
   According to a plan that is still evolving, Cablevision will
also replace seats, carpets, wallpaper and curtains; clean and
restore murals; enhance lighting and sound systems, and restore the
auditorium's pipe organ.
</P>
<P>
   A vast new gold-threaded curtain for the 144-foot-wide stage is
to be embedded with fiber-optic lighting that will generate a
rainbow of changing colors and patterns. This will allow both the
curtain and the organ to be used in preperformance shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the work is finished it will be like going back six
decades and taking a walk through time,'' said James Dolan, the
chief executive of Cablevision. ``We're going to take the building
back to 1932, but bring its infrastructure forward past the year
2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Last December, Cablevision leased Radio City Music Hall from its
owner, Tishman Speyer Properties, and bought the rights to both the
Rockettes and the Christmas pageant from Mitsubishi Estate Co.
Cablevision operates cable channels, produces television shows and
provides cable service to 2.6 million customers in the metropolitan
area.
</P>
<P>
   The music hall's revival is part of the master plan of Jerry
Speyer, the manager and part owner of Rockefeller Center, to
resuscitate what he has called ``the world's most famous address.''
He sees Radio City driving the center's nighttime activities in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   As architects for the project, Radio City has hired Hardy
Holzman Pfeiffer Associates, which oversaw the complex renovations
of the New Amsterdam and New Victory theaters on 42nd Street, and
the Rockwell Group, which has designed projects ranging from 60
Planet Hollywoods to Manhattan's Monkey Bar and Nobu restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the most comprehensive renewals ever undertaken
in a theater,'' said Hugh Hardy of Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer.
</P>
<P>
   Dolan said the cost of the project would be $30 million to $40
million.
</P>
<P>
   The exterior of the music hall and its public interior spaces,
as well as some furnishings, were designated New York City
landmarks in 1979 and the structure was designated a National
Historic Landmark in 1987. As a result of the city's landmarks
designation, the renovation work will require the approval of the
Landmarks Preservation Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The music hall renovation is part of an ambitious plan of
Cablevision _ which owns the 18,000-seat Madison Square Garden and
its 5,600-seat theater, and leases the 5,901-seat music hall _ to
consolidate the booking of its entertainment events under Radio
City's management.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our ambition is nothing less than to relaunch Radio City as
the most prestigious, innovative and active theater in the world,''
said Arlen Kantarian, president of Radio City Productions. ``Radio
City is one of the most underdeveloped of brand names,'' said
Kantarian, who is expected to head Radio City Entertainment, a new
corporate entity that will centralize entertainment-event booking
for the Music Hall and Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Renovation plans also include a suite of television studios,
possibly in the nonlandmarked space above the auditorium that now
contains rehearsal halls for the Rockettes. The studios will be
used by Cablevision's American Movie Classics and Bravo cable
channels; the classic movie channel has already been taping its
introductory segments in the Music Hall.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Plans for restoration of the marquee include a return to the
sequential lighting of the ``Radio City'' sign, which originally
blinked letter by letter. The architects will propose searchlights
to give the marquee opening-night glamour and will seek to install
touch-screen computer kiosks under the marquee that would offer
theatergoers information about future performances.
</P>
<P>
   The 60-year-old backstage hydraulic system with its three
70-foot-long elevators, which was studied by Navy aircraft-carrier
designers during World War II, has long since run out of
replacement parts. It will be overhauled and reconfigured so that
the mechanical systems can be computer-controlled, making possible
more stage effects of the kind used in Broadway shows like
``Phantom of the Opera'' and ``Beauty and the Beast.''
</P>
<P>
   New carpeting and fabric panels are planned to replace the
originals in the Grand Foyer, and the three-story-tall mural by
Ezra Winter, which looms above the grand staircase, will be cleaned
of decades of grime and varnish and restored. Brighter lighting
will be installed, and five new concession stands are planned for
the ground floor and mezzanine levels.
</P>
<P>
   Computer-controlled lighting with color-sequenced programming is
planned to illuminate the auditorium's ``sunrise'' rings, which
radiate from the proscenium arch.
</P>
<P>
   Architects are also drawing up plans for a restaurant on the
mezzanine space overlooking Avenue of the Americas, to be called
The Radio City Club or The Marquee Club.

FEDERAL GRANTS TO COLLEGES ARE RESURGING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala., Maine, Va.)  (lb) 
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This year the University of West Alabama will receive a grant of
$300,000 from the Department of Agriculture for research on the
disposal of poultry carcasses. The University of Maine will receive
$220,000, also from the Department of Agriculture, for research on
low-bush blueberries.
</P>
<P>
   These grants are among more than 200 federal outlays set aside
by Congress for specific colleges and universities without benefit
of competitive or merit review. Although the grants may or may not
meet genuine public needs, they are widely derided as pork-barrel
boondoggles.
</P>
<P>
   All told, Congress authorized $495 million for academic
earmarking for fiscal 1998, according to the 10th annual study of
the practice by The Chronicle of Higher Education, an independent
national newspaper. President Clinton, making limited use of the
line-item veto, reduced the appropriation to $483 million. The June
19 issue of The Chronicle, which reports on the study, will be on
newsstands beginning Monday.
</P>
<P>
   After appropriations dipped to $296 million in 1996 as
Republican legislators slashed earmarks as prime examples of
wasteful spending, the practice is on the rise again, according to
The Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   The peak, according to The Chronicle, came in 1993, when the
value of earmarks was placed at $763 million. Over the last decade,
nearly $5 billion has been spent on such projects.
</P>
<P>
   University leaders whose institutions benefit from earmarking
were muted in their criticism. Cornelius Pings, president of the
Association of American Universities, which has traditionally
opposed earmarking, said the increase was ``a bit troubling, but
not alarming.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All colleges and universities together receive somewhere
between $15 billion and $16 billion from the federal government,''
Pings said. ``Earmarking accounts for only 3 percent of that
total.'' The other 97 percent, he explained, is for competitively
reviewed projects.
</P>
<P>
   James Savage, an associate professor of government at the
University of Virginia and the author of a book called ``Funding
Science in America: Congress, Universities and the Politics of the
Academic Pork Barrel,'' to be published next year by the Cambridge
University Press, said that the reason for the increase in
earmarking was that Congress has more money available because of
the booming economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more they have, the more they get to earmark,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Savage said the solution to the problem lay in electing
lawmakers who would fight the practice.
</P>
<P>
   But academicians must also be held responsible, Savage said.
``Peer review is the norm in academic life,'' he said. ``We have it
in tenure, promotion, allocation of resources and publication.
There is no such norm in politics, where the object is to get
elected and then help your friends. The leaders of higher education
must educate the politicians.''

GOLDMAN, SACHS EXPECTED TO BECOME A PUBLIC COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., Wall Street's last big private
investment bank and by many measures its most successful, plans to
announce Monday that it will end its 130-year partnership and
become a public company, according to people close to the firm.
</P>
<P>
   That decision would make Goldman a prime player in the financial
industry's rush to consolidate, a trend that has turned nearly all
of America's venerable finance partnerships _ which each formerly
had a distinct culture and investment philosophy _ into homogenized
financial giants in less than two decades.
</P>
<P>
   It would also be an indicator that some of Wall Street's
savviest financiers believe there may never be a better time to
capitalize on the long-running bull stock market and on the
investing public's love of finance houses with global ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the stock-market prices of some other big investment
houses, a decision to become a public company by issuing shares of
stock could give the company a value as high as $30 billion and
give each of the partners a stake that might eventually exceed $100
million.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman's six-man executive committee was still meeting late
Sunday night to work out an agreement in principle to end the
private partnership by selling at least part of the company.
</P>
<P>
   People at Goldman said that the firm's 190 partners, in weekend
meetings that they described as passionate, had been almost evenly
divided about the merits of ending the private partnership _ torn
between the near-term riches and global heft that would almost
certainly follow and the satisfaction of working within a
tight-knit group whose decisions are not subject to the whims of
outside shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the partners left the final decision in the hands of the
firm's six top executives, knowing full well that most of the
executive committee favored the plan to go public.
</P>
<P>
   As the firm's partners and 11,000 employees around the world
anxiously awaited the results of the executive committee's
deliberations Sunday night, Jon S. Corzine and Henry M. Paulson
Jr., Goldman's co-chairmen and chief executives, had scheduled a
conference call with Goldman employees for early Monday morning.
Barring last-minute surprises, the two were expected to announce
the decision in principle to take the company public, with details
to be presented to the full partnership in a month or so.
</P>
<P>
   Even though that decision would mark the end of a private firm
founded in New York in 1869 by a German Jewish immigrant, Marcus
Goldman, the game of musical chairs now played on Wall Street is a
global one, and Goldman is determined to keep its seat. It is
enjoying record profits, earning about $1 billion in each of the
last two quarters. But it does not have stock, the chosen currency
for mergers and acquisitions, and is now smaller than its leading
rivals. It is also ill-prepared to seize opportunities at a time
when depression-era walls between brokerages, bank and insurance
companies are crumbling.
</P>
<P>
   As a public company, Goldman bankers say they would seek to buy
other U.S. and foreign finance companies. And the firm itself,
considered Wall Street's crown jewel in terms of profitability and
the track records of the companies whose stock offerings it
underwrites, will likely receive a flood of merger proposals _ some
of which might allow Goldman to take over a larger commercial bank
or insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   Also underlying the decision is a fear that if the company does
not go public during the current bull market, Goldman partners
might lose an opportunity to capture the extraordinary value the
market now places on well run securities companies.
</P>
<P>
   To some market watchers, Goldman's decision might be taken as a
sign that the partners believe the stock market has reached a high.
Indeed, Morgan Stanley and Bear Stearns, two rival investment
banks, first issued shares to the public in 1986 and 1987, close to
the peak of that era's bull market.

</P>
<P>
   Goldman has long engaged in its own version of Hamlet _ to go
public or not to go public _ deciding half a dozen times, most
recently in 1996, to stay private. But people at the bank say a
confluence of factors, including the bull market, the global
competitive challenge, and the fact that the firm has had two of
the best years in banking history, have now tipped the balance in
favor of ending the partnership.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a clear-cut choice. At their two-day retreat at the
Palisades Executive Conference Center north of New York City on the
Hudson River, a complex patrolled by plain-clothes security guards,
the firm's partners engaged in what was described as a Quaker-style
meeting, where all 190 partners were invited to state their views
about the firm's future.
</P>
<P>
   In a long open session Saturday morning, more than 100 of them
did so, with some later describing this gathering of mostly male
white-shoe bankers as emotional and draining.
</P>
<P>
   ``For people who have devoted their lives to this place it was
exhausting, but in some ways amazing,'' said one person who
attended. ``People did not hold anything back.''
</P>
<P>
   Paulson and Corzine remained officially neutral through the
discussion, said people who attended. But several top partners who
worked with Paulson to devise a strategic plan made strong cases in
favor of taking Goldman public, emphasizing concerns that the
partnership structure is too plodding and cumbersome for a bank
with thousands of employees and the need to make snap decisions in
scores of countries.
</P>
<P>
   Others, including John L. Thornton, a member of the executive
committee, spoke with equal determination against any public sale
of shares, people there said. The prime fear was that a public
company could never replicate the close-knit culture of a
partnership, where financial rewards are measured in lifetimes
instead of months.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, no formal vote was taken. The partners were given a
questionnaire in which they were asked to state their views on a
public offering and several other issues, each requiring a written
answer. Partners left the meeting Saturday afternoon without
knowing the results of that poll. Reviewing the comments was left
up to the executive committee, which met Sunday and continued
discussion over dinner Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   At the weekend retreat, Goldman executives presented several
ways of valuing the company, and their estimates covered a wide
range of $15 billion to $35 billion, people who attended said. The
firm has not yet developed a detailed plan for going public and
would not put a price tag on the firm until they do.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts expect that the firm is likely to value itself
between $25 billion and $30 billion, considered a rich but not
implausible figure given the way the market values other securities
companies. But some bankers argue with that figure and say that
Goldman, given its reliance on some outside investment capital as
well as partners' capital, would have to settle for less, perhaps
$20 billion to $25 billion.
</P>
<P>
   How the firm spreads that wealth is likely to be a matter of
discussion in the weeks ahead. But several people within the firm
expect that with a possible valuation of $30 billion, existing
partners will take between $20 billion to $22 billion, or an
average of $105 million to $115 million apiece. Goldman's 6,000
non-partner executives would split between $6 billion and $8
billion, this person said. The rest would be reserved for the
firm's current outside investors and limited partners.
</P>
<P>
   Several at Goldman have stressed that the plan to go public is
not only about how to stuff the already bulging wallets of top
executives. It is also about how to prepare the firm for a new era
_ one in which only the most global banks with the resources to
fight for business in any major economy will prosper.

CALIFORNIA WARNS: SMOKING IS HAZARDOUS TO YOUR SEX LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By NINA SIEGAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ At a gala event, men in bow ties and women in
evening gowns eye one another across an elegant hall. The most
debonair young man gracefully lifts a cigarette to his lips. As
soon as it is lighted, it goes limp.
</P>
<P>
   The camera pans to take in a group of women laughing, and a
voiceover says: ``Now that medical researchers believe cigarettes
are a leading cause of impotence, you're going to be looking at
smoking a little differently.'' The tag line flashes on the screen:
``Cigarettes. Still think they're sexy?''
</P>
<P>
   This new advertisement, which began airing on television
stations throughout California last week, was developed in January,
long before the impotence drug Viagra made a splash in the national
media. The advent of the drug, however, is expected to turn this
advertising spot into the most topical of the state's new dispatch
of striking, savvy commercials and billboards designed to curtail
smoking. It is accompanied by a print advertisement depicting an
attractive man with a limp cigarette hanging from his lips.
</P>
<P>
   This is only the latest assault in California's blitz on
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   In January, smoking was banned in bars and clubs throughout the
state, and individual cities are cracking down on smoking in public
places. Santa Cruz recently prohibited smoking in public bus and
movie lines, and Palo Alto curtailed smoking in ticket lines and
within 20 feet of building entrances. On June 4, San Francisco
moved to prohibit smoking in some public parks, following the lead
of Davis, where smoking is banned in public gardens and near
children's play areas.
</P>
<P>
   Some Californians think the latest measures are extreme. But the
state's decadelong assault on smoking may be working: Although 25
percent of all American adults are smokers, only 18 percent of
adult Californians smoke, and the state now has the second-lowest
adult smoking rate in the nation, after Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Through years of marketing studies, the state Department of
Health has learned that to some people, a flaccid cigarette is a
more horrifying image than a blackened lung. Kim Belshe, director
of the California Department of Health Services, which developed
the campaign, hopes it will be effective in reaching men between
the ages of 18 and 30, a group that has been particularly
intractable when it comes to changing smoking habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our experience has demonstrated that warning these guys that
smoking will affect their health later in life has not been a very
effective inducement to quit,'' Ms. Belshe said. ``Maybe warning
them about the effects on their sex lives will be more powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   Research showing the link between impotence and smoking is not
new. In 1994, The American Journal of Epidemiology published a
study of 4,462 Vietnam veterans between the ages of 31 and 49 that
found smokers 50 percent more likely to be impotent than
nonsmokers. That same year, results of the Massachusetts Male Aging
Study, reported in The Journal of Urology, indicated that smoking
could worsen existing cardiovascular problems that lead to
impotence.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Financing for the new California campaign comes from a 25-cent
tax on each pack of cigarettes, mandated by state voters in 1988
through a ballot initiative known as Proposition 99. Since the
initiative took effect, Ms. Belshe said, the state has spent about
$1 billion to counter the effects of tobacco advertising, more than
the combined anti-smoking expenditures of all other states in the
nation. In the past 10 years, according to the state health
department, California has seen a 30 percent drop in smoking among
adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could wave my magic wand and make sure that every state
was required to use an ad campaign just like California's, you
would have such a marked decline in tobacco use it would make your
head spin,'' said Ahron Leichtman, executive director of Citizens
for a Tobacco-Free Society, a nonprofit advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   Others are less satisfied with California's performance. ``Their
anti-industry ads are about as strong as the cigarette dangling out
of the mouth of the person in the impotence ad,'' said Stanton
Glantz, a professor of medicine at the University of California at
San Francisco. He said that in the past few years the state had
been unwilling to go after the tobacco industry directly in its
advertising campaign, and as a result the rapid decline in
cigarette consumption experienced in the early 1990s has flattened
out.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, Ms. Belshe said. ``Exposing the industry is absolutely
the center of our campaign.''

   SANDTON, South Africa _ ``What tree is that?'' calls Diane
Sheard, environmental education officer at the Reitfontein Nature
Reserve in the leafy Johannesburg suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blue gum!'' her fourth-through-sixth-graders shout back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where is it from?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Australia!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we like it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No!''
</P>
<P>
   The Redhill Enviro Club is out for its Friday afternoon outing,
doing what so many budding environmentalists do here _ ripping up
plants. They won't chop down this eucalyptus tree today, because
it's 6 feet around. But they will don their mothers' gardening
gloves and tear up a lovely swath of flowering lantana.
</P>
<P>
   About 750 miles to the south, Rayno Frans is being dropped off
by helicopter for a week in the Riviersonderenberge Mountains east
of Cape Town. Frans, 27, is in an elite unit of the Ministry of
Water and Forestry Affairs. Bivouacking in the wild, he and nine
other environmental commandos work the peaks with axes and chain
saws, rappelling down sheer cliffs to stalk their prey. Their name:
The Alien Hit Squad. Their mission: kill pine trees.
</P>
<P>
   There's something different about environmentalism in South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   While American and European children get ``green'' environmental
educations that turn them into tree-huggers who believe every
sapling is special, South Africans get a different perspective on
nature. The environment here is under threat not so much from the
smokestacks and parking lots of heavily industrialized countries,
but from ``exotics'' _ aliens from afar bent on stealing the
nation's water and driving out its native vegetation.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing irrational in this fear. The assault from
America, Europe and Australia is very real. Because Africa's animal
life _ from lions to crocodiles to malarial mosquitoes _ appears so
ferocious, many foreigners assume the whole environment is rugged.
In fact, the African landscape is quite fragile.
</P>
<P>
   The stunted thorn trees of the savannas, adapted to drought,
cannot compete with foreign giants like eucalyptuses and willows
with their deep taproots. Nor can they live beneath the pines that,
freed from the annual slowdown of snowy European and American
winters, grow wildly and blot out the sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have invader problems in Australia and California,'' said
Cobus Meiring, a spokesman for the Ministry of Water Affairs and
Forestry. ``But nothing on this scale.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly fragile is the Cape Town area. There are more
species of fynbos on the tiny Cape Peninsula than in all the
British Isles. Fynbos is a sort of multihued gorse _ a short,
tough-leafed plant that thrives on summer fog. But along nearly all
the Cape's streams, it has been destroyed, pushed out by black
wattles, Port Jackson trees and Australian myrtle.
</P>
<P>
   And, as if choking off the native growth weren't bad enough, the
aliens suck up Africa's most precious resource: water. In some
watersheds, creek flow has been reduced by up to 60 percent, said
Christo Marais, a fynbos expert for Cape Nature Conservation, a
government environmental agency.
</P>
<P>
   Fynbos uses little water. But big aliens can absorb and
``sweat'' up to 500 quarts a day into the air. That dries up the
water tables that humans rely on for drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   If a satellite photo could name species, it would show that most
of South Africa is covered with alien vegetation, virtually all of
it deliberately introduced. The vast corn and wheat crops north of
the Orange River are foreign imports, as are the wide lawns of the
suburbs, the purple jacarandas decorating Pretoria and the millions
upon millions of pines planted by timber and paper companies on the
south coast and in the Drakensberg Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The ministry is careful to say that those aliens are OK _ they
provide food and jobs. It's only when they get out of control that
they are a problem. But plants get out of control so easily here.
</P>
<P>
   Even the national parks and the vast Karoo semidesert have areas
overrun by Mexican prickly pear. Ms. Sheard even has it on the roof
of her nature center here in Sandton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terrible, terrible plant,'' she said. ``We had it on
the grounds, so we chopped it up and threw it on the roof _ and new
buds shot up out of the dead pieces. Now we have to inject it with
poisons.''
</P>
<P>
   To clear watershed areas of aliens, the Ministry of Water
Affairs and Forestry has created South Africa's biggest public
works program. Only 2 years old, it already employs 40,000 people,
all from the poorest communities, to clear trees and brush for
about $6 a day.
</P>
<P>
   The best try out for the Alien Hit Squads. There, they can earn
$14 or more _ but pride is also part of the pay package.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guys put on their ropes and climbing gear and walk around
the townships like they're Indiana Jones,'' said Stephen Lamb, who
runs the squads. Along with mountaineering skills, they also get
lessons in running small businesses. The aim of the program is to
turn them into independent contractors, able to not only clear
vegetation, but build mountain trails, lead tourist hikes and so
forth.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The hit squads have to kill all the pines along the crests of
the mountains, Lamb said, or they will reseed the valleys below and
undo all the work of the bigger teams.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how logical the need to fight the foreign hordes is,
there is no doubt that couching eco-enlightenment as a battle cry
somehow appeals to the South African psyche. Anti-immigrant
feelings related to humans are already strong here, and South
Africans come to revile immigrant plants easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alien plants are thirsty enemies,'' explains a comic book for
schoolchildren. ``Give aliens the chop!'' commands a botanical
garden poster showing how to identify and kill them.
</P>
<P>
   Not only plants are targeted.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you find one of these guys in a stream here,'' a guide at a
reptile park told his audience recently as he displayed a North
American painted turtle, ``you have my permission to take a rock
and bash in its skull. I'm a conservationist, but I'm a
conservationist of African species. This is an alien.''
</P>
<P>
   In upmarket suburbs like Sandton, xenophobia takes on a more
gracious air. There are ``indigenous only'' nurseries. At
Christmastime, they refuse to sell cedars or firs, saying their
silly customers have been brainwashed to think Tannenbaum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your perception of a Christmas tree is programmed,'' said
Andrea Hepplewhite, an owner of Witkoppen Wildflowers here. ``I've
used a 6-foot baobab tree.'' And of course, indigenous trees are
better at attracting indigenous birds.
</P>
<P>
   Even more bizarrely, South Africans boast of finding uses for
alien corpses. A grocery advertises ``barbecue charcoal made from
invader blackthorn.'' Curio shops sell stationery made from Port
Jackson trees chopped down by the ministry's teams. And in the Cape
Town aquarium's ``World of Water'' exhibit is a picture of Kader
Asmal, the Minister of Water Affairs and Forestry himself, posing
on a fanciful bentwood bench. Its builders flank him, brandishing a
saw and an ax. The caption says it is ``made from alien wattle.''
</P>
<P>
   When South Africans are asked why they are so bloodthirsty about
aliens, they seem mystified.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought every country had invasives they were trying to get
rid of,'' Ms. Sheard said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it vents a little aggression,'' said Lamb. ``That
gung-ho thing _ give them the chop _ is kind of a marketing
strategy too.''
</P>
<P>
   If that's what it is, it works.
</P>
<P>
   Did Alyssa Rawnsley, 9, enjoy her afternoon at the nature
reserve killing aliens?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yes,'' she said. ``It's like ``Independence Day'' _ only
with plants.''

SPORTS COLUMN: EMOTIONAL MAJOR LEAGUE DEBUT FOR LEDEE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CLAIRE SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One nice thing about a season in which the Yankees
have all but taken care of the big picture before mid-June is that
their runaway success allows time for the little portraits that put
a human face on what is otherwise a relentless machine.
</P>
<P>
   That was the case Sunday when the Yankees, en route to their
major league-best 47th victory in 61 games, enjoyed yet another of
those poignant touches that have helped differentiate the teams of
the 1990s in the Bronx from all the previous ``Damn Yankees''
successes most everyone loved to hate.
</P>
<P>
   This particular nice touch was painted by Ricky Ledee, a
24-year-old who seemingly spent a lifetime in the minor leagues
after signing with the Yankees at age 16. After being called up
from Class AAA Columbus last week, he made his major league debut
Sunday in the Yankees' 4-2 victory over the Cleveland Indians at
Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It took a lot of injuries to make the debut possible. Then it
took two torturous rainouts to make the reward at the end of a
nerve-racking weekend that much more palpable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they might send me back,'' Ledee said. But it was
real. Ledee played a major league game. And when it happened, the
players in a franchise more associated with Hall of Fame
accomplishments and World Series moments paused in appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You root for anyone who is called up to do well,'' said Derek
Jeter, whose major league debut seemingly came eons ago _ in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this was special for me, personally, because I played with
Ricky in the minors in 1992. We've played together for a while.
He's a quality person, so I am pulling for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's tale wasn't necessarily as gripping as the drama being
provided by Orlando (El Duque) Hernandez, the pitcher who
kick-started his American dream by engineering a high-seas escape
from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Ledee's story will probably never attract the attention of
Hollywood as did the saga of Joe Torre managing in his first
postseason against the backdrop of the search for a new heart for
his brother Frank.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't even provide the sort of comic relief that usually
accompanies any David Cone or David Wells saga.
</P>
<P>
   But Ledee, waiting all these years, will take it. For posterity,
for the fulfillment of a dream little boys still dare to wish come
true.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I know why everybody wants to be a Yankee,'' said Ledee,
who wonderfully wears his emotions on his sleeve and doesn't care
if his eyes brim over.
</P>
<P>
   Mention the opportunity, created when Bernie Williams was
disabled because of a sprained knee last week, and Ledee chokes up.
Speak of Ledee's father, Antonio, who encouraged him to play only
to die four years before Ledee signed, and the outfielder can
barely find enough words to show how much his father was a part of
this debut.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted me to be a professional ballplayer,'' Ledee said.
</P>
<P>
   How many minutes of the 2-hour-48-minute game did he remember
that?
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time, every time,'' Ledee said quietly.
</P>
<P>
   Thus Ledee was awash with emotion as well as the cheers of 25
family members from New York, New Jersey and his native Puerto Rico
in a game in which he went 1 for 3.
</P>
<P>
   He took care of some admitted nerves by getting the first major
league hit out of the way quickly, sending the first pitch he saw
from Cleveland's starter, Jaret Wright, into right field for a
single in the second inning. Ledee also walked, in the fourth. He
patrolled his left-field position well, making his first major
league catch special by grabbing a ball hit to the warning track by
Mark Whiten in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked comfortable out there,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   Ledee avoided being the next Matt Luke, the outfielder who was
called up by the Yankees last year, then was snowed out of his only
starting assignment, never to get a chance again.
</P>
<P>
   Now only time will tell whether he will be the next Andy Fox or,
even better, the next El Duque.
</P>
<P>
   Fox was the infielder who was asked to join the Yankees for a
cup of coffee in 1996 only to stay for most of that championship
season. All Hernandez has done is make two starts so impressive
that he dislodged Ramiro Mendoza from the starting rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try not to project too much because there are obvious
things that are going to happen,'' Torre said. ``Bernie's going to
come back. Chili Davis is going to come back. But sure, you want to
have someone do well, to make themselves necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Ledee now has a chance to do just that. His first game gives him
if not a long-term right, then at least an opportunity to try.
</P>
<P>
   Luke was watching his former teammate take that first step as a
Yankee that he was denied.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something you anticipate your whole life,'' said Luke,
now a reserve with Cleveland. ``You think about it every day in the
minor leagues. When it's postponed like that, it can be a little
bit of a letdown. But to know you're eventually going to get it is
rewarding.''
</P>
<P>
   Ledee knew because, Luke said, ``Ricky's a quality player, he's
a hard worker and there are only good things to come.''

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ As California prepares to dismantle bilingual
education for immigrant children, New York, New Jersey and
Connecticut are moving in the opposite direction, with plans to
improve and even expand bilingual and intensive English programs in
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   One day after Californians voted last week to effectively end
the instruction of immigrant children in their native languages,
education officials in New Jersey approved new rules meant to
strengthen it, including one that would allow bilingual classes for
children as young as 3. And in New York, education officials are
planning to train more bilingual teachers and allow some students
to take college-preparatory examinations in their native languages.
</P>
<P>
   But while education officials in both states fiercely defend
bilingual education, they also agree with critics who say that many
students learn English too slowly. That is a particular concern in
New York City, where educators, politicians and parents have
debated for decades whether bilingual programs help or hinder the
mainstreaming of immigrant children.
</P>
<P>
   The debate has spread to Connecticut, where the legislature
recently appointed a task force to evaluate bilingual programs and
determine whether students were spending too much time in them. But
instead of limiting the time that students can spend in bilingual
programs, Connecticut will probably experiment with programs that
have worked in other states, task force members said.
</P>
<P>
   While New York and New Jersey have a history of providing
generously for immigrants, educators in both states say their
embrace of bilingual education is more pragmatic than
philosophical. Both states are introducing new curriculum standards
and more rigorous standardized tests, so immigrant students need to
learn English more quickly and thoroughly, the educators said. At
the same time, they said, many students need to study mathematics,
science and social studies in their native languages to grasp the
subject matter and meet the tougher standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no longer enough to finish a bilingual education program
and have marginal skills,'' said Richard P. Mills, New York's state
education commissioner. ``The expectations are now much higher. So
we're having a very focused effort to understand what works out
there and what doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   While the move to eliminate bilingual education in California
has rekindled the debate here, people on both sides say bilingual
education has had so many ardent defenders in the New York
metropolitan region, for so many years, that it is in no danger of
extinction. The teachers unions in the region are more united in
their support of bilingual education than those in California. And
advocacy groups for immigrants, which have waged successful court
battles to expand bilingual education in New York, have worked
consistently over the years to win parents and politicians to their
cause.
</P>
<P>
   This in stark contrast to California, where the rejection of
bilingual education is one of several recent initiatives that have
put immigrants and their supporters on the defensive. Politicians
in the Northeast have been less inclined to play to anti-immigrant
sentiments, and the champions of bilingual schooling say there is
no reason to expect things to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a totally different atmosphere out here, with divisive
policies and leadership on issues related to race and education,''
said Thomas Saenz, a lawyer for the Mexican-American Legal Defense
Fund, which fought to preserve bilingual education in California.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of bilingual education say it is on safer ground in New
York, New Jersey and Connecticut not only because of its vocal
supporters in the region but also because the three states do not
allow voters to decide education policy through referendums, as
California does.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legislators would have to take on the teachers' unions,
which they hardly ever do, and on top of that, they'd have to take
on the ethnic groups,'' said Jorge Amselle, a spokesman for the
Center for Equal Opportunity in Washington, a conservative research
organization that is opposed to bilingual education. ``The only
time you're going to see serious change in the Northeast is when
you see big grass-roots efforts that will serve as cover for
legislators who want the change.''

</P>
<P>
   Californians passed Proposition 227, which limits help for
non-native speakers to a year of intensive English instruction,
with 61 percent of the vote. But while a growing number of that
state's Hispanic immigrants have expressed deep concerns about
bilingual education, fewer than 4-in-10 of those who voted favored
the proposition, in part because most of California's Hispanic
lawmakers lobbied heavily against it.
</P>
<P>
   Still, immigrant parents in California have protested more
aggressively than those in the Northeast, who have yet to speak
with a unified voice on the issue. Critics of bilingual education
say that while many parents in the Northeast are convinced that it
slows their children's progress in English, they are loath to
challenge advocacy groups and educators.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parents get intimidated when so-called experts tell them
bilingual education is the right thing to do,'' said Sister Kathy
Maire, an organizer for East Brooklyn Congregations who helped a
group of immigrant parents file an unsuccessful lawsuit to curtail
bilingual education in New York state in 1996. ``But it's very fair
to say they understand that their kids are not learning English.
And it's very fair to say they are greatly disturbed.''
</P>
<P>
   The renewed attention to bilingual education comes as immigrant
populations in all three states are growing and school districts
are struggling to find enough certified bilingual instructors. New
York, where 18.7 percent of the population is foreign born,
compared with 25.1 percent in California, spends $88 million a year
on bilingual education for 194,000 students, most of whom live in
New York City.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey, where 15.6 percent of the population is foreign
born, spends $57 million a year on bilingual programs for 48,000
students. About 9 percent of the population is foreign born in
Connecticut, which spends $20 million a year on bilingual education
for 19,300 students.
</P>
<P>
   In all three states, the vast majority of students in bilingual
programs are Hispanic. Mandarin Chinese, Haitian, Korean, Polish,
Arabic, Portuguese and Urdu are also among the most common native
languages.
</P>
<P>
   Of the three states, New Jersey has taken the most concrete
steps toward improving and expanding bilingual and intensive
English programs. On June 3, the New Jersey Board of Education
voted to require school districts to monitor the achievement of
bilingual students to ensure that they meet the state's new
curriculum standards. It also voted to require districts to provide
bilingual or intensive English programs for preschool pupils not
proficient in English.
</P>
<P>
   The board also changed the wording of the state's bilingual
education code to encourage districts to provide instruction in
English as a second language for more than 150 minutes a week,
which is the minimum requirement in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Iliana Okum, who oversees bilingual education for the New Jersey
Department of Education, said the state's programs worked because
more than 90 percent of the bilingual students passed proficiency
tests in three years or less. Although the state in 1996 gave
parents more leeway in deciding whether to remove their children
from bilingual programs, less than 2 percent of the parents have
done so, Ms. Okum said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody is generally pleased,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the state Board of Regents voted last year to allow
students who enter the country in the ninth grade or later to take
most Regents exams in Spanish, Russian, Chinese, Haitian Creole and
Korean. It also voted to require bilingual students to take the
Regents English exam, which will soon be a graduation requirement,
in English. Mills, the education commissioner, asked state
education officials last fall to determine whether bilingual
students needed more intensive English instruction to meet the new
curriculum standards and graduation requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ``The increase in requirements is humongous for somebody who is
learning English for the first time,'' said Alan Ray, a spokesman
for the state's Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   The task force will submit recommendations to the Board of
Regents next month, and Mills said they would probably include
increasing the minimum amount of time _ currently 180 minutes per
week _ that bilingual students spend in intensive English classes.
Other goals are to train bilingual teachers in the new curriculum
standards and to increase the number of teachers certified to teach
bilingual classes. Only 30 percent of the bilingual teachers are
now certified as such, Mills said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that while some students, particularly at the
middle-school level, were staying in bilingual programs far too
long, most finished in three years or less. Students who want to
stay in bilingual programs longer than three years must file for an
extension, and in the 1997-98 school year, only 12 percent of
bilingual students in New York City did so, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mills said he thought that California's strategy in Proposition
227 was ``a sound-bite solution.'' By examining bilingual programs
around the nation, he said, New York hopes to collect enough data
to determine what methods of teaching English work best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not satisfied with the data we have,'' Mills said.
``Bilingual education seems to work under certain circumstances,
but they are very demanding conditions. We have an obligation to
think this through because children who don't speak English, like
other children, must meet higher standards.''

   CALIF-WATERWAR (Keeler, Calif.) _ The dry bed of Owens Lake is
all that is left of a once-fertile farming and mining community.
There is not the slightest mystery about where the water went: For

aqueduct to sustain the artificially verdant sprawl of Los Angeles.

JORDAN STEALS THE SHOW AS BULLS WIN SIXTH TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Utah)  (lb) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Eight years ago, a sky-walking shooting guard
emerged from the shadows of Larry Bird and Magic Johnson, grabbed
the torch and gracefully elevated toward the rim. A new order had
come to what was becoming America's game.
</P>
<P>
   Six championships later, Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls
refuse to come down.
</P>
<P>
   They became champions of the National Basketball Association for
the first time that night against the Los Angeles Lakers, and they
were champions again Sunday night. Overcoming the resilient Utah
Jazz in the league's loudest arena, the Bulls took Game 6 of the
National Basketball Association finals, 87-86, and won the series,
four games to two.
</P>
<P>
   It gave them their sixth title in eight seasons and left the
rest of the league admiring a glowing dynasty, one that gets better
with age.
</P>
<P>
   With the Bulls trailing, 86-85, Jordan stripped Utah's Karl
Malone of the ball and hit a jumper at the other end of the court
with 5.2 seconds left for the last of his 45 points. The next
highest scorer for the Bulls was Toni Kukoc, with 15 points.
</P>
<P>
   Failing to clinch at home in Game 5 on Friday, Jordan and this
current crop of Bulls seized the momentum less than 48 hours after
they lost it at the United Center. In Game 6, they came back
against a team many believed had Chicago's number entering the
league championship series.
</P>
<P>
   And they did it without the full services of Scottie Pippen, who
left the game with 4 minutes 56 seconds left in the first quarter
because of back spasms. Pippen, who received treatment and returned
to start the second half, had received a cortisone shot on Saturday
and went through pregame warm-ups Sunday night looking unsure of
himself.
</P>
<P>
   So Jordan had to be special if not spectacular. His 45 points
came on 15-of-35 shooting, but he was a crucial 12 of 15 from the
free-throw line. Pippen and Ron Harper added 8 points each.
</P>
<P>
   Malone was brilliant in defeat, with 31 points, 11 rebounds and
7 assists. Jeff Hornacek added 17 points for Utah, but John
Stockton was held to just 10 points and 5 assists.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls won their third straight championship for the second
time in the decade. Their two-year gap in 1994 and 1995 came during
Jordan's year-and-a-half experiment with minor-league baseball.
</P>
<P>
   At age 35, Jordan looked as strong and agile as he did the night
in 1991 when he performed a wondrous act of in-air artistry that
has become an indelible image of the NBA finals, rising for a dunk
with his right hand before switching to his left for a layup at the
last possible moment.
</P>
<P>
   He started slowly Sunday night, but eventually took over the
proceedings with his flair and fire.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls bounded out to a 17-8 lead with Pippen in the game,
using a 9-0 run to quiet the Jazz's wild mob at home. But the Jazz
fought back with an 11-1 run of its own, and led by 49-45 at
halftime.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls overcame all kinds of adversity. Beyond a hostile
crowd and Pippen's injury, Harper overcame a stomach ailment.
</P>
<P>
   Harper missed the morning shoot-around because he said he had
eaten some unsatisfactory room-service food from the team hotel. As
usual, it meant Jordan would have to carry the franchise again.
</P>
<P>
   He did.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz led, 70-67, with 8:36 left to play in the game when
Jordan checked back into the game. He had had barely three minutes
of rest, including a timeout. If the Bulls were going to end it,
someone else was going to have to help.
</P>
<P>
   Kukoc quickly came through, dropping in a long 3-pointer from
the left wing to tie the score. At that juncture, it seemed smart
to get Kukoc in the flow.
</P>
<P>
   After all, he had erupted for 30 points in Game 5 and nearly
helped pull out a victory. But Jordan put his head down.
</P>
<P>
   He might have needed his teammates, but he did not care. He
drove the lane. He shot jumpers. If there was a loss, it would be
on him.
</P>
<P>
   Utah entered the fourth period with a surge of adrenaline after
Howard Eisley finally reappeared in the series. The reserve point
guard, who had played so badly behind Stockton, found Antoine Carr
under the basket for a dunk and Adam Keefe for a layup in the
closing seconds of the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Those baskets enabled the Jazz to take a 66-61 lead into the
last 12 minutes of the season.
</P>
<P>
   If Pippen's injury was a bad omen, Jordan's receiving no rest in
the third period was particularly disconcerting. Twice he missed
the front end of free-throw opportunities, and he was being
hammered by the Jazz as he took flight toward the basket.
</P>
<P>
   Going into the fourth quarter, he had played 34 of 36 minutes.
He nearly expended himself in the first half. At the least, his
right arm must have been sore from shooting.
</P>
<P>
   In the best sequence of the series, Malone and Jordan went back
and forth near the end of the second quarter. They were trading
improbable shots on both ends, from every angle available.
</P>
<P>
   A Jordan 3-pointer would be followed by a Malone fallaway on the
baseline. When they were double-covered, they found open teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Malone made 8 of 11 field goals in the first half and continued
his dominance in the third quarter. Luc Longley could not stop him.
Dennis Rodman tried, but ended up doing more theatrical flailing
and bumping than actually defending.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan took 19 shots in the first half. And while nine of them
fell, some were ill advised and forced. It was almost as if he were
worried about Kukoc becoming the go-to guy. The usually serene
Croatian pouted as he walked off the floor at halftime, having
watched Jordan throw up a 3-pointer and a halfcourt shot that both
missed seconds earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz had a chance to create space in the third quarter. Utah
was up by 5 points and appeared ready to go on a run, but poor
execution gave the Bulls a chance to hang around until the end.
</P>
<P>
   This was not how Chicago envisioned things, with Pippen barely
able to bend over and Jordan chucking up everything as if this were
1989 and he had no help. Pippen, in fact, boasted after Game 2 in
Salt Lake City that the Bulls would not return.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get ready for the WNBA season,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls had to come back after all, but they didn't have to
stay long.

SPORTS COLUMN: JORDAN STANDS ALONE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ If this was the end, it looked suspiciously
like the beginning. Michael Jordan against the world, a celebrated
solo act. But even with his odds reduced by age, this wasn't the
place, or the time, for Jordan to surrender pro basketball
supremacy to a couple of reticent stars who only come out to play.
He willed it that way.
</P>
<P>
   He stripped the ball from noble Karl Malone in the post, then
stole the championship hopes of the Utah Jazz. A pullup jump shot
from 18 feet as the Jazz's Byron Russell backed away, fearful of
the drive, nailed down the Chicago Bulls' sixth title of the 1990s
Sunday night at the Delta Center.
</P>
<P>
   Another season ended, another championship won, as if it were
scripted by the writers of Jordan's television commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, it was a flu-ridden Jordan rising out of a sick bed
to carry the Bulls in the game they had to win here. This time, it
was Jordan, at 35 not the high flier he once was, lifting himself
and his team after Scottie Pippen turned up seriously impaired with
an injured back.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-five points, the Bulls' last eight, the crushing jump shot
with 5.2 seconds remaining that won Game 6 by 87-86 and finished,
finally, the long and winding pro basketball season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go ahead, laugh all you want,'' Karl Malone had told the
snickering news media after trustingly revealing how he soothed
himself back in Chicago before his breakout in Game 4. He rode
shotgun with an Illinois state trooper, and went off to help weigh
a few trucks.
</P>
<P>
   No more laughing at Malone, at his hobbies, at the Jazz. But the
truth is, the Jazz had the Bulls right where they wanted them
Sunday night, and let them get away. The overnight analysis of the
finals is this: Utah was a fine challenger, but not a champion.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz couldn't put enough distance between themselves and the
Bulls while Pippen was being worked on in the locker room, couldn't
hold leads in the second half, couldn't execute its half-court
offense when Jordan was lurking, waiting for the chance to strike,
deep into the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tough bunch,'' Jordan graciously called the Jazz, as he
accepted his sixth most valuable player award in as many finals
appearances. But not tough enough for him. Chicago can breathe easy
and begin calling for more, and David Stern can resume hoping that
a more ratings-friendly team than the Jazz will step up or grow up
to carry the torch and the National Basketball Association into the
21st century.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, the owner, Jerry Reinsdorf will turn into Al Capone
if he doesn't come up with about $80 million to underwrite his
current roster for another go-round. No one asks why CEO Jordan
can't take $10 million less so Pippen can get fair market value,
and no one contemplates the impact on the sport's smaller markets
as the larger ones push salaries to unfathomable heights.
</P>
<P>
   That's what this summer's collective bargaining showdown will be
about, how viable an auto dealer entrepreneur such as the Utah
owner, Larry Miller, will in the coming years. How many more
Stocktons and Malones are out there, relishing the thought of
getting away from the big-market glitz? Most of the kids coming in
are blinded by Jordan's fame, and never see themselves spending a
decade or more hidden away where taxis and subways don't roll.
</P>
<P>
   This is Commissioner Stern's delicate balancing act of wanting
his big-ticket teams to produce the ratings the league can crow
about this spring without reaching the point where too many
franchises become the Montreal Expos. How to maintain national _
no, Stern would say global _ interest over the course of a playoff
season that is the equivalent of four consecutive Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The big numbers were being notched courtesy of the Jordan epic,
the possibility of its conclusion, the drama heightening Sunday
night with Pippen in the locker room, doubled over, and the Jazz
pulling ahead. When Jordan exploded for 15 second-quarter points
and a 23-point first half in a shootout with Malone that kept the
crippled Bulls close, you knew he had enough ego to believe he
still had enough left to win. You just wondered if had enough legs.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the first half, as Jordan twice ignored Kukoc and
hoisted 3-pointers, leaving Kukoc shaking his head with his hands
on his hips as the half ended, another thought came to mind. Jordan
obviously was leaving this game to no one, taking himself all the
back to the mid 1980s, trying to win something all by himself.
</P>
<P>
   People always pointed out that he never won a playoff game
before Pippen came along, when he was a one-man team.
</P>
<P>
   He won the game Sunday night. The title. The repeat threepeat,
giving him one more championship in the modern era than Magic
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   He stands alone. If this is the end, then Jordan Sunday night
closed a circle of greatness.

JORDAN PREVAILS EVEN WITH PIPPEN IN PAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ The limping Scottie Pippen worked his way
through the pack surrounding a fatigued but elated Michael Jordan,
and embraced him with the most ginger of hugs when it was over.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it was a most powerful moment for a duo that
may never be together again if the Bulls dismantle. A second later,
Pippen, who played the game with severe back pain, was in tears due
to his emotions as the Bulls celebrated their sixth title in eight
years after Jordan put together a miracle performance that included
45 points. He led the Bulls in winning Game 6 of the National
Basketball Association finals, eliminating the Jazz, 87-86, Sunday
night at the Delta Center.
</P>
<P>
   It may have been Jordan's greatest feat. He had to pull this off
as Pippen played on with his face pinched in pain due to a sore
back that left him limited at best, and absent for much of Game 6.
As much as he means to the Bulls, his problems spread like a drop
of ink in a pool of water during Game 6. Pippen's restricted
effectiveness touched every part of the Bulls' strategy, from the
team's rebounding to its defense, from the offense to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Without Pippen, Jordan was left to fight the fatigue of this
long series and long playoff run. Somehow, he managed to make up
the void left by Pippen. Somehow, Jordan managed to strip Karl
Malone with 10 seconds left, then come down to hit the game-winning
shot with 5.2 seconds to give the Bulls the title. Pippen had a
cortisone shot on Saturday, and felt some relief from the pain in
his back that crept up on him after taking five charges in Game 3.
The discomfort may have had something to do with a 2-of-16
performance in Game 4, an effort that belied a series effort that
had many proclaiming him the most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   Now the player who had been a defensive menace to the Jazz
walked off the floor and disappeared into the tunnel leading to the
locker room with 4 minutes 56 seconds left in the first quarter.
All of the electric-stimulation he had before the game to loosen up
his back had not helped.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen underwent further treatment through the first half. He
returned to start the second half with a wince, only to leave
again. He came back with 9 minutes left in the game. Although he
was severely limited, Pippen's presence meant something. At least
he could function as a decoy.
</P>
<P>
   During Pippen's treatments throughout the game, his absence had
a trickle-down effect on the Bulls that went beyond the extra
minutes Michael Jordan was going to have to absorb. Throughout this
series, Pippen's quickness and defensive instincts had allowed him
to roam around the court like a free safety and disrupt the Jazz's
pick-and-roll.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen's rover status had the Jazz pleading for illegal
defenses. But Pippen had been crafty enough to escape the call. No
other Bull was as clever. Before the end of the first half, the
Bulls were tagged with four illegal defenses. The Jazz connected on
three free throws off the technical fouls called after the first
illegal defense warning.
</P>
<P>
   Without Pippen to help support the offense, coach Phil Jackson
was left to look at a bench of players hardly capable of creating
the kind of shots and making the kind of drives so often associated
with the fluid all-star forward. Neither Jud Buechler nor Scott
Burrell were going to be the answer.
</P>
<P>
   It was going to be up to Jordan to grab the Bulls by the collar
and keep them in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan played all but two minutes in the first half, ending it
by hitting 9 of 19 shots for 23 points to keep the Bulls within
reach of the Jazz, down by just 49-45.
</P>
<P>
   Even when Pippen returned in the third quarter, he was more of a
decoy than a playmaker. The Jazz had to respect his presence, but
Pippen was clearly not himself. That was obvious mid-way through
the third quarter when he missed a layup that normally would have
been made via an explosive dunk.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few minutes later, Pippen left the court and went to the
training room for treatment. Once again, Jordan would have to go it
alone. Jordan has always known how important Pippen has been to his
success and to his teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Scottie Pippen is a major reason why we're here,''
Jordan said before Game 5. ``I think he's a unique and creative
player. The harmony between us is incomparable. You can't compare
it to anything. It's just a rhythm you build with another player.
</P>
<P>
   ``To play without him is like a slap in the face for me.''
</P>
<P>
   This was Jordan, wondering how he would play next year if Pippen
bolted Chicago in free agency. This was before Game 5, when it
seemed as if the duo was destined to walk out of the United Center
Friday night with their sixth title.

factory in Gresik, where workers can earn roughly 35 cents a day
making red plaid dresses for little girls. ``And I'm paying good
wages, at least for around here,'' she says. Just as pressure is
growing in the West against the use of sweatshops in developing

She wants him to grow up to work in a sweatshop. ``He's not going
to get an education,'' says Mrs. Tratiwoon, ``so I don't know
whether he can even get a job like that.'' Indeed, the Asian

fastidious attention to quarterly earnings,'' says Minor. (Peter

EDITORIAL: CHRISTOPHER SHAYS' MOMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, June 15:
</P>
<P>
   When Newt Gingrich was a little-known back-bencher in the House,
he promised open and democratic procedures if the Republicans ever
won control. Last week, as this page warned, the speaker betrayed
those principles and began his filibuster-by-amendment scheme to
block campaign finance legislation. We raise the matter again today
because it is time for reform-minded House members to revive the
petition that forced Gingrich back in April to promise an honest
game.
</P>
<P>
   Getting a majority of House members to demand a vote in defiance
of the leadership is always an uphill battle. But two months ago, a
petition to force a vote on campaign reform got 204 signatures,
just a handful short of the 218 necessary. Alarmed at the signature
campaign's momentum, Gingrich abruptly retreated and promised a
vote. Accepting his word, 13 House members, most of them
Republicans, took their names off the petition as a gesture of
respect. These are the first group of members who must now put
their names back on and urge others to follow their example.
</P>
<P>
   The person to lead this effort is Rep. Christopher Shays, who
sponsored a bill to outlaw ``soft money'' along with Martin Meehan
of Massachusetts. Until now Shays, R-Conn., has urged fellow
reformers to accept Gingrich's pious promises. He took his own name
off the petition in April. But Shays has to face the fact that
Gingrich is not going to change except under pressure. This week
the speaker's agents of destruction, Dick Armey and Tom DeLay, will
try to get Republicans to approve a parliamentary rule that would
allow unlimited amendments to campaign legislation. Their strategy
on the Shays-Meehan bill was revealed by Rep.e Ray LaHood of
Illinois, who told The New Republic magazine: ``We tried squelching
it first. Now we're trying to talk it to death.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLay likes to equate campaign money with free speech. He is
famous for keeping a list of campaign contributors in his front
office, sometimes showing them to visitors. But the First Amendment
was not designed as a license for influence-peddling. The
Shays-Meehan bill, which is close to commanding bipartisan majority
support, would ban the open-ended donations to party treasuries
that made the candidate limits meaningless in the last election. It
would also curb fund-raising for independent groups that run
campaign ads two months before an election. Shays is not the only
Republican from the New York region to take his name off the
petition drive in April. So did Amo Houghton of New York, Marge
Roukema of New Jersey and Nancy Johnson of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   If these Republicans join with other moderates, and indeed with
all the Republicans who have condemned special-interest money in
the last two years, the Shays-Meehan bill can succeed. In 1990, a
young dissident representative declared that Congress had become a
``broken system'' in need of change. ``It is increasingly a system
of corruption in which money politics is defeating and driving out
citizen politics,'' Gingrich said back then. He did not mean what
he said when he talked about creating an unbought Congress. Now we
will see if Shays and the others are willing to back up their
commitment to reform with action.

MARTIN WINS RACE; GORDON CRIES FOUL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLYN, Mich. _ As Mark Martin celebrated his victory Sunday
at Michigan Speedway, Jeff Gordon stood behind his trailer in the
garage and claimed there had been a conspiracy. For the second
straight week, Gordon fell victim to a strange turn of events.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, he was leading the Miller Lite 400 when a yellow caution
flag slowed the race. It allowed Martin to catch up and eventually
pass Gordon, who finished third behind Dale Jarrett. At the time of
the yellow flag, which came on the 118th of 200 laps, Gordon's
Chevrolet was ahead of Martin's Ford by about 10 seconds; a full
straightaway.
</P>
<P>
   Initial reports were that debris was spotted on the backstretch.
Gordon, on the radio to his pit crew moments later, said that he
saw something thrown out of the window of Jimmy Spencer's No. 23
car _ possibly a piece of roll cage padding.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Nelson, the Winston Cup director, could be heard radioing
to the NASCAR trailer that he wanted the suspicious debris
recovered. He also demanded a thorough post-race inspection of
Spencer's car, and those of Bobby Labonte and Darrell Waltrip. They
were the three cars Gordon was about to put a lap down when the
debris was spotted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw some people throwing things out of the window right
before the caution came out,'' Gordon said. ``So it makes me
wonder. But whatever it was, it wasn't worth throwing a yellow
for.''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte said he saw the debris and ran over it. ``Usually I can
tell a seven-sixteenths wrench,'' he said. ``But I couldn't tell
what that was.''
</P>
<P>
   Spencer and Waltrip were not available for comment. Their cars,
like Labonte's, were inspected and then allowed to be hauled away.
Their trailers were the first to leave the track. It was an early
sign that nothing out of the ordinary was discovered, but Jeff
Motley, a NASCAR spokesman, said that the tape from Gordon's in-car
video camera will be looked at.
</P>
<P>

 0615 &HT;    Jordan for the ages: Bulls deep-six Utah
 &HT;    By Jeff Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY, Utah _ The greatest player in the history of
basketball refused to lose Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan sneaked behind Utah's Karl Malone for a steal,
then buried a 19-footer with 5.2 seconds to play that carried the
Chicago Bulls to their second NBA three-peat, 87-86, in a frenzied
Delta Center.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's driving layup set that up.
</P>
<P>
   Only seconds before John Stockton made his bid to force Game 7.
All alone beyond the 3-point line, John Stockton turned killer.
Just like the old days, Karl Malone whipped a pass out of the post
and the old point guard squared up and fired a triple with 41.9
seconds that put the Jazz up by three.
</P>
<P>
   Stockton fired another three as the game ended but this time he
failed.
</P>
<P>
   His marriage to the Bulls in jeopardy, Jordan took control for
better or worse.
</P>
<P>
   He put up 35 shots from the field and made 15, 15 at the line
and made 12, all worth 45 points, barely enough to carry a load
that included a sore-backed Scottie Pippen. Setting up what might
have been his last hurrah, he missed a point blank jumper for a tie
at 1:31, went to the line at 59.2 and locked it at 83.
</P>
<P>
   Malone bulled for 31 and Jeff Hornacek backed him with 17 for
Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen was hurting. On Saturday, he received an injection of
cortisone in his back to relieve a condition that hampered him in
2-for-16 shooting in game 5.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen apparently hurt his back in Game 4 when he had his best
scoring performance of the series.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Chip Schaefer said Pippen showed 30 percent improvement
from the soreness that bothered him Saturday and he started the
game well enough. So did the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   They built a 17-8 lead on nine straight points, two of them
coming when Pippen sank a 10-foot off balance shot in the lane. He
got up slowly and left the game two minutes later during a time
out, going to the dressing room for further treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago struggled without him, committing three illegal defense
calls and a 24-second violation. The Jazz out-scored them 11-1 and
rode a seven-burst by Malone to a 25-22 lead after a quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz led by six before the Bulls recovered. At 30-26 Utah,
Jordan found a good rhythm with a series of jumpers against Shandon
Anderson and Bryon Russell. He made six straight shots, scoring 15
of 19 Chicago points, while Malone responded at the other end. The
sides alternated hoops, Jordan's take including his third triple of
the game, though only fourth of the series.
</P>
<P>
   At 45-all, Jordan missed his next three, but Stockton got a
layup on a nifty pass from Malone and Bryon Russell cut to a layup
as Utah went to the break ahead 49-45, the highest scoring first
half of the series. Malone had 23 points, Jordan 20 in the first
true showdown game between the game's last two MVPs.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen was back for the third quarter but ineffective and the
game bogged down, the Bulls called for four fouls in 1:20, the Jazz
unable to get a hoop after Malone's drive to open the period, the
Bulls inching back to 53-51 when Rodman pulled Malone down three
times in a transition scramble on the floor, finally called for a
foul.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls got even, but Jordan missed a layup for the lead and
his team faltered. It was his 25th shot. They went to the fourth,
Utah leading 66-61.

in Indonesia,'' says Mrs. Hanifa, 48, left, who runs a dress
factory in Gresik, where workers can earn roughly 35 cents a day
making red plaid dresses for little girls. ``And I'm paying good
wages, at least for around here,'' she says. Just as pressure is
growing in the West against the use of sweatshops in developing
countries, the Asian financial crisis is spawning such desperation
that more people than ever seem willing to take grim or dangerous
jobs in such factories. (Nicholas D. Kristof/New York Times Photo)

   (NYT5) JAKARTA, Indonesia -- June 14, 1998 -- ASIA-SWEATSHOPS,
6-14 -- In the Indonesian capital of Jakarta, Mrs. Tratiwoon stands
in the vast garbage dump where she makes a living scavenging
through rubbish and describes her dreams for her 3-year-old son:
She wants him to grow up to work in a sweatshop. ``He's not going
to get an education,'' says Mrs. Tratiwoon, ``so I don't know
whether he can even get a job like that.'' Indeed, the Asian
financial crisis is spawning such desperation that in the slums in
Indonesia and Thailand, many workers even speak of sweatshop jobs
as their greatest aspiration. (Nicholas D. Kristof/New York Times

   (NYT4) SAN FRANCISCO -- June 14, 1998 -- CNET-MINOR-MEDIA, 6-14
-- Halsey Minor in San Francisco at the studios of Cnet, the
computer news and Internet company he founded in 1992. Minor has
always made his aspirations clear: He's not out to save the world;
he's going to conquer it and become the first media mogul of the
Internet, the Ted Turner or Rupert Murdoch of his generation.
``Ultimately, the history of the most successful media tycoons is
filled with bet-the-ranch deals and Hail Mary passes, not by
fastidious attention to quarterly earnings,'' says Minor. (Peter

Harold Evans, 70, left Random House last fall, and is now working
as editorial director for his friend, Mortimer Zuckerman. His new
job -- editorial director and vice chairman of The Daily News of
New York, U.S. News &AMP; World Report, The Atlantic Monthly and Fast
Company, a business magazine. One thing Evans has clearly been
studying is the field of journalistic talent. He is in charge of
hiring and firing at the publications. ``I'm looking at candidates
for every single slot for the business,'' Evans says. ``I always
want to know who is out there and who is good.'' (Linda Rosier/New

-- Kevin Chamberlin and Mary Beth Peil in the revival of ``As
Thousands Cheer,'' the Moss Hart and Irving Berlin revue from 1933.
Sixty-five subsequent years after opening, the comic bite in Hart's
lines and in Berlin's lyrics still clicks crisply, and the work's
portrait of the pandering ways of celebrities and the journalists
who cover them remains spot-on. (Sara Krulwich/New York Times

produces her show for Telemundo Group Inc. With a rising number of
the nation's Hispanic television viewers now bilingual, a handful
of programs are being broadcast that use varying degrees of both
English and Spanish. Soon ad agency representatives in New York

Sony's acquisition of Telemundo is expected to receive regulatory

EDITORIAL: JAPAN SINKS INTO RECESSION 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, June 15:
</P>
<P>
   Japan is now officially in recession, and its government
continues to dawdle about responding. The risk is that Japan's
problems may cause further damage to its already weak Asian
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   The first priority for Japanese officials must be to save the
country's sick banking system, which is still burdened by bad loans
left over from the bubble economy of the late 1980s. In February
the government announced a large and badly needed bank bailout
plan, but almost nothing has been done to institute it. The
government needs to close weak institutions while enabling the
stronger ones to put their bad loans behind them. The scandal at
the Ministry of Finance, which some had hoped would make reform
easier, instead seems to have produced paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   The banks, having belatedly awakened to how bad their situation
is, have created a huge credit crunch by cutting back on loans to
avert further losses. Worried Japanese consumers are reluctant to
spend, making things worse. Money is flowing out of the country as
savers seek safe haven in foreign banks and foreign bonds. So
despite a big trade surplus the yen is tumbling, having fallen 21
percent against the dollar in the past 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's current economic woes reflect the limits of national
monetary policy in moving an economy, particularly in this age of
global financial flows. Japan's central bank has pushed interest
rates about as low as they can possibly go. Short-term rates are
under 1 percent, and the yield on 10-year Japanese Government bonds
has fallen to 1.3 percent. It is hard to imagine how credit could
be cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   But the banks are afraid to make loans, and much of the
borrowing has been by foreigners, who have used the cheap funds to
speculate in foreign securities markets. Japan's low rates have
stimulated rising stock and bond prices in the United States but
have done nothing for its own economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese government has put together a fiscal stimulus
package, which should help. But more needs to be done to allow
Japan to play the needed role of locomotive for the rest of Asia.
Right now, Japan is acting as just one more brake on an already
stalled regional economy.

SPORTS COLUMN: U.S. OPEN REVISITS GRAVEYARD OF LEGENDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (lb) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With its towering cypress and pine trees, its view of the San
Francisco hills, its sprawling Spanish-style clubhouse above the
grassy amphitheater at the 18th green and its occasional fog off
the Pacific, the Lake course at the Olympic Club is one of golf's
most pastoral panoramas.
</P>
<P>
   But for three legends of the game, it has been a gloomy
graveyard.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Hogan, Arnold Palmer, Tom Watson; each a legend, each a
dominant golfer in his era. Together, they won 24 major golf
titles, including six U.S. Open championships (Hogan four, Palmer
and Watson one each).
</P>
<P>
   But in the three previous Opens at Olympic, each finished
second.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan, so near in 1955 to what would have been his record fifth
Open title, lost in an 18-hole playoff to Jack Fleck, an obscure
touring pro.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer, after blowing a 7-stroke lead with nine holes to play in
the final round in 1966, lost an 18-hole playoff to Billy Casper.
</P>
<P>
   Watson's 45-foot uphill putt on the final hole in 1987 stopped
inches short of forcing an 18-hole playoff with Scott Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   That haunting history is enough to make today's dominant players
wonder whether there is an open grave at Olympic, where the 98th
U.S. Open will start on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Fleck, Casper and Simpson left with the Open trophy, but the
conversations at Olympic are usually about how Hogan, Palmer and
Watson did not win.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan even thought he had won. Walking to the scorer's tent
after a par 70 for a 287 total and what he thought was the title,
he handed his ball to Joe Dey, then the executive director of the
U.S. Golf Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is for Golf House,'' Hogan said, meaning the USGA museum.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Gene Sarazen, working as a radio commentator,
congratulated Hogan on ``your fifth Open.'' In the locker room,
weary from that Saturday's 36-hole finish, he sat on a bench and
sipped a Scotch and water. But in those years, when the leaders did
not always go off last, the virtually unknown Fleck was only one
birdie away from tying Hogan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is Fleck good enough to tie you?'' Hogan was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``He must be good,'' Hogan said. ``He uses Hogan clubs.''
</P>
<P>
   Then a pro at a municipal course in Davenport, Iowa, Fleck had
recently visited Hogan's new plant in Fort Worth, Texas, to pick up
a set of the new Hogan irons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the only one he let in the factory,'' Fleck has said.
``He wouldn't let any of the big names past the front door.'' Hogan
even brought two new wedges to Olympic for Fleck.
</P>
<P>
   On the 18th hole, Fleck made a sidehill 8-foot birdie putt for a
67 that created the Sunday playoff, which Fleck won, 69 to 72.
Walking off the final green, Fleck turned to Hogan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe it, Ben,'' he said. ``I can't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleck, who now owns and operates the Lil' Bit of Heaven golf
course in Magazine, Ark., would win only two more PGA Tour events _
the 1960 Phoenix Open and the 1961 Bakersfield (Calif.) Open, but
he had snatched Hogan's fifth Open.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven years later, Billy Casper snatched what would have been
Arnold Palmer's second Open.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Palmer had been America's golf icon for nearly a
decade. He fired a 3-under-par 32 on the front in Sunday's final
round and was 7 strokes ahead of Casper, who acknowledged to Palmer
that he was just hoping to finish second.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll try to help you,'' Palmer said.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer forgot to help himself. He bogied the 10th and the 13th.
At the short 15th, he plopped his tee shot into a bunker. With a
bogey there as Casper birdied, his lead suddenly was down to 3
strokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' Casper has said, ``is when I thought, `Hey, I can win
this.'''
</P>
<P>
   On the long 16th, Palmer pulled his tee shot into high rough.
Choosing a 3-iron, he slashed at the ball, but it bounded only 50
yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to do it again,'' he said later, ``I probably
wouldn't hit a 3-iron.''
</P>
<P>
   With another bogey there along with another Casper birdie,
Palmer's lead was now 1 stroke. At the 18th he pulled his 1-iron
tee shot into high rough. Another bogey for a 71 dropped him into a
tie at 278 with Casper, who made a par for 68. In the Monday
playoff, Palmer led by two at the turn, but let it get away and
lost, 69 to 73.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `Arnie, I'm sorry,''' Casper has recalled. ``He
didn't say anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Casper, however, was not Fleck. Considered one of golf's great
putters, he had won the 1959 U.S. Open at Winged Foot and would win
the 1970 Masters. His 51 victories on the PGA Tour are sixth on the
career list, behind Sam Snead, Jack Nicklaus, Hogan, Palmer and
Byron Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, Watson, the five-time British Open champion, had not
won on the PGA Tour for three years. But after 54 holes at Olympic,
he was 1 stroke ahead of Simpson and Keith Clearwater. And as
Watson left the 13th green in Sunday's finale, he still led Simpson
by one.
</P>
<P>
   At the 422-yard 14th, Simpson holed a 4-foot birdie putt, but
Watson also birdied there with a 20-footer.
</P>
<P>
   At the 157-yard 15th, Simpson drained a 30-foot birdie putt to
share the lead. At the 609-yard 16th, he holed a 15-foot birdie
putt to take the lead. When Simpson finished with 68 for 277,
Watson needed a birdie on the 347-yard 18th to tie.
</P>
<P>
   After a tee shot into the sloping fairway, Watson had 113 uphill
yards to the flagstick. His pitching wedge landed on the green,
then spun back, settling on the fringe, about 45 feet away. His
birdie putt was on line, but it stopped inches short.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably should have hit a 9-iron,'' Watson said later. ``I
had a breeze at my back when I stood over the ball, but as I hit
it, the breeze at my back was in my face. A gust of wind must've
come up.''
</P>
<P>
   Simpson had also come up, big. As a reliable grinder on the PGA
Tour for two decades, he has won seven tournaments and more than $5
million in prize money. He was granted a special exemption by the
USGA for this year's Open.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1 stroke, Tom Watson finished second in that Open at
Olympic, just as Ben Hogan and Arnold Palmer had finished second in
the other two Opens at Olympic, the graveyard for golf legends. Who
will be interred there this time?

team defense to choke the life out of the Washington Capitals in a
2-1 victory.

firing 60 shots at goalie Olaf Kolzig before winning a thrilling
5-4 shootout in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   And in Game 1, the Wings offered a completely lackluster effort,
but still found a way to record a 2-1 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The story line keeps changing in the Stanley Cup finals, but the
end results have become depressingly familiar to the Caps. They
come close. They are capable of making things interesting for a
moment or two. But in the final analysis, there's a gap between the
teams, and that gap is the difference between a very good team and
a champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing our game; we're playing Red Wings hockey,''
Detroit center Igor Larionov said.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit wing Brendan Shanahan said: ``I've never played on a
team that needed and relied on the contribution of all 20 guys. I
don't think we've stolen anything from them. We haven't robbed
anybody here. When you look at the puck possession, the scoring
chances and shots on goal, I think we're playing a good series. We
deserve to be where we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is on the verge of their second straight Stanley Cup under
Coach Scotty Bowman. They can close the deal on Tuesday night in
Game 4 at the MCI Center. They can also record their second
straight sweep in the finals. The games, superficially at least,
may have been close. But you can't say the same about the series.
In building their 3-0 lead, the Wings have dominated virtually
every facet of play and have demonstrated a team game that is
remarkable for its depth and versatility.
</P>
<P>
   ``You only need to look at the Red Wings' play, whether it's
along the boards or their composure or their grit, and we haven't
matched that player for player,'' Washington's Brian Bellows said
after Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   The only mystery about the series, in fact, is how the Capitals
have managed to make each game close when they have been so
thoroughly outplayed.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 3, they mustered one shot in the first 25 minutes, and
that occurred in the game's opening minute. After Bellows scored
the lone Washington goal at 10 minutes 35 seconds of the third,
Washington did not record another shot on Wings goalie Chris
Osgood.
</P>
<P>
   That was hardly an isolated trend. All told, the Wings have
outshot the Capitals 125-68 in the three games. And, while Kolzig
has been stellar in the finals thus far, he has not been good
enough to make up the difference between the teams.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The architect of the Wings' dominance is Bowman, a 64-year-old
coaching wizard, who is approaching a milestone of his own. A
victory on Tuesday would give Bowman his eighth Stanley Cup ring as
a coach, tying the career mark set by his mentor, Toe Blake.
</P>
<P>
   Blake won eight cup titles with the Montreal Canadiens from 1955
to 1968. His last victory came in '68 against the St. Louis Blues
in Bowman's first year as a National Hockey League coach.
</P>
<P>
   Like Blake, Bowman grew up in the Canadiens' chain, coaching the
Montreal Junior Canadiens in the early '60s when Blake ran the
parent club. His office was just down the hall from Blake's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can compare the two records,'' Bowman said.
``He won eight cups in 13 years. No one one will ever do that.''
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean Bowman isn't a worthy successor to Blake.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have so much confidence in the coach,'' Shanahan said. ``On
some teams, 10 or 12 guys might buy into the coach's system. On our
team, everyone has complete faith in what Scotty does.''
</P>
<P>
   Larionov said: ``I feel it's a privilege to play for this team
and Scotty Bowman. He's a legend.''

YANKEES WIN YET AGAIN, 4-2 OVER CLEVELAND 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This old dog continues to have his day _ Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll pitch every Sunday,'' David Cone said.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly one week after he pitched his first complete game of the
season, a two-hitter against the rookie remnants of the World
Series champion Florida Marlins, Cone pitched against a more
veteran, more explosive lineup and dominated the Cleveland Indians
in the Yankees' 4-2 victory Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The 35-year-old right-hander pitched eight innings, allowed four
hits and one run on Kenny Lofton's eighth-inning home run, and he
struck out 12, half on called third strikes. Tino Martinez drove in
the first three Yankee runs with a sacrifice fly and a single after
Paul O'Neill put the runners in position to score with a single and
a double.
</P>
<P>
   It was just another ho-hum victory for the Yankees, their 10th
in the last 11 games and 47th against 14 defeats this season. Cone
has a major league-best nine-game winning streak that also is his
career best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in the last two starts the extra rest has helped me,''
Cone said. ``It seems my stuff is sharper. I think the extra rest
at this point in my career is probably better than working on a
regular schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   Rain, which postponed games the previous two days, provided Cone
extra rest before this start. A dog bite forced him to take extra
time before his previous game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dog bite I had on my finger probably helped me,'' Cone
said, bringing up the incident with his mother's Jack Russell
terrier, Veronica. ``It was a blessing. It gave me a little extra
rest, gave my shoulder a break. It also made me throw my fastball
and curveball a lot more.''
</P>
<P>
   The dog bite, the pitcher explained, prompted him to use his
split-fingered fastball less.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really paid off over the last two starts,'' he said.
``Maybe this old dog learned some new tricks. I've been kind of
stubborn throughout the years trying to feature everything I throw.
It's kind of nice to get back to the basics.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Indians said Cone rarely threw his fastball. Manager
Mike Hargrove estimated that his batters did not see 10 fastballs.
Manny Ramirez, a .300 hitter, saw at least two of them, both coming
with two strikes from a sidearm delivery. He watched both go by for
strike 3.
</P>
<P>
   Discussing his sidearm, or three-quarters, delivery, Cone said:
``It's something I've always featured. The key for me is to be able
to throw some fastballs sidearm. That's what I got Ramirez with
twice. The book on me is when I drop down and throw from the side,
I usually throw sliders. I've got to be able to mix it up and keep
them off balance.''
</P>
<P>
   That Cone did with the Indians. He struck out Ramirez, Omar
Vizquel, Jim Thome and Mark Whiten twice each, and he got David
Bell three times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I faced a young hitter in Bell and got him with some sidearm
sliders,'' the crafty Cone said. ``I don't think he's seen that
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell, a .303 hitter who had averaged one strikeout every six
at-bats, acknowledged that Cone overmatched him with his guile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I really wasn't prepared for what he was going to
throw,'' Bell said. ``After my first at-bat I knew how he was going
to work me, but I didn't make an adjustment. I knew what I wanted
to do but wasn't able to do it. I knew he was going to throw
sliders. That says a lot about how good his slider is. I knew it
was coming and still couldn't hit it.''
</P>
<P>
   The performance served as another dramatic step in Cone's return
from off-season shoulder surgery. His early starts this season did
not give the Yankees reason to think he would reach this stage. ``I
think we were too rash,'' manager Joe Torre said. ``I'm as
responsible or as guilty as anybody that we made too much of his
early starts. He was just gaining arm strength, and it's just
getting better for him now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oakland Athletics battered Cone for 16 runs in nine and
two-thirds innings in his first two games. The resulting 14.89
earned run average has plummeted to 4.56. Cone has been especially
effective in his last four starts, allowing 5 earned runs in 30
innings (1.50) and striking out 35.
</P>
<P>
   The game was the first between the Yankees and the Indians this
season, outlasting two days of rain to get in one of the three
games scheduled. It was their first encounter since the Indians won
the division series in last year's playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   That was why Cone didn't mind turning the last inning over to
Mariano Rivera, who squandered a 2-1 lead in the fourth game of the
playoff series the Yankees led by two games to one. Rivera gave up
a run on two hits and a groundout but earned his 13th save.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was important to get him into the game against
the Indians for obvious reasons,'' Cone said. ``It was nice to see
him close it out.''
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH
</P>
<P>
   Manager Joe Torre altered the pitching rotation, taking Orlando
Hernandez out of the series in Baltimore and pushing him back from
Tuesday to Thursday against the Indians in Cleveland. Torre said he
did not want to push back Hideki Irabu and Andy Pettitte yet
another day. In addition, he said, ``Pettitte has pitched pretty
good in Baltimore.'' ... Torre said that Dwight Gooden, now with
the Indians, met with him on Saturday and apologized for comments
he made about the manager earlier in the year ... The Yankees plan
to have Derek Jeter play one minor league game, probably late this
week, to test his strained abdominal muscle before they restore him
to the active roster.

HAYES WINS A SHOWDOWN WITH FURYK IN THE BUICK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARRISON, N.Y. _ As the pressure mounted during the final holes
of the Buick Classic on Sunday, J.P. Hayes had reasons to doubt
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes had never won on the PGA Tour. He had never played in the
final group on Sunday. He almost lost his tour card last year. And
with so much at stake Sunday, Hayes was locked in a final-round
duel with Jim Furyk, one of the game's most consistent players, who
seemed overdue for a victory.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of giving in to the tension, Hayes answered every
challenge. He hit a marvelous bunker shot at No. 18 to help force a
sudden-death playoff. He made an 8-foot birdie putt on the first
playoff hole to clinch victory. And when J.P. Hayes left
Westchester Country Club Sunday night, he left as a winner.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the first-place check of $324,000 and securing his place
on tour for the next two years, Hayes won the Buick Classic in
dramatic fashion by beating Furyk, who suffered another
disappointing defeat. In a rain-plagued event that was shortened to
54 holes, both Hayes and Furyk shot 3-under-par 68 Sunday to finish
at 12-under 201 for the tournament, three strokes ahead of Tom
Lehman.
</P>
<P>
   Before Sunday, Hayes' best finish this year was a tie for 42nd
at the Greater Greensboro Chrysler Classic, and he had missed five
cuts in eight previous events, including his last two. He retained
his tour card at qualifying school last fall, but he had won just
$16,712 this year.
</P>
<P>
   But Hayes played with the serene calm of someone who had been in
contention many times before, finishing up his second round by
completing five holes in the morning, then shooting the most
important round of his career. When it was over, he sounded almost
afraid to pinch himself, fearing he might wake up from a dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than anything, it's a tremendous feeling of satisfaction
to play like that under those circumstances,'' said Hayes, whose
previous best finish was a sixth-place tie at the Anheuser-Busch
Golf Classic in 1992. ``I don't think it has hit me yet. I'm not
sure when it will.''
</P>
<P>
   The disappointment had hit Furyk, who continued to play well but
fell short. It was Furyk's seventh top-10 finish this year, and he
has 20 top-10 finishes since the start of 1997, more than anyone
else. Yet Furyk has not won since the 1996 United Airlines Hawaiian
Open, and he has grown tired of accepting condolences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really disappointed,'' said Furyk, who overcame a
three-stroke deficit with nine holes to play only to lose. ``About
50 people have already congratulated me on a great week. But when
you lose in a playoff and finish second, second just isn't good
enough.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The dramatic finish came down to the par-5, 526-yard 18th hole,
which was also the first playoff hole. Hayes reached the 18th green
in regulation holding a one-stroke lead, but Furyk hit a tremendous
second shot, a 3-wood from 260 yards that landed 12 feet short of
the pin. Meanwhile, Hayes' second shot landed in the right-side
bunker in front of the green.
</P>
<P>
   With Furyk in position for eagle, Hayes knew he probably needed
a birdie just to force a playoff. And his next shot was divine, a
soft bunker shot from 15 yards that landed less than 2 feet from
the cup, as the crowd around the green roared. Hayes tapped in for
the birdie.
</P>
<P>
   Now it was Furyk's turn to respond, and he did, making the
12-foot putt for eagle to force the playoff. But perhaps because
Hayes had endured so much in his career, the prospect of a playoff
did not faze him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was calm; I really surprised myself,'' said Hayes, who will
turn 33 in August. ``In that situation, I thought I'd be throwing
up all over myself. But I've been more nervous at Q school every
year than I was at any point today.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayes hit a good tee shot on the playoff hole, but Furyk's went
left, hitting a tree and settling in the first cut of rough. After
Hayes hit his second shot to the back collar of the green, about 60
feet from the pin, Furyk made a crucial decision. He decided to hit
a 3-wood out of the rough from 240 yards away instead of hitting
safely back into the fairway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't live with myself in the morning if I had layed up
and made par,'' said Fuyrk, who had also made a costly three-putt
from 21 feet at No. 14. ``It probably was the wrong shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Fuyrk's 3-wood was a low line drive that went left into even
deeper rough. From there, he hit a wedge onto the green, about 40
feet from the pin. After Hayes chipped his third shot to 8 feet,
Fuyrk missed his putt about 5 feet to the right, leaving Hayes the
8-footer for the victory. He didn't miss it.
</P>
<P>
   When the putt went in, Hayes raised his arms and savored a
victory he will never forget. Then he called his wife, Laura, who
was at home in El Paso, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounded like she was having a party,'' Hayes said. Who
could blame her? The victory gave Hayes an automatic two-year
exemption on tour, and for the first time in his career he had
security.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means more than the money or anything,'' Hayes said.
``This will be the first year in eight or nine years that I'm not
going to fill out an application for qualifying school. I knew if I
could control my emotions, I would have a chance. For some reason,
it all came together today.''

INSTITUTE TO MEDIATE DISPUTES ON ENVIRONMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz.)   (Eds: Note that Dr. Kirk Emerson is female, so ``Dr.'' has been
used in 2nd and later references.)  
(lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seeking to curb the sharp rise in litigation over
environmental disputes, Congress has created the first federally
financed institute to encourage mediation as an alternative to
trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought there had to be a way to settle these things
without all of the parties going to court,'' said Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., who sponsored the legislation. ``The solution we came up
with was the institute.''
</P>
<P>
   The newly formed Institute for Environmental Conflict Resolution
will become an extension of the Morris K. Udall Foundation based in
Tucson, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation was created in 1992 to honor Udall, the former
Arizona congressman who, during 15 terms in the House, was known as
a fierce advocate for environmental causes and was credited with
often finding solutions in compromises that would make Henry Clay
proud. (Udall is in hospital with Parkinson's disease.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we are doing what Mo would have wanted us to be
doing, although he probably would not have known what a
conflict-resolution mediator was,'' said Chris Helms, director of
the Udall Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   With an average of 1,000 environmental cases a year filed with
district courts, the need for an alternative has never been
greater, said Dr. Kirk Emerson, the institute's director.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe we can arrive at good ideas without the adversarial
process,'' Dr. Emerson said.
</P>
<P>
   After an initial appropriation of $3 million to pay for a staff
of 14, the institute will receive $1.25 million annually until
2002, when it is expected to be drawing enough client fees to
support itself.
</P>
<P>
   The basic idea behind mediation is simple: If two parties are
brought together and can speak with professional but neutral
experts, the theory says, a solution might be worked out.
</P>
<P>
   Although federal money has been used for mediation efforts in
environmental disputes, the institute is the first federally
financed organization dedicated solely to environmental mediation.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of the process cite the Snohomish River Basin
agreement of 1974 as a dispute in which mediation techniques were
first used to resolve a complex problem.
</P>
<P>
   When, in 1959, after a major flood, the federal government
proposed a dam on the Snohomish River in Washington, it seemed that
nearly everyone within 100 miles of the dam site had something to
say. Farmers favored the dam as a way to prevent flooding, local
tribal governments worried about the impact it would have on fish,
and kayakers thought it would spoil the great white water.
</P>
<P>
   For 15 years these groups, each with different lawyers, battled
in the courts. The governor, Dan Evans, looked for an alternative.
He appointed a group of 10 citizens to review the case, and within
nine months they reached an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental cases take, on average, over two years to work
their way through the courts, Dr. Emerson said, and 10 percent of
the cases take more than five years to resolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is to deal with these more efficiently and
effectively,'' Dr. Emerson said.
</P>
<P>
   She said her biggest problem would be choosing which disputes
get mediated. ``We would like at least to give everyone a hand _
point them in the right direction. We anticipate a tremendous
interest and we will need to make tough decisions.''

SPORTS COLUMN: JORDAN STANDS ALONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: This is a late add to page 1; repeating for all needing.)  
(lh) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ If this was the end, it looked suspiciously
like the beginning. Michael Jordan against the world, a celebrated
solo act. But even with his odds reduced by age, this wasn't the
place, or the time, for Jordan to surrender pro basketball
supremacy to a couple of reticent stars who only come out to play.
He willed it that way.
</P>
<P>
   He stripped the ball from noble Karl Malone in the post, then
stole the championship hopes of the Utah Jazz. A pullup jump shot
from 18 feet as the Jazz's Byron Russell backed away, fearful of
the drive, nailed down the Chicago Bulls' sixth title of the 1990s
Sunday night at the Delta Center.
</P>
<P>
   Another season ended, another championship won, as if it were
scripted by the writers of Jordan's television commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, it was a flu-ridden Jordan rising out of a sick bed
to carry the Bulls in the game they had to win here. This time, it
was Jordan, at 35 not the high flier he once was, lifting himself
and his team after Scottie Pippen turned up seriously impaired with
an injured back.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-five points, the Bulls' last eight, the crushing jump shot
with 5.2 seconds remaining that won Game 6 by 87-86 and finished,
finally, the long and winding pro basketball season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go ahead, laugh all you want,'' Karl Malone had told the
snickering news media after trustingly revealing how he soothed
himself back in Chicago before his breakout in Game 4. He rode
shotgun with an Illinois state trooper, and went off to help weigh
a few trucks.
</P>
<P>
   No more laughing at Malone, at his hobbies, at the Jazz. But the
truth is, the Jazz had the Bulls right where they wanted them
Sunday night, and let them get away. The overnight analysis of the
finals is this: Utah was a fine challenger, but not a champion.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz couldn't put enough distance between themselves and the
Bulls while Pippen was being worked on in the locker room, couldn't
hold leads in the second half, couldn't execute its half-court
offense when Jordan was lurking, waiting for the chance to strike,
deep into the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tough bunch,'' Jordan graciously called the Jazz, as he
accepted his sixth most valuable player award in as many finals
appearances. But not tough enough for him. Chicago can breathe easy
and begin calling for more, and David Stern can resume hoping that
a more ratings-friendly team than the Jazz will step up or grow up
to carry the torch and the National Basketball Association into the
21st century.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, the owner, Jerry Reinsdorf will turn into Al Capone
if he doesn't come up with about $80 million to underwrite his
current roster for another go-round. No one asks why CEO Jordan
can't take $10 million less so Pippen can get fair market value,
and no one contemplates the impact on the sport's smaller markets
as the larger ones push salaries to unfathomable heights.
</P>
<P>
   That's what this summer's collective bargaining showdown will be
about, how viable an auto dealer entrepreneur such as the Utah
owner, Larry Miller, will in the coming years. How many more
Stocktons and Malones are out there, relishing the thought of
getting away from the big-market glitz? Most of the kids coming in
are blinded by Jordan's fame, and never see themselves spending a
decade or more hidden away where taxis and subways don't roll.
</P>
<P>
   This is Commissioner Stern's delicate balancing act of wanting
his big-ticket teams to produce the ratings the league can crow
about this spring without reaching the point where too many
franchises become the Montreal Expos. How to maintain national _
no, Stern would say global _ interest over the course of a playoff
season that is the equivalent of four consecutive Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The big numbers were being notched courtesy of the Jordan epic,
the possibility of its conclusion, the drama heightening Sunday
night with Pippen in the locker room, doubled over, and the Jazz
pulling ahead. When Jordan exploded for 15 second-quarter points
and a 23-point first half in a shootout with Malone that kept the
crippled Bulls close, you knew he had enough ego to believe he
still had enough left to win. You just wondered if had enough legs.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the first half, as Jordan twice ignored Kukoc and
hoisted 3-pointers, leaving Kukoc shaking his head with his hands
on his hips as the half ended, another thought came to mind. Jordan
obviously was leaving this game to no one, taking himself all the
back to the mid 1980s, trying to win something all by himself.
</P>
<P>
   People always pointed out that he never won a playoff game
before Pippen came along, when he was a one-man team.
</P>
<P>
   He won the game Sunday night. The title. The repeat threepeat,
giving him one more championship in the modern era than Magic
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   He stands alone. If this is the end, then Jordan Sunday night
closed a circle of greatness.

MAYOR SEEKS COMPROMISE WITH SIDEWALK VENDORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Officials of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's administration
said Sunday that they had opened negotiations with sidewalk food
vendors, whose carts are to be banned from much of midtown
Manhattan and the financial district next month.
</P>
<P>
   The move was a surprise from an administration that rarely
negotiates. Deputy Mayor Rudy Washington said the city had proposed
allowing vendors to continue to work on as many as two-thirds of
the streets planned for closing, provided the vendors limit the
number of carts on busy blocks. So far, the vendors have rejected
the terms. Negotiations with them and with their chief antagonists,
several business-improvement districts, are continuing.
</P>
<P>
   Washington added that if the vendors did not agree and the
streets were closed to them, the city might sell franchises to
allow a few vendors to work on some of the more desirable corners.
</P>
<P>
   Washington said the franchises would be similar to taxicab
medallions, and would be offered for vendors who sell food,
souvenirs or other merchandise. ``When we get some order on the
streets, we'll talk about that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   City officials had announced that the police would begin
clearing pushcarts, sidewalk sales tables and street artists from
144 blocks of Manhattan in an effort to ease congestion.
Washington, the deputy mayor for community development and business
services, said he intervened at the request of both sides, and
because of his background as the founder of a construction company.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I hear people yelling, `They're putting us out of
business,' that gets my ears up and I pay attention,'' he said.
``We don't view this as a compromise. We want to avoid congestion.
If we can do that based on some agreement, that's fine with us.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials had said that the ban would apply not just to
food vendors, but also to street artists, sidewalk booksellers and
general-merchandise vendors.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed change would also benefit those groups, Washington
said. Because of their First Amendment protection, street artists
and booksellers would be able to set up anywhere that food vendors
were allowed, he said. General-merchandise vendors also would be
able to stay where they are now, he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Washington met with vendors and with representatives
of several business improvement districts, which had asked the city
to impose new restrictions on vending. The blocks to be closed were
selected in May by the city's Sidewalk Vendor Review Panel, which
at the time consisted of three Giuliani administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   At the Friday meeting, representatives of the business
improvement districts said they would consider modifying their
request for a broad-based ban on vending, but said they would not
go as far as Washington had suggested in a map of streets to be
kept open that he had drawn for the occasion. ``I was just trying
to start a conversation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The vendors said they would agree to a limit of two vendors on
each corner but only if all streets in the city were opened to
vending, even ones that are closed now.
</P>
<P>
   Washington said that was an unrealistic position since it would
be impossible to police. ``Basically, the vendors are saying, `Let
us do what we want to do,''' he said. ``The city will never walk
away from its authority to regulate the streets.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The vendors' representative at the meeting, Dan Rossi of the Big
Apple Food Vendors Association, said he was pleasantly surprised
that Giuliani was willing to talk. ``Usually when this mayor loads
a gun, he fires it,'' he said. ``The city realizes they went
overboard.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington said he was willing to bring the sides together again
before the official list of street closings is published this
month. Enforcement is to begin 30 days after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even at the last minute, if these guys are willing to talk and
say, `We understand the city can't just throw laws away,' we're
willing to talk and so are the BIDs,'' Washington said.
</P>
<P>
   The vendors tried to build public support by marching down
Broadway two weeks ago. They contend that the ban would force 300
carts to move and put many of them out of business because they
would be limited to working in less busy, and thus less lucrative,
areas.
</P>
<P>
   The Sidewalk Vendor Review Panel votes on requests for street
closings that are submitted by citizens or private groups. An
official of one business-improvement district, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said the business groups were willing to
withdraw some of their requests ``as a means of bringing peace to
the issue.''

NEW YORK IS EXPERIENCING SECOND-WETTEST YEAR ON RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The sense of gloom, endless drizzle and inescapable
dampness hanging over New York is more than a gnawing hunch.
Meteorologists made it official Sunday: figures show that New York
is experiencing the second-wettest year since records were first
kept in 1869. Only the first five months of 1983 were damper.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Koval, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University,
said that 30.08 inches of precipitation fell in Central Park
between Jan. 1 and May 31 this year, about 12 inches more than
normal. The series of storms that have drenched New York this
spring, he said, is the result of an unusual air pattern.
</P>
<P>
   ``The storms that come up the East Coast are fed their energy by
the southern branch of the jet stream,'' Koval said. ``It has been
unusually strong this year between January and May.''
</P>
<P>
   For the third straight day Sunday, intermittent downpours and
drizzles soaked the area. Koval and forecasters from the National
Weather Service said a break in the dank weather is not expected to
arrive until Friday because a massive low-pressure system is
stalled over the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a persistent area of low pressure in the upper atmosphere
that is very slow-moving,'' said Art Kraus, a forecaster with the
National Weather Service in Mount Holly, N.J. ``As long as it stays
in the area, there could be moisture.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's rainfall did not cause widespread problems, but it
flooded Route 35 in Hazlet, N.J., contributed to a partial building
collapse on Staten Island and threatened to cause flooding across
parts of northern New Jersey and New York Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service issued flood warnings for Ulster
County, N.Y., and the Passaic River basin _ parts of Morris,
Passaic, Essex Bergen and Somerset Counties _ in New Jersey. The
Passaic and its tributaries were expected to reach flood peak
Sunday night or early Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Birkhahn, a spokesman for New York City's Department of
Buildings, said that rain contributed to the collapse of a wall on
the first floor of a two-family home at 45 Caroline St. on Staten
Island at around 3 a.m. Sunday. No one was hurt. City officials
also said lightning struck a two-story building at 200 E. 110th St.
in Harlem around 12:30 p.m. on Saturday. A 30-foot section of
bricks fell into a side yard after the strike, Birkhahn said, but
no one was hurt.

<P>
   Rear Adm. Russell Randolph Waesche Jr., a retired Coast Guard
commander and transportation executive in the Midwest, died on May
28 at his home in Leawood, Kan. He was 84.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was leukemia, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Waesche was born in Thurmont, Md., the son of a future
commandant of the Coast Guard. It was in 1936, the same year that
Waesche graduated from the Coast Guard Academy at New London,
Conn., that his father became commandant, a position that he held
until 1945.
</P>
<P>
   The son served in the Pacific and on convoy duty in the Atlantic
in World War II. He later commanded Coast Guard stations in
Philadelphia, Cleveland, Washington, Seattle, New Orleans and St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   After retiring from the service in 1971 he was the regional
representative of the Department of Transportation for Missouri,
Iowa, Kansas and Nebraska for six years. He retired in 1988 as
executive director of the Missouri and Kansas Public Transit
Associations.
</P>
<P>
   Waesche's wife of 60 years, Janet Thorn Waesche, died last
summer. He is survived by three daughters, Judith Romero of
Arlington, Texas, Marilla Pivonka of Mill Valley, Calif., and
Jillian Seaton of Wichita, Kan.; a son, Russell III of
Williamsburg, Ky; four grandchildren, and a great-granddaughter.

IT'S PUERTO RICO'S DAY ON FIFTH AVENUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Despite a steady downpour, Fifth Avenue echoed with
the syncopated beats of salsa, flamenco and hip-hop as hundreds of
thousands of people clad in every conceivable form of their
national flag danced, cheered and sang along Sunday at the 41st
annual Puerto Rican Day Parade.
</P>
<P>
   Riding atop flatbed trucks festooned with the decidedly unethnic
advertisements of countless corporate sponsors, one band after
another played ``Que Bonita Bandera (What a Pretty Flag)'' as proud
Puerto Ricans, using another name for the Caribbean island,
chanted, ``Boricua! Boricua!''
</P>
<P>
   The entire parade route, from 44th Street to 88th Street, was a
sea of rojo, blanco y azul, thanks to the creativity of paradegoers
who had fashioned their flag, with its three red stripes, lone
white star and blue triangle, into beaded necklaces, capes, floppy
hats, sweatbands, head wraps, short shorts, face paint and
fingernail polish.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Mateo of Stamford, Conn., brought his sons J.J., 5, and
Eric, who turned 4 Sunday. Each had a gold hoop and a diamond stud
through his left earlobe, and a flag-printed bandana stretched over
his head. It was the family's first Puerto Rican Day Parade. ``We
moved up from Florida six months ago,'' Mateo said. ``We didn't
know about this parade, we just saw it on TV this week. It's great.
It makes you feel proud to be Puerto Rican.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentin Nieves, 64, and his wife, Juaquina, 74, who both wore
plastic bags over their heads to keep dry, said they had flown up
from Puerto Rico to visit their two daughters, who live in the
Bronx. Nieves said he and his wife always timed their trips to
catch the parade. ``On this day,'' he said, pointing to the crowd
around him, ``all Puerto Rico is here.''
</P>
<P>
   Marchers from Mayaguez were out in strength, and from Aguadilla,
Guanica and Coamo. There was a band from the University of Puerto
Rico at Ponce. And San Juan's native sons and daughters, it seemed,
were outnumbered only by the residents of what Carlos Ortiz, a
spectator from 161st Street, boasted was ``the largest Puerto Rican
pueblo of all _ the Bronx.''
</P>
<P>
   Omar Esa, 17, of Brooklyn, eating a shish kebob, said he had
watched the parade since he was about 10 years old. ``I come
because it feels good,'' he said, ``and because of the girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Felix, 46, also of Brooklyn, said she had come to the last
23 parades. ``As long as God gives me life, I will come to the
parade,'' she said. ``It doesn't matter if it rains. The rain does
not stop us. This is our day.''
</P>
<P>
   As if to prove that point, the parade began with a procession of
politicians, among them candidates for U.S. Senate and governor,
underscoring the growing importance of Hispanic voters _ who
accounted for one in five city voters in last year's mayoral
election _ in state politics.
</P>
<P>
   An hour before the march began, Geraldine Ferraro, a Democratic
candidate for Senate, received the endorsement of Fernando Ferrer,
the Bronx borough president. Ferrer accompanied Ferraro as she
marched, and she clearly enjoyed the near-fanatical reception given
Ferrer.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki, who wore a guayabera, the traditional
embroidered white shirt, with a sash saying ``Gobernador Nueva
York,'' also was loudly cheered, but he gave as good as he got.
Dashing away from his security detail, he planted a kiss on the
cheek of Adela Otero, a hospital worker from the Lower East Side of
Manhattan who was completely charmed. She said she was a Democrat,
but Pataki had chosen well. ``I voted for him,'' Ms. Otero said.
And she would again, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered among the crowd were references to the NBC comedy
``Seinfeld,'' which set one of its last episodes at the Puerto
Rican Day Parade, but offended many because it showed the island's
flag being accidentally set on fire, setting off a riotous response
by paradegoers.
</P>
<P>
   Bert Nunez, 45, of New Brunswick, N.J., carried a poster saying,
``Jerry, you burned the wrong flag.'' Nunez said that an apology by
the network, and its announcement last week that it would not
rebroadcast the episode, were not enough to make up for the
offense. ``It's a shame that this parade has to be marred by
controversy,'' he said. ``The only thing I have to tell Seinfeld
is, `Viva Puerto Rico!'''
</P>
<P>
   The real-life crowd, as several people pointedly observed, was
far more tame than the one depicted on television. Police reported
no arrests in connection with the parade. About the only friction
was generated by the Police Department itself, when it told members
of the Latino Officers Association, a group that has been critical
of the department, that they would have to march behind the banner
of a rival, officially sanctioned group, the Hispanic Society.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Mode, spokeswoman for Police Commissioner Howard Safir,
said, ``If officers wish to march behind the banners of any other
group, they can do so, but they will have to do so in civilian
clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   But such machinations were invisible to the multitudes. What was
readily apparent was that the organizers of the parade had done an
impressive job of attracting major corporate sponsors, as evidenced
by the Hershey's Kissmobile, the giant inflated bottle of Palmolive
detergent, and the two ``official'' beers (one domestic, one
imported).
</P>
<P>
   At times, the commercialism overshadowed the participants _ such
as the dancing girls and musicians attired in hats and sashes
advertising Goya Foods, who turned out to be members of the Kip's
Bay Boys and Girls Club in the Soundview section of the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   But there was plenty to smile about:
</P>
<P>
   _ Julio Diaz, better known as the man in the subway who dances a
particularly erotic merengue with a foam-rubber woman tied to his
waist and toes, who wore a special gold-lame outfit just for the
day;
</P>
<P>
   _ The pop singer India, who stopped a rendition of her hit song
``Mi Mayor Venganza,'' about a jilted lover's vengeance, to rush
over and greet Cardinal John O'Connor at St. Patrick's Cathedral;
</P>
<P>
   _ A very large Steve Guzman, from the Castle Hill section of the
Bronx, whose giant flag failed to entirely cover his bare torso,
and who ran from one side of the avenue to the other, patting his
prodigious belly and drawing enthusiastic cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Taking it all in was Judy Cortez, 23, visiting from Honolulu.
``My friends told me to come here and represent Hawaii,'' she said.
``This is awesome!''

MARIA REICHE, 95, KEEPER OF ANCIENT PERUVIAN PUZZLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Peru, Germany)  (lb) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maria Reiche, who spent half a century as the self-appointed
guardian of an obscure pre-Incan culture's most mysterious legacy _
a vast, dazzling tableau of giant birds, animals, plants and
intricate geometric patterns scratched into the stark desert floor
_ died on June 8 in a hospital in Lima, Peru. She was 95 and was
known as the Lady of the Lines.
</P>
<P>
   To see the lines near Nazca, in southern Peru, from the air _
and there is no other way to make out the fabulous figures, some
hundreds of yards across _ the vast tapestry looks very much like
the haphazard markings on a giant child's chalkboard.
</P>
<P>
   There is a monkey with a whimsical spiral tail here, a condor
there _ a whale, a shark, a pelican, a spider, a hummingbird, an
owl-faced man, a pair of hands, other birds and animals, flowers,
and an array of geometric shapes. There is also a profusion of
string-straight lines, some extending for miles, none suggesting an
immediate explanation of why they were drawn.
</P>
<P>
   After almost 60 years of intense, if highly speculative,
scholarly scrutiny, it is hard to tell which is the greater
mystery: why the valley-dwelling Nazcan people would decorate the
surrounding desert mesas with figures so large their shapes could
not even be discerned before the age of aviation 2,000 years later,
or why an adventuresome German woman who came to South America on a
whim to tutor a diplomat's children would abandon all other
pursuits to devote her life to an almost obsessive preoccupation
with the Nazca lines.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever possessed her to make them her life's work, almost from
the time she first saw them in 1941, Ms. Reiche (pronounced
RYE-kuh) was the acknowledged and acclaimed curator of the Nazca
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Living in a small house in the desert so she could personally
protect the delicate lines from careless visitors, Ms. Reiche _ who
became a Peruvian citizen in 1994 _ shooed away intruders even as
an old woman in a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   Over five decades she meticulously measured and mapped the
intricate giant glyphs, swept away an accumulation of black dust to
restore 1,000 of the lines to their original brilliance and used
her own funds to hire guards and finance research projects.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, she tried to figure out what the lines meant to
the Nazcans, who carved them on a series of barren mesas covering
200 square miles of a long, narrow desert wedged between the Andes
Mountains and the Pacific Ocean 250 miles south of Lima.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever possessed them to scrape away the covering of
fist-sized black rocks to expose the yellow-white hardpan
underneath in a series of narrow trenches only a few inches deep
forming an array of giant patterns, the Nazcans could hardly have
wished for a more geologically stable canvas to preserve their
mysterious handiwork.
</P>
<P>
   The site is one of the driest spots on earth, drawing an average
of only 20 minutes of rainfall a year. Because of a buffering
cushion of warm air, it is virtually windless.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a land so devoid of erosion that a footprint can
last 1,000 years and the tracks of chariots used by warring
conquistador factions in the 16th century are still visible.
</P>
<P>
   The lines, which were discovered in modern times in 1926, were
threatened by modern encroachments. The Pan American Highway, it
was later discovered, had cut through a giant lizard in 1939. But
nobody could have wished for a more dedicated or effective
protector than Ms. Reiche.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Dresden, Germany, who received a mathematics degree
from the local university and who spoke five languages, Ms. Reiche
went to Peru as a tutor in 1932. She later became a translator in
Lima and met Paul Kosok, a Long Island University scholar, who
became her mentor.
</P>
<P>
   Kosok, whose interest in irrigation led him to investigate
whether the Nazca lines might have been irrigation ditches, quickly
concluded that the shallow trenches, which range from 5 to 18
inches wide, could not have been used for irrigation. But when he
happened to be standing near one of the long straight lines at
sunset on June 22, 1941, he made a discovery that would change his
life and changed Ms. Reiche's even more.
</P>
<P>
   He noticed that the line pointed directly at the setting sun,
suggesting that it was a marker for the winter solstice. Six months
later, Ms. Reiche discovered a line pointing at the summer
solstice, and a full-blown theory was born: that the Nazca lines
formed an elaborate celestial calendar, or as Kosok put it, ``the
world's largest astronomy book.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the initial interest was on the straight lines, once
Kosok had mapped the intricate path of one circuitous line and
discovered that it formed a detailed image of a bird, the interest
broadened.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Reiche, who took over Kosok's work in 1948 after he left
Peru, quickly discovered and mapped 18 other animal glyphs and over
the following decades elaborated on Kosok's calendar theory,
deciding that at least some of the glyphs were representations of
constellations.
</P>
<P>
   The calendar theory was clearly more plausible than the one that
held that the lines were part of a guidance system for prehistoric
spaceships. But scholars whose various rival theories held that the
lines had religious, social or even athletic significance nibbled
away at the calendar idea _ finding, for example, that most of the
lines did not point to any celestial bodies.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But Ms. Reiche may have made a miscalculation not unlike that
made by Columbus, who made his accidental discovery of the New
World through a fundamental error: his belief that the earth was
much smaller (and the Indies, therefore, much closer to Europe)
than they are. Her miscalculation may have been in her conviction
that at least some of the animal figures were images of stellar
constellations.
</P>
<P>
   Recent scholarship by her protege, Phyllis Pitluga, senior
astronomer at the Adler Planetarium in Chicago, concluded that all
of the animal figures are indeed representations of heavenly
shapes. But she contends that they are not shapes of constellations
but of what might be called counter constellations, the
irregular-shaped dark patches within the twinkling expanse of the
Milky Way.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the explanation, largely as a result of Ms. Reiche's
work, the Nazca lines have become a major tourist attraction and
were designated a world heritage site by UNESCO in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   And at her death, Ms. Reiche, who leaves no immediate survivors,
was hailed as a national treasure. President Alberto Fujimori of
Peru went so far as to suggest that the Nazca lines should be
renamed the Reiche lines.

CITY GM BUILT LOOKS AHEAD WARILY

<P>
   FLINT, Mich. _ It is easy to overlook the two major highways
crisscrossing this city as just a pair of well-worn roads.
</P>
<P>
   But these roads are emblems of a rich slice of U.S. history. One
is named the Chevrolet-Buick, in honor of General Motors, which
began its automobile empire here, putting food on the tables and
cars in the driveways of generation after generation. The other
highway is called the UAW, a tribute to the labor giant, the United
Auto Workers, that rose here in a legendary 1936 sit-down strike on
the factory floor of a now shuttered GM assembly plant.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the roads are ordinary yet glaring symbols of just how
tightly this city is gripped by its two most famous offspring.
</P>
<P>
   ``GM owns Flint,'' said Brad Kirfan, who co-owns a chain of
convenience stores, ``and the UAW is the town sheriff.''
</P>
<P>
   The history that binds Flint, GM and the UAW is as long and
layered as the miles of factory smokestacks that dot this city's
desolate landscape. Depending on whom you talk to here, their
tortured relationship is either wholly or at least partially at
fault for the bitter tone of simultaneous strikes by 9,000 auto
parts workers at two GM plants.
</P>
<P>
   [Negotiations between the company and UAW locals at the two
plants recessed on Sunday without an agreement, and were expected
to continue on Monday.)
</P>
<P>
   The disputes have led to the layoffs of more than 50,000 auto
workers throughout North America. And they have focused the eyes of
the nation on Flint in a way that has not been done since the 1989
documentary ``Roger and Me,'' the film by Michael Moore that
chronicled his efforts to find out why Flint was losing tens of
thousands of GM jobs.
</P>
<P>
   These days, everyone here seems to think they have the answer to
what is going on in Flint. On one side are residents and GM
employees who say that GM is trying to abandon the town it built.
On the other side are small-business owners who talk in whispers
about how the UAW seems to be determined to drive Flint's largest
employer out of town. Both groups blame city officials for not
doing more to wrest Flint from under the shadow of the automaker
and the union.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows it's coming,'' said Kevin Jennings, referring
to the widely held belief that GM is quietly preparing to close its
18 factories and offices here. Jennings, 30, is the manager of
Dale's Food for Health, one of only a handful of businesses
scattered in a three-block area of boarded-up storefronts in the
downtown section. ``I wish they would just leave and get it over
with,'' Jennings said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When Jennings was a boy, GM's presence loomed so large that
Jennings and some friends, also children of GM employees, nicknamed
the company Mother Motors. ``GM has left Flint with a plant
mentality,'' he said. ``Most people can't see past the lure of the
money and cars to even think of doing something different with
their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it is difficult to find anything here that has not been
created or influenced by the world's largest auto maker. GM and its
33,000 employees in Flint contribute about 60 percent to the local
economy. Many of the classrooms in the five colleges and
universities here are filled by GM employees and their families,
all of whom receive tuition assistance from the automaker. One of
the schools was started by GM to help train its workers for
management and engineering positions. Now privately run, the school
is the alma mater of at least 16 current GM executives, including
the two men who head the divisions that operate the plants on
strike.
</P>
<P>
   And with more than 41,000 GM retirees and surviving spouses in
the Flint area, GM and the UAW supply much of the customer base for
the city's growing health care industry. Auto workers enjoy one of
the most generous health care plans in the nation, paying for
virtually nothing even after they retire.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Woodrow Stanley says GM has been both savior and oppressor
to Flint. ``The very large presence of GM has retarded the growth
of this community,'' he said. ``It's not something you can change
overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how long the strikes linger or how they are resolved,
Stanley says the outcome for Flint is clear: ``There is no greater
microcosm of the auto industry than Flint. And if that industry is
steadily leaving America, as we're seeing, it only stands to reason
that they're going to leave Flint.''
</P>
<P>
   Union officials predict that Flint will lose 11,000 jobs over
the next two years if workers do not win job security demands at
the striking plants and other factories.
</P>
<P>
   It seems to matter to almost no one that GM plans to invest $1.5
billion here through 2001, including a $500 million engine plant.
The flight from Flint is all that people here seem to talk about,
with many of them trading stories about how they plan to beat GM
out of town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to New York; I'm going to be a singer,'' said
Tanesha Fanter, a 22-year-old welder walking the picket line. Ms.
Fanter, who lives with her parents, went to work for GM three years
ago straight out of high school. Last year, she earned $50,000. Ms.
Fanter said that although she supports the strike, she doubts GM
will always be in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could be like everybody else,'' she said, ``stay here and
collect a paycheck, but it's not worth it. This work is hard. I've
got burns all over my chest. I don't want to spend my whole life
fighting just so I can keep working in a plant. There is more to
the world than GM and Flint.''

A NEW SIGN IN THE SUBURBS: SOLD OUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JOSEPH BERGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Buying a house was not how Ron Shriberg planned to
spend his Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Rising at dawn, he was quickly where he wanted to be, at a
marina in Bayville, N.Y., getting his speedboat ready for the
cruises of summer. But a sudden rainstorm forced him to head back
to the nearby home of his in-laws, where he and his wife were
spending the weekend. On the way, he passed an open-house sign in
front of a fetching four-bedroom Cape Cod-style house in Bayville.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had that warm, appealing home look, something you could
move into and really feel comfortable,'' said Shriberg, a
29-year-old office-equipment salesman from Woodside, Queens.
</P>
<P>
   In the superheated real estate market of 1998, where he had
already lost a house to a cutthroat rival, Shriberg went into
overdrive. He rustled his wife, Laureen, out of her pajamas and
drove her over to look. Four hours after first seeing the house,
they made an offer of $260,000 that was accepted just moments ahead
of two rival bids.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized that if we saw something we truly loved, we needed
to act fairly quickly,'' Shriberg said, not quite appreciating his
own understatement.
</P>
<P>
   Just as in New York City, where co-ops and condominiums are
being snapped up soon after they go on sale, houses in New York
City's suburbs are moving faster than ice cream in July. Once an
aberration, the house that goes on the market and is spoken for the
same day is becoming routine. As a result, houses are selling for
more _ sometimes substantially more _ than their asking price, and
bidding wars that would warm the heart of a Sotheby's auctioneer
are becoming an everyday occurrence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a market in which you want to dillydally,'' said P.
Gilbert Mercurio, executive vice president of the Westchester
County Board of Realtors. ``If you like the house and the price is
right, you should act, because if you don't act, it may be some
time before you find another property.''
</P>
<P>
   Many reasons are being given for the frenzied suburban market,
in which house sales in areas like Westchester and Fairfield
County, Conn., are up more than 20 percent from a year ago and
prices are up as much as 15 percent. The economy is humming, the
stock market is bullish, and interest rates for some types of
mortgages are below 7 percent. As a result, far more people have
the wherewithal to buy. Shriberg's fourfold jump in income over two
years allowed him and his wife to consider moving out of their
Queens apartment.
</P>
<P>
   With the co-op and condo market in New York City also sizzling,
it is easy to cash in an apartment and buy that longed-for Tudor on
a cul-de-sac where the kids can learn to ride a bicycle and kick
around a soccer ball. At the same time, more suburban homeowners
have the money to trade up to that bigger house with the guest
room, the third bathroom and the large kitchen they have always
craved.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the madness is fueled by a tight supply of
houses. The seven slow years of the late 1980s and early 1990s left
many houses languishing on the market. But about two years ago,
they began to move, and now the inventory, as they are referred to
in the real estate trade, is depleted.
</P>
<P>
   In the first quarter of 1998, only 3,945 single-family houses in
all of Westchester were on the market, a 24 percent decline from
the 5,171 listed in the first quarter of 1997. As a result, the
average price of a house in Westchester _ $403,020 _ is 7 percent
higher than it was a year ago. In Nassau County, the number of
homes for sale has dropped from 8,132 in April 1997 to 5,979 this
April, and the average price is up 13 percent. In Fairfield County,
where inventory figures were not available, the average price of a
single-family house is $320,475, a 14.9 percent increase from a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   In such a market, it helps to pounce.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Darlene Bandazian, manager of the Weichert Realtors office in
Ramsey, N.J., recalled how one of her agents received a listing on
a recent Saturday for a $290,000 house in Mahwah. He scheduled an
open house for the next day and, having no time to place a
newspaper advertisement, posted a dozen fliers on lampposts and
street signs. Fifty couples showed up, three of whom made offers.
The house was sold at its asking price.
</P>
<P>
   In such a market, it even helps to bribe _ legally, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Karla Renz-Mcleod and Steven McLeod of Forest Hills, Queens,
fell in love with a three-bedroom house in Stamford, Conn., with a
flagstone patio and a lush garden. But they mistakenly decided to
compare a few other houses before making an offer. By the time they
returned that afternoon, another couple _ in a Mercedes _ was
inspecting the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see the wife was making these motions like, `This is
where the second floor can be expanded,''' said Ms. Renz-McLeod.
</P>
<P>
   The McLeods put in a bid of $285,000 but couldn't match the one
by their rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're using cash for the deal, all inspections waived,''
said Ms. Renz-McLeod. ``How can you compete with that?''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Vera Blendermann, a broker for Houlihan Lawrence in
Bronxville, told of a large Colonial on one acre that went on sale
on a Thursday for $1.5 million. A half-dozen written bids came in,
and when they were opened on Sunday, the highest was from someone
who had not only offered more than $100,000 beyond the asking price
but was also willing to put up enough assets to forgo a mortgage
approval and an engineer's inspection, and to close on the house
whenever it suited the seller.
</P>
<P>
   ``What better terms can you give than removing your mortgage
contingency, removing your engineering inspection and closing at
the convenience of the seller?'' Ms. Blendermann said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some buyers say they feel betrayed by sellers unable
to resist better offers. In March, Shriberg shook hands with the
broker on a $230,000 deal for a waterfront ranch house in
Oceanside, in Nassau County. Shriberg signed a contract and sent in
an $11,500 deposit, but the seller never put his signature on the
contract or cashed the check. Instead, the owner sold the house
privately _ no broker was involved _ to a remote acquaintance who
came up with $250,000 in cash. Though they got their deposit back,
the Shribergs were left in the lurch.
</P>
<P>
   ``These days, people have a lot more money,'' Shriberg said.
``The seller's friend realized, `I better step up to the plate or
I'll lose the house.''' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Though not every broker agrees, Mary Grimm, a veteran broker for
C.S. McClellan in Pelham, in Westchester, said the current market
is giddier than even the bustling market of the mid-1980s. And it
seems to touch most locations and price ranges. Denise Smith, a
spokeswoman for Weichert Realtors, said that sales are at their
most feverish in the ``classic suburban bedroom communities as
opposed to the more urban and rural areas.'' In western Bergen
County, N.J., for example, the hottest locations are Wyckoff,
Ramsey, Mahwah, Allendale and Franklin Lakes. In Westchester,
suburbs like Scarsdale, Larchmont and Pelham are hopping.
</P>
<P>
   The mania has changed the way brokers, buyers and sellers
behave. Rather than merely worry about how to best articulate the
features of a house, brokers have to concentrate on convincing the
suspicious buyer that the race is to the swift.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to be on top of the market,'' said Jackson B.
Browning, president of Julia Fee Realty, which has offices
throughout Westchester. ``It's not a part-time job. They have to be
active, have to know what's coming on the market the minute it's in
the computer.''
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Lampl, a broker at Wykagyl/Rittenberg Realty in New
Rochelle, said she tried to avoid putting overt pressure on a
client she took to houses in Scarsdale and New Rochelle. But
experience provided a telling lesson.
</P>
<P>
   In Scarsdale, the Tudor was swarming with brokers _ upstairs,
downstairs, in the attic, in the yard. They peered, poked, sniffed,
opened and closed closets and then were briskly off to examine
other prospects. Ms. Lampl coolly escorted her pregnant client,
Gail Herman, through the frenzy, pointing out the three-bedroom
house's low taxes, good school district and proximity to the
Scarsdale train station.
</P>
<P>
   But the Scarsdale house vanished the same day, before Mrs.
Herman had even considered making an offer. Mrs. Herman, a
30-year-old school psychologist who has been living with her
stockbroker husband, Michael, in a one-bedroom apartment in White
Plains, was not disappointed. Just that morning, she had seen a
1940s white Colonial cottage with red shutters in a congenial
neighborhood in New Rochelle, a house with offbeat moldings,
dormered ceilings and lots of nooks and crannies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charming. Gail likes charming,'' Ms. Lampl had already noted.
</P>
<P>
   So Mrs. Herman took her husband, weary from a day of work, to
see the house that same evening. The next day, she showed it to her
mother. On the third day, she made an offer. It was too late, of
course. In the frantic market of 1998, three days might as well
have been three years. Someone else had beaten her to the punch.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Herman was stoic. ``There will always be another house,''
she said. But Ms. Lampl said she would not be surprised if Mrs.
Herman took a different tack the next time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It puts me in an awkward position,'' she said of the hot
market. ``I don't want to pressure people and don't want them to
feel they have to hurry up, but when things like this happen, then
the second time around they act a lot more quickly.''

SMUGGLED CHINESE IMMIGRANT DESCRIBES VOYAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID W. CHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELIZABETH, N.J. _ It was an odyssey, he said, that began more
than a year ago, when he was forced to leave a coastal village in
China for political reasons, and ended two weeks ago when what he
hoped would be his boat to freedom ran aground on the Jersey Shore.
</P>
<P>
   In between, he said, was a desperate, often difficult passage
that included a prolonged, lonely stay in a humid country in South
America and an unpleasant voyage aboard a large, rickety ship with
about 200 other Chinese men bobbing through the rough Atlantic
Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been very difficult,'' said the man, 25, who spoke on the
condition that his name not be used. ``I am lonely.''
</P>
<P>
   The man is one of 23 Chinese who tried to enter the United
States illegally on May 30 and are being held by the federal
Immigration and Naturalization Service at a detention center here.
The immigrants' lawyers say that the men will seek political
asylum; the immigration service, though, has begun deportation
hearings and is moving swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   Information about the 23 men, whose predicament recalls that of
the 286 illegal Chinese immigrants aboard the Golden Venture, a
smuggling ship that ran aground in Queens in 1993, has been sketchy
to this point. But one of the 23 spoke briefly in an interview at
the detention center about why he did what he did, casting some
light on the conditions and hardships he and his fellow shipmates
may have endured.
</P>
<P>
   During the voyage, the man said, food was scarce. Uncertainty,
however, was plentiful: uncertainty about whether he would be able
to repay the $20,000 to $30,000 debt his family had incurred to
send him to America, whether he would survive the trip, and whether
he would be caught and sent back to China, where his life, he said,
would be in danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was forced to leave China for political reasons,'' the man
said. ``I am afraid of being captured by the Communist Party.''
</P>
<P>
   The immigration service is trying to determine whether his
account is genuine or the result of an effort to coach the man to
say things that might improve his chances of staying in the United
States. On Thursday and Friday, the 23 men made brief individual
appearances before two immigration judges to determine whether they
should be released on bond. The hearings are scheduled to resume in
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   One of the 23 Chinese men, Wang Wu Dong, was also aboard the
Golden Venture in 1993. He failed to win asylum and was deported
only months before Congress passed a law in 1996 that would have
strengthened his case for asylum. Wang politely declined to offer
any details recently, saying only, ``I've been through many
hardships.'' He referred all matters to his lawyers at The Porges
Law Firm in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   But the 25-year-old passenger who spoke on condition of
anonymity did speak cautiously about his situation.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in Mandarin, the man said that he grew up in the small
farming community of Minjiangko, not far from the city of Fuzhou in
Fujian Province. He studied through middle school, then found work,
first as a painter, later as a clerk at a sundries store.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am worried about what might happen to me if I go back,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He did say, though, that he was not married and that he was not
a practicing Christian or a member of the pro-democracy movement.
</P>
<P>
   He said that his relatives arranged for his trip, paying about
$20,000 to $30,000 to a smuggling group, and that he left home
about one year ago. He was flown to South America.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier reports in the Chinese-language media have said that the
men flew to Suriname, in South America.
</P>
<P>
   The 23, apparently, were not the only Chinese men who were in
South America, waiting for an opportunity to sneak into the United
States, the man from Minjiangko said.
</P>
<P>
   After waiting for what might have been the better part of a
year, the men finally left perhaps two or three months ago,
boarding a big ship. There may have been 200 men, most of whom were
from Fujian. But the man said he did not recognize a soul from his
Minjiangko life, and he felt lonely, often.
</P>
<P>
   The voyage was difficult: Sleep was but a dream, and food
consisted only of rice porridge. At some point, the bigger ship
discharged a group of about two dozen, who then transferred to a
smaller boat, the Oops II. But the Oops II lost its way in heavy
fog and ran aground on the night of May 30 at Bay Head.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday, the U.S. Coast Guard took custody of a freighter
intercepted about 195 miles east of San Salvador Island, and the
authorities have said it may have been a so-called mother ship used
in the Oops II smuggling operation.
</P>
<P>
   The man from Minjiangko said he hoped that he would be granted
asylum. ``I've suffered a lot,'' he said. ``I don't want to go
back.''

GREENSPAN ENDORSES ACCOUNTING BOARD DECISION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., La.)  (lb) 
 By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that the fierce debate has been settled on how banks should
account for complex securities, the Federal Reserve Board chairman,
Alan Greenspan, has thrown his support behind the accounting rule
makers who rejected his recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   In a June 4 letter, Greenspan said that he was concerned about
legislation now pending in Congress aimed at weakening the power of
the rule makers, the Financial Accounting Standards Board.
</P>
<P>
   The bills were introduced after banks complained to legislators
about the accounting board's attempt to force companies to record
the value of financial derivatives in their financial statements.
Greenspan had joined the banks in criticizing the accounting board
for that proposal. And, the rule makers' opponents have been using
the chairman's past comments to help win support for the two bills.
</P>
<P>
   But in his letter addressed to Arthur Levitt Jr., the chairman
of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Greenspan said that he
approved of the way that accounting rules are now set by the
privately financed board, which works on the commission's behalf
and is known by its initials, FASB.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I have not always agreed with FASB's ultimate
conclusions, I have always felt that the openness of the process
allows all affected parties sufficient opportunity to contribute to
the debate,'' Greenspan wrote in the letter, a copy of which was
given to The New York Times by people who support the accounting
board. ``I share your concerns that pending congressional
legislation could disrupt existing accounting standards and impair
the ongoing accounting standards-setting process by subjecting it
to unnecessary pressures.''
</P>
<P>
   The accounting board voted to finalize the rules on derivatives
late last month, angering the banks and adding heat to the debate.
Derivatives are complicated contracts between two or more parties
where the contract's value is derived from a stock, an index or a
commodity.
</P>
<P>
   An aide to Sen. Lauch Faircloth, who has introduced a bill that
would exempt banks from using the new derivatives rule unless
banking regulators approve, said he did not believe that
Greenspan's letter would affect the senator's plans.
</P>
<P>
   The aide, James Hyland, said that Faircloth, a Republican from
North Carolina, plans to hold hearings on the board in the
subcommittee that he heads in the Senate Banking Committee. Hyland
said that the accounting rule makers had ``put on a full court
press, saying that we don't want Congress involved in setting
accounting standards.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They should not feel that they are immune to any congressional
action,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another bill in the House would require federal securities
regulators to approve any new rule proposed by the accounting
board. The bill by Rep. Richard Baker, R-La., would also make it
easier for companies to challenge the accounting rules in court.

EDITORIAL: THE SQUID ON CENTRAL PARK WEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, June 15:
</P>
<P>
   Blanched in death, with a rising odor, a giant squid _ one of
the best-preserved examples of this rarely seen species _ lay
thawing on a plastic-sheathed workroom floor at the American Museum
of Natural History last week. A worker misted its arms and
tentacles with a spray bottle. Another gently turned the tip of a
20-foot tentacle to photograph the squid's suckers. A press
photographer straddled the head and aimed his flash directly at the
visually confusing region where head and mantle become mouth and
arms.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of museum staff members looked on, and beyond them,
through a pair of swinging doors, an enormous freight elevator
began to ferry up the television crews, as though this were the
start of a science fiction movie that could not really begin until
the ingenue-scientist walked in fresh from makeup.
</P>
<P>
   The squid was caught by commercial fishermen at a depth of about
2,000 feet off New Zealand in December. It was frozen aboard ship
and eventually flown to New York City, where it arrived last
Wednesday. It is male, perhaps 5 to 6 years old, and it had been
frozen along with an immature giant squid lacking the two long
tentacles of its fellow. What particularly pleased Dr. Neil
Landman, curator of invertebrates at the museum, was the condition
of the squid's beak, which has the shape of a parrot's beak but
looks, in fact, more like a beautifully modeled seashell, deep
chocolate brown at its sharp ends and paling as it thickens. The
rusty mottling that would have covered the squid's mantle in life _
a life about which virtually nothing is known _ still persisted in
the tentacles.

   In a sense this squid, Architeuthis kirki, suggested the
cephalopods for sale in fish markets (usually a species called
Loligo opalescens) rather than the monsters preyed upon by sperm
whales and described by Jules Verne and Herman Melville. Each time
a giant squid has been sighted _ and there have been fewer than 200
authenticated occasions _ humans learn a little more about giant
squids and a lot more about themselves. In the past, giant squids
have aroused a murderous, fearful curiosity that is perhaps as much
a measure of the primal gap between vertebrates and invertebrates
as the one between man and squid. So much difference is hard to
accept.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at this supple beast _ with so few hard parts, none
giving support to the body _ a viewer could see that in life the
density of the ocean itself had given this squid all the support it
needed, in every direction. This creature is a boon for science,
but its capture is also a reminder of the desperate efficiency with
which humans are now fishing even the deep waters of earth.

THE BULLPEN SQUANDERS NOMO'S GEM 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ On a searing subtropical afternoon, Hideo Nomo did his
part. But the New York Mets' bullpen wasn't nearly as effective.
</P>
<P>
   What had figured to be a painless wrap-up to the Mets' four-game
series against the Florida Marlins turned into a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   A four-run eighth inning allowed the Marlins to tie the game,
4-4, and they won it by 5-4 with a two-out rally in the ninth
before 23,924 at Pro Player Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The loss dropped the Mets to 37-27 and spoiled the first
scoreless outing of the season for Nomo (2-7).
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a very ugly game,'' catcher Alberto Castillo said.
``We just gave it away.''
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins strung together three straight hits to win it, one
coming on a bouncer through shortstop. Rey Ordonez had moved to
cover second base on Edgar Renteria's steal attempt. Todd Zeile won
the game on a broken-bat single up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' offense collapsed as much as their relief pitching.
From the sixth inning on, they were 0-for-7 with runners in scoring
position.
</P>
<P>
   The hitting drought occurred with Butch Huskey, who has had a
balky right knee, in the dugout, benched in the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't ask to be taken out,'' Huskey said. ``It wasn't my
decision.'' Manager Bobby Valentine said Huskey has a ``hobbled
knee.''
</P>
<P>
   The heat apparently made Sunday a bigger challenge for Nomo, the
Japanese right-hander acquired recently from the Los Angeles
Dodgers. ``These are not his favorite conditions to pitch, from
what I have heard,'' Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the test, the Mets chose to wear black jerseys on this
humid 88-degree day, rather than their grays. Actually, Carlos
Baerga made the decision after Charlie Samuels, the equipment
manager, called out in the locker room for someone to make a
choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lighter uniform,'' Valentine said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Nomo struggled with his control from the outset. With one out in
the first, Renteria singled, then stole second. Todd Dunwoody
walked. But Nomo got out of the inning when Zeile struck out and
Castillo threw out Dunwoody on the back end of an attempted double
steal.
</P>
<P>
   In the second, Cliff Floyd doubled to open the inning and Ryan
Jackson sacrificed him to third. Then, with a drawn-in infield,
Baerga speared Craig Counsell's liner, and Nomo struck out Mike
Redmond.
</P>
<P>
   Two more Marlins reached base in the third with one out, but
Nomo struck out Dunwoody and induced Zeile to bounce to short.
</P>
<P>
   After Livan Hernandez, the World Series most valuable player,
retired eight straight batters between the first and third innings,
the Mets managed a run with two outs in the third. Luis Lopez was
hit by a pitch, then Edgardo Alfonzo doubled to the
left-center-field wall with Lopez racing home.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonzo did more clutch hitting in the fifth. Nomo beat out a
two-out infield single and Lopez doubled off the left-field wall.
Alfonzo hit a full-count fastball to right to score both runners.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo left after six innings. He allowed four hits, three walks
and struck out seven while throwing 93 pitches, 51 for strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a humid day, and he'd done some running,'' Valentine
said. ``I thought I'd turn it over to the bullpen.''
</P>
<P>
   Little did he realize how dicey that would be. Mel Rojas and
Brian Bohanon were jolted for four runs in the eighth. Doubles by
Renteria and Zeile scored the first two runs, bringing in Bohanon.
He gave up a two-run home run to Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I'd keep throwing him inside until he proved he
could hit it,'' Bohanon said of Floyd. ``I just didn't do the
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopez, the leadoff hitter, was a bright light in this emotional
rainstorm. The left fielder had a perfect game. He singled twice,
doubled, was hit by a pitch and walked.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine was asked if this defeat will last a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we play again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH:
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Mike Piazza, who missed the last two games with a
strained right shoulder, hit the ball hard during batting practice
Sunday and likely will play Tuesday, according to Manager Bobby
Valentine. ... Outfielder Bernard Gilkey, hit on the left eye
Friday night, also took batting practice but said he felt ``about
the same'' as the day before, when swelling around the eye affected
his vision. ... Armando Reynoso, who has been bothered with elbow
tightness, pitched in a simulated game Sunday, and was expected to
start Thursday for Class A Port St. Lucie, Fla. He will see catcher
Todd Pratt, who has had a nerve disorder in his right shoulder, and
who made his debut for Port St. Lucie on Sunday.

EDITORIAL: RIGGING THE NUMBERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, June 15:
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans want to cut taxes, but some of them are queasy
about the spending cuts needed to make the numbers work out. It
would be so much easier if someone could just apply a magic wand to
make everything balance without having to face difficult choices.
Fortunately for the public purse, the rules now do not allow for
invented numbers. Instead, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget
Office estimates the budget effect of tax and spending proposals.
</P>
<P>
   The intellectual honesty of the Budget Office, and its
reluctance to assume that whatever the Republicans propose will
magically make the economy boom, has so angered Speaker Newt
Gingrich and the rest of the Republican leadership that they have
embarked on a campaign to intimidate it. A letter from the entire
GOP leadership to the key Appropriations subcommittee warned that
if the office did not immediately start to produce more palatable
numbers, ``we must review [its) structure and funding.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans have a point when they say that recent budget
forecasts have been too cautious. The strength of the American
economy has surprised economists and produced tax revenues well
above estimates. But it would be very risky to assume that the
``Goldilocks economy'' _ not too hot and not too cold _ will
continue indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans need to face the hard choices in putting
together a budget. They should stop trying to intimidate the
professionals who have served Congress, and the public, very well.

COMMENTARY: A SPOT TO HIDE FROM THE JOKES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ELIZABETH KOLBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A hurricane sweeps up the Eastern Seaboard toward New
York City, packing 100-mile-an-hour winds.
</P>
<P>
   A bomb blast destroys a power plant, plunging Brooklyn and
Queens into darkness.
</P>
<P>
   A terrorist group vows to release nerve gas in a crowded subway
station, pushing the city toward hysteria.
</P>
<P>
   Such crises could happen, and a metropolitan center like New
York is particularly vulnerable, which helps account for Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani's plans for an emergency control center. As the
mayor explains it, the city needs the control center so that its
leaders can respond to disasters with all the speed and
effectiveness that cutting-edge technology can provide.
</P>
<P>
   So why is everyone laughing?
</P>
<P>
   No sooner were the mayor's plans for the $15 million command
bunker revealed over the weekend, than the visionary scheme became
a target for practically every would-be humorist in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Sliwa and Ron Kuby devoted four hours of their radio
program to lampooning the project on Saturday morning. During the
show, listeners participated in a name-that-shelter contest, which
produced such winning entries as ``Rudy's Nuclear Winter Palace''
and ``The Nut Shell.''
</P>
<P>
   The City Council speaker, Peter Vallone, joined in the
not-quite-harmless fun, noting that ``the mayor's actions are
increasingly bizarre.'' He added, ``If he wants to build a bunker
for the only people he trusts, all he needs is a phone booth.''
</P>
<P>
   A clearly delighted former Mayor Edward Koch declared, ``It's
the joke of the week.''
</P>
<P>
   In a highly symbolic business like politics, it is sometimes the
truly consequential blunders that matter, and sometimes just the
ones that make good sense metaphorically. Had George Bush ever laid
eyes on a supermarket scanner before that fateful day in 1992?
Probably he had.
</P>
<P>
   Did Dan Quayle know the correct spelling of ``potatoe''? Quite
possibly.
</P>
<P>
   Does New York City need a state-of-the-art emergency control
center, with enough water to last a week, a secure line to the
president and a ventilation system that can be closed in case of a
biological attack?
</P>
<P>
   Who cares?
</P>
<P>
   In the course of his eminently successful career, Giuliani has
already done more than his fair share of unsettling things. Whether
dressing up in sequins or harassing hot dog vendors, his actions
have often been characterized by an element of excess, a ``l'etat,
c'est moi'' quality that has left even his critics slightly agape.
</P>
<P>
   But rarely has he seemed, symbolically speaking, on such
dangerous ground.
</P>
<P>
   It is not that the center is, on the face of it, an outrageous
project, or even that its most grandiose elements are out-and-out
absurd. Who knows, maybe it would be useful to be able to hold a
video conference with the president during a bomb scare, a flood or
a really ugly sewer-main break.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that the project seems to speak too clearly to
the mayor's fears and, worse still, his hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has always governed as if from a bunker, with chaos
threatening from all sides and enemies all around. On some deep
level _ well, maybe not so very deep _ one senses that nothing
would please him more than having an antagonist truly worthy of his
energies instead of just a ragtag bunch of disgruntled taxi
drivers, street artists and unemployed strippers.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the news of the multimillion-dollar command center
got out, aides to the mayor did their best to quash the story. The
mayor was not building a Strangeglovian bunker, they said, noting
that it was going to be equipped with only a fold-out couch. They
also disputed charges that the bunker was being built in secret,
pointing to a one-line entry on page 995 of the city's capital
budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clearly laid out in the budget for anyone to inspect and
review,'' said Colleen Roche, a spokeswoman for the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Aides even objected to the term ``bunker,'' with its paranoid
Cold War connotations; it is ``not a bunker,'' insisted Jerome
Hauer, director of the city's Office of Emergency Management.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, at a news conference on Saturday, defended the bunker
with characteristic vigor, accusing critics of playing politics
with the safety of millions of New Yorkers. And he made a special
point of correcting the notion that in planning for disaster, he
was thinking about himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not for the benefit of the mayor,'' he said. ``It's for
the benefit of New York.''
</P>
<P>
   So will everyone please stop laughing?

JIM HEARN, 77, GIANTS PITCHER WHO HELPED WIN '51 PENNANT 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jim Hearn, a right-handed pitcher who helped propel the New York
Giants to victory in a dramatic 1951 National League pennant race
with the Brooklyn Dodgers a year after his career was seemingly
ending, died Wednesday at his winter home in Boca Grande, Fla. He
was 77.
</P>
<P>
   Hearn, whose main home was in Greensboro, Ga., had suffered from
Hodgkin's lymphoma, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' drive to a pennant in 1951 after they were 13{ games
behind the Dodgers in mid-August has been labeled ``The Miracle of
Coogan's Bluff.'' Although thrilled by Bobby Thomson's
pennant-winning homer off Ralph Branca at the Polo Grounds in Game
3 of a playoff, Hearn would point to the Giants' pitching in the
regular season's final week as the real miracle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only really bad pressure was on the pitching staff,'' he
recalled. ``We were just plain worn out; our arms were hanging
dead. In those last four games of the season _ two in Philly, two
in Boston _ we gave up a total of four runs, pitching with two,
three days' rest. That, to me, is the Miracle of Coogan's Bluff.''
</P>
<P>
   A 6-foot-3-inch, 205-pound native of Atlanta, Hearn had a 17-9
record for the 1951 Giants in a pitching rotation led by Sal Maglie
and Larry Jansen. Hearn beat the Dodgers twice late in the season
and then pitched the Giants to a 3-1 victory over Brooklyn at
Ebbets Field in Game 1 of the playoff. He beat the Yankees in Game
3 of the World Series, which the Giants lost in six games.
</P>
<P>
   Hearn compiled a 12-7 record as a St. Louis Cardinal rookie in
1947, having been signed out of Georgia Tech and then converted
from a third baseman. But he did not enjoy much more success in St.
Louis; he sustained a shoulder strain and was sent to the minors
early in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis sent Hearn to the Giants for $10,000 that July. With
his shoulder becoming sound again, and with the Giants' pitching
coach, Frank Shellenback, teaching him to throw a sinker, Hearn
went 11-3 for the Giants in 1950, led the league in earned run
average at 2.49 and tied for the lead in shutouts with five.
</P>
<P>
   Going into Game 1 of the 1951 playoff, Hearn had pain from a
ligament strain in his side. After each inning, the team trainer,
Doc Bowman, applied a hot ointment. It made Hearn forget about the
ligament problem, and he limited the Dodgers to five hits in a
complete-game victory.
</P>
<P>
   Hearn had a career record of 109-89 over 13 seasons with the
Cardinals, Giants and Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Mary; three sons, Jeffrey, of
Charleston, S.C., Paul, of Dunwoody, Ga., and Christopher, of
Chamblee, Ga.; a daughter, Mary Crawford, of Dunwoody; a brother,
Jack, of Atlanta; a sister, Mary Elrod, of Boca Grande, and 11
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Hearn would retain vivid memories of the moment when Thomson hit
baseball's most dramatic home run. He was throwing in the Giants'
bullpen in right field, prepared to enter the game if it went to
extra innings, when he heard a roar.
</P>
<P>
   At first, he did not realize what had happened. Then, as he
recalled it: ``I saw Duke Snider on his knees in center, pounding
his glove on the grass. That's when I took off for home plate. It
was just the greatest thrill of my life.''
