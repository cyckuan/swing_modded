<HEADLINE> Tsohatzopoulos Stresses Peaceful Solution to Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Greek Defense Minister Akis
Tsohatzopoulos said Saturday that diplomacy was the only way to
resolve the Kosovo crisis, warning that the use of military force
could ignite war further afield in the Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after meeting his Albanian counterpart Luan Hajdaraga
in the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki, Tsohatzopoulos said
that whoever used violence, be it the Serbs or the Albanian
Liberation Army (KLA), would be responsible and accountable for
the explosion which would be ignited in the Balkans, the
semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need for pressure to be exerted on the Yugoslav
government to begin immediately the dialogue with ethnic Albanian
leader Ibrahim Rugova without terms and preconditions. He also
said that the KLA forces trying to win Kosovo's independence from
Yugoslavia through violent means would be condemned as undermining
peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that they respected human rights and the
right to self-administration and autonomy, but equally, the
peaceful coexistence of peoples must be secured and there must be
no change of borders in the Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
Hajdaraga, who arrived in Thessaloniki Saturday for a working
visit, said that he agreed on the general need for dialogue, but
added that if diplomatic efforts failed, military action was
likely as a last resort.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers also agreed to extend the presence of two
Greek military missions in Albania.

<HEADLINE> Russian Food Imports Rise Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 27 (Xinhua) -- A battered Russian agricultural
sector has brought about a sharp rise in food imports into the
country in the first four months of the year.
</P>
<P>
From outside the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), milk
powder imports was up 90 percent, raw sugar 330 percent and white
sugar 420 percent, the Interfax news agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Police Investigate Nazi Behavior of German Soldiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 27 (Xinhua) -- German police said Saturday that they
are investigating three German soldiers who have been assused of
giving Nazi salute while watching a television broadcast of a
World Cup soccer match in the southern German city of Regensburg.
</P>
<P>
According to police investigators, eyewitnesses have seen a
group of German soldiers making the constitutionally forbidden
Nazi salute at a cafe in Regensburg while the German national
anthem was being played ahead of last Thursday's World Cup match
between Germany and Iran.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers have also been seen wearing T-shirts printed with
the slogan: "We march into France in 1998."
</P>
<P>
Three soldiers based near Regensburg have been detained in
connection with the incident.
</P>
<P>
German army officials Satursday said they were shocked by the
new incident and would take harsh disciplinary measures against
the soldiers if their behavior had been confirmed.
</P>
<P>
The German military was hit by a series of neo-Nazi scandals
last years with incidents ranging from soldiers making Nazi
salute, chanting Nazi solgans to conducting mock execution of Jews.
</P>
<P>
The scandals also prompted the German parliament to launch a
special investigation into the general morale of the German army
earlier this year.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Spain Pledge Joint Efforts to Advance Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and Spain on Saturday pledged
joint efforts to advance the stalled Middle East peace process,
saying that they support the convening of an international
conference if the latest U.S. peace bid fails.
</P>
<P>
The pledge was made by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
visiting Spanish Prime Minister Maria Aznar after their meeting
here.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the joint conference with Aznar, Mubarak clarified
that the conference that he and French President Jacques Chirac
are jointly proposing will not be a Madrid II and not aimed at
cancelling the agreement reached at the historical Madrid
Conference in October 1991.
</P>
<P>
"A Madrid II conference will blast the whole peace process,"
Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
The Madrid conference, which brought the Arabs and Israelis to
the negotiating table for the first face-to-face talks, created
the framework for the subsequent peace talks between Israel and
its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Upset by the prolonged deadlock in the current peace
process, Egypt and France initiated the call in May for holding an
international conference to salvage the Middle East peace.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said the joint Egyptian-French bid does not contradict
the American endeavors but is aimed at assisting these efforts. He
was referring to the U.S. proposal calling for a 13.1 percent
Israeli troop redeployment in the West Bank in order to break the
15-month long impasse in the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"In case the American endeavors did not bear fruit, then the
Egyptian-French initiative must come to light so as to probe means
of ending the stalemated Middle East peace process," he said.
</P>
<P>
Aznar said that Spain is committed to the Middle East peace
process and supports the Egyptian-French initiative to convene an
international conference if the U.S. effort fails. He called on
all the parties to implement the signed peace accords without any
delay.
</P>
<P>
He agreed that the call for holding a Madrid II conference
should not be aimed at cancelling the principles agreed upon at
the 1991 Madrid conference.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak blamed Israel for the current deadlock, saying that
there has been no breakthrough in the peace process since Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came to power in mid-1996.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian leader also defended the Palestinians' appeal for
upgrading their status as a "statehood" at the United Nations
General Assembly, saying that the Israeli practices necessitate
such demand.
</P>
<P>
Aznar arrived here Friday on a three-day visit to Egypt, his
first since his election in March 1996. He will also visit Israel
and the Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also discussed ways of promoting bilateral
economic and trade ties. Aznar, accompanied by 300 Spanish
businessmen, later attended the meeting of the Egyptian-Spanish
Businessmen Forum on increasing bilateral trade and raising
Spanish investment in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian-Spanish trade stood at 491 million U.S. dollars
last year, and it is expected to rise to 550 million dollars this
year.
</P>
<P>
Spain, the third biggest foreign investor in Egypt after the
United States and Britain, has an investment of 164 million
Egyptian pounds (48.24 million U.S. dollars) in Egypt.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Accuses S. Korea of Inhumanity in Submarine Incident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) accused Saturday the South Korean authorities of
adopting inhumane measures against a sunk DPRK submarine.
</P>
<P>
"We already reported that our small submarine was wrecked after
drifting about with a mishap to machinery in a training in the
east Sea of Korea off Kosong," the DPRK Committee for the Peaceful
Reunification of the Fatherland said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
However, said the statement released through a spokesman, the
South Korean authorities described the accident as an "anti-South
operation" in an investigation statement on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK side strongly condemned South Korea's engagement in an
anti-North conspiracy by making use of the submarine incident.
</P>
<P>
The statement also urged South Korea to send back immediately
the corpses of the crewmen as well as the submarine.

<HEADLINE> News Feature: New Kuala Lumpur International Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 27 (Xinhua) -- A Malaysia Airlines Boeing
777 dubbed "Super Ranger" with 150 people on board from the old
Kuala Lumpur International Airport touched down at the new Kuala
Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) Saturday night, marking the
new airport's opening.
</P>
<P>
Under a blaze of fireworks and pounding of drums, Malaysian
King Tuanku Ja'afar fitted a replica of the airport control tower
into a model of a globe to signify the opening of Malaysia's
world-class KLIA, located in Sepang, some 50 km south of Kuala
Lumpur, and is among the largest in the world.
</P>
<P>
The air over the former rubber and oil palm plantation site
Saturday night was filled with the throbbing beats of the Malay
drums performed by drum troupes.
</P>
<P>
A 10-minute breathtaking fireworks and laser display was
watched by some 1,400 guests from inside the main terminal
building and thousands of people in the surrounding areas.
</P>
<P>
The KLIA, covering 10,000 hectares of land, was completed in
four and a half years with round-the-clock construction work
undertaken by an international workforce of 25,000 people at a
cost of about 3.5 billion U.S. dollars and will commence full
commercial operations on June 30.
</P>
<P>
Designed by renowned Japanese architect Kisho Kurokawa, the
KLIA is a spectacular feat of construction which combines
futuristic technology, Malaysian culture and the rich, tropical
splendor of its natural resources, and is regarded as one of the
most modern and sophisticated airports in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
From the air, the KLIA looks like a futuristic structure hidden
in a remote jungle. Encircling the airport is a tropical forest.
</P>
<P>
More than a million trees and shrubs are transplanted both
within and outside the large Passenger Terminal Complex, according
to the airport management authorities.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is home to the world's oldest tropical rain forests.
The KLIA is therefore often described as the "airport in the
forest, forest in the airport."
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammad, who was present at
the opening ceremony, said: "KLIA is not just an airport. It is a
piece of art, dedicated to beauty as well as the environment. It
relates to the greenness and the forests of Malaysia, both inside
and outside."
</P>
<P>
Two runways are capable of handling up to 120 aircraft
movements an hour -- one for landings and the other to serve
planes taking off, and the world's tallest control tower at the
airport guides the plane right up to one of the 46 aircraft
parking gates or one of the 60 remote aircraft stands.
</P>
<P>
The large passenger terminal complex, whose facade has a
rippling wave-like roof supported by a colonnade of majestic
granite-clad conical columns, is designed with an emphasis on
natural light, transparency and greenery.
</P>
<P>
The main passenger terminal is linked, by an automated train
shuttle, with the four-armed satellite building where
international passengers make connections to other flights.
</P>
<P>
The departure concourse on the top level of the main passenger
terminal has six check-in islands providing up to 216 counters.
</P>
<P>
To speed up immigration clearance for departing passengers,
there are 61 counters, and for arriving passengers, they can move
rapidly through 69 immigration counters and 32 customs counters as
well as retrieve their
baggage from one of 12 carousels.
</P>
<P>
Initially, the KLIA is capable of handling up to 25 million
passengers and 1.2 million tons of cargo annually.
</P>
<P>
Designed to be a regional hub, the KLIA is built with features
that allow flexibility for future expansion, well into the next
century. In its lay-out plan, the KLIA with four runways will
ultimately have the capacity for 100 million passengers per annum
under future phases of development.
</P>
<P>
A high-speed train link between the KLIA and the capital city
of Kuala Lumpur is under construction and is scheduled to be in
service by 2000 when it will take passengers half an hour from the
KLIA to Kuala Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
Describing the official opening of the KLIA as another
milestone in Malaysia's aviation history, Mahathir said that
during the present economic slowdown it offered the aviation
industry in the Asia-Pacific region unlimited capacity for growth.
</P>
<P>
"A hub can only succeed if it could offer a wide network of
connecting flights," he said, adding that the KLIA should achieve
this by promoting itself with confidence.

<HEADLINE> Italy Squeeze into Quarter-finals with 1-0 Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MARSEILLE, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Italy played a mostly defensive
game to beat Norway 1-0 for a place in the quarter-finals at the
World Cup finals here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Italians was apparently more aggressive than in their group
matches in the first 30 minutes and created several chances.
</P>
<P>
Christian Vieri, who had scored four goals in the group
competitions, added his total to five when he got a long pass from
Luigi Di Biagio and beat the Norwegian goal-keeper at the 18th minute.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian team, which adopted the same tactics they used in
the game against Brazil, failed to organise effective attack when
the Italians went back to their usual defensive play after the goal.
</P>
<P>
The second half saw the Norwegians in attack for most of the
time. But Tore Andre Flo, who was the star in the game against
Brazil, could not break up the tough defence of the Italians.
</P>
<P>
He did have a chance at the 71st minute but his powerful header
was saved by Italian goal-keeper Gianluca Pagliuca.
</P>
<P>
Earlier at the 66th minute, Alessandro Del Piero could have put
the Italian team 2-0 ahead but his shot was just wide.
</P>
<P>
Later on Saturday, defending champions Brazil will play against
Chile at the Parc des Princes Stadium.

<HEADLINE> Aziz Briefs Hassan on Visit to Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz here Saturday briefed Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan on
the outcome of his visit to Europe this week and again called on
the United Nations to lift sanctions against his country.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Aziz told Hassan about his two-day official
visit to Spain, where he held talks with senior government
officials who politely rebuffed the plea to get the sanctions
lifted and pressed Iraq to fully respect the U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Despite the lack of support from European countries, Iraq still
hopes for an early removal of the sanctions in light of the
agreement reached between Iraq and chairman of the U.N. Special
Commission (UNSCOM), Richard Butler, Aziz told reporters after his
meeting with Hassan.
</P>
<P>
Butler has recently said that there is proof that Iraq has
weaponized poisonous gas, which makes it even harder for Iraq to
seek an early removal of the eight-year-old sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The crippling sanctions can only be lifted after UNSCOM, which
oversees the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction,
confirms all prohibited weapons in Iraq have been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Hassan stressed Jordan's support for Iraq to get
the sanctions lifted and save its people from current plight,
Jordan's official news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Aziz arrived in Amman earlier Saturday on a brief visit. He is
expected to leave for Baghdad soon.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. sanctions was imposed in 1990 after Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait. In February this year, a crisis erupted over Iraq's
obstruction of U.N. arms inspections, but was then defused by
U.N. chief Kofi Annan through in a deal between Iraq and the United
Nations over weapons inspections.

<HEADLINE> Plane With UN Angola Envoy Aboard Missing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 27 (Xinhua) - A Beechcraft 200 plane carrying
U.N. special envoy to Angola Alioune B. Beye failed to land in
Abidjan as expected on Friday evening, Cote d'Ivoire Foreign
Minister Amara Essy said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Abidjan airport sources said the light plane had been expected
to arrive from Lome, the Togolese capital at 2115 GMT after its
flight from Togo, a Reuters report said.
</P>
<P>
Essy confirmed the plane was missing, and said the Ivorian air
force, helped by French and United States officers, was probing
the matter.
</P>
<P>
Ivorian military sources said the authorities had received no
reports of a plane crashing on land, and if the plane had gone
down, it would almost certainly have plunged into the sea off
Abidjan, or the lagoon on which Abidjan sits.
</P>
<P>
One Ivorian airport source said the plane disappeared from
radar screens between five and 10 minutes before its expected
arrival time in Abidjan.
</P>
<P>
Beye had left Luanda Friday on a visit to five African nations
to discuss the peace process in Angola, where the opposition
UNITA movement is balking at implementing the 1994 Lusaka peace
accord.
</P>
<P>
As a Malian, Beye became the U.N. envoy for Angola in 1993,
and his family lives in Cote d'Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
U.N. sanctions are due to be in effect against the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) on June 30
unless UNITA complies.
</P>
<P>
A Togolese official said two other United Nations officials, a
reporter and three crew members were also on board the plane.
</P>
<P>
However, French army helicopters are said to have located the
wreckage of a plane that crashed near Abidjan with Beye on board,
a French army spokesman said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The plane came down on Friday night in the bush near the town
of Alepe east of Abidjan, the spokesman for the 43rd Bima
Regiment based in Cote d'Ivoire told Reuters.
</P>
<P>
But he was unable to say if anyone had survived the crash.

countries last year, comes into effect next month, he said.
</P>
<P>
Menasra said that through the implementation of the agreement,
the two countries will promote bilateral trade and economic
cooperation by exploring export potentials and launching joint
investment projects in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The minister added that his country will also learn management
experience from Jordan in developing its private sector by
launching joint projects.
</P>
<P>
Menasra arrived here Friday to discuss implementing the
Jordanian-Algerian trade agreement, which is designed to stimulate
bilateral industrial and commercial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Algerian economy has been plagued by the Islamic insurgence
since 1992 when the military-backed government cancelled the
parliamentary election in which the Islamic Salvation Front was
poised to win. Muslim militants have since launched a bloody war
to oust the government, leaving nearly 70,000 people dead in the
past seven years.

<HEADLINE> Iran Voices Readiness to Open Dialogue with EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Saturday said it is ready
to start "constructive dialogue" with the European Union (EU) in
order to open a new chapter in Iran-EU relations.
</P>
<P>
"Tehran welcomes speedy start of such negotiations to help
create a positive and constructive atmosphere and to build the
confidence between the two sides," Foreign Ministry spokesman
Mahmoud Mohammadi said.
</P>
<P>
His remark came after British Foreign Office Junior Minister
Derek Fatchett announced on Thursday that the EU was looking
"receptively and optimistically" at the possibility of a
ministerial visit to Tehran.
</P>
<P>
With the doubt if the visit would take place during the
Britain's EU presidency, Fatchett said that London was "very keen"
to improve bilateral ties with Iran and make efforts to clear
outstanding differences between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi expressed satisfaction with the EU efforts during
Britain's presidency, to end next Wednesday, which he said have
lead to a higher level of understanding between the EU and Iran.
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement reached between Iran's Foreign
Ministry and the EU on May 19, the two sides agreed to conduct
comprehensive negotiations in Tehran in near future, he said.
</P>
<P>
The EU members agreed to send a delegation to Iran on June 20,
but delayed the trip due to differences with Iran over the topics
to be discussed.
</P>
<P>
Iran expects the EU to send a high-level delegation since the
two sides have serious matters to discuss, an Iranian Foreign
Ministry official said earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said Britain's desire to improve ties with Iran
surely strengthens the element of realism in the British policy,
and more attention to the Islamic Republic would facilitate
expansion of bilateral relations based on mutual respect and
interest.
</P>
<P>
Fatchett had said Iran should make clear its stand over the
controversial issue of the British writer Salman Rushdie who was
sentenced to death for blasphemy by Iran's late supreme leader
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Over the past years, the EU countries have repeatedly called on
Tehran to revoke the death verdict on Rushdie. In response, Iran
said Khomeini's fatawa (religious order) can not be nullified, but
promised not to send commando to kill the writer.

<HEADLINE> Chirac's Mozambique Visit Aims to Broaden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, June 27 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
will pay a two-day state visit to Mozambique starting Sunday to
broaden Paris' influence in Maputo.
</P>
<P>
The visit, aimed at boosting the bilateral relations and
strengthening France's ties with the southern African region, is
the first visit by a French president ever since Mozambique
gained independence in 1975, a French official said here
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Didier Destremau, French Ambassador to Mozambique, said that
Chirac would head a 230-strong delegation, including board
chairmen of 27 big French companies, to tour the country.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambique News Agency said the visit is to find out new
ways of cooperation, and perfect France's African policy by
exercise Paris' influence beyond French speaking African
countries.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique ended the civil war and achieved peace in 1992 and
has since been carrying on successful reforms, and all this has
caused more and more concern in the international community, the
French ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
Destremau listed maritime transportation, police cooperation,
and the rehabilitation of the Nacala corridor's highway and
railway as projects the two countries would cooperate.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the preferential loans offered by the French
Development Bank, France will provide Mozambique yearly with
about 40 million French Francs (less than seven million U.S.
Dollars), Destremau said, adding that Chirac would announce the
increase of France's aid to Mozambique during his visit.
</P>
<P>
France also helps Mozambique in establishing governmental
institutions, land-mine clearing, improving social security and
developing cultural programs.
</P>
<P>
It is said that Maputo Development Corridor in southern
Mozambique will be listed on the agenda for bilateral talks
during Chirac's visit.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Hold Strike Against Jerusalem Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Palestinians in East Jerusalem
Saturday observed a general strike against Israel's planned
expansion of the disputed holy city.
</P>
<P>
Shops and businesses were shut down in major Arab commercial
areas in the city. A leaflet issued in the streets called on
Palestinians to hold the strike to respond to the "Israeli
conspiracy."
</P>
<P>
A demonstration was also staged near the Old City in East
Jerusalem to condemn what the Palestinians called Israel's attempt
to Judaize the city.
</P>
<P>
The strike and demonstration were held also to mark the
anniversary of Israel's annexation of the Arab East
Jerusalem. Israel took over East Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967
War and officially annexed it in May 1980.
</P>
<P>
Abu Ala, speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council, said
that if Israel truly wants peace, it should end the occupation
of East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by the Voice of Palestine radio as saying that
the latest plan adopted by Israeli government to expand the
municipal authority of Jerusalem would continue to leave the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks in stalemate.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Israeli Cabinet approved a plan to extend
Jerusalem's boundaries to incorporate western Jewish suburbs as
well as eight West Bank Jewish settlements in a bid to maintain
the majority of Jews in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
This plan sparked angry protests from the Palestinian side as
well as the international community, which called it as another blow
to the moribund peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority denounced the plan as a new
attempt by the Israeli government to destroy the peace process,
noting that by adopting the plan Israel would annex the occupied
territories of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The United States, leading mediator in the Israeli-Palestinian
peace talks, has also called the Jerusalem expansion plan "a
provocative step at the sensitive time" in the peace talks and
urged Israel to reconsider it.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian peace process has been stalled since
Israel began the construction of a Jewish settlement in East
Jerusalem early 1997.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem, a holy city for Jews, Muslims and Christians, is one
of the most sensitive disputes in the Israeli-Palestinian peace
talks. While Israel has declared the whole city as its eternal and
indivisible capital, the Palestinians want East Jerusalem to be
the capital of a future independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo accords, the status of Jerusalem should be
settled through the Israeli-Palestinian permanent talks, which
have not resumed so far.

LONDON, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Dozens of Catholic protesters
clashed with riot police on the streets of Belfast Saturday before
a parade by pro-British Protestants in West Belfast, the capital
of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Angry protesters threw bottles and stones and were held back by
lines of police with riot shields on the streets, reports from
Belfast said. They object to the marches as a display of
pro-British triumphalism in the British province.
</P>
<P>
The violence in West Belfast broke out just before the start of
a march by 1,000 members of the staunchly pro-British Orange Order
in a Protestant area of the city.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Catholics gathered near the peace wall, where an
Orange Order march was due to pass by.
</P>
<P>
The violence broke out as votes were being counted in elections
for a new Northern Ireland assembly envisaged in an historic peace
accord aimed at ending 30 years of violent conflict between
Catholics and Protestants.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Welcomes Israeli Release of Lebanese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Jordan on Saturday welcomed the
release of 60 Lebanese prisoners by Israel and renewed its call
for unconditional Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued after the cabinet session, the Jordanian
government expressed its congratulations to the released prisoners
and their families, while paying condolences to the Lebanese
killed during years of armed conflicts with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The statement reiterated Jordan's strong support to the various
efforts exerted by the Lebanese government to restore its people's
full rights and free its territories from Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
It also urged Israel to implement the United Nations Security
Council's resolutions 425 and 426, which called for Israeli
unconditional and comprehensive withdrawal from the occupied
Lebanese territories.
</P>
<P>
Arranged by the international Red Cross, 60 Lebanese prisoners
were released from Israeli jails and returned home on Friday in
the last stage of a swap for the remains of Israeli soldiers. This
was the second swap deal reached between Israel and the
anti-Israeli Hezbollah (Party of God) guerrilla forces and
Lebanese government in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
Such swaps are the only cooperation between Lebanon and
Israel, which have been enemies in a war of attrition in south
Lebanon where Israel has occupied a buffer zone to protect its
northern border towns from cross-border attacks since 1985.
</P>
<P>
Israel endorsed in last April a unilateral withdrawal from
south Lebanon on condition that the Lebanese government agrees to
guarantee the safety of its north. But Lebanon, backed by its
powerful ally Syria, insists that Israel should conduct an
unconditional pullout.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, the second Arab country that signed peace treaty with
Israel, has always backed the Lebanese call for an Israeli
withdrawal from south Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Condemns Israel's Jerusalem Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian government Saturday
issued a statement condemning Israel's recent decision to expand
Jerusalem and establish a major percentage of Jewish inhabitants
in the holy city.
</P>
<P>
The decision to expand the boundaries of Jerusalem is "a
flagrant attempt" to change the city's demographic structure and
impose de facto policies on the Arabs, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It said any measures taken by Israel about the holy city at the
present time will affect the outcome of peace negotiations
between Israel and the Palestinians, as the destiny of Jerusalem
should be one of the major issues to be discussed in the final
status of the talks.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, the purpose of Israeli making the decision is
malicious and should be condemned, it added.
</P>
<P>
It called on Israeli government to withdraw the decision and
implement the United Nations Security Council's resolution 242,
which outlines the principle that Israeli return the occupied
lands to the Palestinians in order to build peace with them.
</P>
<P>
The statement also emphasized the importance of Jerusalem's
remaining as a city of peace and cradle of monotheistic religions.
</P>
<P>
With its plan to expand Jerusalem, Israeli government will
annex several West Bank towns to the west of Jerusalem and boost
the city's Jewish population by some 30,000.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied the Arab East Jerusalem in 1967 and illegally
annexed it in 1980, where the Palestinians want as the capital of
their future independent state.
</P>
<P>
The future of Jerusalem is one of the most contentious issues
to be hammered out in any final peace deal between Israel and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
But negotiations between the two sides have been at an impasse
for 15 months largely due to Israel's Jewish settlement policy in
the occupied territories.

<HEADLINE> UUP Wins Most Seats in Northern Ireland New Assembly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The final results of the election
of Northern Ireland's new Assembly showed that the Ulster Unionist
Party (UUP) won the most representatives in the Northern Ireland
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The UUP, the largest pro-British protestant political party,
won 28 of the 108 seats in the assembly. The pro-Irish Social
Democratic and Labor Party (SDLP) won 24, the Democratic Ulster
Party (DUP) 20, Sinn Fein 18, the Alliance six and others 12.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam said the new Northern
Ireland Assembly heralds a new era in the province.
</P>
<P>
She said the election results meant the Assembly would work,
with 75 percent of seats won by pro-peace accord candidates.
</P>
<P>
"This is another vital step towards genuine peace and political
stability in Northern Ireland," Mowlam added.
</P>
<P>
Gerry Adams, leader of the IRA's political wing Sinn Fein, said
the assembly election was a big success for his party, which won
18 seats in Thursday's election. Adams is expected to be a
minister in the 12-member executive in the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
However, DUP leader Ian Paisley, who opposed the historic
Northern Irish peace agreement struck in April, said he would
"nail (Prime Minister) Tony Blair's flesh to the fence" over
weapons decommissioning pledges.
</P>
<P>
He said Blair must stick to his pledge that Sinn Fein would not
be part of the executive before substantial decommissioning.

<HEADLINE> UUP Wins Most Seats in Northern Ireland New Assembly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The final results of the election
of Northern Ireland's new Assembly showed Saturday that the Ulster
Unionist Party (UUP) won the most representatives in the Northern
Ireland Assembly.
</P>
<P>
the UUP, the largest pro-British protestant political party,
won 28 of the 108 seats in the assembly. The pro-Irish Social
Democratic and Labor Party (SDLP) won 24, the Democratic Ulster
Party (DUP) 20, Sinn Fein 18, the Alliance six and others 12.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam said the new Northern
Ireland Assembly heralds a new era in the province.
</P>
<P>
She said the election results meant the Assembly would work,
with 75 percent of seats won by pro-peace accord candidates.
</P>
<P>
"This is another vital step towards genuine peace and political
stability in Northern Ireland," Mowlam added.
</P>
<P>
Gerry Adams, leader of the IRA's political wing Sinn Fein, said
the Assembly election was a big success for his party, which won
18 seats in Thursday's election. Adams is expected to be a
minister in the 12-member executive in the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
However, DUP leader Ian Paisley, who opposed the historic
Northern Irish peace agreement struck in April, said he would
"nail (Prime Minister) Tony Blair's flesh to the fence" over
weapons decommissioning pledges.
</P>
<P>
He said Blair must stick to his pledge that Sinn Fein would not
be part of the executive before substantial decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein insists that weapons decommissioning should be linked
with release of prisoners and "total demilitarization" in the
province.

<HEADLINE> Policeman Killed in Tanzanian Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 27 (Xinhua) -- A policeman has been killed
and two butchers badly wounded by armed gangsters in two separate
incidents in the Tanzanian capital of Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
The Dar es Salaam Regional Police Commander, Alfred Gewe,
confirmed the incidents Saturday, saying that three suspects have
been arrested over the killing of the policeman.
</P>
<P>
Corporal Aza of Chang'ombe police station in Dar es Salaam,
was killed by a group of armed men at 10 p.m. Friday at Tandika
Maguluwe, on his way home from duty at Yombo police post.
</P>
<P>
However, the regional commander did not disclose the names of
the nabbed suspects who were found in illegal possession of
firearms.
</P>
<P>
In another incident, four suspected bandits attacked a
butchery in the city at 8:15 p.m. Friday, opening fire at the
butchers inside and made away with estimated 800,000 Shillings
(about 1,200 U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
One of the victims, Mazengo Mayomba, 26, was shot in the chest
and suffered serious injuries. He is hospitalized in the
Muhimbili Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
Another victim, Lawrence Nyamwezi, 22, was shot and slashed on
the right hand. He is also receiving medical treatment at the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
Nyamwezi said at a hospital bed that four people armed with
guns ambushed them while they were inside the Chimwaga butchery,
counting the day's income collected from six butcheries.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the income of the butcheries are usually
gathered at Chimwaga butchery for counting.
</P>
<P>
"The bandits cornered and ordered us to surrender the bag
containing the day's income," Nyamwezi said. "As we resisted,
they opened fire at us."
</P>
<P>
The victims said several people in the vicinity fled on
hearing the bullet sounds. The matter was later reported to the
police.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Denounces Israel's Jerusalem Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Sudan added its voice Saturday to
the chorus of condemnation of Israel's recent decision to tighten
its grip on the disputed holy city of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail slammed the Israeli plan
to expand Jerusalem boundaries as "a flagrant provocation of the
feelings of the Arabs, Muslims and Christians alike," the Sudanese
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Ismail said that his country has been following closely and
with great concern the successive violations by the Israeli
government that seeks to impose the policy of fait accompli on the
occupied Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
Last week Israeli government approved a plan to expand the
municipal boundaries of Jerusalem to incorporate western Jewish
suburbs as well as eight West Bank settlements. The plan has
sparked widespread protests and condemnation from the
Palestinians, Arabs and other countries.
</P>
<P>
Ismail said the Israeli government tries not only to block the
way of the Middle East peace process, but also to bury the process
for good.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem expansion plan shows that Israel is ignoring the
U.N. resolutions and the principles of Madrid Peace Conference,
and is not committed to the documents it has already signed, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Ismail urged the co-sponsors of the peace process, the United
States and Russia, to shoulder their responsibilities and take
effective and speedy steps to stop the Israeli attempt so to save
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that he had instructed Sudan's
U.N. representatives to conduct necessary consultations in the U.N.
general secretariat to discuss the Israeli move.
</P>
<P>
As the current chairman of the ministerial council of the Arab
League (AL), Ismail said he would consult other AL members and
AL Secretary General Ahmed Esmat Maguid to assess the situation
and to explore the possibility of holding an emergent Arab
summit.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, U.S. Discuss Cutting Economic Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Minister of Economy Youssef
Boutros Ghali said Saturday that Cairo and Washington have
discussed the possibility of cutting the annual U.S. economic aid,
the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Ghali, who returned home Saturday after a visit to the U.S.,
held economic talks with U.S. officials on means of increasing
bilateral trade and upgrading economic relations.
</P>
<P>
Ghali told reporters that his talks with U.S. officials also
touched on means of channeling the American economic aid to Egypt
into serving the country's new requirements under the policy of
shifting into market economy.
</P>
<P>
He further noted that economic negotiations in Washington took
up issue of promoting trade exchange and increasing U.S.
investments in Egypt along with technology transfer.
</P>
<P>
He said the Egyptian economy has "become of age" so that it
became able to absorb international investments.
</P>
<P>
Ghali, along with Minister of State for Planning and
International Cooperation Zafer al-Bishri, Minister of Higher
Education and Scientific Research Mufeed Sheehab, arrived in
Washington on June 17 on a 10-day visit.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the two sides agreed on launching 32 joint
scientific projects to help in the transfer of sophisticated
technology to Egypt in the areas of genetic engineering,
environmental protection, and standardization.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the 5-million-Egyptian-pound (about 1.47 million
U.S. dollars) projects, they are already working on 25 similar
projects with a total cost of 2.2 million pounds (about 647,000
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the two countries started to discuss the
possibility of cutting U.S. economic aid, mainly in the light the
U.S. Congress intention to reduce foreign economic aid.
</P>
<P>
Egypt received from the U.S. about 815 million dollars in
economic aid each year. Israel, which gets 1.2 billion dollars
yearly, has proposed to the U.S. to switch economic aid to
military assistance.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Hails UN Resolution on Border Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia said Saturday the
resolution adopted Friday by the U.N. Security Council backed
their demand for the withdrawal of Eritrean force to the position
held on May 6 when the conflict began.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian government spokeswoman Selome Taddesse said here
that what was endorsed by the Organization of African Unity (OAU)
and the African leaders has now been accepted by the whole world
-- that Eritreans withdraw from the territory that they are
occupying.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council resolution voiced strong support for
the decision of the OAU leaders for a peaceful resolution of the
conflict and demanded that both parties immediately cease
hostilities and refrain from further use of force.
</P>
<P>
The resolution affirmed the principle of peaceful settlement
of dispute and stressed that the use of armed force is not
acceptable as a means of addressing territorial disputes or
changing circumstances on the ground.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Eritrean presidential adviser Yermane Gebreab said
Saturday at a news briefing in Asmara that the resolution is
"very positive."
</P>
<P>
According to a report from Asmara, Yermane said that "At least
for the first time, we feel that an attempt to ensure the
concerns of both countries are being addressed."
</P>
<P>
On Saturday morning, President Laurent Kabila of the
Democratic Republic of Congo left Addis Ababa for home after his
mediation between Asmara and Addis Ababa on Friday to hold talks
with leaders of both countries.
</P>
<P>
Last week, an OAU delegation comprising three African
presidents shuttled between the capitals of Eritrea and Ethiopia
to promote a peaceful resolution of the conflict. But the OAU
mediation effort made no progress when a clause of the four-point
plan was rejected by Eritrean side.

<HEADLINE> 3 E. African States End Joint Military Exercise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LODWAR, Kenya, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania
winded up their first-ever joint military exercise at Lodwar in
northwestern Kenya Saturday, describing it as a milestone in and
a climax to the three east African states' military cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The month-long training-exercise, code-named Natural Fire'98,
started on June 2 with 1,356 Kenyan soldiers, 256 Tanzanians and
210 Ugandans under 365 U.S. army trainers.
</P>
<P>
It focused on dealing with a hypothetical state called
Somanga, which is troubled and the forces work to restore order
and stability within the perimeters of the U.N. peace-keeping.
</P>
<P>
The troops which were divided into two warring sides under the
"Somanga" state, stopped fighting, came to the negotiating table
and finally reached a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
To create an enabling environment for a negotiated solution to
the crisis and supervise the truce, they also evacuated
civilians, protected refugees, offered medical services to the
wounded, set up check points, restored police operation and
patrolled along the street.
</P>
<P>
"The exercise is very successful" and will be repeated in the
region in the coming years, said Lt. General Daniel Opande, the
vice Chief of the General Staff of Kenya, while presiding over
the closing ceremony Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
Through the military show, "we do feel we have the capacity to
tackle disaster and defend peace and security in the region,"
Uganda's Col. John Mugume told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"It's a major milestone in east Africa... We learned a lot
from each other," said Tanzanian Brig. Joseph Lesulie.
</P>
<P>
Gen. Opande told Xinhua that a regional military cooperation
strategy focusing on common training and exchanges of senior
military officers, is to be officially completed soon.
</P>
<P>
The strategy also includes a series of confidence building
measures, integration of military training facilities and
systems, joint military research and production and so on.
</P>
<P>
The three countries will participate together in peace-keeping
operations on the continent in the future if needed, said Opande,
adding that the Kenyan army has been involved in the U.N.
peace-keeping move since 1970s on more than 10 occasions.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the military cooperation is only being
boosted to coincide with the increasing regional social, economic
and political cooperation pushed forward by "the strong political
will" of the people in the three sister states.
</P>
<P>
The troops also held a memorial service Saturday for three
fallen soliders -- a Kenyan, a Tanzanian and an American who
passed away during the exercise. The American died of a heart
attack and the two others were killed in a road accident.

<P>
-- A summit meeting in Beijing ended with a formal state dinner
after an extraordinary televised exchange between President Clinton
and President Jiang Zemin of China over human rights, Tibet and
the Tiananmen Square protests. The two countries also announced a
number of agreements, including one not to aim nuclear missiles at

political leaders of the rebel army fighting for independence in

political leaders, who said they would abide by a ceasefire if one
can be negotiated, senior American officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post

such nettlesome long-term problems as missile proliferation and
Tibet.
</P>

Saturday, bringing severe, sudden flooding requiring helicopter
rescues. A train derailed and spilled fuel in the extreme weather
that killed at least four people.
</P>
<P>

BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Following are some tidbits during
U.S. President Bill Clinton's tour in Beijing today:
</P>
<P>
-- Hamburger for Lunch
</P>
<P>
President Clinton had a busy schedule today. He spent an hour
and a half at the Chongwenmen Church in downtown Beijing attending
church services and toured the Palace Museum, or Forbidden City,
for another hour. And it was noon already.
</P>
<P>
To save time, Clinton ate hamburgers in his bullet-proof
limousine and then drove ahead to the Great Wall.
</P>
<P>
According to reliable sources, the hamburgers had been prepared
by the U.S. Embassy in China.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. Journalists Pose for Pictures on Great Wall
</P>
<P>
Many American journalists came to China for the first time, it
was therefore the first time for them to tour the magnificent
Great Wall.
</P>
<P>
Before President Clinton and his family arrived at the Great
Wall, the journalists had been busy posing for pictures taken with
the help of Chinese journalists.
</P>
<P>
-- Considerate Preparations for Cameramen and Photographers
</P>
<P>
In accordance with consultations between press officials of
China and the U.S., only 15 Chinese journalists and as many U.S.
journalists were able to get close to the U.S. president on the
Great Wall.
</P>
<P>
The wall of the arrow tower where Clinton stayed for a while is
so high that even the tallest American photographers their found
their sight blocked.
</P>
<P>
But they seemed not worried, for staff members of the American
Embassy in China had sent there two large empty wooden trunks
which were lifted onto the tower in advance to serve as platforms
for journalists.

Kong Interport Cup women's soccer tournament here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The visiting team, which had won all the seven previous
tournaments inaugurating in 1990 in Shanghai, led the match 6-0 at
half-time.
</P>
<P>
A successful penalty shot by Hong Kong SAR's forward and former
 member of China's national team Wai Hoi Ying five minutes after
the interval and two more goals scored later by her teammates
Theresa Miller and Wong Kwan Ping saved the hosts team from
leaving the ground empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai team added three more goals to their record in the
second half. Forward Bai Lili was her team's top scorer, with
three goals to her credit in the first half.
</P>
<P>
Lack of training is generally believed to cost the local team
badly as the players, mainly students or employees, had
coordinated training only once a week. Their poor fitness itself
actually destroyed their chances.
</P>
<P>
As for the Shanghai players, they are all students of the
Shanghai Amateur Sports School, who split their daily life for
schooling and training. Their performance at the annual interport
 match here on Sunday showed their superiority in both physique
and skills.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Hong Kong Ladies Football Association were
reportedly to have planned for the team to take more training
sessions and competitions, both in China's mainland and abroad.

<HEADLINE> Spain Calls for Respect for Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Spanish Prime Minister Jose
Maria Aznar said on Sunday that the progress in the Mideast peace
process hinges on the implementation of the signed agreements and
relevant international resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Respect for the Oslo agreements and the framework of the Madrid
Middle East peace conference constitutes a basis for any future
accord or peace talks, Aznar told a news conference after a
meeting with Arab League Secretary General Ahmed Esmat
Abdel-Meguid.
</P>
<P>
The Madrid peace conference held in 1991, which brought Arabs
and Israelis to the negotiating table for the first time since
their conflicts began in 1948, established the land-for-peace
principle for the negotiations between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Aznar said that respect for the existence of each country in
the region and the Palestinians' legitimate rights also contribute
to the basis of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between the Spanish prime minister and the Arab
League chief, which Aznar termed as "extremely frank," dealt with
the latest developments of the peace process and the relations
between Spain and the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
Describing Aznar's visit as historic, Abdel-Meguid praised
Spain's role in the peace drive as reflected in hosting the Madrid
peace conference and leading the European countries in assisting
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed an Israeli suggestion to hold a second Madrid
peace conference as "woolly."
</P>
<P>
"We have now the U.S. initiative which we hope will make some
progress, and the Egyptian-French initiative to rescue the peace
process," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Supporting these two overtures is bound to restart the peace
process," he added.
</P>
<P>
The United States has reportedly proposed that Israel withdraw
from another 13.1 percent of the West Bank. The Palestinians have
accepted the proposal, but Israel has not.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and France have called for an international conference
for the Mideast peace.
</P>
<P>
Aznar arrived here Friday on a three-day visit to Egypt, after
which he will travel to the Palestinian self-rule areas and
Israel.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Renews Opposition to Netanyahu's Call for Madrid II </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
reaffirmed Sunday that Egypt opposes Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin's proposal for holding a Madrid II international
conference on the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing called `Madrid II'," Moussa was quoted by the
Middle East News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
He was commenting on the idea put forward by Netanyahu for
convening a multilateral conference to tackle all regional issues
but not the Israeli-Palestinian peace deadlock specifically.
</P>
<P>
In an interview published Saturday on the Spanish newspaper
ABC, Netanyahu said he believed that peace talks held along the
lines of the 1991 Madrid peace conference would be "useful" to
solve the regional problems, such as water distribution and
environment protection.
</P>
<P>
But he did not want the conference to tackle specifically the
Israeli-Palestinian peace stalemate, arguing that negotiations on
bilateral levels are being held with the U.S. participation.
</P>
<P>
Egypt interpreted the Netanyahu proposal as an attempt to
annul the land-for-peace principle set by the Madrid conference
and the Oslo accords that Israel signed with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Madrid conference, which brought Israelis and Arabs to
face-to-face talks for the first time, formulated the the landmark
land-for-peace principle and the framework for bilateral and
multilateral talks between Israel and its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Moussa reiterated that there is no need at present to hold a
Madrid II conference since the 1991 Madrid conference has already
laid the main bases for the peace process on all tracks.
</P>
<P>
The top Egyptian diplomat noted that there is now an
Egyptian-French initiative on holding an international conference
to deal with the crisis created by the present Israeli policy.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the proposed conference is "not to
renegotiate the principles of Madrid conference," rather to call
on the parties to implement these principles.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to France in May, Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak and his French counterpart Jacques Chirac jointly proposed
the holding of an international conference to discuss the current
peace deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar in Cairo
Saturday, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak flatly rejected
Netanyahu's Madrid II idea, warning that this could blast the
whole peace process.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait Sunday strongly
condemned Israel's recent decision to expand boundaries of
Jerusalem to embrace surrounding settlements and vast areas of
the West Bank territories, Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister of State for Cabinet Affairs Nasser
Al-Roudhan was quoted as saying after a cabinet session that the
cabinet considered the Israeli move a challenge to Muslims.
</P>
<P>
He condemned the decision as a flagrant violation to the Oslo
peace accords.
</P>
<P>
He reiterates Kuwait's "full support for the Palestinian people
who cling to their territory and for their right to regain all
their legitimate rights."
</P>
<P>
Kuwait calls on the international community to keep pressure
on the Israeli government to back off from this provocative
decision, Al-Roudhan said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet approved last week the plan that aims at
expanding the boundaries of Jerusalem to accommodate more Jewish
settlements.

<P>
This move has prompted widespread accusations and criticism
from the world, especially from Arab countries.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Carter Center Inspects Elections In Mao's Hometown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The Carter Center of the United
States has completed on-the-spot inspections on village elections
in Xiangtan County, Hunan Province, hometown of China's late top
leader Mao Zedong.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. inspectors have closely watched the democratic
elections conducted by villagers living in four villages.
</P>
<P>
Since 1988, when China issued the Law on the Organization of
Village Committees, three rural elections have been held in most
Chinese provinces, including Hunan.
</P>
<P>
The elections, under the guidance of the Ministry of Civil
Affairs, have become more and more mature and standardized in the
past decade.
</P>
<P>
Although many villages are far from meeting the demands of the
Ministry of Civil Affairs, we have found that the democratic sense
of Chinese farmers and local governments has been increasing, said
Robert Pastor from the Carter Center.
</P>
<P>
Local villagers claim that they are fond of secret voting,
though, Carter Center inspectors believe, it may increase the
amount of work to count the large number of candidates.
</P>
<P>
However, officials from the ministry support the secret method
as it may protect the sense of democracy of Chinese farmers.
</P>
<P>
The kind of democratic elections have forced village leaders to
work harder. "I can feel the pressure from the villagers," said
Huang Zhengchun, a village head. "They will make correct
judgements in the next election, if I fail to work well and
fairly," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. inspectors are expected to visit more than 20
villages, in Hunan and Jilin provinces for the same
purpose.

PARIS, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria had protested against the

FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper said on Sunday Nigeria had asked the

Cooper said FIFA turned down the demand but emphasized the fact

Swiss Urs Meier will officiate the game instead of previous
selection of Spanish referee Jose Maria Garcia Aranda.

<HEADLINE> Free Democrats Vow to Boost Their Role in German Politics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Free Democratic Party (FDP)
Sunday concluded a three-day party convention in the eastern
German city of Leipzig by adopting an election platform aiming at
sharping its profile as a small but crucial party in German.
</P>
<P>
With only three months to go before the country's general
election on September 27 this year, FDP leaders said that their
goal at the national vote was to become once again the
third-largest political party in Germany, a position it lost to
the ecologist Greens party few years ago.
</P>
<P>
In the election platform adopted on Sunday, the FDP calls for
more radical privatization of state-owned companies in Germany and
opposes old-style state intervention, state subsidies and
burdensome regulations.
</P>
<P>
The party also calls for big tax cuts and a comprehensive
education reform in order to improve Germany's competitiveness in
the world.
</P>
<P>
The platform also included the long-time FDP demand for
granting dual citizenship to children of foreign immigrants born
on German soil.
</P>
<P>
FDP General Secretary Guido Westerwelle described the election
platform as "super modern", which would help to sharp FDP's
profile as a pro-business party to the German voters.
</P>
<P>
As the only centrist party in the German political spectrum,
the FDP has been pivotal to keep German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
centre-right ruling coalition in power in the past 16 years.
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, the highest ranking FDP
official in Kohl's government, stressed at a closing speech to the
party convention on Sunday that only the FDP offered the best
chance to keep Germany in balance both domestically and
internationally.

<HEADLINE> Computer Systems For Elections Installed In Pilot Villages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The projects to install computer
systems for counting votes in rural elections were completed today
in three pilot counties in Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
The systems were jointly developed by the Ministry of Civil
Affairs, the Carter Center of the United States, and the Beijing
Guochuang Wanwei Information Company.
</P>
<P>
Another six systems will be installed in Fujian Province in the
east and Jilin Province in the northeast.
</P>
<P>
The Carter Center proposed the project two years ago because it
found that China spent an unexpectedly long time to count votes in
village elections throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Later, the three parties developed software especially for
village elections in China.
</P>
<P>
The systems will improve the efficiency of rural elections in
China and be helpful for judging whether the elections follow
correct procedures and normal operations, and ensure the
transparency of the elections, said Robert Pastor from the Carter
Center.
</P>
<P>
What's more important, he said, is that the systems could be
used to find out when and where to give compulsory lectures for
villagers on voting to improve the quality of elections in the
whole country.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Ministry of Civil Affairs said that the
data on the elections will enter the Internet, when the time
comes. "It is not an easy matter to link all the 900,000-plus
villages in China to the Internet because of the limitation of
technology and finance," he said, adding that it needs the support
of the whole world.

<HEADLINE> GCC Regrets Nuclear Tests by India, Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) states have expressed regrets at the nuclear tests carried
out by India and Pakistan and its far-reaching impact on the
region's security and stability.
</P>
<P>
This came in an inaugural speech of the 67th meeting of GCC
foreign ministers which was held Sunday in Riyadh, Saudi
Arabia. The speech was delivered by Kuwait's first Deputy Prime
Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahamad Al-Sabah.
</P>
<P>
India conducted five tests on May 11 and 13 and Pakistan
responded with six tests two weeks later.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sabah, the chairman of the ministerial session, was quoted
by Kuwait News Agency as calling on both countries "to stop any
further nuclear tests and resume their dialog on various pending
issues that sever regional peace and stability."
</P>
<P>
The GCC groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and
the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
The session also urged Eritrea and Ethiopia to halt battling
and start border negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993, but leaving
at least six border areas on dispute. Armed clashes erupted in
early May between the two countries for a 400-square-kilometer
land.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sabah also called on Iraq to implement the U.N. Security
Council resolutions, including Resolution 833 concerning the
demarcation of Iraq-Kuwait borders.
</P>
<P>
He rejected the remarks made by Iraqi Vice President Taha
Ramadan earlier this month questioning the legality of Resolution
833.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the GCC concern "at the suffering of the
brotherly Iraqi people" because of the U.N. economic sanctions,
holding the Iraqi government responsible for the ordeal.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions were imposed after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in
1990.
</P>
<P>
On the improvement of Iran-GCC ties, the session expressed
wishes the two sides will establish good and constructive ties
based on mutual confidence.
</P>
<P>
Iran has launched a diplomatic initiative to improve cool
relations with its neighbors which were resulted from various
differences.

<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) - At his first sight of the Great
Wall, U.S. President Bill Clinton could not help saying, "
Beautiful, amazing, magnificent!"
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't imagine it was built so long ago, even the bricks
are more than 400 years old," Clinton said Sunday while climbing
the Great Wall. After rounds of talks with Chinese leaders
Saturday, the U.S. president, in a dark green sports shirt,
appeared more like a tourist today.
</P>
<P>
In 1972, President Richard Nixon stood on the wall and
declared, "This is a great wall." In 1984, President Ronald Reagan
said "It's awe-interesting" after he climbed up.
</P>
<P>
Work began on the wall around 200 BC by Emperor Qin Shihuang,
the first emperor of the Qin Dynasty (221-207 BC) to keep invading
northern tribe troops out of his pastoral land. It snakes 6,000 km
from the East coast to the Gobi desert in the west.
</P>
<P>
Sunday was scorching hot in Beijing, with temperatures at 37
degrees Celsius (99 Fahrenheit), the hottest day this summer.
About 80 kilometers northeast of Beijing, the Mutianyu section of
the Great Wall visited by the Clintons meanders over the crests of
the mountains, once a natural barrier for invading nomads.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and his family came to this section of the Great Wall,
known for its steepness, after touring the Forbidden City, the
imperial palace that housed 24 emperors in China's Ming and Qing
dynasties (1368-1911).
</P>
<P>
When his lengthy motorcade arrived at the foot of the
mountains, the Clintons took cable-cars to the top of the
mountain. The 52-year-old president, hand in hand with his wife
Hillary Rodham Clinton, walked to the gates of the No. 15 Arrow
Tower.
</P>
<P>
The Great Wall here runs more than 3,000 meters with 22 arrow
towers. Built in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), this section of the
wall was once a heavily guarded pass of strategic importance.
</P>
<P>
After posing for pictures, the president and his daughter
climbed up to the No. 16 Arrow Tower, the steepest part of the
section of the wall. "It's even more magnificent than I expected,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"If we have a few hours to go, we will be in good shape," he
said to reporters, adding, "It's good for us to do exercises. And
it's also good for you."
</P>
<P>
Clinton and his family spent more than one hour on the Great
Wall. Walking down the wall, he stopped in front of a stone tablet
inscribed with the words: "The Great Wall was served to fend off
aggression from aliens. Now it has become a nexus linking all
nationalities worldwide. Wish the Great Wall continues to serve as
a symbol of the unity of people all over the world."
</P>
<P>
The head of the Mutianyu Great Wall park presented replicas of
the wall, albums and certificates for Great Wall climbers to the
Clintons at the end of the tour.
</P>
<P>
"You are now an American true man," said the head of the park,
rephrasing a verse by late Chinese leader Mao Zedong: "If we reach
not the Great Wall, we are no true men!"
</P>
<P>
After coming down from the Great Wall, President Clinton left
a few words on the visitors' book: "Thank you for showing the
Great wall to me, my family and my party. It's more magnificent
than we thought it would be.!1

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Defends Own Proposal on Mideast Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu on Sunday defended his own proposal for convening an
international Middle East conference, saying it is not aimed at
replacing the current American peace initiative.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel Radio, Netanyahu said he proposed
such a conference in an effort to revive the multilateral talks
between Israel and its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The conference could be convened with the resumption of the
bilateral negotiations between Israelis and the Palestinians, but
it would not replace the latest U.S. initiative, he added.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's remarks was in response to the criticism made by
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak over his idea on holding an
international conference.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Mubarak dismissed Netanyahu's proposal as an
attempt to annul "the first Madrid conference, the land-for-peace
(principle), Oslo agreements, and all that has been signed so that
he can rid himself of all that and restart new agreements on new
principles."
</P>
<P>
In an interview published Saturday on the Spanish newspaper ABC
ahead of the visit by Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar to
Israel, Netanyahu suggested that Europe sponsor a Madrid II
conference to discuss all Middle East issues but not the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict specifically.
</P>
<P>
He said he would like to see more talks held along the lines of
the 1991 Madrid conference, because such talks would be "helpful"
in solving regional problems, such as water distribution and the
environment.
</P>
<P>
The Madrid peace conference, sponsored jointly by the U.S. and
then Soviet Union, brought Israelis and Arabs to the negotiating
table for the first time in 1991. It formulated the land-for-peace
principle and set up a framework for subsequent bilateral and
multilateral negotiations between Israel and its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Little progress has been achieved in the Middle East peace
process since mid-1996 after the Netanyahu-led hard-line government
came to power and abandoned the land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between Israel and Syria and Lebanon have not
yet resumed, while the Israeli-Palestinian peace track, the core
of the regional peace process, has been stalled for over 15 months
due to Israel's refusal to carry out an overdue troop redeployment
in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's idea appeared to be a counter proposal to the joint
initiative launched by Egypt and France to convene an
international conference to discuss specifically the deadlock in
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said Saturday that the Egyptian-French bid would not
replace the latest American peace initiative but to assist such
effort. Since last January, the U.S. has been pressing Netanyahu
to accept its proposal for a 13.1 percent withdrawal in the
second Israeli redeployment.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- A senior leader of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) has called on Party organizations at all
levels to take a strategic view and fully recognize the importance
of consolidating the Party's grassroots units in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
Hu Jintao, member of the Standing Committee of the CPC
Central Committee Political Bureau, made the statement Saturday at
a national conference on the work of building CPC's grassroots
organizations in the rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Other Party leaders including Wei Jianxing, Ding Guangen, Zhang
Wannian, Luo Gan, Wen Jiabao and Zeng Qinghong were also present
at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
According to Hu, local Party committees at all levels have
produced remarkable results in rectifying and rebuilding village
Party branches in recent years.
</P>
<P>
He urged continued efforts for three more years toward building
stronger grassroots Party organizations in the countryside, making
new progress in achieving political democracy in villages, and
further improving public security in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
It is an important, fundamental work, proposed by the 15th
Party Congress, to expand rural grassroots democracy by adopting
democracy in elections, decision-making, management and
supervision, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the building of the Party's grassroots
organizations should be closely combined with the development of
the rural economy and pushing the crucial effort of eradicating
poverty.
</P>
<P>
The development of the rural economy must be integrated in the
basic economic system with the public ownership as the main avenue
along with the simultaneous development of other kinds of
ownership, he said.

<HEADLINE> World AIDS Conference Aims to Bridge Gap Between North, South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The 12th World AIDS Conference
began here Sunday to discuss ways to stop AIDS from being an
epidemic.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the conference is "Bridging the Gap" between the
developed countries and the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by the Joint United Nations Program on
HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the World Health Organization (WHO), by the
beginning of 1998, over 30 million people have been infected with
HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, and 11.7 million people around
the world have already lost their lives to the disease.
</P>
<P>
While a small number of people with HIV enjoy scientific
achievements in the developed countries, more than 90 percent of
people afflicted with AIDS and HIV in the developing world have no
hope of access to more than the most modest care, let alone drugs
which cost thousands of dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
Researchers participating the conference hope to make
treatments already available simpler to take and more
effective.
</P>
<P>
Some drug companies believe until treatment is down to one
tablet a day from the current pile of up to two dozen, it will be
too expensive for developing countries.

and told him the past records of the meeting room, where he has
met with many foreign dignities.
</P>

Great Wall earlier today.
</P>
<P>
Then, the Chinese president gave a dinner in honor of the U.S.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Crime Rate Soars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The crime rate in Zambia has
increased by 13 percent in the last five years with 135,389 cases
being reported to police in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia Sunday quoted annual crime statistics released
by police spokesman Beenwell Chimfwembe as showing that 633,727
various crimes were reported between 1993 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
But the statistics show a consistent growth on white collar
crime of frauds while recording a gradual reduction on motor
vehicle thefts, aggravated robbery and rape over the years.
</P>
<P>
A total of 17,197 frauds took place during the five year
period with only 2,519 convictions. But 3,136 cases were reported
in 1993 against 3,993 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Aggravated robbery has dropped from 5,224 in 1993 to 3,746 in
1997 while motor vehicle thefts from 1,694 to 711 in the same
period.
</P>
<P>
The police spokesman attributed the increase to socio-economic
factors and accused some parents of abating the criminal
activities their children engaged in.
</P>
<P>
"Family grounds have played a major role in our children
engaging in all sorts of criminal activities, " said Chimfwembe.
</P>
<P>
At present, he said, the economic environment for an average
Zambian is not conducive as most people could not make ends meet
while unemployment has increased.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman expressed worry about the regular occurrence of
white collar crime which involved falsification of documents such
as customs clearance of motor vehicles, school certificates and
cheating on hard currency.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Parliament Session Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The summer session of the Nepali
parliament opened here Sunday amid signs that the barely
three-month-old minority government led by Girija Prasad Koirala
will be facing a tough time.
</P>
<P>
Speaker of Lower House Ram Chandra Paudel told the MPs that
King Birendra will address the joint session of the bicameral
parliament on July 1 on the government's policies and programs.
</P>
<P>
In addition to debate on the policies and programs, the summer
session, also known as the budget session, is to discuss and pass
the budget to be presented by the government for the 1998/99
fiscal year which begins in mid-July.
</P>
<P>
To get the budget passed, Koirala has to garner 103 votes in
the 205-seat Lower House. Otherwise, he has to resign. But his
Nepali Congress party has only 88 MPs in the house.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxism-Leninism,
CPN-UML), the largest opposition party with 49 MPs in the house,
indicated at the opening session that it may withdraw its support
if the government does not heed the national problems.
</P>
<P>
The government of Koirala which came to power in mid-April won
the vote of confidence with the support of CPN-UML, who instead
raised 36-point demands as preconditions.
</P>
<P>
Several days before, General Secretary of CPN-UML Madhav Kumar
Nepal accused the minority government of failing to solve the
problems of the people.
</P>
<P>
At Sunday's session, the opposition parties raised the issue of
Kalapani in Darchula district of far-western Nepal, where the
Indian army has been stationed since 1962. They demanded that the
government initiate necessary actions for the immediate withdrawal
of the Indian army from Kalapani and the return of encroached land
by India in the border areas.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that some important bills including those
concerning decentralization which aims to transfer powers to the
local bodies and the property rights of women are expected to be
presented to the present session of parliament.

<HEADLINE> Major Japanese Newspapers Laud China-U.S. Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Major Japanese newspapers on Sunday
welcomed the historic summit held in Beijing Saturday between
Chinese President Jiang Zemin and U.S. President Bill Clinton,
saying the meeting marked a new beginning of Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
The Asahi Shimbun newspaper applauded a series of agreements
reached during the summit, especially the one on mutual
de-targeting of nuclear missiles at each other.
</P>
<P>
"Such cooperation between the U.S. and China, which are the two
big countries at the two ends of the Pacific, will benefit
stability and peace in Asia and can be welcomed," the daily said
in an editorial.
</P>
<P>
The paper also called on the Japanese government to improve its
relations with China while maintaining good ties with the U.S.,
saying that Japan should adapt new relations with China according
to the new China-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
The Mainichi Shimbun said that China-U.S. ties have entered a
new phase after the two countries agreed to maintain dialogue
while reserving differences.
</P>
<P>
The Nihon Keizai's commented that China and the
U.S. have laid a solid foundation for establishing bilateral
relations oriented toward the 21st century through Clinton's
visit.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and China have expanded their "constructive strategic
partnership" to currency, financial spheres from security and
business fields, the Nihon Keizai said in an editorial.
</P>
<P>
The Yomiuri Shimbun, meanwhile, said in its editorial that the
Sino-U.S. relations entered a new era with the summit.
</P>
<P>
The two countries took the first step to strategic dialogue
toward the next century, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Number of Telephone lines Increases in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The number of telephone lines
installed in Macao had reached 169,591 by the end of last year, up
5 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The Macao Telecommunications Company (CTM) said in a report
published on Sunday's Macao Daily News that the newly increased
telephone lines reached 8,106 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Macao has a resident population of 415,000.
</P>
<P>
The most rapid part of increase was the GSM mobile service,
which grew from 24,013 customers in 1996 to 41,093 in 1997, up 71
percent.
</P>
<P>
Macao residents made a total of 118.9 million minutes of
long-distance phone calls last year, up 6.3 percent. That would
mean 282.5 minutes for each resident in Macao.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the CTM reported an after-tax profit of 313
million patacas (about 39.13 million U.S. dollars), up 14.3
percent from 1996.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurated in 1981, the CTM monopolizes all telephone services
in Macao.

<HEADLINE> HK Press Hails Jiang-Clinton Summit Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong press hailed as "very
fruitful" the historic Sino-American summit meeting in Beijing on
Saturday between Chinese President Jiang Zemin and U.S. President
Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
In a Sunday editorial entitled "Fruitful Sino-American Summit
Meeting," Chinese-language newspaper Wen Wei Po said that, in
their "positive, constructive and fruitful" discussions during the
focus-attracting summit meeting, the Chinese and U.S. leaders
exchanged in depth their views and opinions and reached an
important consensus on such topics as Sino-American relations and
international and regional affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-American relations had been developing in a positive
and healthy direction ever since President Jiang's visit to the
United States last year, the editorial said. President Clinton's
current return visit to China "marks a new stage in the
development of the Sino-American relations and a new progress in
the their joint efforts in the establishment of a constructive
strategic partnership," the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
The progress was especially demonstrated in the fact that both
parties had looked into the bilateral relations from a strategic
point of view and long-term approach and they had found common
ground on many issues, it continued.
</P>
<P>
With China being the world's largest developing country while
the U.S. the world's most developed state, there is a wide space
between the two to help each other with mutual benefits. And the
two countries have wide common interests on many important issues
concerning world peace and development and they bear as well
common and irresistible responsibilities, the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
With differences existing between the two countries in social
systems, cultural tradition and ideology, it is nothing strange
that they have different ideas and views on some issues. It is
however up to the two countries themselves to choose their path of
development and the Sino-American relations should be dealt with
in the spirit of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit and
seeking common ground while reserving differences, the editorial
added.
</P>
<P>
"New Stage in the Sino-American Relations" was the title of an
editorial carried by the Sunday issue of the Chinese-language
newspaper Hong Kong Commercial Daily.
</P>
<P>
"The Sino-American summit meeting in Beijing is very fruitful,"
said the editorial. If the summit meeting between President Jiang
and President Clinton eight months ago in Washington had set the
target for the two countries to establish a constructive strategic
partnership for the 21st century, their meeting in Beijing on
Saturday marked a giant step towards the target by the two
countries, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement reached between the two countries, both members
of the United Nations Security Council, on not to point their
strategic nuclear weapons at each other, demonstrates to the world
that China and the U.S. are partners, not adversaries, as
President Jiang described it.
</P>
<P>
As to such issues as human rights and China's bid to join the
World Trade Organization, differences between the two countries
should not be the obstacles to the development of bilateral
relations. The Beijing summit meeting showed that the two
countries tried to settle down their differences through dialogues
and discussions, which represented a matured orientation, the
editorial said.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing meeting demonstrated again the wide and common
interests of the two countries on issues concerning world peace
and development, the editorial said, adding the Summit meeting has
laid down a sound foundation for the further and healthy
development of the Sino-American relations. "This is all the more
important result out of the summit meeting in Beijing," said the
editorial.

<HEADLINE> Interview: German Business Leader Confident in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Being responsible for promoting
trade between Hong Kong and Germany, Ekkehard Goetting, leader of
the German industrial and commercial community in Hong Kong, has
said that his work is not easy but very interesting and very
important.
</P>
<P>
Goetting, chairman and chief executive officer of the German
Industry and Commerce in Hong Kong, South China and Vietnam, said
in an exclusive interview with Xinhua recently that Hong Kong,
affected by the current Asian financial turmoil, is experiencing a
difficult time.
</P>
<P>
At this time, "more businessmen from Germany and Hong Kong need
our service to help them do business in each other's places,"
Goetting said.
</P>
<P>
Sitting in his office from where he can overlook the Victoria
harbor, Goetting said that he is not only interested in getting
German to come to Hong Kong or South China, but also interested in
providing Hong Kong and South China with business opportunities in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
"One of our main activities is to find the right local people
for them to do business with," Goetting said, adding "We also
provide them with market information and quite a number of
service."
</P>
<P>
Goetting said that every year his chamber publishes a survey of
how the companies which are already here view their prospects in
Hong Kong and their business in China's mainland.
</P>
<P>
In the latest survey of confidence published earlier this year,
three quarters of the polled German companies in Hong Kong rate
the investment climate in the SAR after the July 1, 1997 and over
the next five years as "good" and "very good," and more than one
third of them plan to increase their activities here in the medium
term.
</P>
<P>
The vast majority (83 percent) confirms that the investment
climate has remained unchanged or even become more favorable since
the handover.
</P>
<P>
Those companies who have noticed any negative development blame
this on the general economic and financial crisis in the
surrounding south-east Asian countries, which only indirectly
affects Hong Kong and has nothing to do with the handover.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that Hong Kong remains an important economic
and financial center for German companies. Nearly 80 percent of
the Hong Kong offices are regional head offices which used the SAR
as a base from where their most important markets (China's
mainland, Taiwan, Macao, South Korea and the Philippines) are
managed and coordinated.
</P>
<P>
The good transportation, telecommunications and information
infrastructure, the excellent services, the attractive taxation
system, the stable legal system and the available know-how, are
the main investment motives for German companies here, Goetting
said.
</P>
<P>
Over 90 percent of the companies polled want to keep their
regional heads of office in the SAR in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's role as gateway to China's mainland was also
underlined again by the survey with more than two thirds of the
polled companies having at least one or more branch offices on the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
Whereas some South-East Asian countries have had to drastically
devalue their currencies, the Hong Kong dollar continues to be
pegged with the U.S. dollar, he said.
</P>
<P>
This makes Hong Kong a relatively expensive investment location
in comparison to the above-mentioned countries, but this also
ensures domestic and foreign investors a certain and very
necessary stability in the SAR, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Goetting said that there are proximately 500 German companies
registered in Hong Kong such as BASF, Bayer, Hoechst, Henkel,
Schering and Siemens.
</P>
<P>
Turning to politics, Goetting said that the general situation
in Hong Kong has been improved and freedom of press is still
guaranteed in Hong Kong since the handover, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have seen for ourselves the improvement," Goetting said.
"In my own case I can ask for the permanent identification card of
the HKSAR after July 1 and I have already obtained one," he added.
</P>
<P>
"The only concern that we have is that the quality of English
business language is a little bit in a question mark and some
companies complained sometimes that it seems to be a little bit
more difficult to get foreign staff into Hong Kong for
international companies," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But I think these are only individual cases, not a common
phenomenon and the Immigration Department has reinsured that there
is no change of policy," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Economically, from my personal point of view, the situation is
difficult now but there's no reason to panic," Goetting said.
</P>
<P>
HK's fundamentals are much more solid, particularly the
financial sectors are much more solid, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong, as a regional hub, is playing an important role in
the region, he said. It can provide companies in the region with
know-how to explore and to establish as well as to conquer new
markets, he added.
</P>
<P>
Know-how is very important for foreign companies which want to
do business in the region and Hong Kong is the best place in the
region in terms of the know-how, Goetting said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong can recover faster than others, Goetting estimated.
Foreign companies depend on HK to get into other markets in the
region, particularly into China's mainland, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's other advantages include its infrastructure, low
tax, the rule of law and the business-friendly environment.
</P>
<P>
Having been working in Hong Kong for eight years, Goetting said
 that Hong Kong is a wonderful place, a very good place to do
business. "I have no plan to move because I can't think of a more
interesting place like Hong Kong," Goetting said.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Singapore Envoy: HK's Future Is Bright </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Chan Heng Wing, consul-general
of the Republic of Singapore in Hong Kong, has said that he
noticed almost no change in Hong Kong one year after it returned
to China on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
"Of course, the original Hong Kong flag has been replaced by
the five-starred flag of China and the bauhinia flag of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region," he said in an exclusive
interview with Xinhua at his office recently. "That's the only
change I have seen," he added.
</P>
<P>
The handover has been smooth and the way of life in Hong Kong
has remained unchanged ever since, said Chan.
</P>
<P>
He said, Hong Kong continues to thrives as a free market
economy and it enjoys the same kind of political and economic
freedom as they always enjoyed before.
</P>
<P>
"All the officials of the SAR government I met told me that
they felt no interference at all from the Central government with
Hong Kong affairs, Chan said.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that the policies of 'one country, two systems',
'a high degree of autonomy in Hong Kong' and 'Hong Kong people
governing Hong Kong' are working well," Chan noted.
</P>
<P>
Chan has been in Hong Kong since March 1997. He said the
handover aroused great interest in Singapore when the historical
event was broadcast live.
</P>
<P>
Chan, whose ancestor went to Singapore from Guangdong province,
China, said that for many Singaporeans the handover was an event
of great significance in the evolution of the Chinese history,
because many of the Singapore people, whether by studying history
themselves or being told by their parents or grand parents, know
what happened at the end of the last century.
</P>
<P>
"It gave a kind of sense of pride because this is a change of
era," he said. "Of course, some of the Singapore people worried
that the Hong Kong people's life may be changed after the
handover," Chan said.
</P>
<P>
"Many people who came to visit Hong Kong asked me whether
anything has changed in Hong Kong after July 1 last year and I
told them to see themselves."
</P>
<P>
Of course in the last few months, Hong Kong, like the rest of
the region, is facing some economic difficulties at the moment.
This is the result of the Asian financial crisis that has brought
about a slowdown in all the economies of the region and has
nothing to do with the handover, Chan stressed.
</P>
<P>
The relationship between Hong Kong and Singapore, remained as
close as before, both economically and politically, Chan
continued.
</P>
<P>
"The economic relationship is at the private sector level, not
directly at the governmental level, because both of our economies
are run by the private sectors," Chan said.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 100 Singapore companies in Hong Kong and
there are also a large number of Hong Kong companies in Singapore
in a wide variety of businesses. These businesses are continuing
to grow.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that both the business communities of Hong Kong and
Singapore can find the two places are good to do business in,"
Chan said.
</P>
<P>
Chan said that Hong Kong and Singapore share the similarity of
being business hubs for the Asia-Pacific region and both of them
are able to attract a lot of foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
"Out of the way we do business in Hong Kong and Singapore we
can bring back some confidence to this region and in this way we
can take the region out of the economic troubles," Chan said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is the fifth largest trading partner of Singapore and
Singapore is the sixth largest trading partner of Hong Kong. Last
year, the total trade value between the two economies was 23.6
billion Singapore Dollars (about 12.82 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
On the political side, the relationship between Hong Kong and
Singapore has also stepped up.
</P>
<P>
"We have had the Civil Servants Exchange Program between the
civil servants of Hong Kong and Singapore since 1996," he said.
</P>
<P>
Each year, top civil servants of Hong Kong and Singapore
visited each other and had consultations.
</P>
<P>
In December last year, the permanent secretaries of education,
communications, and health of Singapore visited Hong Kong.
Recently, the Home Affairs Department of the HKSAR led a
delegation of 18 Provisional District Boards Chairmen to Singapore
for a study visit.
</P>
<P>
"We also have a program in which senior officials of each
other's government departments are appointed to sit on each
other's advisory boards."
</P>
<P>
"We have officials here sitting on the advisory committee of
environment and the anti-drug board of Hong Kong. Similarly, there
are also Hong Kong officials sitting in Singapore's boards."
</P>
<P>
At the working level, Singapore had a lot of civil servants
that were appointed to work with the departments of the SAR
government and Hong Kong also sent civil servants for a few weeks
or so to work in the departments of the Singapore government to
learn each other's experience, Chan said.
</P>
<P>
A Singapore-Hong Kong parliamentary friendship group has been
set up and members of the parliament of Singapore and members of
the Legislative Council of Hong Kong can exchange visits.
</P>
<P>
So, there are lots of exchanges like these and some of these
exchanges are long-standing, Chan said. They have been going on
for many years before the handover.
</P>
<P>
For example, the exchanges between the police of Hong Kong and
Singapore started many years ago and the cooperation between them
has long been very close. There are also a lot of close
consultations between the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the
Monetary Authority of Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Of course, there are competitions between Hong Kong and
Singapore. But they are healthy competitions, which can make both
Hong Kong and Singapore better.
</P>
<P>
"We have to restructure the economies so as to be more
competitive and by doing so we can reintroduce confidence for
others who want to do business here," he added.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's future is extremely bright because of its favorable
location and its hardworking and talented people.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's position as a gateway for China's mainland is one
of its strong points, Chan said. The economic development of China
will bring great benefits to Hong Kong because Hong Kong is an
ideal place to be able to assist the development of China's
mainland and at the same time the economic development of the
mainland can offer a lot of opportunities for the business
communities here.
</P>
<P>
The hard working nature of the Hong Kong people is another
strength of Hong Kong. The third strength goes to the ability of
the Hong Kong business communities to spot business opportunities,
Chan said.
</P>
<P>
Outside the window of his office, ships are busy crossing the
Victoria harbor. Chan said that Hong Kong, with its solid
fundamentals, will revive more quickly when the region begins to
walk out the current storm.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Summit to Seal Egypt's Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Egypt will become the 20th member of
a key regional group of Africa Monday when the Common Market for
Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) seals its admission, Egypt's
Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa will lead Egypt's delegation Sunday
to COMESA summit which will start Monday in Kinshasa, the
Democratic Republic of the Congo.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt's admission into COMESA is bound to enhance trade and
investment links between it and the other 19 members," said
Egyptian Trade and Supply Minister Ahmed Gowaili, who expected
trade among the member states to surge to 4 billion U.S. dollars
this year.
</P>
<P>
Egypt applied for the membership in 1993, in order to benefit
from advantages of the preferential trade zone of COMESA.
</P>
<P>
The membership will also mean wider export vistas for Egypt, as
reduced duties are already in force among the member states.
</P>
<P>
COMESA is planning to dismantle all tariffs by the year
2000. The 19 members started phasing out tariffs in 1991 by 10
percent each year.
</P>
<P>
The annual exports of these countries, with a population of 350
million, are valued at 17 billion dollars against 25 billion
dollars in imports which are mainly foodstuffs and oil products.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, Egypt paid particular attention to
expanding economic and trade relations with other African
nations. Early this year Moussa made a multi-nation tour of
southern Africa, accompanied by a big delegation of businessmen.
</P>
<P>
On their part, COMESA members are eager to get Egypt into the
fold because of its leading role and political weight. Egypt has
been participating in major farming and industrial ventures in a
number of African countries, such as Kenya and Uganda, according
to MENA.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Opposition Party Elects New Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 28 (Xinhua) --South Africa's expelled
African National Congress (ANC) leader Bantu Holomisa was elected
Saturday president of the United Democratic Movement (UDM) at the
party's first national congress.
</P>
<P>
Roelf Meyer, a former stalwart of the National Party (NP), the
biggest opposition party in South Africa, was elected UDM's
deputy president at the congress in Johannesburg, Sunday Times
paper reported.
</P>
<P>
Holomisa, 43, and Meyer, 51, have been co-leaders of the UDM
since the party was formed in September last year.
</P>
<P>
Holomisa served as Deputy Minister of Environment Affairs and
Meyer as Minister of Provincial Affairs and Constitutional
Development in the first national unity government after the 1994
election.
</P>
<P>
A poll last month showed that support for the UDM stood at
five percent, up from four percent last November. Meanwhile, NP
support fell from 12 percent in November to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 delegates attended Saturday's congress, which
also saw the election of Sifiso Nkabinde, a controversial former
ANC leader from the KwaZulu-Natal province, as national
secretary. Meanwhile, Esau Mabeta was elected as national
chairman.
</P>
<P>
The congress decided the party would not form any alliance
with opposition parties in the run-up to next year's general
elections. "The UDM will go on its own," Holomisa said.
</P>
<P>
This was a rebuff to repeated calls from the NP that
opposition parties should unite and fight the ruling ANC together
in the coming election. Leaders of the NP and the white-based
Democratic Party (DP) have met to discuss possible cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Holomisa called for trade unions to be independent of
political parties. The ANC's alliance with the Congress of South
African Trade Unions (Cosatu) had become an embarrassment and was
affecting investor confidence, he said.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Sends Farewell Letters to World Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
has expressed his hope that the Philippines will continue to
receive the support of the world community as he bade farewell to
his counterparts in 93 countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
In separate letters to the 93 heads of state and heads of
government, Ramos formally informed them of his retirement from
government service on June 30 as well as the assumption into
office of President-elect Joseph Estrada as the 13th president of
the country.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued here Sunday by the presidential
office, Ramos also sent a letter to U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan, saying that Estrada will renew the country's strong
commitment to the ideals of the United Nations and continue with
vigor "our efforts to enhance the peace and security in the region
and to address the concerns of developing countries."
</P>
<P>
In his letter to U.S. President Bill Clinton, the office said,
Ramos thanked him for their friendship which, he said, has helped
lay the foundations for a closer and more dynamic
Philippine-American partnership for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The president said he will urge his successor to "continue
building on this great progress that we have made in our
relations."
</P>
<P>
In his letter to Chinese President Jiang Zemin, the office
said, Ramos expressed the country's gratitude for China's
statesmanship.
</P>
<P>
As he thanked Jiang, the president also expressed hope that
China will extend the same level of cooperation under the Estrada
administration, the office said.
</P>
<P>
It said that Ramos further thanked Jiang for his "recent
reassurance to maintain the current value of the renminbi in
consideration of the economic difficulties faced by Southeast
Asian economies including the Philippines."

<HEADLINE> Israeli Speaker Grumbles about Spanish PM's Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Knesset (Parliament)
Speaker Dan Tichon has decided not to attend all official
receptions for Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar who arrived
here Sunday for a three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Tichon told Israel Radio that during the visit to Israel, the
Spanish prime minister will not pay a visit to the Knesset and
this is unusual for a leader of a foreign country. So he decided
to boycott all official receptional activities to be held for
Aznar, Tichon said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Ministry said Sunday that Spanish prime
minister's not visiting the Knesset is not a mistake of the
Spanish side, because the Foreign Ministry did not ask the Spanish
side to do so.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear whether Tichon's boycott will have any
repercussion on Aznar's visit to Israel.
</P>
<P>
Aznar is to hold two private meetings with Netanyahu, one is
scheduled Sunday evening and another on Monday, to discuss
progress made in bilateral relations and the situation of the
stalled Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
After losing interest in holding a referendum on the second
phase West Bank troop redeployment, Netanyahu suggested Saturday
to hold another international peace conference on the Middle East
along the lines of the 1991 Madrid Conference.
</P>
<P>
Aznar will also meet with Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat on issues of how to move the peace process
forward.
</P>
<P>
Economic relations between Israel and Spain developed fast
during recent years and bilateral trade totaled about 1 billion
U.S. dollars in 1997.

<P>
MACAO, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The unemployment rate for the first
three months of this year reached 3.3 percent, with about 7,000
people jobless, latest statistics show.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the Macao Census and Statistics Department
Saturday show that Macao's labor population totaled 208,500 in the
first quarter, down 1.1 percent from the previous quarter. While
about 201,500 people had jobs, some 7,000 remained unemployed.
</P>
<P>
Most of the unemployed lost their previous jobs in retail
sales, restaurants, hotels, public services and manufacturing
sectors, which were hardest hit by the economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
Trade unions and many other organizations in Macao have urged
the government to take effective measures to help create new jobs.
The Macao government recently earmarked 50 million patacas (6.25
million U.S. dollars) as special relief fund for those in extreme
difficulty.
</P>
<P>
However, due to the worsening situation in the wake of the
financial turmoil in Asia, the Macao government has decided to cut
 government expenditures and suspend some public engineering
projects this year.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Leader Meets Opposition Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's new leader, General
Abdulsalam Abubakar Saturday met the major opposition group, the
National Democratic Coalition (NADECO), in his effort to promote
the democratization process in the country.
</P>
<P>
A government statement said the Abubakar had useful
discussions with members of the NADECO delegation on a broad
range of issues of national interest and the need for genuine
national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
It said the meeting was one in the series of on-going
consultation between the government and various interest groups,
all in an effort to find a solution to Nigeria's political
dilemma following the sudden death of late military leader
General Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
While answering reporters' questions, NADECO's Chairman Chief
Abraham Adesanya said the meeting was satisfactory and that they
gave the advise and the head of state promised to consider it.
</P>
<P>
He, however, refused to disclose exactly what advise NADECO
has given, only saying that the group's position has not changed.
</P>
<P>
NADECO has, in a recent statement, attributed the country's
current political crisis to the annulment by "a few selfish
individuals" of the June 12, 1993 presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
It asked the government to allow Moshood Abiola, the presumed
winner of the 1993 election to form a government of national
unity, which will then call a Sovereign National Conference to
map out the way forward for the country.

<HEADLINE> President Clinton Tours Palace Museum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. President Bill
Clinton and First Lady Hillary toured the imposing Palace Museum,
also renowned as the Forbidden City, in downtown Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
The President, who had been deeply impressed by China's
splendid ancient culture in the northwest city of Xi'an, the first
stop of his nine-day China trip, was once again amazed by the
magnificent buildings in the Forbidden City, which was the
imperial court of the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911)
dynasties.
</P>
<P>
At 11:30 a.m., The U.S. President and Mrs. Clinton walked into
the Palace Museum from its southern and main entrance: the
Meridian Gate (Wumen). It was at the very entrance former U.S.
President Richard Nixon had entered the Forbidden City during his
China visit 26 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The Forbidden City, home of more than 20 emperors of the Ming
and Qing dynasties, is the largest and best group of imperial
structures that remain intact in China.
</P>
<P>
With a collection of more than 930,000 invaluable cultural
relics, the Palace Museum has been included into the list of "World
Culture Heritage" by the United Nations Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organization.
</P>
<P>
The museum has also established itself as China's leading
tourist attraction since it was reopened to tourists in 1972, only
one day prior to former President Nixon's China trip.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Museum played host to a total of six million
Chinese and foreign visitors last year, including heads of state
and government leaders from many other countries.
</P>
<P>
Tan Bin, executive deputy curator of the Palace Museum, who
accompanied the president and his family as their guide, briefed
them on historical anecdotes related with courts and unique styles
of varied architectures as he showed them around.
</P>
<P>
The Clintons listened to him with great interest and stopped
him frequently with queries. They posed for pictures twice at the
Hall of Supreme Harmony and the Hall of Central Harmony in the
Forbidden City.
</P>
<P>
The president looked carefully the huge marble carvings on the
pavement leading to the three main halls and appreciated them.
When he learned that a 200-plus ton carved marble was moved in by
some 10,000 builders from afar in 28 days, Clinton said: "It's no
easy job."
</P>
<P>
When asked about his impression on the museum, Clinton said
"It's amazing."
</P>
<P>
At the end of one-hour tour of the Palace Museum, the Clintons
thanked Deputy Curator Tan and the Chinese interpreter for their
excellent work, and posed with them in front of an ancient tree in
the Imperial Garden at the rear of the museum.
</P>
<P>
Tan presented the President and Hillary a picture album of the
Museum, and a miniature replica of the plaque hanging in the
bed-chamber and office of ancient emperors.
</P>
<P>
The plaque bears a four-character inscription of the first
emperor of the Qing Dynasty: "Zheng Da Guang Ming, or Open and
Aboveboard".
</P>
<P>
When President Clinton heard the words' meaning from the
interpreter, he said he would like to place it in his White House
office.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton signed the visitors' book with words: "Thank
you for hospitality. We learned much and really enjoy the beauty
and magnificency of your rich and colorful history."

<HEADLINE> Germany Expect Tough Match against Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MONTPELLIER, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The aging German team will have
to overcome some of their sluggish performance in the group stage to
accelerate past well-prepared Mexico in the round of 16 on Monday.
</P>
<P>
German captain Jurgen Klinsmann, who scored his 46th goal for
Germany in the match against Iran, said they are well aware of
Mexico's ability.
</P>
<P>
"We have learned lessons from our games against Yugoslavia and
Iran, and now it is all or nothing in the second round," said
Klinsmann, "We are capable of moving up a gear, and we can beat any
team here."
</P>
<P>
The German team are famous for their slow start in major
international tournaments but can improve as the matches become
tougher.
</P>
<P>
With the 37-year-old Lothar matthaus back in normal sweeper
role, the German team now seemed has settled into a familiar style
of play.
</P>
<P>
"Not everything has been perfect in the first round, but we are
on our way," said German coach Bertie Vogts, "Pulling off Olaf Thon
and playing Matthaus deeper seemed to work against Iran."
</P>
<P>
The Mexican team, which played some high-spirited matches in the
group stage, will be led in the match by striker Luis Hernandez who
had scored three goals in the first round.
</P>
<P>
Mexican coach Manuel Lapuente said:"We have the players to
unlock the German defense, but I have limitless respect for the
opposition. I admire their force and strength. We will play to our
limit and they will have to work very hard to beat us."

<HEADLINE> Iran to Face Tough Economic Times: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 28 (Xinhua) -- A senior Iranian official has
warned of tough economic times ahead because of decreasing
revenues caused by sluggish oil prices on the world market.
</P>
<P>
Vice president and chairman of the Plan and Budget
Organization, Mohammad Ali Najafi, told a meeting in the central
province of Isfahan that the country would face austerity this
year and next year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Iran Daily newspaper Sunday, Najafi called for
measures to ease the economic pressure on the government, which
depends on oil export for about 85 percent of its income in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
"Given the current global oil situation, the government's
income base will decrease," he said, "We should rely on a minimum
level of oil revenues."
</P>
<P>
"If we neglect the future, the society will be overcome by
chaos," he warned. "The shortfall in oil income will eventually
lead to a decrease in investments and result in recession."
</P>
<P>
The world oil market seemed reluctant to recover even after the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and some other oil
producers agreed Wednesday to cut their production by a total of
3.1 million barrels per day as of July 1.
</P>
<P>
Iranian light oil dropped to 10.38 U.S. dollars per barrel
Friday from 10.64 dollars, reports said. Most Iranian oil experts
fear that oil prices would not climb up in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Najafi said that during the current Iranian calendar year
(starting March 21) the government would face a budget deficit of
18,000 billion rials (about 6 billion dollars according to the
export rate).
</P>
<P>
He said the government would try to reduce the deficit by 8,500
billion rials (about 2.8 billion dollars) through spending-cut
measures.
</P>
<P>
He also said the government would continue efforts to create
838,000 job opportunities every year in order to keep unemployment
rate at the 1996 level of 9.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Funds AIDS Vaccine Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- William H. Gates foundation, set up
by the Microsoft Corp chairman and his wife, has donated 1.5
million U.S. dollars to help develop a vaccine to combat AIDS, the
International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We make this gift with the hope that a safe, accessible
vaccine can be developed to end AIDS for all time," Gates said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
"This will require a sustained global effort and creative
thinking from organizations at all levels," he added.
</P>
<P>
The IAVI has also received a 200,000 pound grant from Britain,
the first donation from a government, and sponsorship from another
foundation.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has raised its commitment to 1 million dollars
this year from 200,000 dollars, said IAVI, a non-profit
organization founded two years ago in the United States.
</P>
<P>
A worldwide strategy to accelerate the development of the AIDS
vaccine is reportedly to be launched on the occasion of the 12th
World AIDS Conference which is to open here Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, three to six international teams will be
established to help speed up testing of promising vaccines in
areas where AIDS has reached epidemic proportions.
</P>
<P>
They will also enhance cooperation between scientists in
industrialized and developing countries, and ensure people in the
developing world benefit from vaccines once they are developed,
reports said.
</P>
<P>
According to IAVI's Seth Berkley, the program will cost up to
500 million dollars over the next nine years.
</P>
<P>
"The budget we've outlined is not trivial, but it is modest
compared to the 18 billion dollars the world spends annually on
AIDS treatment, prevention and research," he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Scientists Report New Findings on Migraine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Certain genetic reasons are
behind the high rates of North American migraineurs, according to
a new study by U.S. researchers.
</P>
<P>
Presented at the annual meeting of the American Association for
the Study of Headache (AASH) now going on in San Francisco, the
report said that the highest prevalence of migraines is in North
America, with 22 percent for women and 7 percent for men. Latin
Americans and Europeans also have high rates. But in Africa and
Asia, only 8 percent of women and 2 percent of men are affected.
</P>
<P>
Isolating this genetic linkage could lead to the understanding of
the basis for migraine and possible new treatments, the researchers
told the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Among the participants at the annual meeting are neurologists,
physical therapists, psychologists, nurses and other health
professionals who treat headaches.
</P>
<P>
Topics include neurobiology of migraine, next generation of
headache therapies, paroxysmal hemicranias and the controversial
position of oral contraceptives in migraineurs.
</P>
<P>
In the new study, researchers examined headache surveys from 90
countries and regions and whittled them down to 18 that were
considered valid enough to allow cross-regional comparisons.
</P>
<P>
Until recently, comparisons were difficult because different
kinds of headaches -- tension, migraine and cluster headaches --
were often lumped together. But diagnostic tools have become
refined enough to isolate migraines sufferers, usually people who
experience such similar symptoms as sensitivity to light and
sound, numbness, nausea and auras.
</P>
<P>
In the past, cultural differences were considered as related to
the disease. Some researchers, for example, argued that lower
Asian rates may be due to a greater level of stoicism. But the new
findings show that African Americans and second- and third-
generation Asian Americans also have lower rates of migraines,
even though they share much the same culture as
U.S. Caucasians. This adds new evidence to the theory that the
disorder has a genetic basis, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
The higher rate of migraines among North Americans in
comparison with Europeans, especially among women, indicates that
some kind of environmental factor also seems to be at work, the
researchers said.
</P>
<P>
For years, it was believed that stress was the principal
cause. But in the past few decades, researchers have identified
alcohol, chocolate and a range of environmental factors as
triggers, leading them to believe that brain biochemistry and
genetic disposition also play a major role.

<HEADLINE> Netherlands Welcome Back Kluivert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
TOULOUSE, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The Netherlands will welcome back
their suspended striker Patrick Kluivert in the second round match
against Yugoslavia on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Kluvert was handed a two-match ban after an incident involving
Belgian defender Lorenzo Staelens. He will be available for
Monday's match but the Dutch coach Guus Hiddink will have difficult
in selecting the starting line-up between Kluvert and Phillip Cocu.
</P>
<P>
Cocu has been in superb form as he scored in the matches against
South Korea and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
But Kluvert also has his supporters. Ronald de Boer, Kluvert's
former teammate in Ajax, said:"Patrick is in great form. In our World
Cup warm-ups and in training he has looked really sharp. You must have
a striker who scores and Patrick can do that."
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands will be favorites in the match against
Yugoslavia. But they still are aware of the fact that the Yugoslav
team have remained unbeaten so far in the World Cup and finished
runners-up to Germany in Group F only on goal difference.
</P>
<P>
Vujadin Boskov, member of the Yugoslav coaching team, said
Yugoslavia have chances in the match:"They are an excellent team and
belong to the category of sides which motivate us. This gives me
some reason for optimism."
</P>
<P>
"We are not nervous. There is a positive tension in the team.
There is no panic ahead of the game," said defender Zeljko Petrovic,
"We'll play a man's game until the final whistle. We save our best
performances for the best teams."

"After the second goal, Brazil completely relaxed, and we were
not able to do a thing against them." said Acosta.

"It was already a great performance that for the first time in

we had to play against the team who will surely go all the way to

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Villagers Ordered to Vacate Invaded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Vice-President Simon
Muzenda ordered farmers who have invaded white owners' commercial
farms to vacate the properties and await orderly resettlement.
</P>
<P>
Addressing hundreds of land-hungry villagers who invaded four
white commercial farms in east Zimbabwe Saturday, Muzenda urged
the villagers to register and wait to be resettled under the
recently announced second resettlement program before the onset
of the rainy season, the Sunday Mail reported.
</P>
<P>
The villagers, estimated at more 4,000, illegally occupied the
white-owned commercial farms two weeks ago saying the government
was dragging its feet over its land acquisition and land
redistribution exercise.
</P>
<P>
Muzenda, however, did not give a deadline as to when the
villagers should leave the farms but assured them that by August
they would have been allocated land.
</P>
<P>
Muzenda reiterated President Robert Mugabe's assurance that no
legal action would be taken against them as the previous land
distribution process was unfairly biased towards the white
minority community.
</P>
<P>
He, however, said there was not enough land for all of them to
be resettled.
</P>
<P>
The villagers agreed to leave but were concerned that some of
them would be left out of the envisaged resettlement despite
having participated in pressuring the government to speed up land
redistribution.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Appoint New Interior Minister in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 28 (Xinhua) -- President Mohammad Khatami will
introduce his new interior minister to the Majlis (Parliament) for
approval by end of the current Iranian month (to end July 22), the
pro-moderate newspaper Iran reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
An informed source with the Interior Ministry was quoted as
saying that this should be done soon in order to prepare the
election of the Experts Assembly, which is empowered to determine
the country's supreme leader, on October 23.
</P>
<P>
The conservative-dominated Majlis on June 21 impeached former
Interior Minister Abdollah Nouri on charges of instigation and
mismanagement. Khatami responded by appointing Nouri as vice
president for development and social affairs and named Nouri's
deputy, Mostafa Tajzadeh, as acting interior minister.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will start to register candidates in August, the
source said. According to relevant laws, the acting minister can
not take charge of important elections.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper named three prominent leftist figures - Vice
President for Legal and Parliamentary Affairs Mosavi Lari,
Managing Director of the Salam daily Mosavi Khoiniha and former
Heavy Industries Minister Behzad Nabavi - as possible nominees for
Nouri's successor.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts believed that Lari is likely the choice,
because it would be very difficult for Khatami to convince the
conservative-led Majlis to accept Khoiniha or Nabavi, two
well-known leftist hardliners.

PARIS, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Ronaldo said his appetite was whetted
by the two goals he scored in the match against Chile and he would

Ronaldo scored twice in either half of the match and hit the
woodwork twice. "I really wanted to score. These goals tasted sweet,
but they just whetted my appetite for more," said Ronaldo, "I have

off the posts, I would have been among the top scorers of the World
Cup."
</P>
<P>
"Today you saw a fast, creative and unbridled Brazilian team.
That's the Brazil that everyone wants to see. When the team help
me, I can help the team." said Ronaldo.
</P>
<P>
Roberto Carlos, who was praised by coach Mario Zagallo as the
best player of the match, said:"I've always wanted to score a goal
against Chile, and I'm getting closer and closer. Today I got to
play left wing and I felt as though I was back playing for Real
Madrid. I am also very happy for Ronaldo who broke the spell that
was hanging over him."

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Hopes to Do More for EU in Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Foreign Minister Ioannis
Kasoulides has said that Cyprus hopes to play an active and
constructive role when it becomes member of European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
He made the remark at a meeting of twinned Mediterranean
cities, which ended on saturday in western coastal town of
Paphos.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides said that Cyprus, being the only Mediterranean
applicant, can act as a link between Europe and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that despite Cyprus' small size, it seeks no
special treatment from Europe but instead offers to play a role as
Europe's gateway to the region.
</P>
<P>
"Our foreign policy, founded mainly on our European
orientation, is also addressed to the Middle East," the Minister
said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that Cyprus' traditionally friendly ties

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Needs Tough Decisions for Economy: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Finance Minister
Herbert Murerwa said time has come for the government to take the
most difficult decisions and turn around the country's unstable
macro-economic environment.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe was currently experiencing a difficult economic
period characterized by low export earnings against high import
payments, Murerwa told the ruling Zanu (PF) party's national
consultative assembly Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the government should immediately
rationalize the civil service so that it becomes leaner and more
efficient.
</P>
<P>
It should also accelerate the privatization process and use
the proceeds from the process to reduce the country's debt which
is currently at 24 percent of the country's total expenditure, he
added.
</P>
<P>
"We also need to facilitate growth of the economy by creating
an environment that is conducive to both domestic and foreign
investors bearing in mind that we also need a social stability in
the country," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"No progress can take place without political and social
stability, it is essential that this is maintained for the good
of the nation," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The country's economy, he said, was thrown into disarray this
year mainly because of the weak Zimbabwean Dollar, all time low
metal prices on the world market, depressed tobacco prices,
adverse publicity in the foreign media and the turmoil in the
banking sector brought about by the collapse of the United
Merchant Bank owned by tycoon, Roger Boka.
</P>
<P>
This resulted in low development, plummeting inflation
rates, poor employment creation, a lower revenue base and the
high cost of living, the minister said.

<P>
TEHRAN, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Iran has condemned "harsh behavior"
of American immigration officials toward its scholars invited to
attend a conference on the ancient Iranian poet Ferdowsi at
Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
According to Tehran Radio Sunday, Foreign Ministry spokesman
Mahmoud Mohammadi said the "harsh behavior" was against the
principle of mutual respect, indicating that the U.S. was still
continuing its "hostile policy" towards Iranian people.
</P>
<P>
The U.S immigration officials had asked the Iranian scholars to
leave their fingerprints upon arrival, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said that it was regretful that the U.S. officials
repeated such an "inhuman behavior" after they apologized for
shabby treatment of Iranian wrestlers months ago.
</P>
<P>
It was a good token of the difference between their words and
deeds, he added.
</P>
<P>
This would only increase distrust between the two countries, he
said, noting that Iran had extended hospitable reception to
U.S. travelers.

NEW DELHI, June 28 (Xinhua) -- India has rejected the Sino-
U.S. Joint Statement which was issued in Beijing Saturday to call
on New Delhi and Islamabad to curtail their nuclear weapon or
missile development programs.
</P>
<P>
An Indian Foreign Ministry statement said that the approach of
the United States and China is "completely unacceptable and out of
place in the present-day world," the Hindustan Times reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that India could not consider the
suggestions contained in the Sino-U.S. Joint Statement and would
continue to act on the basis of its own national security
requirements.
</P>
<P>
The joint statement criticized last month's nuclear tests by
India and Pakistan and urged the two South Asian nations not to
conduct more tests or deploy nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-U.S. statement, issued by U.S. President Bill Clinton
and Chinese President Jiang Zemin after their summit meeting, said
Washington and Beijing "shared interests in a peaceful and stable
South Asia and in a strong global non-proliferation regime put at
risk by (Indian and Pakistani) tests."
</P>
<P>
India conducted three nuclear tests on May 11 and two more two
days later, leading to a tit-for-tat response from neighboring
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The tests fueled tensions in South Asia and were widely
condemned by the international community.

The tugboat American Heritage, owned by American River
Transportation Co. of St. Louis, was pushing 30 grain barges when
it collided with Christine Cenac, a tugboat owned by Cenac Towing
Co. Inc. of Houma, Louisiana.

<HEADLINE> Revolutionary Mecca Becoming Tourism Magnet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Yan'an, a revolutionary base of the
Communist Party of China in northwest China in the 1930s and
1940s, has become a magnet for tourists.
</P>
<P>
An official from the city's tourism bureau said that, in 1997,
Yan'an received more than 800,000 tourists, of which nearly 4,000
were from overseas, and received 174 million yuan in revenue
related to tourism.
</P>
<P>
Yan'an has unique tourism resources like Hukou waterfall of the
Yellow River in Yichuan County; the mausoleum for Huangdi, an
ancestor of the Chinese nation in Wuling County; and the loess
plateau culture such as folk songs, paper-cut art and millet wine.
</P>
<P>
Such revolutionary sites as Zaoyuan (the date garden), the
headquarters of the Eighth Route Army during the anti-Japanese
war, and Yangjiaping, where the Secretariat of the Chinese
Communist Party Central Committee was located from 1937 to 1947,
now attract more visitors after repairs in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Forestry also has approved the establishment of
a national forest park. Landscaped areas in Yan'an exceeds the
national average.
</P>
<P>
Yan'an also has invested in the the development of
infrastructure facilities. Program-controlled telephones shorten
the distance between Yan'an and the world. And the operation of
the Xi'an-Yan'an railway and air routes from Yan'an to Xi'an,
Taiyuan, and Datong make the city more convenient for
tourists.

<HEADLINE> US President Clinton Attends Sunday Church Service in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton who is
now on a nine-day state visit to China went with his family to the
Chongwenmen Church downtown Beijing today to attend Sunday morning
services.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is the second incumbent U.S. president to have visited
the church following George Bush who attended services here during
his 1989 China trip.
</P>
<P>
Built in 1870 and renovated several times, Chongwenmen Church
was Beijing' as well as north China's earliest Protestant church.
Today, as every Sunday, more than 2,000 Protestants came to the
church for the service.
</P>
<P>
Upon their arrival at the Gothic-style church at 9:25 a.m.
local time (1:25 GMT), the president, his wife Hillary and their
daughter Chelsea greeted the pastors and some of the congregation
with warm handshakes. The Clintons then sang psalms and read the
Bible with the rest of the congregation.
</P>
<P>
Pastor Wu Wei, who rendered the service today, gave Clinton a
Bible, a collection of psalms and a cassette that records psalms,
all in Chinese.
</P>
<P>
In a brief message, Clinton conveyed his belief that all
Christians should seek unity with people of different races,
backgrounds and creeds in different parts of the world, and "the
Chinese and the American are brothers and sisters as children of
God."
</P>
<P>
After the one-and-half-hour service, the Clintons talked with
the pastors and other believers.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton and his family left the church around 11:00
for the Forbidden City, former residence of China's imperial
families. They are scheduled later today to tour China's most
famous landmark, the Great Wall.
</P>
<P>
China's Protestant population grew from more than 100 in 1840
to 10 million in 1997. There are more than 12,000 Protestant
churches across China. Beijing, with about 30,000 Protestants out
of its 13-million-population, has eight Protestant churches.

BELGRADE, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic said Saturday that he supports the Chinese people's
efforts in reform and opening up and hopes to see closer friendly
cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark during a meeting with a visiting Chinese
delegation led by Yu Wen, vice president of China Association for
International Understanding. The delegation is in Yugoslavia for a
week-long visit.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic said that he is happy with China's rapid economic
growth and that China has contributed tremendously to the human
rights development and protection by managing to feed its one
billion plus population.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia insists that there is only one China and has been
supporting the Chinese national unification drive, Milosevic said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that China will achieve more in its
reform and opening up drive, which in turn will surely promote an
early unification of the country.
</P>
<P>
In the meeting, Yu Wen spoke highly of the efforts by the
Yugoslav government to protect state sovereignty and territorial
integrity, as well as efforts to develop its economy, to keep the
society stable and to return to international organizations.

<HEADLINE> Interview: BIMP-EAGA Development Affected by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANDER SERI BEGAWAN, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The development of the
Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines-East ASEAN Growth
Area (BIMP-EAGA) has been affected by the prevailing regional
financial crisis, a Brunei official said.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the Projects have been stopped, nothing much on the
ground as inputs are getting less" in the BIMP-EAGA, Project
Officer Abdul Wahab of BIMP-EAGA Unit under Brunei's Industry and
Primary Resources Ministry told Xinhua in a recent exclusive
interview here.
</P>
<P>
The construction of roads in the area such as the road between
Brunei and Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia's Sabah State has stopped and
shipping has also been affected, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Established in March 1994, the BIMP-EAGA, generally still
under- developed, comprises the whole of Brunei, Indonesia's
Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Maluku and Irian Jaya, Malaysia's Sabah,
Sarawak and Labuan as well as Philippines' Mindanao and Palawan,
covering a land area of more than 1.56 million square kilometers
with a population of about 47 million.
</P>
<P>
The BIMP-EAGA has focus on 13 sectors with five of them on the
fast-track: air and sea linkages, tourism development, fisheries
cooperation and construction, she said.
</P>
<P>
Its objectives are to facilitate free movement of people, goods
and services, to share common infrastructure and natural resources
and market, and to increase economic activities with the
sub-region by maximizing complementarities in order to increase
trade, tourism and investment, she said.
</P>
<P>
Up to 1995, investments amounting to 2.9 billion U.S. dollars
were pledged for 120 joint ventures in the area in the fields of
agro-industry, air and sea linkages, fisheries and tourism, with
the agriculture taking the lion's share, amounting to 2.1 billion
dollars out of the total, the official said.
</P>
<P>
However, she said "Though the BIMP-EAGA is four-year old but
not much results have been seen."
</P>
<P>
The target that the BIMP-EAGA takes shape before the year 2003
when the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) is planned to be established
might not be realized by the set time, she said.
</P>
<P>
"Due to the financial crisis, we are trying to revise our goals
and then come up with a new three-year action plan. We hope things
more practical and result-oriented can come up," Abdul Wahab said.
</P>
<P>
She said the senior officials meeting of the BIMP-EAGA
countries which was scheduled to be held in Brunei this month had
to be postponed due to the situation in Indonesia and are now
rescheduled for September, if Indonesia can make it, to discuss
the issue.
</P>
<P>
Again, because of the financial problems, the senior officials
meeting which was supposed to be twice a year will be held only
once this year and the ministerial meeting which was supposed to
be once a year will be canceled this year, she said.
</P>
<P>
On the perspective of the BIMP-EAGA, Abdul Wahab said "let hope
for the best" as most of the BIMP-EAGA countries are upgrading
their airports and seaports and the feasibility study is going on
for the Borneo Highway to improve infrastructure facilities.

<P>
KIEV, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma
said on Saturday Ukraine's successful economic reforms have
created better conditions for its integration into the European
Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference with visiting Polish President
Aleksander Kwasniewski in the industrial city of Kharkov, Kuchma
expressed his belief that the EU will make a decision to accept
Ukraine as an associate member of the bloc.
</P>
<P>
He also said he was sure that Ukraine and the EU would sign a
free trade agreement in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Kwasniewski arrived in Kharkov on Friday and held talks with
Kuchma on economic and neighborly ties.
</P>
<P>
This was the fourth meeting between the two presidents since
early this year.
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian media reported that Ukraine submitted an application
for EU associate membership on June 9, and Ukrainian leaders
repeatedly indicate that the country's policy for integrating
itself with Europe and the European-Atlantic structure will not
change.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Kwasniewski welcomed Ukraine's cooperation with
the EU.
</P>
<P>
Poland became the EU's only associate member in 1994.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral relations, Kwasniewski hoped for Ukraine's
involvement in Poland's military modernization drive, as much of
the country's military equipment comes from Poland.

MOSCOW, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Major Russian newspapers on
Saturday frontpaged stories and comments on U.S. President Bill
Clinton's on-going China visit, hailing it as ushering in a new

It also said the visit will help the U.S. establish a
constructive, strategic partnership with the giant of Asia, adding

in a bid to eliminate human prejudice against the country

"Sovietskaya Rossiya" said that Clinton's China tour and the
U.S.-China summit are of no less historical significance as

The newspaper also said that China, with a rapid economic
growth, will become the most needed trading partner of the United

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- China's major banks are gearing up
their efforts to improve their financial services to help the
country achieve 8-percent economic growth this year, according to
China Daily's Business Weekly today.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, has
urged the financial sector to help boost spending to ensure the
targeted economic growth. The call has been responded by top five
Chinese banks.
</P>
<P>
"The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) arranged 75
billion yuan (about 9 billion US dollars) for lending in the first
half of this year, raising the ratio of savings to loans by 18
percentage points compared to the corresponding period last year,"
the report said.
</P>
<P>
ICBC plans to inject 30 billion yuan for loans to small and
medium-sized enterprises, while attaching importance to key
enterprises by trying to offer the credit quota system to satisfy
their demands for funds.
</P>
<P>
The Agricultural Bank of China (ABC) has declared its
commitments to support the country's agricultural sector by
offering 35 billion yuan in loans to agriculture in 1998, an
increase of 11 billion yuan from last year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the bank has increased by 20 billion yuan loans to
the housing sector, expected to become the country's new growth
area.
</P>
<P>
"Infrastructure, small and medium-sized firms, export-oriented
companies and the residential housing sector are among priorities
of the Bank of China in supplying financial services," the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The China Construction Bank will arrange 20 to 30 billion yuan
for road construction, 25 billion yuan for posts and
telecommunications, and 10 billion yuan for the national and
regional electricity grid, the oil industry and other
infrastructural construction. A total of 27 billion yuan has been
allocated for housing construction and consumption.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Communications is expected to offer 50 billion yuan
in loans this year, with 20 percent of this to be funnelled into
key projects, such as three billion yuan for the massive Three
Gorges Dam project on the Yangtze River.

prestigious institutions of higher learning in China.
</P>
<P>
Beijing University, originally Capital Grand School, was the
first state-run and comprehensive educational institution in
modern China.
</P>
<P>
The school was established in 1898 and renamed in 1912.
</P>
<P>
On May 4 this year, the university celebrated its centenary.
Earlier, Chinese President Jiang Zemin inspected the school and
delivered a speech.
</P>
<P>
The institution was established with a sense of revitalizing
the nation, a mission it has taken up since its founding.
</P>
<P>
It was also the birthplace of the movements of combating
imperialism and feudalism, with advanced intellectuals spreading
Marxism and new knowledge there.
</P>
<P>
The university served as the venue for Chinese Communist Party
members to carry out activities in the early years of the Party.
Of the 53 Party members in 1921 when the Party was founded, 21
were teachers or students of the university.
</P>
<P>
Many incidents happening in the university set records in the
country or in the world.
</P>
<P>
-- In 1957, then Beijing University President Ma Yinchu put
forth the urgency of population control in China.
</P>
<P>
-- China's first atomic energy department was founded there in
1958.
</P>
<P>
-- In the 1960s, synthetic bovine insulin was produced for
the first time in the world.
</P>
<P>
-- In 1973, the university succeeded in developing the
country's first computer which was able to complete one million
calculations per second.
</P>
<P>
Over the past century, more than 190,000 people have graduated
from the university, 150,000 of whom graduated over the past two
decades since the country started the reform and opening-up drive.
</P>
<P>
The university now boasts eight colleges, 50 departments, 53
research institutes, 72 research centers and 12 key national
laboratories.
</P>
<P>
The school has about 3,000 teachers and researchers, including
814 professors. And there are 24,000 students, including over
1,000 overseas students coming from more than 70 countries and
regions.
</P>
<P>
The university has established academic ties with 143
universities or colleges in 40 countries and regions.

<P>
BANGKOK, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Thai police are still
investigating the case involving four Pakistani nationals
suspected of involvement in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing in
New York.
</P>
<P>
A police source said Sunday that Thai police had doubts about
earlier suspicion that the four men were connected with the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
The Nation newspaper reported Saturday that Thai police and
U.S. FBI agents stormed a Bangkok apartment Friday and arrested
four Pakistani nationals suspected of involvement in the 1993
World Trade Center bombing in New York.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation
officers as saying the four men were also suspected of planning to
assassinate the U.S. ambassador to Thailand and launch a terrorist
attack on the U.S. Embassy compound.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the suspects -- Mohamad Rahim, 30, Hadja Pahu
Sasa, 25, Hara Haj Husem, 26, and Hareef Hussen, 25 -- had made
contact with several Thai suppliers to obtain weapons for their
operations.
</P>
<P>
The police said on condition of anonymity that Thai police were
still gathering information from several sources before they could
come to a conclusion.
</P>
<P>
He said none of the arrested had committed any serious crimes
here.
</P>
<P>
Thai immigration police chief Pol Lt-Gen Chidchai Wannasathit
said earlier that police were uncertain whether the suspects were
terrorists. He said Thai police were waiting for more information
from the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
The World Trade Center bombing killed six people and wounded
more than 1,000 others. Damage was estimated at more than 500
million U.S. dollars. Six men were convicted in the United States
between 1994 and 1997 in connection with the attack.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Imperial Palace Museum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The Imperial Palace Museum, also
known as the Forbidden City, was the imperial palace of the Ming
(1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties in China's history.
Located in the center of Beijing, it is the largest and best
preserved remaining ancient architecture group in China.
</P>
<P>
The Forbidden City, whose construction started in 1406 and
completed in 1420, had been the throne of 24 ancient Chinese
emperors.
</P>
<P>
The City, 961 meters long from north to south and 754 meters
wide from east to west, has more than 9,000 rooms with a total
construction area of 150,000 square meters.
</P>
<P>
The whole architectural complex is an embodiment of grandeur,
luxury and splendor, culminating the art of architecture in
ancient China.
</P>
<P>
The Revolution of 1911 led by Dr. Sun Yat-sen overthrew the
rule of the Qing Dynasty and ended the Forbidden City's history as
feudal imperial palace. In 1925, the Imperial Palace Museum was
set up in the Forbidden City.
</P>
<P>
The Palace Museum preserves a large collection of invaluable
cultural and historical relics. On the founding of the museum,it
had a total of more than 1.17 million items of cultural relics,
which are important materials for study of the history and ancient
arts of the Ming and Qing dynasties.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, part of the cultural and historical relics were
lost during the War of Resistance Against Japan (1937-1945) and
the War of Liberation (1945-1949). By 1995, the Imperial Palace
Museum had preserved a collection of more than 930,000 items of
cultural and historical relics.
</P>
<P>
On the palace ground there are many well-known buildings such
as the Hall of Supreme Harmony, Hall of Mental Cultivation, Hall
of Heavenly Purity and Hall of Earthly Tranquility. Among them,
the Hall of Supreme Harmony is the most grandiose building in the
Forbidden City. It is also the largest wooden structure hall in
China.
</P>
<P>
The Hall of Mental Cultivation was the place where emperors
after Emperor Kangxi of the Qing Dynasty resided and handled state
affairs. It was also the place where the last emperor of China
relinquished the throne and thus concluding the feudal rule of
emperors in China's history.

<HEADLINE> China Encourages Competition in Auto Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Worldwide leading auto
manufacturers might face severe competition in the Chinese market
in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xiaoyu, vice-director of the State Machine-Building
Industry Bureau, which oversees China's automobile industry, said
the country will continue to promote international co-operation
and exchange, reported today's Business Weekly of China Today.
</P>
<P>
China will renegotiate a multipurpose vehicle (MPV) project
with Daimler-Benz and Chrysler, even if at that time the
megamerger between the two auto giants is still waiting for
shareholders' final approval, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"The merger between Daimler-Benz and Chrysler will create a new
dimension we have never encountered before. We'll have a new
platform to develop our investment strategy," said Karlheinz
Michel, president of Mercedes-Benz China Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Daimler-Benz signed a general agreement with China Nanfang
Automotive Company in 1995 to produce MPVs using petrol and diesel
engines, but the project was delayed due to "market
changes". However, it is still feasible that the project will be
improved and implemented, Michel said.
</P>
<P>
Giant car-makers such as Toyota, Ford, fiat and Renault are also
stepping up their efforts to vie for a stake in sedan assembly in
China.
</P>
<P>
Envisioning intense future competition in the auto
manufacturing sector, some large domestic car-makers are seeking
opportunities to raise funds needed to launch new models.

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen to Establish Biological Engineering Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Shenzhen's city government and
the Chinese Academy of Military Medical Sciences have signed an
agreement to jointly build a biological engineering industrial
base in Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
It is one of the important measures taken by the city in
southern China to boost its high-tech biological engineering
industry, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The bio-industry base, located in the city's high-tech
development zone, will first produce erythropoietin (EPO), the
most popular genetic engineering pharmaceutical in the world.
</P>
<P>
The genetic engineering pharmaceutical can encourage metabolism
and enhance immunity for patients who contract kidney disease,
hematopathy and tumors.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Academy of Military Medical Sciences is the top
medical science research body with the People's Liberation
Army. It will provide its latest biological engineering
discoveries to the Shenzhen base for industrial uses.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen has recently adopted preferential policies for the
industrialization of major scientific discoveries made by
scientists in other parts of China.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 27 (Xinhua) -- A rare re-run forced Russia's Irena
Privalova to win the woman's 100 meters twice at the European Cup
athletics meet in St. Petersburg on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Nathan Morgan secured a bronze medal in the men's
long jump after controversy and protest.
</P>
<P>
Privalova had to run the event twice after a re-call signal
for a false start went unheard.
</P>
<P>
An official investigation determined that -- as Nathan Morgan
had insisted all along -- he had in fact cleared 7.85 meters in
the first round. Officials agreed to allow Morgan to take an extra
jump, in which he cleared 7.93 meters for the third place.
Russian Kirill Sosunov won the event gold with 8.38 meters and
equalled the meet record of Armenian Robert Emmiyan.
</P>
<P>
Morgan's six points helped defending champions Britain to lead
the overnight standings in the men's competition. After nine
events, they totalled 53 points, seven ahead of Russia, with
Germany third on 44.5.
</P>
<P>
In the women's events, Russia got a 68-66 lead over Germany,
with France coming third on 52.
</P>
<P>
Former long jumper Italian Fiona May cleared 14.65 meters in
the triple jump for a new Italian national record.
</P>
<P>
Britain won two gold medals on the opening day -- Mark
Richardson in the men's 400 meters and the men's 4x100 meters
relay.

"We know the Nigerian team have their weak spots and when their

rains tomorrow because the heat doesn't suit us."

Nigerian coach Boro Milutinovic would not agree with Laudrup, he
thought Denmark were the favorites because they prepared better than
the Nigerians.

"we are already happy to have qualified for the round of 16.
Now we must keep on going," said Milutinovic, "For me, Denmark

<HEADLINE> U.S. Spends 50 Mln Dlrs on Bosnian Suspect Arrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The United States has spent
50 million U.S. dollars in a covert operation to arrest the
alleged war criminals in Bosnia, a leading U.S. magazine
reported in its latest edition.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. News and World Report said in its July 6 edition that
the U.S. has sent dozens of naval commandos to Bosnia to carry out
the operation.
</P>
<P>
The commandos, from the navy's elite SEAL counter-terrorism
units, had been active for at least a year to try to capture the
alleged criminals in former Yugoslav Bosnia, or the persons
indicted for war crimes (PIFWICS).
</P>
<P>
A U.S. special operations task force has been conducting one of
the broadest covert operations since the Vietnam War, gathering
intelligence on PIFWICS and helping to seize them in a series of
raids, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It quoted sources as saying that more than 300 people were
involved in the covert operation, and so far the cost is at least
50 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The West has called on the indicted, including former Bosnian
Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his army commander General Ratko
Mladic, to surrender themselves.
</P>
<P>
About 30 war crimes suspects have been brought before the
International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia. But
Karadzic and Mladic are still at large.

<HEADLINE> UN Envoy's Plane Crashed in Abidjan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The plane which carried Blondin
Beye, the U.N. envoy to Angola, crashed around 19:45 Friday night
while it was planning to land at Abidjan airport in Cote
d'Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
This was announced here Saturday by a communique issued
jointly by the U.N. observer mission in Angola and the three
observer nations, namely Portugal, Russia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The communique quoted the latest news as saying that the
wreckage of Beechcraft 200, a light aircraft which carried Beye
on board, has been discovered several kilometers north of
Abidjan.
</P>
<P>
Beye left here Friday for a visit to five African nations to
seek support and help from their leaders for the Angolan peace
process, which has been stalled due to the failure of opposition
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) in
implementing a four-year-old peace accord.
</P>
<P>
At this sad moment, the communique noted, the U.N. observer
mission and the three observer nations reiterated their pledge to
make continuous efforts to ensure the 1994 Lusaka Peace Accord is
implemented by the two warring sides, so as to achieve a complete
and lasting peace in the country.
</P>
<P>
The communique also called on the Angolan government and UNITA
to demonstrate their will to carry out all tasks prescribed in
the peace deal.
</P>
<P>
The communique did not reveal any survivors in the plane
crash. And sources from the U.N. observer mission told Xinhua
that there is little possibility for any survival.
</P>
<P>
The Angola News Agency quoted a report from the U.N. that
other passengers on board the plane from Togo to Abidjan included
five officials from the U.N. observer mission and two pilots.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. mission in Angola left here Saturday for Togo for
investigations.
</P>
<P>
Beye, a Malian, became the U.N. envoy to Angola since June,
1993. During his five-year stay in Angola, he has brought the two
warring sides together to sign the Lusaka peace agreement.

<HEADLINE> 3 E. African States End Joint Military Exercise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LODWAR, Kenya, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania
winded up their first-ever joint military exercise at Lodwar in
northwestern Kenya Saturday, describing it as a milestone in and
a climax to the three east African states' military cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The month-long training-exercise, code-named Natural Fire'98,
started on June 2 with 1,356 Kenyan soldiers, 256 Tanzanians and
210 Ugandans under 365 U.S. army trainers.
</P>
<P>
It focused on dealing with a hypothetical state called
Somanga, which is troubled and the forces work to restore order
and stability within the perimeters of the U.N. peace-keeping.
</P>
<P>
The troops got in between the warring sides in the "Somanga"
state, stopped their fighting, brought them to the negotiating
table and finally enabled them to reach a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
To create an enabling environment for a negotiated solution to
the crisis and supervise the truce, they also evacuated
civilians, protected refugees, offered medical services to the
wounded, set up check points, restored police operation and
patrolled along the street.
</P>
<P>
"The exercise is very successful" and will be repeated in the
region in the coming years, said Lt. General Daniel Opande, the
vice Chief of the General Staff of Kenya, while presiding over
the closing ceremony Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
Through the military show, "we do feel we have the capacity to
tackle disaster and defend peace and security in the region,"
Uganda's Col. John Mugume told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"It's a major milestone in east Africa... We learned a lot
from each other," said Tanzanian Brig. Joseph Lesulie.
</P>
<P>
Gen. Opande told Xinhua that a regional military cooperation
strategy focusing on common training and exchanges of senior
military officers, is to be officially completed soon.
</P>
<P>
The strategy also includes a series of confidence building
measures, integration of military training facilities and
systems, joint military research and production and so on.
</P>
<P>
The three countries will participate together in peace-keeping
operations on the continent in the future if needed, said Opande,
adding that the Kenyan army has been involved in the U.N.
peace-keeping move since 1970s on more than 10 occasions.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the military cooperation is only being
boosted to coincide with the increasing regional social, economic
and political cooperation pushed forward by "the strong political
will" of the people in the three sister states.
</P>
<P>
The troops also held a memorial service Saturday for three
fallen soliders -- a Kenyan, a Tanzanian and an American who
passed away during the exercise. The American died of a heart
attack and the two others were killed in a road accident.

<P>
PARIS, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Cesar Sampaio and Ronaldo scored a
double apiece as Brazil swept past Chile 4-1 to enter the soccer World
Cup quarterfinals here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Brazil opened the scoring in the 11th minute when midfielder
Sampaio popped up just outside the box to head home a free kick from
captain Dunga.
</P>
<P>
Defender Roberto Carlos blasted a long-range shot two minutes later
but the ball soared over the crossbar.
</P>
<P>
Sampaio, who plays for Japanese club Yokohama Flugels, found the
net again in the 27th minute, slotting the ball past Chilean keeper
Nelson Tapia.
</P>
<P>
Ronaldo converted a penalty kick in the injury time of the first
half to make it 3-0 for the defending world champions.
</P>
<P>
The spot kick was awarded after Ronaldo was brought down by Tapia
in the penalty area.
</P>
<P>
Chilean defender Fernando Cronejo had a scoring chance in the 39th
minute when he blasted a 20-meter shot from right in the area but the
ball was captured by Brazilian keeper Taffarel.
</P>
<P>
The South Americans reduced the margin through River Plate striker
Marcelo Salas in the 68th minute.
</P>
<P>
Forward Ivan Zamorano tried to head the ball home but the ball,
parried off by Taffarel, went onto Salas to head in.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilians responded two minutes later when Ronaldo netted his
second goal, this time breaking off from right before scoring.
</P>
<P>
Ronaldo could have scored two goals more had his shots in the 67th
and 85th minutes not hit the crossbar or post.
</P>
<P>
Chile's best chance came in the injury time but the curvy free kick
by Zamorano was saved by Taffarel.

<HEADLINE> Annan: Angola's Peace Process Should Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The peace process in Angola
must continue despite the plane crash in which his Special Envoy
to Angola Alioune Blondin Beye may have been killed, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to reports received from the United Nations Observer
Mission in Angola (MONUA), the United Nations plane transporting
the U.N. chief's Special Envoy for Angola Beye and five other
members of the MONUA together with two pilots crashed while
approaching the Abidjan airport at about 8 p.m local time Friday.
</P>
<P>
Access to the site of the crash was difficult and the rescue
team was slowly making its way to the crash. It has not seen any
survivors.
</P>
<P>
Beye left Luanda Friday on a visit to five African nations to
discuss the peace process in Angola, where the peace process has
been stalled and is in a crucial stage.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued through his spokesman's office, Annan
said, "Beye, who for several years has been spearheading the
implementation of the peace process in Angola, was traveling in
the region in yet another attempt to seek support of African
leaders in overcoming the present crisis in this war-torn
country."
</P>
<P>
"In this difficult time, I once again appeal to all Angolans,
in particular the Government of Unity and National Reconciliation
and the opposition UNITA movement, to continue to cooperate
closely with the United Nations and to bring the peace process to
the earliest conclusion," Annan said.
