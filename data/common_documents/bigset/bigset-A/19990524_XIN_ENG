<HEADLINE> Roundup: SPD's Rau Elected German President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 23 (Xinhua)--German Social Democrat (SPD) Johannes
Rau was elected as the country's eighth president by Sunday's
parliamentary session in the historic building of Reichstag in
Berlin.
</P>
<P>
Rau won the election at the second round ballot at which 690
lawmakers voted in favor. He had failed to gain the necessary 670
votes at first round.
</P>
<P>
Other two candidates, both women, were Dagmar Schipanski of
Germany's largest opposition, the conservative Christian
Democratic Union (CDU), and Uta Ranke-Heinemann of the left wing
Democratic Socialist Party (PDS).
</P>
<P>
Schipanski, a physician, had won 588 from 1333 valid votes in
the first round, while Ranke-Heinemann won 69, and Rau, 657. But
in the second round, some legislators voted in favor Rau.
</P>
<P>
Knowing his victory, Rau declared he would serve not only the
Germans, but also millions of foreigners living in Germany.
</P>
<P>
" I am president of all Germans but also the partner for
dialogue of all people living here without German passport," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Rau stressed the Germans must keep good relationship both with
the 7.3 million foreigners and with all neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
" I will never be a nationalist but rather a patriot," said
Rau, adding, " a patriot is someone who loves his motherland. A
nationalist is someone who despises others' motherlands."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Kosovo conflict, he said, "we are living in the
war time, and I wish this war will not last long." Rau announced
his support to NATO's air campaign against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
One of the first foreign state heads that congratulated Rau's
election was French President Jacques Chirac, who said he was
expecting to cooperate with Rau to promote the two countries'
friendship.
</P>
<P>
And his party boss and German Chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, said
Rau's election will bring Germans with great hopes, especially
those living in east Germany.
</P>
<P>
Rau, a moderate SPD politician and former Premier of the North
Rhine-Westphalia State who had been ruling for 20 years, will on
July 1 formally succeed the outgoing President Roman Herzog.
</P>
<P>
In Germany's political life, federal presidency is largely a
ceremonial role with most power be concentrated in the
chancellory.
</P>
<P>
But the prestige post does provide Rau with a key platform for
authority, since he is given the power to appoint chancellor and
veto legislations.
</P>
<P>
Rau, popular inside the party because of his ability to draw
opposing sides together, is well known as a joke-teller, a keen
christian and a Bible quote.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's election in Berlin, in which 669 lawmakers from the
lower chamber of Germany's parliament, Budestag, and the same
number of delegates from the country's 16 states took part,
coincided with the 50 th anniversary of Germany's Basic Law, the
country's constitution since 1949.
</P>
<P>
And Parliamentary president Wolfgang Thierse, who presided over
the assembly, depicted it as " the first election for a president
residing in Berlin."

<HEADLINE> AL Hails Positive Results of Khatami's Arab Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) has hailed the
positive results of Iranian President Mohammed Khatami's latest
visits to three Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued on Sunday, Arab League Secretary General
Esmat Abdel-Meguid said the league was following the positive
results of Khatami's visits to Syria, Saudi Arabia and Qatar.
</P>
<P>
The league viewed the visit as a confidence-building step,
which would lead to solid Arab-Iranian relations and serve mutual
interests, Abdel-Meguid said.
</P>
<P>
Khatami visited Syria, Saudi Arabia and Qatar on May 13-20 in a
bid to seek further promotion of relations or improved ties with
the three countries.
</P>
<P>
Damascus has been Tehran's long-time ally in the Arab world. It
supported Tehran during 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.
</P>
<P>
But ties between Iran and Gulf Arab countries, including Qatar
and Saudi Arabia have been tense for two decades due to Iran's
1979 Islamic Revolution, which Arab countries viewed as a threat.
And during the Iran-Iraq war, the Gulf nations sided with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iran's general relations with the Arab world have been eased
since Khatami took office in 1997. Khatami, a political moderate,
has repeated Tehran's readiness to end hostility and establish
mutual trust with Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid expressed hope that the Iranian authorities will
reflect on pending problems between Iran and Arab countries,
especially its territorial disputes with the United Arab Emirates
(UAE).
</P>
<P>
He called on Iran to respond to the stand of the Emirates and
the repeated Arab call to settle the dispute over three Gulf
islands peacefully in accordance with the international law.
</P>
<P>
Both Iran and the UAE have claimed sovereignty over the islands
of Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa near the strategic
Strait of Hormuz.
</P>
<P>
But the two countries have voiced willingness to solve the
problem through peaceful means. The UAE has proposed the disputes
be submitted to international arbitration while Iran prefers
bilateral talks.

<HEADLINE> Zambian President Calls for Financial Support for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
said here Sunday that his diplomatic shuttles to mediate a
peaceful solution to the nine-month war in the Democratic Republic
of Congo (DRC) has been costly and he will appreciate any
financial assistance for the peace mission.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for Kenyan capital Nairobi to attend the 4th
summit of the Common Market for the Eastern and Southern Africa
(COMESA) scheduled for Monday and Tuesday, Chiluba said that his
government has accumulated huge cost in travel expenses and other
activities related to the peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
The president, who was mandated one year ago by the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) to mediate a peaceful
settlement of the conflict in the DRC, expressed his appreciation
for the gesture of the European Union to off-set some of the
expenses.
</P>
<P>
In the past year, Chiluba shuttled frequently among the
countries concerned for an early end to the war in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
On the COMESA, the Zambian president said that COMESA member
states are moving very fast toward achieving a free trade area and
regional economic integration.
</P>
<P>
As the current chairman of the COMESA, Chiluba said that a
number of members have reduced their tariffs by 80 percent in a
bid to achieve zero tariffs by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Southern Africa will only achieve a meaningful economic growth
when a single bloc is integrated, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He also urged COMESA members to speed up their efforts to
strengthen their individual economies.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said the large economies like South Africa can create
more wealth in their partnership with the small ones.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Discusses Bilateral Ties With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
on Sunday discussed bilateral relations and regional developments
with Bahraini Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin Isa al-Khalifa in a telephone
conversation.
</P>
<P>
Khatami expressed satisfaction with the new atmosphere
prevailing between the two countries and called for expansion of
these ties, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope that the cordial relations between
the two nations would lead to the preservation of security in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president also underlined that the destiny of the
regional countries is interdependent. These countries can help
each other and cooperate in the future, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Bahraini emir termed the relations between Iran and
regional countries including Bahrain as very good.
</P>
<P>
Extending invitation to Khatami to visit Bahrain, Sheikh Hamad
said that the exchange of official visits is important in
expansion of bilateral ties and resolving outstanding issues
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Bahrain exchanged their ambassadors recently, some 30
months after the two countries downgraded their diplomatic ties
over an alleged pro-Iranian attempt to overthrow the Bahraini
government by force. Iran denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharazi visited Manama in
March, following the death of the former emir, Sheikh Isa Bin
Salman al-Khalifa, to convey Tehran's condolences.
</P>
<P>
Bahraini Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammad bin Mubarak
al-Khalifa paid his two-day landmark visit to Tehran earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Iran and its Gulf Arab neighbors have
improved after President Khatami came to power in August 1997.
</P>
<P>
Khatami visited Saudi Arabia and Qatar last week, the first
by an Iranian president since the Islamic revolution in
1979.

<HEADLINE> OAU Chairman Urges Africans to Display Collective </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Current chairman of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) and President of Burkina Faso,
Blaise Compaore has urged all Africans to display a collective
surge of energy.
</P>
<P>
In his message to African people issued here Sunday to mark the
36th anniversary of the African Liberation Day which falls on May
25, President Compaore said that the establishment of the OAU on
May 25, 1963 "wrote one of the most beautiful pages" in the
African history.
</P>
<P>
"Once independence was recovered, the dream consisted in
leaving the Africans alone with the exhilarating but noble
responsibility and heavy duty to change, with their own hands and
intelligency, Africa into a haven of peace, justice, solidarity,
prosperity and brotherhood," said Compaore
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "more than thirty years have elapsed since,
and the dream is yet to fulfill."
</P>
<P>
The OAU chairman pointed out that Africa's independence remains
very fragile in a world where those who have the military and
economic might lay down the law and rule over humanity.
</P>
<P>
"Africa is at the crossroads", he noted, adding that "all over
the continent unbridled crises, tensions and wars are erupting and
coming in the foreground in virtually all our states."
</P>
<P>
"At the dawn of the third millenium, I would therefore like to
fervently wish for a greater mobilization in Africa," he said.
</P>
<P>
"An Africa where justice, peace, development, democracy,
solidarity and prosperity, will no longer be concepts, but
palpable realities deeply rooted in our societies", he expected.

<HEADLINE> Barak Starts Formation of Coalition Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Israeli prime minister-elect Ehud
Barak spelt out the strategy for coalition talks Sunday, beginning
his drive to build a broad-based government with an aim of healing
internal rift and achieving national consensus on the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
His aides will begin talks first with parties that supported
him or remained neutral during the elections, and only afterwards
with other parties, according to the strategy laid down by Barak
during a meeting with his coalition negotiation team.
</P>
<P>
After the first round of talks with all the potential
coalition partners, Barak will publicize the guiding principles of
his government and invite those parties agreeing to the
principles to join the government, said David Liba'i, former
justice minister and head of the negotiation team.
</P>
<P>
Barak will have 45 days to form a coalition after the Central
Election Committee officially publicize the election results
Tuesday. His aides said he is in no rush to wrap up the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Unlike outgoing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who found it
difficult to cobble together even a narrow coalition after he
won the 1996 elections, Barak enjoys a luxury of riches: he has
several coalition models to choose after left and center parties
won a majority in the Knesset (parliament) elections.
</P>
<P>
But Barak has pledged after his landslide victory last Monday
that he will establish a coalition as broad-based as possible to
achieve national unity and a consensus in order to take tough
decisions on peace talks with the Palestinians and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Sources in his One Israel alliance have said that Barak is
seeking a coalition with at least 75 seats in the Knesset, backed
by another 10 from three Arab parties.
</P>
<P>
This indicated that the former army chief might include the
right-wing Likud party or the ultra-religious party Shas, or both
of them, in his coalition.
</P>
<P>
The Likud, a traditional counterbalance to the Labor in the
Knesset, suffered a crushing defeat in the elections, lost 13
seats from 32 in the outgoing Knesset.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Shas, a party of Middle East Jews, scored a
stunning victory, capturing 17 seats in the 120-member Knesset,
up from 10 last time and securing its position as the third
largest party after One Israel and the Likud.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, acting as temporary leader of
Likud after Netanyahu resigned his leadership following the
elections, convened Sunday Likud members in the next Knesset to
discuss the party's position in the coalition talks.
</P>
<P>
A majority of the party members, including Sharon himself,
agreed that the Likud should not reject a possible offer by Barak
to join a coalition. But Sharon asked the Likud members not to
express themselves publicly on this issue.
</P>
<P>
Sharon denied reports that he has been attempting to create a
right-wing bloc with other right-wing parties in the Knesset in
order to strengthen their positions in the coalition talks.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who did not attend the meeting, is expected to
announce his resignation from the Knesset later this week.
</P>
<P>
In a sign of strong opposition to a possible inclusion of Shas
in the next government, Israel Radio reported that Barak's office
was flooded Sunday with more than 20,000 e-mails which asked him
to exclude Shas out of any coalition he forms.
</P>
<P>
A maker and breaker of coalition governments for years, Shas
has been in the frontline in a heating-up cultural battle between
the religious and the secular.
</P>
<P>
Its spectacular showing in the elections was widely seen as a
powerful support by low-income Israelis for the party's leader,
Aryeh Deri, who was sentenced to four years in jail last month
for corruption and fraud.
</P>
<P>
The left-wing party Meretz, a natural coalition partner of One
Israel, and Shinui, a new secular party that won six seats on a
platform against ultra-Orthodox control of public life, have said
that they would not sit in any coalition with Shas so long as
Deri could call the shots.
</P>
<P>
In a move seen as an attempt to boost Shas' chances of
entering Barak's coalition, Deri announced his resignation from
parliament one day after the elections, but said he would stay on
as chairman of the party.
</P>
<P>
In response, Barak said that he will not deal with Shas so
long as Deri could still control the party from behind the scene.
</P>
<P>
Some of his senior aides, however, said that Deri's move has
cleared the way for Shas to enter the coalition talks.
</P>
<P>
"While the party (One Israel) must be aware of the feeling of
its anti-Shas supporters, it must deal with the issue of unity,"
said Shlomo Ben-Ami, a senior Labor Knesset member.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that Barak might bring Shas into his coalition
on condition that Deri totally resigns from its leadership and
the party agrees to put its educational and welfare networks
under the control of the government.
</P>
<P>
But Barak has kept his cards close to his chest. Before his
meeting with President Ezer Weizman Sunday, the first since the
elections, he was asked by reporters if he would include Shas in
his government, but he walked away with the president without
giving an answer.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps
(IRGC) on Sunday launched the main stage of Jerusalem military
exercise at Houweizeh, the southwestern Khuzestan province.
</P>
<P>
An IRGC command Brigadier General Rahim Noui-Aqdam said that
the troops equipped with heavy armors and tanks infiltrated the
territory of the hypothetical enemy, suppressed the enemy movement
and reached the targets.
</P>
<P>
He said that modern armors, tanks, personnel-carriers and
parachutists brought at the theater carried out the main stage of
the exercise, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Noui-Aqdam said the Iranian forces carried reconnaissance
missions and clean-up operation against the hypothetical enemy's
chemical attack as well as firing anti-aircraft machine guns.
</P>
<P>
He said that columns of the infantry and armored troops are
scheduled to move toward the border city of Khorramshahr on
Monday to mark the anniversary of the liberation of the strategic
city in 1982.
</P>
<P>
The commander noted that the military exercises were being held
to commemorate those killed in the operation to liberate
Khorramshahr from the Iraqi forces and to boost the preparedness
of the IRGC troops.
</P>
<P>
He said that the exercises were being held in an area of 250
square kilometers in three stages. However, he did not mention how
many troops were involved in the maneuver.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Two Iraqi people were injured
on Sunday in U.S. and British warplanes attacks on civilian
facilities in northern Iraq, an Iraqi military spokesman
announced.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at 10:30 (0630 GMT), 12 formations
of enemy warplanes coming from Turkish airspace violated northern
Iraqi airspace over Dohuk, Neineva and Erbil provinces.
</P>
<P>
The enemy formations attacked civilian facilities and some
military sites in this region, injuring two civilians, said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi anti-aircraft units fired back and forced the enemy
planes to flee at 13:35 (0935 GMT), he added.
</P>
<P>
Enemy warplanes also violated southern Iraqi airspace at
10:10 (0610 GMT) and 17:00 (1300 GMT) when 34 formations
coming from Saudi and Kuwaiti bases flew over Basra, Thi-Qar,
Muthana and Misan provinces, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Since the U.S. and Britain launched four nights of airstrikes
against Iraq last December, their warplanes have been regularly
attacking Iraqi military and civilian targets, causing severe
civilian casualties and property damages.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies imposed the no-fly zones in
Iraq following the 1991 Gulf War with a claimed aim of
protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in
the south from "Baghdad's suppression."
</P>
<P>
Iraq has declared that it does not recognize these
restricted zones and vowed to continue confronting any allied
plane violating its airspace.

<HEADLINE> Angola Deregulates Foreign Exchange Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Angola has abandoned its 25-year old
fixed exchange rate system and adopt a free floating exchange
rate, which will take effect from Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Aguinaldo Jaime, governor of the Angolan National Bank, the
central bank of the country, said Saturday night the government
gave up the fixed rate because it has almost run out of foreign
exchange reserve and was no longer able to maintain the fixed
rate.
</P>
<P>
The governor said the central bank will deregulate the foreign
exchange rate and the rate will be determined by the market alone.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the official exchange rate was 710,000 Kwanza to
one U.S. dollar while at the black market one dollar could buy two
million Kwanza.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, most of Angola's foreign exchange and local currency
had gone to the black market.
</P>
<P>
Jaime noted that the in the medium and long run, the country's
economy will "benefit from the floating rate," because banks can
buy the urgently-needed foreign exchanges and encourage savings in
local currency Kwanza.
</P>
<P>
More importantly, the governor said, the banks will hence be
able to finance the development projects in the war-torn southern
African country.
</P>
<P>
Angola had adopted fixed exchange rate system ever since it won
 independence in 1975.
</P>
<P>
The prolonged civil war has made the Angolan government's
military spending soaring up. while the low prices in the
international crude oil market has made its major foreign exchange
income decreased by one third.
</P>
<P>
At the end of last year, Angola fell in the most serious
financial crisis in its history.

<HEADLINE> Profile:Johannes Rau, from Apprentice to German President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 23 (Xinhua)--Never completing his high school
education and beginning his career as an apprentice with a
publishing house, Social Democrat (SPD) Johannes Rau was elected
as Germany's eighth Federal President Sunday in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
Rau, 68, had been governing Germany's largest state, North
Rhine-Westphalia, for 20 years as State Premier before he resigned
last year and then entered national political stage.
</P>
<P>
Born in the industrial city of Wuppertal, west Germany, and the
son of a pastor, Rau had worked 14 years (1954-1967) for a
theological publishing company. Then, since 1958, he began his
career as an SPD politician, and was elected as leader of the
city's SPD youth movement.
</P>
<P>
During 1964 to 1967 Rau served as Wuppertal's SPD party chief,
and two years later he was elected as the city mayor, his first
major post. Nine years after entering SPD's national executive
circle in 1968, Rau became the party's state leader.
</P>
<P>
Rau, coming from SPD's more moderate wing and a well known
joke-teller, has a nickname of "Brother Johannes" because he
quotes the Bible for every occasion.
</P>
<P>
He owns the ability to draw opposing sides together and to
defuse conflict, Rau's party friends said.
</P>
<P>
Acknowledged as a pro-business leader, Rau has linked his name
with a set of structure reforms to help Nord Rhine-Westphalia's
declining mining and coal sectors after he elected as the state's
premier in 1978.
</P>
<P>
Rau sticks to SPD's ideal of solidarity with weaker members of
society, but this belief is linked to a firm insistence on
pragmatic solutions but not utopian illusions, said one of
Germany's most influential newspapers, Frankfurter Allgeimeine.
</P>
<P>
Before taking part in the presidential election, Rau had twice
contended for posts as national leader.
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Rau, as SPD candidate for German Federal Chancellor,
was defeated by Helmut Kohl. Seven years later he was again
defeated by Roman Herzog, now the outgoing President, in the
federal presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Rau astonished the media and even his close friends in 1982,
when he, long being a bachelor, announced to marry the
granddaughter of ex-President Gustav Heinemann. At that time he
was 51 years old and she was 26. Now the family has three
children.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 23 (Xinhua)--German Social Democrat (SPD) Johannes
Rau was elected as the country's President by Sunday's
parliamentary session in the historic building of Reichstag in
Berlin.
</P>
<P>
Rau won the election at the second round ballot at which 690
lawmakers voted in favor. He had failed to gain the necessary 670
votes at first round.

Democratic Socialist Party (PDS).
</P>
<P>
Schipanski, a physician, had won 588 from 1333 votes in the
first round, while Ranke-Heinemann won 69, and Rau, 657. But in

</P>
<P>
Rau, a moderate SPD politician and former Premier of the North
Rhine-Westphalia State who had been ruling for 20 years, will on

opposing sides together, is well known as a joke-teller, a keen
christian and a Bible quote.
</P>
<P>

anniversary of Germany's Basic Law, the country's constitution
since 1949.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President Leaves for COMESA Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
left here Sunday evening for Kenyan capital Nairobi to attend the
4th summit of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa
(COMESA).
</P>
<P>
A press release issued by the President's Office said that the
president was seen off by Vice-President Specioza Kazibwe at the
Entebbe International Airport.
</P>
<P>
The two-day summit opens in Nairobi Monday to deliberate on
trade issues within the 21 member countries of the regional trade
bloc with a view to achieving zero tariff trade by October 31,
2000.
</P>
<P>
The summit follows a three-day 7th meeting of the COMESA
Council of Ministers which began Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The COMESA, set up in 1994, is aiming to realize complete
regional economic integration.
</P>
<P>
The regional trade bloc with a population of 380 million people
and a gross domestic product (GDP) of 155 billion U.S. dollars is
a potential big market.
</P>
<P>
However, its exports valued only 23 billion dollars in 1998,
accounting for less than 0.45 percent of the world's total.
</P>
<P>
The COMESA is trying to promote trade in and outside the
sub-region in a bid to play its role in the globalization in the
new millenium.

<HEADLINE> Clinton OKs Plan to Destabilize Milosevic - Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 23 (Xinhua) - U.S. President Bill Clinton has
approved a top-secret plan to destabilize Yugoslav leader Slobodan
Milosevic, using computer hackers to attack his foreign bank
accounts and a sabotage campaign to erode his public support,
Newsweek magazine reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The magazine, in its May 23 edition, quoted sources as saying
Clinton issued an intelligence "finding" allowing the Central
Intelligence Agency to find "ways to get at Milosevic."
</P>
<P>
The finding would permit the CIA to train ethnic Albanian
rebels in Kosovo in the art of sabotage, including such tricks as
cutting telephone lines, fouling gasoline reserves and pilfering
food supplies, the magazine said.
</P>
<P>
The CIA also was instructed to wage a cyberwar against
Milosevic, using computer hackers to tap into the Yugoslav
president's foreign bank accounts, the magazine said.
</P>
<P>
Newsweek said other NATO allies were not to be told about the
secret war.
</P>
<P>
The Senate and House of Representatives intelligence committees
were briefed on the decision, Newsweek said. Some lawmakers
criticized the finding, questioning the legality and wisdom of
launching a risky covert action, the magazine said.
</P>
<P>
"If they pull it off, it will be great," Newsweek quoted one
government cyberwar expert as saying. "If they screw it up, they
are going to be in a world of trouble."
</P>
<P>
Sen. Joseph Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat, told the
television program "Fox News Sunday" he thought a cyberspace war
against the Yugoslav leader was "totally acceptable."
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't be surprised if we were using it here as part of an
effort to bring the war in Kosovo home to the people, the
civilians in Belgrade, so that they pressure Milosevic to break
and make an agreement with NATO," he said.

<HEADLINE> Iran Rejects Taliban Accusation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Sunday rejected an
accusation by the Afghan Taliban militia that it was involved in a
recent rebellion in Herat city, western Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi said such a
groundless accusation is designed to divert the public opinion and
justify the continued crisis in Afghanistan, the Islamic Republic
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban authorities on Saturday accused Iran of organizing
the ethnic Hazaras in Herat to fight against the Taliban and urged
Tehran to stop intervention in Afghan affairs.
</P>
<P>
"Members of the group were not Hazaras alone, there were
other people among them too, organized by Iran," a Taliban
spokesman said after the militia suppressed the rebellion.
</P>
<P>
However, the Iranian spokesman said Iran has been urging the
warring factions in Afghanistan to hold talks in order to settle
their dispute and set up a broad-based government consisting of
all ethnic and religious groups.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Republic of Iran has expressed its readiness to
help find a solution to the Afghan crisis and preserve the
independence and territorial integrity of Afghanistan, Asefi said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman expressed regret over the continuation
of conflicts, war and bloodshed in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Taliban lodged a protest to Iran for
launching a military incursion into Afghanistan's western provinces.
But Iran denied the accusation.
</P>
<P>
However, the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps later
announced that its forces smashed two Afghan groups and killed
30 members in recent armed clashes in the Torbat-e Jam region,
the northeastern province of Khorasan, which borders Afghanistan.

<P>
BONN, May 23 (Xinhua)--Seven people have possibly been killed
in floods after days of heavy rain over the Alpine region that
covers southern Germany, northern Austria and Switzerland, more
were missing and thousands were affected, German authorities said
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Two German boot drivers were feared drowned. They had been
missing since Saturday night when their boots had been swept by
roaring rivers.
</P>
<P>
In Germany's southern sate of Bavaria, two pensioners,
respectively 87 and 75 years old, have been found dead after they
had been trapped in flooded cellars.
</P>
<P>
A fifth German, a holidaymaker, was killed in a landslide in
Switzerland. And in Austria, two people were reportedly killed in
floods and mountain slides.
</P>
<P>
Some 100,000 people in Bavaria are affected by the floods,
local officials estimated.
</P>
<P>
"It is a flood of century," said Bavarian Interior Minister
Guenter Beckstein. He said the region was in a state of
"extraordinary emergency".
</P>
<P>
Lake Constance rose to a century high of 5.63 meter, while
other lakes and rivers in central and southern Germany also hit
record heights. Many cities in the region have sounded a
catastrophe alarm.
</P>
<P>
Mud slides blocked roads and railways between Germany and
Austria, and in some areas even power supplies were cut off. Local
motorists are busy seeking alternative means of transport.
</P>
<P>
But the worst was over, said meteorologists of the German
Weather Service. They forecast a dry spell, which will begin on
this Monday and will let the floods run off.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Arms Group Denies to Sell Weapons to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 23 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's state-owned
arms manufacturer, Denel, Sunday denied that it would market
weapons to Libya, South African Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
"We are not going there to sell arms, we are going there to
sell South Africa," Denel chief executive officer, Max Sisulu,
said in an interview before going with a high-profile trade
delegation to Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
The CEO said that South Africa's world class equipment for
clearing landmines, is among the products he would be punting in
Libya, where thousands of landmines planted during the second
world war posed a serious problem.
</P>
<P>
Libya was in any event not that interested in acquiring arms,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The delegation led by Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin
includes a number of the country's leading businessmen who are
hoping to secure contracts worth billions of U.S. dollars which
are up for grabs since the suspension of U.N. sanctions against
Libya.
</P>
<P>
This follows Libya's hand-over of two men suspected of the 1988
bombing of a Pan American flight over Lockerbie in Scotland for
trial in the Netherlands, a settlement which South Africa helped
broker.
</P>
<P>
Libya has revealed plans to invest considerable sums of money
in water supply and transport projects, but analysts were unaware
of it being in the market for significant quantities of new arms.
</P>
<P>
Denel comprised 22 companies which sold a wide range of other
high-tech equipment, including soya bean products, plastics, money
counters and information technology, said Sisulu.

Togo's Foreign Minister Joseph Kokou Koffigoh had met the

OTTAWA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Canada announced Sunday that a
parliamentary delegation will travel to Austin, Texas State of the
U.S., on May 25 to intercede with key officials in the case of
Joseph Stanley Faulder, a Canadian who is scheduled to be executed
on June 17.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentarians will seek executive clemency for Mr.
Faulder from the State of Texas. The Canadian government believes
that Faulder's rights were violated when state officials failed to
notify him of his right to contact Canadian consular officials at
the time of his arrest.
</P>
<P>
"Access by Canadian consular officials to Canadians who have
been arrested by foreign governments is an important and
fundamental principle of international law--which in his case was
not respected," said Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd
Axworthy in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The three-MPs delegation will meet with a number of state
officials, including the chairman of the Texas Board of Pardons
and Paroles, the Secretary of State of Texas, and the Deputy
Attorney General for Criminal Justice.
</P>
<P>
Faulder, 61, was convicted of killing a 75-year-old East Texas
woman 23 years ago.

<HEADLINE> Lott: U.S. Senate Rejects Ground War Against Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate will reject the
use of American ground troops to fight Serb forces, but consider
backing plans for a non-combat deployment to help Kosovo refugees
return home, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Lott said the air war's mistakes unfairly are blemishing the
U.S. military, which he said has been sent on a mission in
Yugoslavia that air power alone cannot win.
</P>
<P>
As NATO's bombing against Yugoslavia enters a third month, the
alliance has flown about 26,000 sorties over Yugoslavia, and about
15,000 bombs or missiles. NATO Claimed that its mistake rate is
less than one percent.
</P>
<P>
Lott, appearing on CBS's program, said the bombing is hurting
U.S. prestige.
</P>
<P>
"Quite frankly, these little boo-boos, where you're hitting a
KLA (Kosovol Liberation Army) headquarters, where you're killing
innocent citizens, I think is hurting the image of the military,
which is unfair," Lott said.
</P>
<P>
Lott said Congress should "be supportive of the
(airstrikes-only) decision, now that the decision has been made,
and hope for the best. Absolutely. But I am very dubious about the
likelihood for success just with bombing."
</P>
<P>
Lott made it clear that he opposes sending ground troops to
Kosovo in a combat mode.
</P>
<P>
"If you're talking about fighting their way in there,
absolutely not," Lott said. "The president has repeatedly told the
American people that we would not use ground troops in a combat
mode there."

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Reaffirms Commitment to Free </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
reaffirmed COMESA's determination to meet its deadline for the
establishment of a " free trade zone" by October 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Moi, the current chairman of the Common Market for Eastern and
Southern African (COMESA), said at the opening ceremony of the
Fourth COMESA Summit in Nairobi that "we should endeavor to honor
the time-table we have so painstakingly worked out for the
realization of a COMESA free trade area by October 31, 2000."
</P>
<P>
The president told the two-day summit, which is attended by 12
heads of government and senior officials from 21 COMESA member
states, that the realization of this objective calls for
commitment as well as sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
According to the African trade body's objectives, all tariff
and non- tariff barriers to trade among its member countries will
be removed by October 31, 2000, and a common external tariff will
be introduced by 2004.
</P>
<P>
Moi said the implementation of this goal has cost implications
on the economies of the member countries. "The governments will
have to forfeits the right to levy taxes on goods imported from
COMESA member countries," he added.
</P>
<P>
The president also stressed, "these are some of the short-term
sacrifices we must make."
</P>
<P>
The out-going COMESA chairman and Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba also reaffirmed the trade bloc's commitment by saying,"a
firm foundation is already being laid for its smooth introduction
and operation."
</P>
<P>
Many observers are sceptical about the objective of the African
sub- regional organization, since there are about one third of its
member countries are still involved in regional or civil
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
COMESA covers a vast area of about 13 million square
kilometers with a population of 380 million, its gross domestic
product is only 165 billion U.S. dollars which is about that of a
small European country like Belgium.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian president revealed that 14 COMESA member states
have reduced 60 percent of their tariffs and 10 countries have
reduced tariffs by 80 percent.

<HEADLINE> Trade Objectives Can't Be Realized Without Peace, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 24 (Xinhua) --  Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
said the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA)
can not realize its goal of free trade in the region without
peace.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the Fourth COMESA summit
held in Nairobi Monday, Moi said, "we can not talk meaningfully
about improving the standards of living of out people when brother
is rising against brother."
</P>
<P>
Moi, who was elected COMESA chairman replacing out-going
chairman, Zambian President Frederick Chiluba, said that "we can
not strengthen trade between us when wars are destroying
productivity, neither can we improve the well-being of our people
when political instability continues to force thousands of people
to suffer as refugees in neighboring countries."
</P>
<P>
Moi said that the maintenance of peace and security is a
critical ingredient in the trade body's efforts to ensure the
social and economic development in the region.
</P>
<P>
"As we discuss these important issues regarding trade, we must
also make our contributions in addressing the need to strengthen
peace in our region."" Moi said.
</P>
<P>
The two-day summit is attended by 12 head of states of the
regional bloc, including Laurent kabila, President of the war-torn
Democratic Republic of Congo, "
</P>
<P>
Almost one third of the 21-ember regional bloc, like the
Democratic Republic of Congo, Uganda, Rwanda, Namibia ,Zimbabwe,
Ethiopia and Eritrea, are involved in military conflicts in the
region, which makes it hard for COMESA to realize its objectives.

<P>
COMESA is aiming to realize a full free trade area guaranteeing
the free movement of goods and services produced within COMESA and
the adoption of a common visa arrangements in the regional group.
</P>
<P>
Moi also urged COMESA countries to reduce expenditure on arms
imports which only serve to create employment and increased
incomes for arms manufacturers in distant lands, Moi said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Police Repatriate Ghana Citizen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Public Security
disclosed today that Chinese police have repatriated Aciieampong,
a citizen of the Republic of Ghana, who attempted to smuggle
himself into Canada via China.
</P>
<P>
On March 11, Aciieampong was stopped by border inspection
officials at the Yantai Airport in east China's Shandong Province
for possession of fake credentials.
</P>
<P>
Police later found that the 37-year-old man, who was
dissatisfied with his poor life in Ghana, had left his hometown
with 3,000 U.S. dollars of family savings and loans.
</P>
<P>
He arrived in Hong Kong last October as a tourist and stayed
there for three months before he obtained a fake United States
passport.
</P>
<P>
Aciieampong planed to enter Canada via Yantai and the Republic
of Korea, but was unexpectedly stopped as soon as he arrived at
the Yantai Airport.
</P>
<P>
He could not return to his hometown as he had spent all his
money in Hong Kong and given his own passport to an accomplice
before his departure from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Chinese police provided free board and lodging and clothes and
medical service for him while his case was under review, in
accordance with the law. After 48 days of efforts, Chinese police
reached an agreement with their counterparts in Ghana and sent
Aciieampong home on April 26.

<HEADLINE> Greece, China Stand for Political Solution of Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Both Greece and China believe that
the solution to the Kosovo crisis must be a diplomatic and
political one, and diplomatic efforts must be intensified for a
quick resolution, Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou said
here this evening.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou made the remarks at a press conference prior to his
departure for the United States from the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
Greece shares much in common with China in its desire for a
political solution of the Kosovo crisis, said the Greek foreign
minister, who arrived here Sunday for a two-day working visit.
</P>
<P>
Before visiting Beijing, Papandreou visited Belgium, France,
Finland, and Russia, to further diplomatic efforts.
</P>
<P>
During Papandreou's stay in Beijing, he met with Chinese Vice
Premier Qian Qichen and Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan to
discuss the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
"We discussed the Kosovo crisis extensively and exchanged views,
" he said, adding that both governments believe there must be a
solution which respects the territorial integrity and sovereignty
of Yugoslavia and the democratic rights of ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
He said that he also discussed some details of a possible
solution to the crisis and other Balkan issues including
reconstruction,as well as the relationship between China and the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
China and Greece have warm relations, Papandreou said, adding
that China has an important voice in world affairs as a permanent
member of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"China also wants to contribute in a constructive way as much
as possible to peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Greek foreign minister also expressed the deepest sorrow
for the three Chinese innocent victims of NATO's attack on the
Chinese embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
He said he understood the desire of the Chinese government to
receive a clear and in-depth answer to the incident.

<HEADLINE> Appeal From a Belgrade Pediatric Surgeon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Six brand-new incubators were idle
while four new-born babies were crying weakly with two nurses
looking on in between them without much assistance.
</P>
<P>
Electricity was out for already 10 hours in a run.
</P>
<P>
The University Children's Hospital of Belgrade was without
electricity after NATO warplanes bombed the country's power supply
system outside the capital city over the past two days.
</P>
<P>
The babies were not the only ones affected by the black-out, 84
others were also affected in the hospital, including children
patients of meningitis, leukaemia, serious bone fracture.
</P>
<P>
With 400 beds, the only specially-designed children's hospital
in the capital city now could only manage a daily admission of 10
children compared with 45 before NATO air raids started on March
24. The hospital could now operate on 2 patients instead of on 35
previously, all due to the lack of normal electricity supply.
</P>
<P>
Dusan Scepanovic, general director of the hospital and a senior
professor of pediatric surgery, appealed to the NATO
secretary-general and the United Nations secretary-general for an
immediate stop of NATO bombing against the country's power supply
system.
</P>
<P>
"Electricity and electrically-supported water supply to
hospital are like air to human beings," said the professor. He
would like to know any of his peers in either the United States or
Britain who can continue operating on patients without electricity
or water.
</P>
<P>
Not only operations, medical equipment that needs electricity
and water cannot function normally in the hospital. Bone marrow
transplant, plasma transfusion and one hundred and one other
medical treatments are run on electricity, he said.
</P>
<P>
Scepanovic is now the one who has to decide which children
patients can be operated on the next day but it is to him more
like a judge on life-and-death matters than the routine to a
doctor.
</P>
<P>
"We doctors here can no longer take the responsibility to take
care of all the children patients like this," he said, "The NATO
and the United Nations have to take this responsibility."

<P>
He noted that after tremendous changes occurred in Eastern
European countries, China respected the choice of the Bulgarian
people according to the principle of non-interference in other
country's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
"China values friendship between the two countries and two
peoples, and maintaining bilateral cooperative ties conforms to
the aspirations and fundamental interests of the two peoples," Li
added.
</P>
<P>
China would like long-term, stable, and friendly ties with
Bulgaria on the basis of mutual-respect, equality, and mutual-
benefit, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li reiterated China's stand on the Kosovo issue, saying it is a
well-acknowledged norm of international relations that the
internal affairs of a sovereign country brook no interference  by
others.
</P>
<P>
The bombing by U.S.-led NATO of Yugoslavia is an act of
hegemony that disregards international law, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Halting the airstrikes is the prerequisite for a political
solution to the Kosovo issue, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the NATO attack on the Chinese embassy in Belgrade,
Li said that the peace-loving Chinese people can never tolerate
any infringement on the sovereignty and dignity of their country.
</P>
<P>
U.S.-led NATO must take full responsibility for the incident,
and make a serious response to the solemn requests of the Chinese
government, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Sokolov said that Bulgaria has always regarded China as a friend
and values China's important role in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
He noted that all parties in Bulgaria agree to seek friendly
ties with China, therefore, no matter which party is ruling,
Bulgaria will adhere to the One China policy and remain committed
to bilateral friendship.
</P>
<P>
He cited China as an important force in safeguarding world
peace, saying that as a permanent member of the UN Security
Council, China should play a key role in a peaceful solution of
the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Sokolov is here at the invitation of Li.

<TEXT>
<P>
"The great shift is also the fundamental reason for the rapid
development of our country and the remarkable improvement of our
people's lives," the editorial adds.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, it says, taking economic development as the central
task all the time is the key to the resolution of all problems
China now faces.
</P>
<P>
"We must focus on economic development while handling both
domestic and international issues. Even if we're involved in a
large-scale war, we must remember to go back to economic
development as soon as the war is over," it elaborates.
</P>
<P>
The editorial goes on to say that in order to pursue economic
development, the entire Chinese people must be closely united and
work hard together for the same goal.
</P>
<P>
"We must combine all strength, wisdom and talents of the whole
Party and people of various ethnic groups across the country to
promote the development of our productive forces," it says.
</P>
<P>
It points out that hostile forces both inside and outside China
will never feel happy to see a strongly united and increasingly
powerful China, and that they will try every means to "westernize"
China and throw the Chinese people into a state of chaos and
disunity, just like "a sheet of loose sand".
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people must keep on the high alert and never get
fooled, urges the editorial.
</P>
<P>
"We must seize all opportunities, press ahead despite various
difficulties, meet the challenge of hegemonism and power politics
with a steady growth of our comprehensive national strength and
usher in a new century of peace and development," the editorial
concludes.

<HEADLINE> Barak Starts Efforts to Form Coalition Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister-elect
Ehud Barak's negotiating team on Monday held a meeting with
leaders of the left-wing Meretz Party in efforts to form a
broad-based coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said the meeting focused on the policy of the
new government, but not on the distribution of the portfolios.
</P>
<P>
David Libai, head of the negotiating team, asked Meretz not to
be hesitative in joining a wide coalition.
</P>
<P>
However, Meretz representatives stressed the coalition
government should not include the religious Shas Party. Meretz
has insisted that it will not join a government with Shas.
</P>
<P>
In the May 17 parliamentary and prime minister elections, Shas,
which represents the ultra-orthodox Jews of Middle East and North
African origin, won 17 seats in the 120-member Knesset
(parliament), and Meretz garnered 10 seats.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Meretz also submitted a list of demands, which
includes an end to the expansion of Jewish settlements in the
occupied territories and the resumption of the peace talks with
Syria and Lebanon, which was stalled in early 1996.
</P>
<P>
Meretz demanded that the negotiations with Syria be resumed
from where they were left off in 1996 under Israel's former Labor
government.
</P>
<P>
The then labor government has accepted the principle of
returning much of the Golan Heights in exchange for security
guarantees and a full peace treaty with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Barak won a landslide victory over outgoing Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu in the May 17 elections. And he has 45 days to
form a coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Barak's negotiating team is due to finish the first round of
talks with all the parties this week.
</P>
<P>
Afterwards, Barak and his negotiators are to draw up guidelines
for the new government before continuing coalition talks with
concerned parties.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Africa Seeks for Debt Cancellation (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- A movement for a complete
cancellation of unpayable debt on billions of people is unfolding
as African countries celebrating Africa Freedom Day on May 25.
</P>
<P>
Highly indebted African countries are seeking a new freedom
from the burden as they enter the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
The just-ended regional conference titled "Toward an African
consensus on sustainable solutions to the debt problem" concluded
here by adopting the Lusaka declaration, which urged African
countries to undertake a plan of action leading to debt
cancellation and determine their own development path.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from ten African countries attended the
conference.
</P>
<P>
According to a human development report released by the United
Nations Development Program (UNDP) at the conference, at least 33
countries in Africa are faced with a crippling debt problem that
is now widely acknowledged and for which sustainable solutions are
being sought and worked out.
</P>
<P>
It is also widely accepted that these countries are
experiencing high levels of poverty that need to be addressed.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that sub-Sahara African countries are at the
bottom of human development index. About 260 million people in
the region are subsisting on less than one U.S. dollar per day,
half of the children are not in school, life expectancy is the
lowest in the world at 53 years, infrastructure is dilapidated and
the share of Africa's trade in the world economy had declined from
3.1 percent achieved around the time of independence in the 1960's
to 1.2 percent in 1990's.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a large debt burden motivates a lot of poor
countries to lower labor standards as they engage in a desperate
struggle to attract foreign investment and thereby earn enough
"hard currency" from export revenues to repay foreign debt. That
leads to lower wages and growing poverty around Africa.
</P>
<P>
Each day the poorest countries transfer 717 million dollars in
debt serving to the richest countries, the UNDP said.
</P>
<P>
In order to repay foreign debts, many poor countries are being
forced to direct scarce government resources away from the health
care, education and other vital services.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP estimates that debt serving payments Africa makes
could, if re-directed to expenditure on health care, save the
lives of seven million people a year.
</P>
<P>
Zambia, for instance, spends 200 million dollars annually on
debt servicing, and is likely to be faced with over 600 million
annual debt servicing bills after the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The result has been to deny many children the chance to go to
school, women access to pre-natal care, HIV-infected persons
access to counseling and treatment, and small farmers access to
credit and technical assistance.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, the people of Zambia, considering its
population of about 10 million, the immense debt burden means that
every woman, man and child owes 650 dollars to international
creditors.
</P>
<P>
Following independence, the proportion of gross national
product (GNP) Zambia devoted to education was one of the highest
in Africa. But now, it is one of the lowest.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique is one of the countries holding the lowest
development indicators in the world. Two-thirds of Mozambican
people live below the poverty line. Yet, it carries a burden of
5.6 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Every year, a quarter of export earning in Mozambique goes to
debt service, the same with the government's revenues. This is
only a third of what the government should be paying. The
scheduled debt service in the period of 1995-1998 averaged 375
dollars per capita. The government only managed to pay 113
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Africa's main creditors are the world's wealthiest nations,
such as the United States, France and Germany. Other important
creditors include the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the
World Bank, which are controlled primarily by the world's rich
nations. Regional development banks and many commercial banks
also have loans to poor nations.
</P>
<P>
Debt arises from credit and aid is a grant. However, there has
been some strange relationship between the two. It has been
observed that the amount of official aid rarely exceeds that of
debt repayments. In some cases donor countries collect more from
countries than they give to them in aid.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, sovereign rights of African countries have been
greatly compromised due to the debt situation. And the various
wars being fought on the African continent are increasing the debt
situation.
</P>
<P>
There is clear consensus that poverty is a problem in Africa
and that the current debt problem plays a significant role in
preventing its eradication. The cause of the debt problem is
shared by both the debtor and creditor. However, it has become a
tool for some creditors to exercise control over African
countries.

<HEADLINE> Filipinos Demonstrate Against VFA Outside Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,000 Filipino peasants,
workers and students rallied in front of the Philippine Senate
Monday afternoon against the Visiting Force Agreement (VFA) that
would allow the resumption of military exercises with U.S. troops
in the country.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators held flags and chanted "Junk VFA," "Kill and
Burn VFA" and other anti-American slogans.
</P>
<P>
Some demonstrators threw stones toward policemen and the
Marines in front of the gate of the senate.
</P>
<P>
A worker from Gelmart Industries Philippines said, "Before
Americans come, the Philippines don't have enemy; after they come,
we have."
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Peace and Solidarity Council, one of the
organizers of the demonstration, said in an open letter to the
senate that the VFA "will not only aggravate the present strife
among our people, but will also sow discord within our region."
</P>
<P>
The letter said the VFA is not even in the interest of
President Joseph Estrada's administration, because "the return of
U.S. forces in our country will be like having a gun leveled again
at the head of any Philippine regime."
</P>
<P>
Inside the senate building, Senator Raul Roco said the VFA
"will deny the Filipino equal protection of the law in his own
land" and "there has been no cogent or valid reason given to
accept such an oppressive situation."
</P>
<P>
The VFA, signed by former President Ramos' administration and
the U.S. government, must have the support of at least 16 of the
23 senators for it to pass.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, three senators -- Teofisto Guingona Jr., Serge
Osmena III and Raul Roco -- have expressed their objection to the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Military ties between the Philippines and the United States
have remained sensitive since the Philippine Senate forced the
closure of the last U.S. base in the country in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The senate vote on the VFA was originally scheduled for May 17,
but it has been postponed three times because of strong objection.
The new voting date is May 27, but an official in the senate said
it might be postponed again.

<HEADLINE> China, Greece Seek Political Solution to Kosovo Issue (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He pointed out that the U.S.-led NATO bombing of Yugoslavia has
caused the greatest humanitarian disaster in Europe, not only
harming security in the Balkans, but also disturbing global peace
and stability.
</P>
<P>
China has always held that the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of Yugoslavia should be respected and the legal rights
of all ethic groups in Kosovo, including those of the Albanian, be
guaranteed, he noted.
</P>
<P>
China has condemned the U.S.-led NATO attack against Yugoslavia
and has demanded that NATO stop bombing at once and bring the
Kosovo issue back to the track of a political solution, he said.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that a political solution will not be possible
unless the bombing ends, and China will not agree with the idea
that the UN discuss a political resolution while the bombing is
still going on.
</P>
<P>
He said that the UN Security Council cannot impose a political
solution on a sovereign state without that state's approval.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led NATO's attack at the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia
severely violated China's sovereignty and roughly trampled on the
norms of international law. U.S.-led NATO should take the Chinese
government's solemn demands seriously and give a satisfactory
reply to the Chinese people, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
China is willing to maintain close consultation and
coordination with Greece on the Kosovo crisis and other
international issues, he said.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Ends Weaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar weakened
Monday, caving into a host of negative factors including gold,
commodities, the Japanese yen and the uncertainty over the future
of the government's goods and services tax (GST) proposal.
</P>
<P>
At the close Monday the Australian dollar was at 65.65 U.S.
cents from 66.13 U.S. cents at Friday's close, having traded
between 65.57 and 65.86 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
Nick Volanakis, treasury manager at Colonial State Bank, said
the Australian dollar was sustaining a corrective move amid some
short-term negative influences.
</P>
<P>
"It's a combined thing -- weak yen, weak commodities, weak
gold, still no GST resolution," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was besieged by profit taking and poor
commodity prices on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Prices for copper, lead, zinc and aluminum were lower on the
London Metal Exchange on Friday while gold was again in sight of
20-year lows.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar also closed at 0.6215 euro from 0.6245
euro Friday and 81.39 Japanese yen from 81.86 yen.

<HEADLINE> Greece Asks NATO to Temporarily Stop Transiting Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Greece has asked the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) to temporarily stop transiting the
alliance troops from the northern Greek port of Thessaloniki to
neighboring Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
Confirming a report in the Athens daily "Ta Nea" at a press
briefing Monday, Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said
that the government had asked NATO to suspend such transit for 12
days, ten before and two after European elections on June 13.
</P>
<P>
He explained that police officers who accompany NATO convoys to
the Greek-Macedonian border will be deployed at different places
during elections.
</P>
<P>
Since the start of the Kosovo crisis, Greece, member of both
NATO and the European Union (EU), has refused to participate
directly in NATO military operations against Yugoslavia, but has
provided the use of Thessaloniki as a transit point for NATO
troops in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 NATO troops have reportedly passed through
Thessaloniki for Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Reppas also said that Greece and the Czech Republic
had agreed to propose a 48-hour cease-fire in Yugoslavia in order
to give time to diplomatic efforts for acceleration of the Kosovo
peace initiatives.
</P>
<P>
The proposal would be submitted to NATO, which began airstrikes
against Yugoslavia on March 24, he said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Africa Seeks for Debt Cancellation (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the solutions to the problem is heavily indebted poor
countries (HIPC) initiative, which was sponsored by the IMF and
the World Bank to help provide debt relief in these countries.
</P>
<P>
Under normal HIPC terms, debts in some African countries may be
 cancelled only after a six-year or more qualification period.
</P>
<P>
Regarded by many as ground-breaking when it was introduced two
years ago, HIPC has not lived up to the expectations of many
African governments although five African countries are among the
total of seven countries that have qualified for HIPC debt relief,
out of 41 potential candidates.
</P>
<P>
African countries are unsatisfied with HIPC, saying it might
offer some help, but it comes too late. For instance, Zambia
won't be eligible for HIPC relief until 2002, it is too little,
for only a portion of the debt is written off the books; it is too
limited, only 41 countries are declared "eligible"; and it is too
unrealistic, it doesn't consider social factors.
</P>
<P>
Africa countries reiterate the call for total unpayable debt
cancellation, and insist that creditors and G7 countries cannot be
allowed to dictate the terms of cancellation.
</P>
<P>
The Lusaka declaration said HIPC initiative and other debt
relief proposals, including the recent proposals from G7
countries, notably from the United States, Britain and Germany,
all insist on unacceptable conditions, and entail inadequate
amounts of relief.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it added, the so-called debt relief initiatives have
not resulted from inclusive negotiations. The Paris Club and the
HIPC are merely processes and frameworks imposed by creditors on
debtors.
</P>
<P>
"We reject HIPC and the other current debt relief processes and
commit ourselves to expose their fundamental flaws in each of
countries, particularly in the run-up to the June G8 meeting in
Cologne, Germany," the declaration said, adding "as members of
African civil society, we believe we have the standing to speak
truth to power, in the presence of overwhelming Northern financial
arrogance".
</P>
<P>
Africans believe debt is one of the most important instruments
of Northern domination over the South, and the domination of
financiers over people, production and nature everywhere, it
noted.
</P>
<P>
"As part of our struggle to liberate ourselves from this
bondage, we make demands for the cancellation of debt as part of a
broader struggle to fundamentally transform the current world
economic order and transfer power from the political leadership of
the rich countries, " said the declaration.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, we commit ourselves to working against localized
symptoms of our debt burden and economic process, including war,
corruption and other evils that undermine our development
process," it added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a world-wide anti-debt campaign, organized by the
Jubilee 2000 group, is underway to lobby donor countries and
international lending institutions to cancel the unpayable debt
for the impoverished countries of the world by the next
millennium, saying it wants to collect about 22 million signatures
at next month's meeting of G7/8, and press the leaders to consider
canceling the debt of the Third World countries.
</P>
<P>
In Zambia, the debt cancellation campaign has gained momentum
on May 22 through a solidarity march in various parts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Religious Affairs Deputy Minister Peter Chintala said
here after taking part in the march that the country's
6.5-billion-dollar debt had not only become unpayable but also
unserviceable.
</P>
<P>
He said it was encouraging to note that 180,000 signatures in
favor of debt cancellation had been obtained from various
individuals in the country and the government was happy to know
that it had support from citizens.
</P>
<P>
He called on African countries to adopt a common strategy
toward IMF and World Bank conditionalities and foster cooperation
through economic integration in the region.

<P>
CANBERRA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The Australian sharemarket ended
marginally weaker Monday after investors remained concerned about
the possibility of interest rate rises in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark All Ordinaries Index fell 1.5 points to 2,949.2
after jumping between positive and negative territory during the
day.
</P>
<P>
"There were not very many people coming in bargain hunting
today," Lucinda Chan from Macquarie Equities said.
</P>
<P>
"The market's very edgy, very nervous. There's a lot of talk
over there (in the United States) about the market pulling back a
lot more if rates go up, so people are still a bit worried about
that," she said.
</P>
<P>
In Australia on Monday, the All Industrials Index fell 5.8
points to 5,175.7 while the All Resources Index moved in the
opposite direction adding 3.1 points to 1,175.5, despite a fall in

<HEADLINE> Singapore's TradeNet Passes Y2K Tests, Official Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's Trade Development
Board (TDB) declared Monday that its on-line trade documentation
system, TradeNet, has passed a six-day Y2K test and will be ready
to handle the year 2000 and the leap year processing of trade
documentation.
</P>
<P>
TDB's Director for Computer Information Services Division
Martin Tsang said in a press release that the TradeNet Y2K
Integrated Simulation Test was declared a success after six days
of stress testing from May 10 to 15.
</P>
<P>
During the test, more than 500 trade documentation cases were
tested with the participation of the TDB, the Customs and Excise
Department (CED), Singapore Network Services (SNS), Cargo
Community Network (CCN), nine controlling agencies, four TradeNet
software vendors and 10 of their shipping agents and traders.
</P>
<P>
Tsang said, "We are pleased at the success of the simulation
exercises and it will still be business as usual for our traders
as we enter the year 2000."
</P>
<P>
Tsang also said two minor problems were encountered and quickly
resolved during the test.
</P>
<P>
They were the communication problem which obstructed the
connectivity between Customs and Excise Department and Singapore
Network Services and the permit date problem which made TradeNet
System unable to format some permits correctly when the system was
set to February 28, 2000, and February 29, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Tsang was confident that TDB's services will continue to run
smoothly without any disruptions as it crosses over into the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
The Y2K problem arises when software records the year in two
digits instead of four, which will cause confusion when the year
2000 approaches.

<HEADLINE> Zambian President Hails Progress Made by COMESA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 24 (Xinhua) -- As of February 1, 1999, 14 out of
the 21 member states of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern
Africa (COMESA) had reduced their tariffs by 60 percent. Of
them, 10 countries had reduced COMESA tariff by 80 percent or
more.
</P>
<P>
Zambian President Frederick Chiluba made these remarks in his
keynote address delivered at the 4th Summit of COMESA Authority
opened here Monday. The two-day summit is attended by over a
dozen heads of state and government from the COMESA members.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba, the outgoing chairman of the COMESA Authority who has
served the regional body during the past two years, said COMESA
had made commendable progress toward the attainment of the goals
of a free trade area by October 31, 2000 and a common external
tariff by the year 2004.
</P>
<P>
Over the last two years, Chiluba said, "we have pursued the
goal of creating a common market where goods, services, labor and
capital are free to move across our borders."
</P>
<P>
To facilitate the operations of a free trade area, the COMESA
had implemented programs including those intended to facilitate
transportation, communication, business transactions and
investment in the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
Transport programs embracing road, rail, sea and air transport
are being implemented and indications showed that the program had
considerably reduced the cost of moving goods in the region.
</P>
<P>
With regards to the clearing house, Chiluba noted that the
introduction of faster and easier payment system would greatly
facilitate business transactions. In addition, the clearing
house would provide an innovative political risk guarantee scheme,
namely, the proposed Africa Guarantee Facility.
</P>
<P>
COMESA has established the Consultative Committee of the
Business Community and implemented the Regional Investors' Road
Map which have greatly facilitated the investors to conduct
cross-border investment projects and the development of the
private sector, Chiluba said.
</P>
<P>
He welcomed potential investors within and outside the region
to invest in COMESA sectors such as telecommunications,
information technology, tourism, mining and agro-business.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian president also cited some progress COMESA has made
over the past two years in the fields of free movement of people
and labors,

legislation, and increased cooperation with international and
regional development partners.

The Party has led the people to enact and implement the
Constitution and other laws, and it's also necessary for the Party
to carry out its own activities within the restraints of the
Constitution and other laws, he added.
</P>
<P>
"The ultimate purpose of the people's congresses' supervisory
work is to promote lawful administration and judicial justice.
Therefore, it's in fact a kind of support to the work of the
government and the judicial bodies," Li stressed.
</P>
<P>
While explaining the draft regulations on judicial supervision,
Li said that the supervisory power must not be exercised by any
individual lawmakers, but only by the people's congress and its
standing committee as a collective power.
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, it's also impossible for the people's congresses to
probe into too many judicial cases," noted Li. "Therefore, we must
focus on those individual cases which have aroused strong
criticism and a lot of complaints."
</P>
<P>
He also reminded people's congresses at all levels of the
importance of respecting the judicial organs' power and right to
handle judicial cases with full independence.
</P>
<P>
"The people's congress should never get involved in the
specific process of the handling of a judicial case," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Li also studied the latest development of the reform of state-
owned enterprises in Shandong and the local "Vegetable Basket"
project, which aims at guaranteeing ample vegetable supply for the
urban residents.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Top Lawmaker Stresses Supervision (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, May 24 (Xinhua) -- China's top lawmaker Li Peng has
stressed the importance of strengthening supervision over the
government and judicial organs, saying that this is the common
aspiration of Chinese lawmakers and the majority of the people.
</P>
<P>
"Deputies to people's congresses at all levels and the broad
masses of the people all require the supervisory work to be
further strengthened and to enact a law on supervision as early as
possible," said Li, chairman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress (NPC), China's top legislature, during
his study tour of the east China province of Shandong last week.
</P>
<P>
Li, also a Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau of
the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, mainly
learned about the supervisory work of the local people's
congresses and their standing committees during the tour of Jinan,
capital of Shandong, and several other cities.
</P>
<P>
He also called several meetings to solicit opinions on a draft
of the Regulations on the Supervision on the Judicial Organs'
Handling of Some Individual Cases, which was formulated recently
by the NPC Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
Li told participants in the meetings that during the second
annual full session of the Ninth NPC convened in Beijing in March,
many Chinese legislators had called for intensified supervision on
the government and judicial bodies.
</P>
<P>
"The NPC Standing Committee has attached utmost importance to
their suggestions and has decided to enact a Law on Supervision
during its five-year term of office," he added.
</P>
<P>
Before the law is worked out and formally adopted, Li said, the
NPC Standing Committee has found it necessary to first enact
several special regulations and legal decisions on supervision,
such as the one he brought for discussion, to pave the way for the
law.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier Urges NATO to Stop Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen
reiterated today that the U.S.-led NATO must stop its wanton and
indiscriminate bombing of Yugoslavia immediately in order to bring
the Kosovo crisis back to political settlement.
</P>
<P>
Qian made the remarks while meeting with Greek Foreign Minister
George Papandreou. He said that the NATO attack on Chinese embassy
in Yugoslavia touched off the strong indignation of the Chinese
people, and that the U.S.-led NATO must conduct a comprehensive,
thorough and fair investigation, and make the truth public, and it
should be held fully responsible for that.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that China and Greece are both countries with a long
history, and that the two countries can approach issues from a
long-term perspective, adding that the Kosovo issue, a complicated
one which is connected with different ethnic groups and religions,
can only be settled politically.
</P>
<P>
Qian expressed his appreciation for Greece's efforts to seek a
political settlement of the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou, who arrived here Sunday for a two-day working visit
to China, briefed Qian on Greece's position on the Kosovo issue.
He said that military actions can only trigger various kinds of
contradictions instead of solving this complicated matter.
</P>
<P>
He said that Greece, as a country in Balkan, will make its
effort to let relevant countries and ethnic groups in the region
live in harmony.
</P>
<P>
The Greek foreign minister added that Greece is fully prepared
to increase consultations and cooperation with China, in order to
seek a political solution of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also spoke highly of the smooth development of
the Sino-Greek relations in recent years. They agreed that the two
governments will work together to promote mutually beneficial

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong-based Heritage Fund Invests in Palace Garden Reconstruction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong-based China Heritage
Fund (CHF) plans to pour four million U.S. dollars into the
reconstruction of the Jianfu Palace Garden in the Imperial Palace
Museum (the Forbidden City).
</P>
<P>
The fund today signed a contract agreement with the China
Heritage Exchange Association to carry out its first relics-
protection project, and the Palace Museum will organize the
reconstruction over the next four years.
</P>
<P>
The Jianfu Palace Garden covers some 4,000 square meters and is
the second largest garden in the Palace complex. It was created in
1740 and was totally destroyed by a disastrous fire in 1923.
</P>
<P>
"Garden reconstruction is an important step in restoring the
former appearance of the ancient Forbidden City," said Zhang
Wenbin, head of the State Administration of Cultural Heritage (
SACH) and also the association president.
</P>
<P>
Ronnie Chan, the CHF chairman, said, "We're devoted to
preserving the treasured cultural relics and ancient architecture.
"
</P>
<P>
"I hope overseas visitors will be able to learn more about
traditional Chinese culture and history," said Chan, chairman of
the Hang Lung Group of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
A museum task force has carefully researched the garden ruins
and has sought the advice of many well-known archeologists and
architects.
</P>
<P>
A total of 24 emperors of the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-
1911) dynasties lived in the enormous palace, built in 1420. The
Imperial Palace Museum in downtown Beijing was placed on the
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization'
s (UNESCO) World Heritage list in 1987.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- A nine-member U.N. team has arrived
in East Timor on Monday, along with communications equipment for
direct autonomy ballot monitoring, the official Antara News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The team was welcomed by officials of the East Timor
Immigration Office, the report quoted a source at the airport as
saying.
</P>
<P>
It will monitor the direct ballot in East Timor scheduled for
early August this year.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N. Assessment Mission in East Timor, the United
Nations will send a 600-member mission to execute the process of
consulting the East Timorese on the solution to the East Timor
issue, based on an agreement reached by Indonesia and Portugal in
a recent U.N.-brokered tripartite meeting.
</P>
<P>
The mission will implement the direct balloting to decide
whether or not the East Timorese are willing to accept a
wide-ranging autonomy offered by the Indonesian government. A
rejection of the offer would mean independence for the former
Portuguese territory.
</P>
<P>
All U.N. staff to be deployed in East Timor in preparation for
the ballot should be in place by mid-June.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said here Monday that
Indonesian security forces will be responsible for the security in
East Timor and safety of U.N. personnel.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, with a population of some 800,000 and an area of
15,000 square kilometers, had been a Portuguese colony until 1975
and it became an Indonesian province in 1976. But the United
Nations never recognized the move.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Summit Opens in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The fourth summit of the Common
Market of Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) opened here Monday
in Kenyan capital Nairobi in a bid to pave the way for a COMESA
free trade area.
</P>
<P>
The meeting has drawn a dozen heads of state and government,
namely presidents from Kenya, Burundi, Djibouti, Zimbabwe, the
Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Namibia, Malawi, Sudan,
Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The opening ceremony started with the playing of the national
anthem of Kenya, and the COMESA song expressing the unity for
freedom in trade in COMESA region.
</P>
<P>
In his welcoming speech, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi said,
"despite the challenges we have faced, we have remained steadfast
in our common resolve to transform COMESA into a free trade area."
</P>
<P>
He said, together under the umbrella of COMESA, "we must work
for freedom in trade, that will enable us participate effectively
and gain from the global economy."
</P>
<P>
Moi urged all COMESA member countries to be united in pursuing
issues of concern, saying "the solution to Africa's problems must
come from Africans themselves."
</P>
<P>
In his keynote address, President Frederick Chiluba of Zambia
who has served as Chairman of the Comesa Authority over the past
two years, noted that greater integration and cooperation within
COMESA could serve as an effective cushion against the adverse
effects of globalization.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the free trade area, Chiluba said, "we have
pursued the goal of creating a common market where goods,
services, labor and capital are free to move across our borders."
He added that "we set ourselves the goal of attaining a free trade
area by October 31, 2000."
</P>
<P>
"We reaffirmed our commitment to achieving this goal, and to
establish a common external tariff by the year 2004," he said,
noting that the rate of intra-COMESA trade is growing at a
healthy 20 percent per annum.
</P>
<P>
He told the participants that to the goal of a common external
tariff, " I feel comfortable to inform you that a firm foundation
is already being laid for its smooth introduction and operation."
</P>
<P>
Chiluba also highlighted the progress in the implementation of
programs and projects discussed at the last COMESA summit related
to telecommunications, African Guarantee Facility, free movement
of people, investment promotion, private sector development and
the COMESA court of justice.
</P>
<P>
Zambian President Sam Nujoma and his Djibouti counterpart
Ismail Omar Guelleh spoke highly of Chiluba's contributions to
COMESA during his two- year term as chairman of the COMESA
authority.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day summit, the heads of state and government of
the COMESA members will consider the report presented by the 7th
Meeting of the Minister Council on such issues as trade and
customs, monetary and financial cooperation as well as
infrastructure development.

<HEADLINE> Priority to Coastal Areas in Developing Nuclear Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- China will give priority to
southern and eastern coastal areas in developing nuclear power,
said Xu Yuming, deputy director of the State Atomic Energy Agency
(SAEA).
</P>
<P>
The coastal areas, lack of energy resources, have witnessed
fast economic growth over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
Xu said that China will adhere to unified planning when
developing nuclear power so as to keep its step with the
development of electricity and other energy resources.
</P>
<P>
China will make full use of its own nuclear resources and
enhance its capacity of extracting and processing natural uranium,
designing, building and running nuclear power stations and
facilities, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that China will also continue to adopt advanced and
fully-developed nuclear power technology and gradually develop its
new generation of advanced nuclear power stations.
</P>
<P>
Specialists estimate that China will need 20 million kwh and 50
million kwh of power produced by nuclear power stations or
stations using other energy resources respectively in 2010 and
2020 so as to meet the need of social and economical growth.
</P>
<P>
China's nuclear power development has slowed down due to the
competition of other energy resources, Xu said. However, nuclear
power, as a high-quality and clean energy, has irreplaceable
advantages in easing environmental and ecological problems.
</P>
<P>
"Its development still has much room in the future," he added.
</P>
<P>
China plans to construct four nuclear power stations with a
total generating capacity of 6.6 million kw during the 1996-2000
period, all in eastern and southern coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
China currently has a nuclear power generating capacity of 2.1
million kw.

<HEADLINE> Filipinos Protest Visiting Forces Pact With U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- About 200 protesters, demonstrating
against the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) between the
Philippines and the United States, Friday clashed with police
outside the U.S. Embassy in Manila.
</P>
<P>
The activists ran past police lines and destroyed a plastic
cover protecting the U.S. government seal at the embassy's
entrance, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
Police pushed them back with shields and truncheons, injuring
at least one protester, they said.
</P>
<P>
The protesters carried an effigy of U.S. President Bill Clinton
which they later blasted with firecrackers outside the gates,
witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
The protesters later marched to join other protesters at the
nearby senate building, where legislators were debating the VFA
that would allow the resumption of large-scale joint military
exercises with U.S. troops.
</P>
<P>
The entire Metro Manila police force was on full alert on
Monday in anticipation of massive protest actions against the
ratification of the VFA.
</P>
<P>
Police and military units have been ordered to monitor closely
all ongoing activities and to take necessary and appropriate
action.
</P>
<P>
Last week, senate security forces and police clashed with some
300 anti-VFA demonstrators who tried to storm the senate building.
</P>
<P>
The VFA, signed by Manila and Washington last year, would pave
the way for the resumption of large-scale annual joint military
exercises between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Senate is due to vote on the agreement on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The opponents say the pact gives Washington jurisdiction over
U.S. troops who may commit crimes in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
They say the pact also exposes the Philippines to nuclear
threats because it does not require the United States to declare
whether it has nuclear weapons aboard visiting ships.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Russian
special envoy for the Balkans, on Monday called for a "firm
decision" on Kosovo, warning a stop to negotiations on the
Yugoslav crisis would spell "catastrophe."
</P>
<P>
"Peace talks are extremely difficult to conduct in light of
the escalation of missile and bomb strikes on Yugoslavia,"
Chernomyrdin told reporters following his meeting with Indian
Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh, who arrived here Sunday for a
visit.
</P>
<P>
He called for coordination of settlement efforts by Russia,
India and China, adding that Moscow is ready for such coordinated
actions.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said intense talks over the past three weeks have
made NATO accept the fact that part of Serbian troops could remain
in Kosovo, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"The troops need to be withdrawn, but it is necessary to leave
part of the troops there, too," he said.
</P>
<P>
Singh, for his part, said New Delhi's stance on the Kosovo
crisis coincided with that of Russia and China and that the Kosovo
conflict is a problem of not only the Balkans, but of the whole
world.
</P>
<P>
The conflict puts in question the role of the United Nations
and the foundations of international law, the foreign minister
said.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin confirmed that he would meet Finnish President
Martti Ahtisaari and U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott
here Wednesday for a fresh round of talks over Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Moi Urges for African Unity to Achieve Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
said here Monday that the path of Cooperation and free trade is
the long-term solution to economic problems in the African region.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the Fourth Summit of the
Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa(COMESA), Moi said,
"we cannot expect to achieve meaningful economic progress when we
are divided, or if we continue to approach international issues as
individual nations."
</P>
<P>
Though the trade block covers a vast area of about 13 million
square kilometers with a population of 380 million, its gross
domestic product has only 165 billion U.S. dollars which is about
that of a small European country like Belgium.
</P>
<P>
The president told the two-day summit, which was attended by 12
heads of state of its 21 members, that the economy of the African
trade body is extremely vulnerable to the existing constraints in
the global economic progress.
</P>
<P>
Moi, who was elected COMESA chairman replacing the out-going
COMESA Chairman Zambian President Frederick Chiluba, said that
African countries need to put in place "effective strategies",
which will enable them to meet the challenges and harness the
emerging opportunities brought up by global economy.
</P>
<P>
To achieve sustainable growth that will enable African
countries participate effectively and gain from the global
economy, "African countries must work for freedom in trade", Moi
said.
</P>
<P>
The current COMESA chairman said the ongoing summit "is a step
forward in the pursuit of our cherished and common goals."
</P>
<P>
Moi reaffirmed the African sub-regional economic body's
determination to meet its goal for creation of a free trade zone
by october 31, 2000 by removing all tariff and non-tariff barriers
to trade among member countries, and introducing a common external
tariff by 2004.
</P>
<P>
The president also stressed the need to develop common
strategies in the on-going negotiations under the World Trade
Organization and a common stand on the evolving relations between
African, Caribbean and Pacific countries and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The Asian financial crisis has reduced the economies growth of
many of African countries by up to 50 percent, while the drop of
the prices of primary commodities has further eroded the export
earning of many countries in the region, Moi said.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Top Official Depressed by Slow Progress Over Aborigines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Australian Governor-General
William Deane risked angering the Australian federal government
Monday when he said he was depressed by the slow progress in
reconciliation between white Australians and black aborigines.
</P>
<P>
With National Sorry Day being celebrated mainly by the
aborigines on Wednesday, the governor-general, basically a
ceremonial political figure in Australia, again highlighted the
plight of indigenous Australians and his concerns about the
reconciliation process, the Australian Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
"These days, it is sometimes difficult not to feel discouraged
-- even depressed -- about the slow course of the reconciliation
process," he said in Australia's third largest city of Brisbane,
East Australia.
</P>
<P>
He said the country's 300,000 indigenous people were greatly
disadvantaged compared with other Australians in health, welfare,
housing, community services and employment.
</P>
<P>
"In that regard, it is unnecessary to do more than quote one
plain statistic: an aboriginal baby born in this country today
has, on present figures and on average, a life expectancy of
almost 20 years less than that of a non-aboriginal baby," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Think of that: almost 20 years. And the statistics indicate
that the discrepancy is still widening."
</P>
<P>
He apologized in 1997 for the misery of the stolen generations
during half a century before the 1970s under the white
assimilation policy. Tens of thousands of aboriginal children were
forcibly taken from their families and raised in government-funded
welfare centers or churches. Many of whom have never reunited with
their parents.
</P>
<P>
Some of the children, better known as stolen generations, have
been demanding a formal apology from the Australian government for
the misery they had suffered, but the demand was rejected by
Australian Prime Minister John Howard.
</P>
<P>
During the first 100 years of European settlement in Australia,
thousands of innocent aborigines had been killed and many more had
been driven by white people to remote and arid areas.
</P>
<P>
In late 1997 the governor-general inflamed debate on a
government's native title legislation designed to limit
aborigines' claims to land rights by saying he would weep for the
nation if it failed to acknowledge past oppression of aborigines.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Editorial Stresses Economic Development (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The People's Daily, China's leading
newspaper, echoes Chinese President Jiang Zemin's call on the
whole country to focus on economic development after the NATO
missile attack on the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in an editorial
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"After learning the atrocities of the U.S.-led NATO, the
Chinese people not only felt great indignation, but also
recognized the utmost importance of improving China's economic
power and comprehensive national strength as quickly as possible,"
says the editorial entitled "Unswervingly adhere to taking
economic development as the central task."
</P>
<P>
The editorial says that a major factor behind hegemonism and
power politics lies in the fact that they have powerful economic
strength and mighty military power backed by their economic
strength.
</P>
<P>
The editorial recalls that in his keynote speech at the meeting
welcoming Chinese personnel back from Yugoslavia, President Jiang
said: "We will continue to unswervingly adhere to taking economic
development as our central task."
</P>
<P>
"This has precisely reflected the Chinese people's
determination to turn grief into strength and make every effort to
develop China into a socialist power," the editorial adds.
</P>
<P>
The editorial says that the shift from stressing class struggle
to taking economic development as the central task some 20 years
ago represents a significant revision of its guiding ideology and
political line by the Communist Party of China.

<P>
BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Both China and Greece have vowed
to seek a political solution to the Kosovo issue, as expressed by
their foreign ministers in talks here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan exchanged views on the
Kosovo crisis with his Greek counterpart,George Papandreou,who
is on a working visit to China.
</P>
<P>
Briefing Tang on Greece's position on the Kosovo issue and its
efforts at diplomatic mediation, Papandreou said Greece, a Balkan
nation, is dedicated to the peaceful co-existence of all nations
and ethic groups in the region.
</P>
<P>
Greece will not take part in NATO military action, but instead
will promote a political solution to the crisis, grant
humanitarian aid to all parties,and appeal for post-war
construction, he pledged.
</P>
<P>
Greece is ready to urge a NATO bombing pause and a return to
the United Nation's effort for a political solution, he pointed
out.

willing to enhance consultation and coordination with the Chinese
side.

embassy in Yugoslavia, and once again expressed condolences for

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Open More Consular Offices in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kuala Lumpur, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will open more
consular offices in China for issuance of visas to Chinese
intending to visit the country, Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah
Ahmad Badawi said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
These offices would be located in cities with high demand for
Malaysian visas, said Abdullah, who is also home minister.
</P>
<P>
At present, Chinese can apply for Malaysian visas at the
Malaysian Embassy in Beijing and Malaysian consulates in Hong Kong
and Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
"We have no problem in giving visas to Chinese tourists to
enter Malaysia through the KLIA, Langkawi, Johor Baharu or any
other entry points," he said.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah told reporters this after launching the book "A New
Deal For Asia" written by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said that as the practice in China is to require
outward-bound Chinese to have visas issued well in advance, it
would be a boon to have more consular offices in that country.
</P>
<P>
Replying to another question, Abdullah said the decision to
have the extra consular offices only is applicable to China.
</P>
<P>
He said Chinese visitors entering Malaysia through a third
country, such as Indonesia, would be given visas at Malaysian
entry points.
</P>
<P>
On the 25th anniversary of Malaysia-China diplomatic ties,
Abdullah said, Malaysia is pleased that the long-established and
cordial ties have benefited both sides.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Not to Export Arms to Libya: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 24 (Xinhua) -- South African arms producer,
Denel, has denied any suspicion that it will offer its arms to
Libya, Business Day newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
A high-profile South African trade delegation headed by Trade
and Industry Minister Alec Erwin is visiting Libya, seeking
business contracts and orders.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the arms parastatal Denel are among the
powerful delegation.
</P>
<P>
Upon his departure for Tripoli on Sunday, Denel chief executive
Max Sisulu denied the trip was to market weapons to Libya.
</P>
<P>
Denel comprised 22 companies which sold a wide range of
equipment, including soya bean processing, money counters and
information technology, said Sisulu.
</P>
<P>
He said South Africa's world class equipment for clearing
landmines, was among the products he would be punting in Libya,
where thousands of landmines planted during the Second World War
posed a serious problem.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources said South African businessmen are hoping to
secure contracts worth billions of U.S. dollars which are up for
grabs since the suspension of the United Nations' sanctions
against Libya.
</P>
<P>
The suspension followed Libya's handover of two men suspected
of the 1988 bombing of the PanAm flight over Lockerbie in Scotland
for trial in the Netherlands, a settlement which South Africa
helped broker. The Lockerbie air crash claimed 270 lives.

ANKARA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- One Turkish soldier was killed and
26 others wounded in a terrorist attack in southeastern Turkey
late Sunday night, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that a group of rebels of the outlawed Kurdish

casualties.
</P>
<P>
The injured were rushed to hospitals in Van and Hakkari
provinces, among whom 10 seriously injured were taken to Ankara
for treatment later.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting since 1984 for an independent
Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey. Conflicts between the
Turkish government and the PKK have claimed over 37,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan was captured by Turkish special
agents in Kenya in mid-February and has been detained on

<HEADLINE> Macao Faces Brighter Future: First Chief Executive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Edmund Ho Hau Wah, the first chief
executive of the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR),
believes that with the motherland's backing, there is no doubt
that Macao will have a better future after it returns to the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of his new mission, Ho, who is now in Beijing
receiving his official appointment from the State Council, said
that "the responsibility is heavy and the road ahead is long".
</P>
<P>
"This is the same for the Macao people, as well," Ho told
Xinhua in an exclusive interview here today. "Only by trusting
the government and the Macao people will we be able to make a
clear distinction between the right and wrong, will be open and
fair, and will win trust and support, and there will be no burden
or contradiction that will baffle me," Ho said.
</P>
<P>
Ho, 44, was elected the first chief executive of the Macao SAR
on May 15. He is the general manager of the Tai Fung Bank and
chairman of the Macao Association of Banks.
</P>
<P>
Ho took his election as an indication of being trusted by the
Macao people, and said this has given him a great opportunity to
deepen his feelings for the motherland and Macao.
</P>
<P>
"I'll turn the opportunity into selfless sacrifice," said Ho.
</P>
<P>
On the future of Macao, Ho said that two points should be made
clear to the people of Macao -- first, there is no doubt about a
brighter future for Macao, and second, creating prosperity and
making progress requires the concerted effort of the Macao people.
</P>
<P>
"The SAR government will do its utmost to improve the current
situation and push forward social development, and the Macao
people are expected to actively create conditions for the future
development of Macao," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Currently, public security and the economy are the two issues
demanding most attention," Ho said. "People in Macao wish for
early solutions to these problems, and the SAR government will
make efforts to rectify the security order as quickly as possible.
"
</P>
<P>
"But 'Rome was not built in a day' and people should not
expect all problems to be solved overnight when the SAR government
is officially formed," Ho said.
</P>
<P>
"Macao is a small place with limited resources, but its
connections with the rest of the world are extensive and tourism
is booming. Macao is an important bridge and window between Asia,
and the inland areas of the motherland in particular, and the rest
of the world."
</P>
<P>
"Macao expects a broader space in which it can conduct
cooperation with Guangdong and Hong Kong," Ho said, "and its role
as a bridge across the Taiwan Straits will also be displayed
further."
</P>
<P>
"All these advantages will be conducive to Macao's economic
revitalization and stable development, and I am confident that
this is so," Ho concluded.

<HEADLINE> Capital Investment Exceeds 2 Billion US Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Total capital investment
approved in Malaysia has reached 8.8 billion ringgit (2.3 billion
U.S. dollars) so far this year.
</P>
<P>
"The amount (of investments) approved has almost touched 10
billion ringgit in the first few months of this year," said Deputy
Minister of International Trade and Industry Kerk Choo Ting here
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The investments are mainly in the electronic and electrical
sector as well as chemical and petrochemical products, he told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Kerk said that of the approved amount, 7 billion ringgit (1.8
billion dollars) worth of investments were obtained since April
and they came from two local companies and five foreign investors,
mostly from the United States.
</P>
<P>
Major sources of foreign investments were the United States,
Japan, Taiwan, Singapore and Germany, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kerk said Malaysia will continue to encourage new foreign
investors as well as reinvestments from existing foreign investors
to build upon the industrial foundation that has been laid so far.
</P>
<P>
"The thrust of the industrialization policy will be focused on
the growth and development of industries that will provide maximum
spin-off effects to the economy and the promotion of higher
quality investments and productivity-driven growth," he said.
</P>
<P>
As such, future thrusts will be focused on accelerating the
shift toward hi-tech and knowledge-based industries and developing
resource-based industries which will generate greater domestic
value-added activities, he said.

<HEADLINE> OAU Chief Calls for African Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Salim Ahmed Salim, Secretary
General of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), Monday called
on African states

"to close their ranks and work together in the spirit of unity and
 solidarity."
</P>
<P>
The spirit has inspired the founding fathers and sustained the
continental organization over the past 36 years, he said.
</P>
<P>
In his message issued on the occasion of the 36th anniversary
of the founding of the OAU which falls on May 25, Salim said over
the years, the pan-African organization "proved to be an
invaluable instrument for unity and solidarity of the Africans."
</P>
<P>
"Whenever the African peoples stood and acted together, their
voice was heard and their views were taken into account," he said.
</P>
<P>
Salim noted that "today, more than ever before, the unity and
solidarity of Africa is needed to address the formidable
challenges confronting the continent at a time when the world is
experiencing rapid changes."
</P>
<P>
The various conflicts in Africa have caused the loss of
precious lives, destruction and immense suffering to Africans,
Salim said, adding "we have no option but to continue and redouble
our collective efforts to promote peace, security and stability
both in our countries and in our continent."
</P>
<P>
"Our primary objective of promoting the well-being and progress
of our people cannot be achieved in an environment devoid of
peace, security and stability," he said.
</P>
<P>
He, therefore, suggested that the motto for Africans, as they
usher into the new millennium, should be the attainment of lasting
peace, security and stability by all means.
</P>
<P>
The OAU chief appealed to African states "to recommit
themselves to the ideals of unity, solidarity, cooperation and
Pan-Africanism which are enshrined in the OAU charter.

<P>
BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji today
urged the United States to give clear answers to all the demands
of the Chinese government and Chinese people, otherwise "the
Chinese people won't agree."
</P>
<P>
Zhu said made the remark while meeting here with John Moore,
the first Australian Minister for Defense ever to visit China
since the two countries forged diplomatic ties 27 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Zhu expressed his belief that the current visit will further
push forward the ties between the two countries and the two armies.
</P>
<P>
The friendly ties and cooperation between China and Australia "
are at a very good period of development," said Zhu, adding that
China is satisfied with the fine momentum of development in
bilateral relationship as exhibited in various fields.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of Chinese President Jiang Zemin's coming visit to
Australia this year, Zhu said this will be a historic event in
bilateral relations that will surely lend stronger impetus to
promoting bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Moore agreed that the U.S.-led NATO's attack on the Chinese
embassy in Belgrade is unforgivable and that the U.S. should
satisfy the demands raised by the Chinese government.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets With Chief Executive of Macao SAR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin met
here today with Edmund Ho Hau Wah, the first chief executive of
the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR), which will be
established after Macao returns to China on December 20 this year.
</P>
<P>
"In the over 400 years of Portuguese rule over Macao, all
successive Macao governors were directly appointed and sent in by
the Portuguese government. You're the first Chinese to serve as
Macao's chief executive," noted Jiang after congratulating Ho on
his election.
</P>
<P>
The election of Ho by a selection committee, whose members are
all permanent residents of Macao, through secret ballot reflects
the Chinese central government's firm determination to implement
the principles of "one country, two systems" and "Macao people
running Macao, and has also opened a new era in the history of
Macao, said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
"'One country, two systems' is a state policy China will long
pursue, and after the founding of the Macao SAR, we will strictly
follow the stipulations of the SAR's Basic Law and will never
interfere with any affairs within the scope of the SAR's self-
government," said the president.
</P>
<P>
He also pledged that the central government will give all-out
support to Ho if he encounters problems and needs assistance.
</P>
<P>
As the first chief executive, Jiang said, Ho shoulders the
great historic mission of leading all Macao residents in putting
the principle of "one country, two systems" into practice, and
thus faces an arduous task.
</P>
<P>
"I hope you will live up to the great expectations of the
entire Chinese people, including the 400,000-strong Macao
residents," said Jiang. "And I believe that Macao will have a
better tomorrow."
</P>
<P>
Ho replied that he will try his best to make due contributions
to Macao's stability and further development, as well as to the
prosperity of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Vice Premier Qian Qichen and several other officials also were
present during the meeting.

<TEXT>
<P>
Kuala Lumpur, May 24 (Xinhua) -- A Royal Malaysian Air Force
(RMAF) Canadian-made Caribou transport aircraft crashed shortly
after taking off from the Kuching International Airport on Monday,
killing all the five people aboard, a RMAF spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
RMAF Public Relations Officer Maj. Ramli Abdul Rahim said in a
statement issued here that the aircraft was on a normal training
mission when it crashed.
</P>
<P>
"All five crew members are killed and their names will be
released after the RMAF informed their next of kin," he said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> IMF Gives Yellow Card to Nigeria's Unrestrained </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund (IMF)
 threatened to defer debt relief lately for Nigeria if the
country do not stop unrestrained ex-budgetary spending.
</P>
<P>
The move came after the west African country's deficits hit a
record high, and its foreign currency being alarmingly low, the
Fund's Abuja office confirmed to Xinhua Monday.
</P>
<P>
The threat means the incoming civilian government may go deep
into an economic crisis, since the new administration is still
counting on the IMF to help write off a large bulk of its
29-billion-U.S. dollar foreign debt, inherited from former
Nigerian government.
</P>
<P>
Britain and the United States have both ruled out debt
forgiveness for Nigeria, implying that the new administration must
look to the multinational financial organizations for help.
</P>
<P>
The IMF officials had recommended in a memo to its head office
in Washington that the Nigerian government make an urgent freeze
in the parastatals money in the banking sector as well as the
extra-budgetary spending, reported This Day, one of the country's
leading daily.
</P>
<P>
The memo said the Nigerian government has gone completely off
the track in the implementation of the IMF-sponsored programs.
</P>
<P>
The IMF has always insisted that Nigeria must first show a
six-month record of its healthy economic running --a "clean bill"
as called by some Nigerian commentators, before it could get
further consideration in relieving the country's huge debt stocks,
which is widely deemed to be critical for the success of the new
government's economic policies.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets Senior Pakistani Officer (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin met
with Pervez Musharaf, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
Committee and chief of Army Staff of Pakistan, here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who is also chairman of China's Central Military
Commission, said that China and Pakistan are neighbors with a
traditional friendship.
</P>
<P>
"During the long period of friendly exchanges, the peoples of
our two countries comprehend and sympathize with each other," he
said, adding that China appreciates Pakistan's firm support and
assistance in such issues as Taiwan, Tibet and human rights.
</P>
<P>
According to Jiang, U.S.-led NATO wantonly bombed the sovereign
state Yugoslavia in total disregard of the U.N. Charter and
relevant international laws and agreements. "The Chinese
government and people expressed their strong opposition to such an
action from the very beginning," he said.
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, Jiang said, U.S.-led NATO went so far as to
attack the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia with missiles. The
president said that attack constituted "the gross violation of
Chinese sovereignty and wanton trampling of international laws and
relevant international agreements."
</P>
<P>
The only way to tackle the Kosovo crisis, the president pointed
out, is that NATO stops bombing. "No political solution can be
discussed otherwise," he added.
</P>
<P>
On the regional situation, Jiang said that the South Asian
subcontinent constitutes a major component of Asia. "Without the
stability or development in South Asia, there would be no peace or
prosperity in the whole of Asia," he said, adding that China
sincerely hopes that the subcontinent maintains peace and
stability.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Urges Study on Soeharto Wealth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J. Habibie
Monday instructed Attorney General Andi M. Ghalib to study
intensively all the data provided by the U.S. Time magazine on the
alleged wealth of former President Soeharto and his family abroad.
</P>
<P>
"But (the investigation on former President Soeharto's
allegedly hidden wealth) should abide by the concept of (respect
for) human rights," State Secretary/Justice Minister Muladi quoted
Habibie as saying after a meeting with Ghalib, Defense Minister
Gen. Wiranto and himself at the Merdeka Palace here.
</P>
<P>
Muladi said Ghalib has also been asked to investigate the
magazine's findings, considering that Soeharto had authorized him
to do so.
</P>
<P>
He said that during their meeting, Ghalib reported to the
president that he has sent a letter to the ambassadors of
Switzerland, Austria and the United States to Indonesia as well as
Foreign Affairs Minister Ali Alatas to provide data on the wealth
of the former president, based on the Time report.
</P>
<P>
Time reported that the Soeharto family amassed a 15 billion
U.S. dollar fortune during his 32 years of rule.
</P>
<P>
The Soehartos' fortune includes 9 billion dollars in cash that
was transferred from a bank in Switzerland to another bank in
Austria shortly after the former ruler was forced from office in
May last year, the magazine said.
</P>
<P>
"(We need) data such as proof of the transfer (of Soeharto
funds from a Swiss bank to an Austrian bank). Time did mention the
data, but it would be much better if there is evidence of the
transfer. This is not easy to be obtained if we do not get
assistance from the governments of Switzerland, Austria and the
U.S.," Muladi added.
</P>
<P>
Muladi said the Attorney General's Office has set up a team
tasked to look into the Time report.
</P>
<P>
The probe into Soeharto's alleged ill-gotten wealth will be
completed after the June 7 general election.
</P>
<P>
"This is the government's commitment," he said.
</P>
<P>
If Time magazine has the will to help settle the case, it is
not difficult for it to send its data on Soeharto's alleged wealth
stashed abroad, he added.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto asserted in a recent private television interview that
he did not own a single cent in foreign banks and he challenged
the government and the general public to trace whatever wealth he
possesses overseas.

in Yugoslavia caused a number of casualties and property losses. "
I would like to express my sympathy," he said.

range of the United Nations and that wanton bombing by NATO is
definitely not a way to solve the crisis.

<HEADLINE> India to Launch 3 Satellites Simultaneously </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 24 (Xinhua) -- India is expected to launch three
satellites simultaneously Wednesday and the countdown for the
launch began Monday, the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO)
said.
</P>
<P>
The country's latest generation space launcher, Polar Satellite
Launch Vehicle (PSLV-C2), will launch an Indian remote sensing
satellite (IRS-P4), a German scientific satellite and a South
Korean satellite on May 26.
</P>
<P>
The 1,050-kg IRS-P4, also called Oceansat-1, will be placed in
a polar sun-synchronous circular orbit of 720 km, at an
inclination of 98.28 degrees, sources said.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first time for ISRO to launch three satellites
in a single vehicle.
</P>
<P>
The IRS-P4 will gather data for oceanographic and atmospheric
applications, develop new application areas and provide
opportunity for conducting technological/scientific experiments
that are of relevance for future development, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
The May 26 launch will also mark India's entry into the highly
profitable business of commercial space launch as the two
non-Indian satellites will be put in space at a promotional price
compared with the international price tag of one million U.S.
dollars per satellite of this class.

LONDON, May 24 (Xinhua) -- British Defense Secretary George
Robertson said on Monday that NATO troops would escort refugees
back to their homes in Kosovo, making an excuse for the ground
force to invade Yugoslavia.

The defense secretary told BBC television that NATO would do it
in disregard of whether Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
agrees or not.

<P>
"Milosevic won't have a veto on what we do," Robertson said.

<P>
When asked whether Washington would agree to send in ground
troops if Milosevic refused to back down to NATO demands,
Robertson said all options remained on the table.
</P>
<P>
"The alliance stays together, holds together, has been
effective together," he said.
</P>
<P>
The hawkish defense secretary said he was "perfectly confident"
the 19-strong alliance would get the force in place.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- China today urged Japan to honor
its solemn commitments of not becoming a military power and of
following the path of peaceful development.
</P>
<P>
When commenting on the approval of the new Japan-U.S. defense
cooperation guidelines today by Japan's House of Councillors,
Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said here today that China
is gravely concerned about Japan's act of going against the
historical trend and its insistence on strengthening Japan-U.S.
military cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said that Japan should honor its solemn commitments of not
becoming a military power and of following the path of peaceful
development through its real action, properly approach the Taiwan
issue strictly in accordance with relevant principles, and not do
anything interfering in China's internal affairs or undermining
Sino-Japanese relations. Only when Japan does so, will it help
reduce doubts and uneasiness of China and other neighboring
countries and safeguard the regional peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has repeatedly urged Japan to act
prudently, and Japan has made some commitments and explained its
stance to China in this regard, Zhu said, adding that "We will
listen to what the Japanese side says and watch what it does."

<HEADLINE> Mbeki to Announce S. African New Cabinet in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The announcement of new South
African cabinet will be made between June 14 and 15, Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki has said.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki, president-in-waiting, said Sunday that he would only
announce his cabinet for the new millennium once parliament has
formally appointed him head of state.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is due to hold its second all-race elections on
June 2.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki, chairman of the African National Congress (ANC), the
biggest ruling party in the country, is generally believed to
succeed Nelson Mandela as president of state after the election.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no president until such a person is appointed by
 parliament. I don't think anybody who is not president should
appoint ministers," Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
Also on Sunday, Mbeki told a mass rally in Witbank, about 200
km east of Johannesburg, that the ANC-led government would do its
best to curb corruption both in the party and the government.
</P>
<P>
Business Day newspaper quoted Mbeki as saying that some people
joined the government as ANC members, but turned out to be
"thieves", only there to "fill their stomachs".
</P>
<P>
"They (corrupt officials) must get out the government. We don't
want such people in the ANC," Mbeki said.

<HEADLINE> Alatas: U.N. to Assist E. Timor in Autonomy Ballot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations (U.N.) will send
600 personnel to East Timor during the autonomy balloting to be
held there in August this year, Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a news briefing at the Foreign Ministry, Alatas said the
U.N. together with the Indonesian government will be responsible
for the security situation and a smooth implementation of the
autonomy ballot in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.N. personnel include 400 people who will arrange
the balloting and 200 civil guards to maintain security situation.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed by Indonesia and Portugal on May 5 in
New York, the U.N. will deploy civilian police advisers from
several countries to assist Indonesian police in maintaining law
and order in East Timor. A key function will be the disarmament of
rival factions that are either for or against independence.
</P>
<P>
Alatas was convinced that the security situation will be under
control during the balloting.
</P>
<P>
He said that Indonesia, Portugal and the U.N. are discussing
the problems on sending observers to East Timor to supervise the
balloting, sending emergency hospital units and emergency medical
units there and other technical issues.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. had proposed to send 20 observers to East Timor during
the balloting, he disclosed.
</P>
<P>
About 45 million U.S. dollars will be needed to conduct the
ballot and some of them will be provided by the U.N. and several
countries such as Australia, said Alatas.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, 200 registration offices and 700 polling
stations will be set up for the balloting.
</P>
<P>
He said a U.N. mission will arrive in Jakarta on May 27 to
discuss the new developments in East Timor and the arrangement for
the direct autonomy ballot. On May 29, he said, the mission will
visit Dili, capital city of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Alatas also denied the reports that the balloting date has
changed from August 8 to August 7. It was only a proposal from the
Indonesian government to the U.N. given August 8 is a Sunday and
the East Timorese will go to church, no decision has been made on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
The proposal to give East Timorese wide-ranging autonomy by
holding a direct balloting was announced by the Indonesian
government in January this year. The announcement said the
Indonesian government is ready to release East Timor if the
alternative to provide wider autonomy is refused by the people in
the region and the international community.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, with a population of some 800,000 and an area of
15,000 square kilometers, had been a Portuguese colony until 1975.
It became an Indonesian province in 1976, but the U.N. never
recognizes the move.

<P>
LONDON, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading British newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
-- Genetically modified soya beans currently found in some of
the most common processed foods, including biscuits, ready-made
meals and soft drinks, have been released on to the world market
without the safety tests necessary to protect human health,
according to independent scientists.
</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- NATO will this week send a fresh declaration of intent to
Slobodan Milosevic by announcing that its ground forces massing in
Macedonia to go into Kosovo is to be almost doubled to 48,000 men.
</P>
<P>
The Independent:
</P>
<P>
-- Britain and the U.S. are now ready to drive the remaining
Serb forces from Kosovo, bring to an end a war which on Monday
drags into its third month with no sign that air strikes are
hastening a Yugoslav withdrawal, or that a quick diplomatic
solution is at hand.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- NATO's ability to wage a ground war against Yugoslavia came
a step closer as it prepared to send 22,000 more troops to the
Balkans. But defense sources said it would take "weeks and
probably months" to build up such a force.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The British government is likely to disappoint its European
Union partners on Monday by failing to put forward plans to break
the deadlock over the imposition of an EU-wide 20 per cent
withholding tax.

<HEADLINE> HK Hosts Event for Tax Free Asia Pacific 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 24 (Xinhua) -- A five-day event, Tax Free Asia
Pacific 1999 (TFAP), the fifth of its kind, was launched at the
Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center Monday with a view to
looking into the future prospects of the region for the tax free
industry.
</P>
<P>
The event includes an exhibition and a conference entitled "
Planting the Seeds of Recovery" as well as a series of dynamic
workshops.
</P>
<P>
About 200 exhibitors from around the globe feature a
comprehensive display of premium duty- and tax-free goods
including liquor, tobacco, fragrance, cosmetics, accessories,
jewelry, gifts and confectionery.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Marie Cerruti, president of the Tax Free World Association,
said at the opening of the conference that the Asia Pacific region,
with its vast population and active travel industry, represents
the greatest potential worldwide for the travel and retail
industry.
</P>
<P>
Last year duty- and tax-free sales reached a retail value of 20.
5 billion U.S. dollars with Asia Pacific contributing 20 percent
to that figure.
</P>
<P>
Despite the economic downturn, he said, "We are confident that
the TFAP will benefit from a large range of internationally known
brands, offering an incomparable multi-product platform in a
unique environment, with the best possible conditions to meet and
do business."
</P>
<P>
Stephen Ip, HK Secretary for Economic Services, described the
international duty and tax free industry as dynamic.
</P>
<P>
He said the industry enables consumers traveling between
different countries and regions to purchase high quality luxury
merchandise at attractive prices.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the sales of tax-free commodities in Hong Kong took up
some 10 percent of the total market share in the Asia Pacific
region.
</P>
<P>
Last year when the exhibition was first held in Hong Kong, it
recorded an overwhelming success featuring more than 300
international brands from over 20 countries.
</P>
<P>
It also attracted over 2,000 quality trade buyers from the Asia
Pacific region notwithstanding the region-wide financial turmoil
and economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
This testifies to the importance attached to this industry-wide
event, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ip expressed the belief that this year's exhibition is going to
break new ground.

PARIS, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading French newspapers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Over the past two days, NATO launched its most intensive
bombings on Yugoslavia since the beginning of the air campaign,
while explicitly raising the possibility of a ground intervention.
While hesitating about a ground intervention, U.S. President Bill
Clinton does not exclude any option.
</P>
<P>
-- Germany is going to celebrate on Monday the 50th anniversary
of its Constitution, which came into force on May 23, 1949, in a
simple and modest way. The playing of the music by Mozart, Brahms
and Mendelssohn, as well as the national anthem, plus a short
speech by the president of the republic, will be all of the
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- In two months of operation in Kosovo, NATO said it has
destroyed one third of the heavy armaments and about 100 planes of
the Yugoslav forces with 14,000 bombs. NATO also announced the
reinforcement of its ground deployment in the Balkans in
preparation for a deployment in Kosovo once a political solution
is found.
</P>
<P>
-- The Italian government suspects that the order to
assassinate a senior government advisor on labor issues was given
by someone close to the leadership of labor unions. Massimo
D'Antona, who was assassinated last week by the terrorist group "
Red Brigade", helped the government conclude talks on a social
pact with the unions last December.

<P>
BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin met
with Howard Cooke, governor-general of Jamaica, and his wife at
the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Extending welcome to Cooke and his party, Jiang praised Cooke's
contribution to promoting the growth of bilateral ties between
China and Jamaica and expressed his appreciation for the Jamaican
government's adherence to the "One China" policy and refusal to
develop official relations with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
As developing countries, Jiang said, China and Jamaica now face
the common tasks of developing domestic economies, improving
people's living standards and safeguarding world peace.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the principle of treating each other equally,
mutual support and enhancing exchanges and friendship, the Chinese
government is willing to make concerted efforts with the Jamaican
government to bring the Chinese-Jamaican relationship featuring
long-term stability and sustainable growth into the 21st century,
the Chinese president said.
</P>
<P>
Cooke, who is also the sponsor of Jamaica-China Friendship
Association, said that the Chinese people are diligent and
intelligent. China is an important country in the world, with
its stability and development playing a pivotal role in the
world's stability and development.
</P>
<P>
Cooke told Jiang that he had paid close attention to China's
economic construction and development for years. He expressed his
admiration for China's achievements, in particular its success in
feeding and clothing its 1.2 billion people.
</P>
<P>
Cooke and his party are here as guests of the Chinese People's
Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries (CPAFFC). CPAFFC
President Qi Huaiyuan was present at the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Lhalu: An Eyewitness of Old and New Tibet (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lhalu said, "I stepped out of the jail into the street. To my
surprise, I saw happy people, instead of the beggars who filled
the street in old Tibet."
</P>
<P>
"The Central Government gave me a house with glass windows in
Lhasa, I asked for land to till, and was given 0.3 hectares. I
learned to do farm work," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In June 1978, my wrist watch was lost while I worked in the
field. I told myself not to make a fuss about this as I was a serf
owner in the past. One and a half months later, I was told that my
wrist watch was found by a boy who turned it over to the local
police. The local police worked hard to locate the owner and
finally found it was me," he said.
</P>
<P>
When Lhalu and some others who used to be in the upper strata
of Tibetan society were organized to visit other parts of Tibet,
Lhalu discovered starling changes. Shannan sold mountains of
surplus grain to the State and Nyingchi, a barren area in the past,
was home to more than 100 enterprises in the textile, power
generating and printing fields.
</P>
<P>
"From these I came to understand that the Democratic Reform is
a must," said Lhalu. "The Tibetan race will enjoy a bright future
under CPC rule and by taking the socialist road."
</P>
<P>
In 1977, Lhalu was elected a member of the National Committee
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC)
and in April 1983, he was elected vice-chairman of the CPPCC Tibet
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Lhalu has completed his lengthy memoirs entitled Rise and Fall
of the Lhalu Clan. "I committed crimes against the Tibetan people.
Over the past four decades following the peaceful liberation of
Tibet, however, the CPC and the people didn't show any prejudice
against me," said Lhalu.
</P>
<P>
"The Tibetans, under the leadership of the CPC and with the
support of the Chinese people as a whole, have driven the
imperialist forces out of the region and China at large."
</P>
<P>
"I lead a comfortable life now. I miss my colleagues who are
still exiled. There is a Tibetan saying: Old bird misses forests
and old people miss hometown," he said.

Meanwhile, asset assessment will be confined to trust companies
that have gone bankrupt, or have been closed down, restructured or
merged.

Beijing Business Consultation Corporation of 250 Beijing residents
shows that Beijing residents have a strong environmental
protection awareness.
</P>
<P>
Almost all the respondents cited environment as one of three
important factors affecting the living quality. Nearly 71 percent

</P>
<P>
The survey also indicates that nearly 88 percent of the
respondents are ready to use cloth bags instead of plastic bags to

</P>
<P>
In addition, more than a half of the respondents have used one

<HEADLINE> Asian Convention on Bottled Water Opens in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 24 (Xinhua) -- More than 300 experts of the
bottled water industry from all over the world gathered at a
convention here Monday to discuss sales and marketing strategies,
market trends in Asia and new production technologies for bottled
water.
</P>
<P>
The three-day convention, sponsored by the Asia Chapter of the
International Bottled Water Association (IBWA), which was
inaugurated Monday morning, consists of an exhibition and a series
of seminars.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition features displays of advanced production
facilities and technologies, information systems, raw materials,
and packaging and labeling equipment.
</P>
<P>
Edmond Tsui, president of the IBWA Asia Chapter, said at the
opening of the meeting that people in Asia have enjoyed great
improvement in their living.
</P>
<P>
Consumers are getting more health conscious and they are urging
for better quality drinking water. Marketers thus have been
competing to supply products of higher quality standard and
greater variety to meet the increasing demand of customers, he
said.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released by IBWA's Asia Chapter, the
total volume of bottled water consumed in Asia in 1998 was 11.93
billion liters, representing an 8 percent increase over 1997.
</P>
<P>
Thailand was the largest market, consuming a total of 4.2
billion liters.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese mainland came in second, having consumed 2.9
billion liters in 1998, representing a 21 percent increase over
the previous year. This amount was equivalent to about a quarter
of the total Asian consumption of water in the same period.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years the mainland market has experienced an
annual growth in demand for water of more than 20 percent,
demonstrating the enormous potential for future growth.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong consumed over 270 million liters of bottled water in
1998, ranking sixth in Asia. In the past few years, sales of
bottled water in Hong Kong have grown by double-digit figures
every year, surpassing the overall growth of its economy.
</P>
<P>
Despite the economic downturn, the industry still maintained
positive growth of between 6 and 7 percent, indicating growing
versatility in the local market.
</P>
<P>
Tsui said it is a top priority for the Asia Chapter to offer
guidelines and support to water industries in countries that need
to institute rules and regulations. Continuous public education
and promotion of IBWA's quality standard is equally important.
</P>
<P>
IBWA is a reputable trade association with more than 1,200
members from the bottled water industry. Its mission is to
establish stringent standards for the bottled water industry and
to assure that safe and clean bottled water is produced and
marketed to consumers.
</P>
<P>
The Asia Chapter comprises 202 members in 33 Asian countries.

In an interview with a German television shortly after his

Gerhard Schroeder and his government ministers would make their
best efforts to push for a political solution to the crisis. He

<HEADLINE> Two Ugandan Soldiers Killed in Clash with DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- At least two soldiers of the Uganda
People's Defense Forces (UPDF) were killed over the weekend when
Ugandan army deployed in the eastern part of the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) clashed with the rebels there.
</P>
<P>
The clash, which occurred in the northeastern city of
Kisangani, appeared to be linked to last week's split in the rebel
Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD), the Monitor paper reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The shoot-out started when opponents of ousted rebel leader
Ernest Wamba dia Wamba tried to stop a protest march in Kisangani
by his supporters.
</P>
<P>
The internal split between the top leaders of the RCD has been
deepening over the past few weeks. Last week, some founding
members of the RCD ousted Wamba and named Emile Ilunga as their
new leader.
</P>
<P>
Wamba, who is usually supported by Uganda, rejected the move
and denounced it as a coup d'etat.
</P>
<P>
Uganda Army Commander Jeje Odongo confirmed the shootings, but
declined to give any detail concerning the incident, the report
added.
</P>
<P>
Regional analysts feared that this exchange of fire might
further split the already fragmented country.
</P>
<P>
Uganda, one of the key backers of the rebels bent in toppling
DRC President Laurent Kabila, has maintained a large military
presence in the eastern part of the central African country to
allegedly protect its long border there.
</P>
<P>
There were reports that Ugandan troops had clashed with the
Rwandan soldiers, but both Kampala and Kigali denied the
allegations.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Senate to Probe Marcos Account </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will leave
it to the Senate to verify reports about a 13 billion U.S. dollar
account supposedly maintained by heirs of the late president
Ferdinand Marcos abroad, a government official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said that he is willing to
cooperate with the Senate probers, even as he denied anew his
involvement in a reported plot to recover the wealth.
</P>
<P>
"I am ready to cooperate with the Senate. But I am not involved
in ongoing operations to recover the wealth," he said in a radio
interview.
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, reports linked Zamora to an alleged "clandestine
operation" seeking to recover the wealth.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, Zamora tapped the services of
Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Task Force chief director
Panfilo Lacson for the "operation."
</P>
<P>
The reports stemmed from a transcript of a telephone
conversation between bounty hunter Reiner Jacobi and former
Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) chairman David
Castro.
</P>
<P>
Zamora also said President Joseph Estrada ordered an immediate
verification of the reports immediately after learning of them.
</P>
<P>
"The president instructed PCGG Chairman Magdangal Elma to get
to the bottom of this, and Chairman Elma has been communicating
with the Swiss authorities," Zamora said.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Say China Needs Computer Science </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- China needs to step up the
development of computer science and apply it to major projects to
tackle complicated problems, according to a group of scientists
here.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a recent symposium on large-scale computer science,
Gui Wenzhuang, director of the High-Tech Bureau of the Chinese
Academy of Sciences (CAS), said that China has developed large
computers capable of making 100 billion calculations per second.
</P>
<P>
The large-scale computers have been applied to the research on
material science, life science, cosmography, meteorology, space
and other areas, said Gui.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the computer's capacity has made it possible to
tackle very complicated problems, said Gui, adding that
computation, experiments and theoretical analysis have become
three important means in scientific research.
</P>
<P>
Sun Jiachang, a research fellow with the Software Institute of
CAS, said that the Boeing Company of the United States designs
airplanes with computers, and the simulated experiments in the
wind tunnel are also conducted by computers.
</P>
<P>
He said China should also step up the development of computer
science to shift the important research to computation.
</P>
<P>
"It's a change of the research concept and means," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yu Dehao, vice-director of the Institute of Mathematics and
Scientific Project Computer, said that theoretical analysis has
its limits in many complicated problems, and experiments are not
feasible or too costly in areas such as space science,
microphenomenon, particle disintegration and galaxy evolution.
</P>
<P>
He said that scientists have to turn to computer science to
tackle many of the complicated problems. And the development of
the computer science should aim at meeting national demand.
</P>
<P>
Gui Wenzhuang said that China should make full use of its
resources of large parallel computers and push forward the
development of other sciences.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the hardware in some Chinese institutes have met
the United States' standard of the mid-1990s, but are not fully
utilized. China should make an effort to develop efficient
computing methods in the coming five years.

<HEADLINE> Manila Reminds Oil Firms of Social Responsibility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government Monday
reminded oil firms of their responsibility to the public as it
questioned their decision to impose another round of oil price
increases in the country.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora branded as inconsiderate the
reported plan of some big oil companies to impose another round of
oil price hikes.
</P>
<P>
"They should understand that they have a responsibility to the
public and not just their shareholders," Zamora said in a radio
interview.
</P>
<P>
He also said the move of these oil companies may prompt some
people to hoard oil products.
</P>
<P>
But he said the government is not likely to get back into the
business of controlling oil prices.

<P>
CAIRO, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading Egyptian newspapers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said Sunday President
Hosni Mubarak's talks with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
focused on the status of the Middle East peace process and the
results of the recent Israeli elections. "We must wait for the
formation of the Israeli government but the peace process must be
revived with clear measures on the ground," he said.
</P>
<P>
Al-Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak started
consultations to form the new Israeli government, the Israeli
Radio reported Sunday. Barak will declare the outlines of his
government Monday and refer them to his partners expected to join

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Bombing Victims Charge U.S. with Negligence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Some 545 Kenyan individuals and
families affected by the U.S.embassy bombing last August have
filed a complaint against the U.S. government for its abuse of
duty and negligence in rescuing Kenyans.
</P>
<P>
Phillip Musolino, an American lawyer representing the victims
of the bomb blast, last week sued the U.S. State Department in a
U.S. court for a compensation of an average of 200,000 U.S.
dollars for each victim, the East African Standard weekly reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Musolino argued in a complaint that American rescuers at the
scene of the embassy attack, which killed 213 people and injured
about 5,000 others, did not give timely assistance to wounded
Kenyans, and instead focused only on U.S. casualties.
</P>
<P>
The complaint also claimed that the U.S. failed to warn Kenyan
authorities about a suspected threat of terrorist violence.
</P>
<P>
The complaint said that before the twin bombings in Kenya's
capital Nairobi and Tanzanian capital Dar es Salaam on August 7,
the United States had received information of possible attacks on
American targets in Africa.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials were guilty of further negligence in not
securing the Nairobi embassy against a possible bombing, the
lawyer argued.
</P>
<P>
The legal action initiated by Musolino is separate from the
suits filed early this year by another lawyer John Burris, who
represents about 2,300 Kenyan victims.
</P>
<P>
U.S. government lawyers are scheduled to respond to Musolino's
motion on May 28.
</P>
<P>
Musolino said it may take three years or longer to reach a
settlement.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Offers Prisons for Rwandan Genocide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has offered to provide prison
 facilities for convicts of the 1994 Rwanda genocide, the
International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) said.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia newspaper Monday quoted the U.N. court as
saying in a press release reaching here that it has reached an
agreement in principle with the Zambian government for this
purpose, and that the agreement is expected to be formalized
shortly.
</P>
<P>
If the agreement is signed, Zambia will become the second
country, following Mali, to accept prisoners of 1994 Rwanda
genocide in which more than 500,000 people were massacred.
</P>
<P>
On February 12 this year, the tribunal's registrar signed with
the government of Mali an agreement whereby the west African
country undertook to provide prison facilities for the enforcement
of the court's prison sentences.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the court said more African countries have expressed
 willingness to accept the Rwanda genocide prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations are at an advanced stage with the governments of
Benin and Madagascar on this issue, it added.
</P>
<P>
The ICTR, based in Arusha town in northern Tanzania, was
created by the United Nations Security Council in November 1994
after the genocide happened that year.
</P>
<P>
Several Scandinavian countries have also offered to provide
prisons for the genocide convicts, but the court preferred to let
them serve sentences in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The reason, according to Tom Kennedy, chief official of press
and public affairs of the court, is that Rwanda genocide is an
African problem.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand's Fruit Industry Heading for Record Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, May 24 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's fruit industry is
heading for a record year, with exports likely to exceed the 1.05
billion NZ dollars (578 million U.S. dollars) earned in the year
ending June 1998.
</P>
<P>
The latest issue of New Zealand's Export News, a fortnightly
newspaper published in South Island's Christchurch, quoted Peter
Silcock, convenor of the Fruit Industry Innovation Council of New
Zealand, as saying that innovation is the "key to the industry's
continued success".
</P>
<P>
"A great deal has already been achieved. We have new fruit
varieties like the distinctively different kiwifruit Zespri Gold
which will make a big impact over the next decade. Our brands like
Enza and Zespri have won worldwide recognition," he said.
</P>
<P>
Silcock said work on identifying future directions for the
fruit industry shows there are tremendous opportunities in the
development of new fruit varieties, leveraging its intellectual
property, better techniques for growing and storing fruit and
dynamic marketing.
</P>
<P>
"We have introduced environmentally friendly growing
techniques. Then we have a company like Horticulture Automation
which has a big reputation for its state-of-the-art fruit grading
equipment and is winning export orders in many overseas
countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Silcock told the Export News that his council will, like its
predecessor (the Fruit Research Council of New Zealand), place its
focus on the research and development of the fruit industry within
the context of the wider industry and close regard to commercial
results.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Minister Suggests New Items in Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Tourism Minister Henry
Kosgey has advised stakeholders in the industry to explore new
opportunities like mountain climbing and bird watching in a bid
to rejuvenate the tourism sector.
</P>
<P>
Tourism, fourth biggest foreign currency earner for Kenya, has
been in a depressed situation, registering a decline since early
1990s.
</P>
<P>
If the stakeholders want to realize the target of two million
visitors by the year 2002, they can not rely solely on beach and
safari tourism, Kosgey said.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Nation newspaper Monday quoted Kosgey as saying that
it was high time for stakeholders to start marketing mountain
climbing and bird watching as tourist attractions.
</P>
<P>
If well-packaged and aggressively marketed, cruise tourism,
sports, culture and conference tours could also help the country
hit its target of two million tourists by 2002, Kosgey said
Saturday in Mombasa, the east African country's biggest port and
beach resort.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister said safari and beach tourism should not
be abandoned but rather re-packaged to make them sensitive to
environmental protection and sustainable tourism.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Govt Offers Incentives to Sugar Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- In line with centerpiece agenda to
guarantee food security, the Philippine government is now taking
steps to accelerate the rehabilitation of the sugar industry, a
government news release said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada was quoted as saying that
the government is offering incentives to sugar planters and
producers so they would invest in upgrading their equipment and
facilities.
</P>
<P>
Among these incentives is a guarantee fund of 110 million pesos
(2.75 million U.S. dollars) for farmers to buy tractors, the news
release said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the problems plaguing the industry can be traced
to sugar producers and millers who are not willing to invest in
new equipment and farmers who do not use high-yielding varieties
of sugar.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Estrada unveiled a 40-billion-peso (1 billion U.S.
dollars), five-year program to modernize the sugar industry, which
he said has become a sunset industry because of government neglect
over the last several years.
</P>
<P>
The five-year plan aims to make the country self-sufficient in
sugar and restore its role as a global player in the world market.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Likely to Cut Sugar Export As Warned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 24 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is likely to cut
its sugar export to avert an industry crisis following a warning
by the London-based International Sugar Organization (ISO), the
Star newspapers reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
In its latest report, the ISO warned leading exporters to cut
sugar output by ten percent, or six million tons, to avoid a
crisis.
</P>
<P>
International sugar prices have tumbled to a 13-year low in the
past six months. The raw price of sugar fell from a monthly
average of 250 U.S. dollars a ton in October 1997 to 162 dollars
in September last year. There has been little improvement since
then.
</P>
<P>
The reduced prices represent less than half the cost of
production, and all sugar-producing nations report they are losing
money.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, among the world's top ten sugar exporters, has
also suffered from the reduced prices.
</P>
<P>
The world's major sugar exporters - Brazil, the European Union,
Thailand, Australia, Colombia, Guatemala, Mexico and South Africa
- produce an estimated 62 million tons of sugar a year.
</P>
<P>
South Africa exports about 1.3 millions tons of sugar, about
half of its production, mostly to Asia, the Middle East and
Africa.

<HEADLINE> Lhalu: An Eyewitness of Old and New Tibet (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Lhalu Cewang Doje, one of the
largest serf-owners in old Tibet, said that the Tibetans have made
continuous progress in socialist construction and Tibet has won
achievements impossible in the past.
</P>
<P>
"From the progress Tibet has made I learn that only socialism
can save Tibet and Tibet can make progress only within the big
family of the motherland," said 80-year-old Lhalu, quoted by the
latest issue of "China's Tibet".
</P>
<P>
The Lhalu clan was very influential in Tibet historically as
two members of the clan were Dalai Lamas. In old Tibet, Lhalu
Cewang Doje owned a score of large and small manors and thousands
of slaves. As the high-ranking official of the local government,
he did his best, including attempt to rely on imperialist forces,
to defend the prerogative of serf-owners, and stood for "Tibetan
independence".
</P>
<P>
When Tibet achieved peaceful liberation in 1951, he was forced
by the general situation to accept the reality and was still
pondering how to maintain the interests of the three estate-
holders in power.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the Communist Party of China (CPC) and Government
leaders arranged for people from various walks of life in Tibet to
visit the hinterland. Lhalu served as delegation leader, and was
received by Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai during the
national day celebrations on October 1.
</P>
<P>
Lhalu and his delegation visited Beijing and Shanghai, where he
paid a visit to Mr. Rong Yiren, a capitalist. Upon returning home,
he made a detailed report to the Gaxag government of Tibet, which,
however, paid no heed.
</P>
<P>
In 1957, when Lhalu was appointed the granary chief, the 14th
Dalai Lama received him. Lhalu was greatly moved by the
appointment and vowed to be faithful to Dalai Lama.
</P>
<P>
In March 1959, reactionaries in the upper echelon of Tibetan
society rebelled and Lhalu served as commander of the rebel army.
</P>
<P>
The rebels were soon put to rout, with the 14th Dalai Lama
fleeing to India and Lhalu arrested by People's Liberation Army
troops.
</P>
<P>
"I thought I would be executed," Lhalu said. "So, I was very
stubborn in the beginning. But the government sent people to
explain policies in great detail and with great patience," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In August 1965, I was released and my gold earrings, gold
wrist watch and pen, which were taken away when I was thrown into
jail, were returned to me."

<HEADLINE> China to Strengthen Inspection on Fishing Boats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- China will strengthen inspection of
fishing boats in the next few years to ensure safety, according to
the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is now formulating a series of regulations and
rules to make inspection more effective.
</P>
<P>
Bao Shengqing, director of the ministry's Bureau of Fishing
Vessel Inspection, said that the small number of inspected vessels
has been a factor causing marine incidents. He said the accidents
are due primarily to the absence of a whole range of laws and
regulations, fishermen's lack of safety awareness and the
negligence of local authorities.
</P>
<P>
To implement the rules effectively, the country also plans to
improve the management and supervision of the inspection agencies
and inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The ministry promulgated a rule on fishing boat inspectors
last year and is now providing training for them.
</P>
<P>
The rule stated that by 2001, all fishing boat inspectors must
have qualification certificates.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also plans to introduce a scrapping system for
fishing vessels, said Bao, adding that the service length and the
standards for scrapping are being studied.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Bigamy Laws Fail to Stop Concubines in Guangzhou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Judicial departments in Guangzhou
reached an agreement in April 1998 on stopping the practice of
having concubines and bigamy, which was rampant in the southern
China city adjacent to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
A year later, however, no one has been prosecuted for these
crimes.
</P>
<P>
Keeping concubines or unlicensed prostitutes become acts of
bigamy and punishable according to this local law, which was
widely hailed across China and became a cover story in the media
immediately after its promulgation.
</P>
<P>
But the Guangzhou Municipal People's Procuratorate says that it
is yet to handle a such a case because the police, who are
authorized to investigate such cases, have not done their job. An
official with the Guangzhou Municipal Party Committee in charge of
law and order explains that the reason for the lack of cases is
the different understanding of the Criminal Procedure Law.
</P>
<P>
The newly revised law says that prosecutors can no longer
investigate acts of bigamy, so victims think that public
prosecutors have been deprived of the right to bring such cases to
the court and, as a result, have lost because of an inability to
find evidence.
</P>
<P>
However, police are still supposed to investigate such cases
and bring them before a prosecutor. But, due to different views of
the Criminal Procedure Law, the police has done nothing, the Party
official says.
</P>
<P>
Ding Lu, head of the Women's Rights Protection Department of
the All-China Federation of Women, says that bigamy and
concubinage have become a serious social problem and that judicial
offices across the country need to take steps to deal with this.

<HEADLINE> Han Dynasty Tomb Discovered in Xi'an </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists have dug up
130 funerary items from a tomb dating back to the Han Dynasty (206
B.C.-220 A.D.) in Shangzhou in Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The tomb has a passageway and a front coffin chamber, 1.6
meters long and 3.3 meters deep. It was found recently during
construction work at the provincial power supply bureau.
</P>
<P>
The unearthed objects include over 100 coins, an iron sword
that was put on the chest of the tomb's occupants, an iron stove,
a copper basin, and some earthenware.
</P>
<P>
Judging from the burial items, the tomb's owner was a high-
ranking general at the end of the Western Han and beginning of the
Eastern Han dynasties, a turbulent period with numerous wars. The
iron stove was believed to be used for cooking while on the move.
The iron sword is well preserved.
</P>
<P>
The reason of the man's death remains a mystery.

<HEADLINE> Oldest Edition Of Confucian Classic Discovered (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scholars have
identified a collection of bamboo slips unearthed in a 2,000-year-
old tomb as the earliest edition of the Confucian Analects.
</P>
<P>
The bamboo version was found in a tomb in Hebei Province, which
archeologists say belongs to an emperor of the Han Dynasty (206 BC
-- 220 AD) and dates back possibly to 55 BC.
</P>
<P>
The tomb was first discovered in the early 1990s by local
farmers who were digging water control facilities. A great number
of bamboo slips have been unearthed, but most of the characters on
them were illegible and archeologists had to use modern techniques
to reveal their true nature. Ultimately they reached the
conclusion that some of them were from the Analects, a collection
of major doctrines and sayings of the educator and philosopher
Confucius (551 -- 479 BC).
</P>
<P>
The book is more than 2,000 years old and is the earliest
edition of a Confucian work ever found, according to Xie Fei, the
director of the Hebei Cultural Relics Research Institute, who
examined the slips along with scholars from the State Cultural
Relics Bureau and Beijing's Palace Museum.
</P>
<P>
The collection consists of more than 620 bamboo slips, which
were used by the ancient Chinese before the use of paper was
popularized. They measure 16.2 centimeters by 0.7 centimeters and
contain as many as 20 characters each. There are also traces of
the silk strings that were used to connect them.

<HEADLINE> Fate of Some Iranian POWs Clarified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The fate of some Iranian prisoners
of war (POWs) have been clarified during recent talks between Iran
and Iraq, head of the Iranian POWs Commission Brigadier General
Abdullah Najafi announced on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Najafi said that the POWs, including 64 released by Iraq
during the past six months, had been taken captive after the
1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said that delegations from the two countries held fruitful
talks on the fate of remaining POWs on November 26 and May 17.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian delegation also gained first hand information
about the fate of a number of other POWs, Najafi said, adding that
coordination would be made with the International Committee of the
Red Cross (ICRC) to decide their fate and inform their families
following completion of the investigations.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Iraqi POWs, the Iranian official said that over
the past six months, Iran released 622 Iraqi POWs under the
ICRC's supervision.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran arranged the ICRC to meet with 3,479 Iraqi
POWs on August 13, 1998 and they preferred to live in Iran and
refused to return home.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting on March 7-17, six out of 108 Iraqi POWS
interviewed by the ICRC preferred to go home and they were
delivered to Iraqi officials under the ICRC's supervision, Najafi
said.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC would continue meeting with Iraqi refugees this year
and Iran would arrange the meetings at a suitable time, he said.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Iraq exchanged 53 Iranian POWs for 450 Iraqis under an
agreement reached in March, raising the number of POWs swapped
since 1991 to 55,438 Iraqis and 39,417 Iranians.
</P>

COLOMBO, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Tamil rebels of
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) have once again targeted
the country's capital city Colombo, police sources said Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to military intelligence a lorry loaded with
explosives had left for Colombo from Vavuniya in North Central
province with six tiger cadres to attack a prime target.
</P>
<P>
All police stations and military units in and around Colombo
have been placed on full alert since last Saturday to look out for
the lorry.
</P>
<P>
Security at key government installations has also been
tightened.
</P>
<P>
Two LTTE suspects who had been arrested at Vavuniya last week
had revealed details of the planned attack on Colombo.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Colombo was hit by a wave of bomb attacks.
Police suspected that the Tamil rebels had sent bomb squads to
disrupt civilian life.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting a separatist war against the Sri
Lankan government since 1983 for a Tamil homeland in the north and
east of the country.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Launches Nation-Wide Anti-AIDS Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is to enhance its activities
against AIDS by launching an anti-AIDS month from May 25-June 30,
local press reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the nation-wide campaign is to further raise public
awareness of the danger of the deadly disease as well as the
necessity to care for HIV carriers.
</P>
<P>
The campaign focuses on the necessary measures for families and
communities to curb the spread of the epidemic as well as to care
for HIV/AIDS carriers.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has been cited by the United Nations as a good example
in terms of strong political commitment as well as effective
prevention of the spread of HIV injection, said Chung A, vice
chairman of Vietnam's National Anti-AIDS Committee.
</P>
<P>
He said the campaign will encourage people to use condoms and
not to share hypodermic needles with anyone.
</P>
<P>
About 85 percent of HIV cases, mostly young people, have been
infected with the virus through injections.
</P>
<P>
The campaign commemorates the fourth anniversary on the
introduction of state laws to fight the deadly disease on May 31
and the International AIDS Prevention Day which falls on June 5.
</P>
<P>
Up to mid-May, more than 13,000 Vietnamese people have been
diagnosed HIV positive and more than 2,440 have contracted fully
developed AIDS and 1,292 died.
</P>
<P>
The epidemic is reportedly spreading at an alarming rate in
Vietnam's northern cities and provinces such as Quang Ninh, Hai
Phong, Lang Son and Hanoi.

<HEADLINE> 20,000 Die During Child Birth Annually in Bangladesh: UNICEF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- About 20,000 women die every year in
Bangladesh due to delivery-related complications, which is one of
the highest in the world, according to a study of the United
Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) available
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The main reasons behind the deaths are excessive bleeding,
obstructed labor, sepsis, abortion and eclampsia, the study
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
There are about 600,000 complicated delivery cases in the
country a year, 90 percent of which are conducted at home by
"untrained birth attendants," it said, adding that about four
million women give birth every year, 60 percent of whom are anemic
and malnourished.
</P>
<P>
The services for the management of complications are also
inadequate and under-utilized in the country, it noted.
</P>
<P>
Besides, about 30 to 50 percent of the new-born babies have low
birth weight -- less than 2.5 kilograms, and of every 1,000 babies
born alive, 12 die within hours of birth, with eight of them due
to injury during deliveries, it revealed.
</P>
<P>
Almost 75 percent of the mothers die due to delivery-related
complications and do not live to see the first birthday of their
babies, it further stated.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government has undertaken a UNICEF-funded
special program called "Comprehensive Emergency Obstetric Care" to
avert the above-mentioned unnecessary deaths. The program will be
implemented to strengthen the capacity of health centers for safe
delivery practices in the country.
</P>
<P>
The program aims at reducing annual maternal deaths by 50
percent, increasing the number of normal deliveries attended by
trained traditional birth attendants and increasing uptake of pre-
and post-natal care services.

<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian National Assembly
President Prince Norodom Ranariddh left here Monday by a special
plane for Hanoi, Vietnam, starting his eight-day official
good-will visit to the country.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh told reporters at the Pochentong airport that the aim
of his visit is to strengthen friendly cooperation between the two
assemblies and the two countries, but he will also touch upon the
problems such as borders, territorial waters and immigrants during
the talks with Vietnamese leaders.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time Prince Ranariddh leads the National
Assembly delegation to pay an official visit abroad since he
became president of National Assembly last November. The prince
last visited Vietnam in 1995 when he was co-prime minister of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The visit also comes less than one month after Cambodia
formally became a member of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations at a special ceremony held in Hanoi on April 30.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Ranariddh is scheduled to meet with his
Vietnamese counterpart National Assembly Chairman Nong Duc Manh,
President Tran Duc Luong, Prime Minister Phan Van Khai and
Communist Party General Secretary Le Kha Phieu.
</P>
<P>
Besides Hanoi, Ranariddh will also visit the former imperial
city of Hue, Ho Chi Minh City and the northern province of Quang
Ninh.

<HEADLINE> Unemployment Rate Falls Steadily in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's unemployment rate has
fallen to 9.1 percent of the labor force in 1998 from 10.4 percent
the previous year, official sources said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The jobless rate fell steadily, considering the rate of 12.3
percent in 1995, 13.8 percent in 1993 and 15.9 percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The steady decline in unemployment in recent years reflected
the rapid economic growth and the resultant growth of employment
opportunities, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The male unemployment rate declined from 11.8 percent in 1990
to 7.1 percent last year while female unemployment fell at a
faster rate from 23.4 percent to 12.7 percent during the same
period.
</P>
<P>
Employment generation increased by about nine percent in 1998,
pushing the total number of employed persons to 6.08 million from
5.58 million in 1997, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The private sector was employing 82 percent of the total as of
last year, up from 75.6 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The sources attribute the increase to the success of the
government's private-sector-led growth policy and the buoyancy of
the private sector.
</P>
<P>
The favorable incentive schemes backed by prudent
macro-economic management has enabled the country to achieve an
average economic growth rate of over 5 percent during the past
five years, which is cited as another factor of helping generating
job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, 137 enterprises commenced operations under the Board
of Investment, generating 36,200 jobs.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Gov't Decides to Build More Food Godowns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has taken
a decision to build 20 more godowns to provide further food
storage facilities in the next fiscal year starting from July
1999, The Bangladesh Observer daily newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The government will build 20 food godowns at a cost of 90
million taka (about 1.86 million U.S. dollars) from its own
sources, and the food storage capacity of these food godowns will
be 10,000 tons, each with 500-ton capacity, a Food Department
official was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
At present, the government has 639 big and small food godowns
with a storage capacity of over 1.8 million tons, but the
effective storage capacity is roughly 1.5 million tons, he stated.
</P>
<P>
Of the total food godowns, 621 are local supply depots with a
storage capacity of 118,300 tons, 13 are central storage depots
with a storage capacity of 474,800 tons and the rest five are
silos with a storage capacity of 225,800 tons.
</P>
<P>
The present food grains stock position of the government is
over 1.3 million tons, which is satisfactory, he stated.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh will harvest a record 22.5 million tons of rice and
wheat in 1998-99, despite the century's worst flood that ravaged
the country last year and the severe drought this year, according
to the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
With a population of 126 million, this agriculture-based South
Asian country's annual needs of food grains is about 21 million
tons leaving a net surplus of 500,000 tons of food grains during
the current fiscal year after the earmarked one million tons as
seeds.

<HEADLINE> Analysts See Few Price Hikes for Building Materials in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The price of building materials in
China is not likely to pick up substantially this year although
fluctuations are possible, according to China Material News.
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts say that the supply of building materials is
adequate and can meet most demand so there is no reason for prices
to go up. In the past, when supply failed to meet demand, high
prices prompted many manufacturers to expand production.
</P>
<P>
Production of major building materials like steel, cement, and
plate glass has grown a great deal since the early 1990s, leading
to an oversupply on the domestic market, the paper says.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, China produced 105 million tons of steel, a 90 percent
increase from 1992, while cement production jumped 72 percent to
510 million tons, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Although the present low prices of building materials will have
a negative effect on many manufacturers, large producers with low
production cost are doing a lot to expand market shares, and this
upward trend in building materials production will continue unless
prices hit a slump, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
Imports of building materials have continued to grow as well,
adding to the glut in the domestic market, the paper says,
attributing the growth to the sustained low price level on the
global market at a time when the slowdown in world economic growth
leads to an oversupply.
</P>
<P>
In addition, declining production costs of domestic building
materials enterprises have discouraged price hikes in China,
analysts say.

<HEADLINE> Ruling Party Asks Habibie to Pay Attention to Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian ruling Golkar Party
General Chairman Akbar Tanjung said President B.J. Habibie did not
pay serious attention to security problems after his one-year of
rule as some cases of violence in the country remained unsolved.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued on Sunday night, Golkar said prior to
the June 7 polls many Indonesian citizens fled the country for
fear of unrest.
</P>
<P>
"This means that President Habibie could not give a sense of
security to the community," Akbar said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has been hit by a spate of riots following the
downfall of former President Soeharto on May 21 1998 amid the
country's worst economic and political crisis in decades.
</P>
<P>
The riots and unrest in Ambon, capital of Maluku province,
since January 19 until mid-May have left at least 350 dead and
some 6,000 houses burnt down.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the number of people leaving Indonesia
from Soekarno Hatta International Airport here has increased in
recent weeks. About 350,000 people went abroad from the airport in
April, while the figure is likely to reach 400,000 this month.
</P>
<P>
The people leaving the country amid fears that unrest could
erupt during the ongoing general election campaign, the reports
said.
</P>
<P>
Akbar said in the press release that Habibie also has not done
his utmost to implement the mandate and decrees of the People's
Consultative Assembly (MPR) especially on the eradication of
corrupt, collusive and nepotistic practices.
</P>
<P>
The people still question how serious Habibie has traced the
alleged wealth of former president Soeharto and his family.

<HEADLINE> Time Is Ripe for Consumer Credit in China: Banker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- A People's Bank of China official
said today that China has all the necessary conditions to develop
the consumer credit business.
</P>
<P>
Huang Jiaquan, of the central bank's monetary department, said
that most urban Chinese consumers are now turning their attention
to more costly consuming items and that consumer credit has become
a necessity to bridge the gap between income and expenditure.
</P>
<P>
Although the number of consumers who actually understand the
consumer credit business and who want to use credit is generally
speaking not very big, the amount of potential consumer credit
business is considerable, Huang noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that, after 20 years of rapid development, China has
sufficient material supplies and a solid foundation for consumer
credit. In addition, the income of consumers and the ability of
financial institutions to offer funds can meet the needs of
consumer credit development.
</P>
<P>
According to him, consumer credit is an important way to
stimulate consumer spending and can help promote economic
development by expanding purchasing power. It can also help
improve banks' assets, minimize financial risks, and promote the
establishment of a social credit system.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out, there are still many restrictions to
developing consumer credit, both socially and economically, and
central government departments concerned should design necessary
policies to improve social conditions for consumer credit.

<HEADLINE> New Reservoir Put into Service in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, May 24 (Xinhua) -- One more new reservoir was put into
service in Bago township, 80 kilometers away from Myanmar's
capital of Yangon, to get drinking water, control flood and
extend cultivation in Bago division.
</P>
<P>
The Mazin Reservoir, inaugurated on Sunday, is 1,230 meters
long and 18 meters high and was built on Mazin Creek at a cost of
over 916,000 U.S. dollars, official The New Light of Myanmar
newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The reservoir is capable of supplying 50 million liters of
drinking water to the Bago township daily and irrigating 263.25
hectares of farmland.
</P>
<P>
Bago division gets much rain in the rainy season and it faces
flood every year as it is unable to control rain water that flows
down from Bago Yoma mountain range, but there is scarcity of water
in the hot season.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Lieutenant-General Tin Oo, second secretary
of the Myanmar State Peace and Development Council, as saying that
the government relies on Bago division in production of paddy,
placing emphasis on extended cultivation of the crop.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the inauguration ceremony for the reservoir, he
expects modern farmlands to emerge soon as national entrepreneurs
are engaged in reclamation of thousands of hectares of fallow and
virgin lands in the division.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, Myanmar has built 98 irrigation facilities
throughout the country in the past 10 years.

<P>
COLOMBO, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka has spent one billion
rupees (14 million U.S. dollars) for the rehabilitation and
reconstruction of the civil war-ravaged Trincomalee district in
the east since 1996, the official Daily News said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Minister M.H.M. Ashraff said
the government had given priority to redress the grievances of
displaced persons in the district and provide other amenities to

The ongoing civil war between the government and Tamil rebels
since 1983 have left hundreds of thousands people displaced and
homeless in the north and east of the country where rebels demand
a separate homeland.

The minister charged that the previous government had delayed
relief to refugees and war victims but the present government took
prompt action to rehabilitate and reconstruct destroyed towns.
</P>
<P>
"This government resettled about 80 percent of families who
were suffering in refugee camps earlier," said Ashraff.
</P>
<P>
The government also had provided basic facilities such as
water, electricity and shelter to many victims, he added.

<HEADLINE> Scientist: Rare Fish Spices Need Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, May 24 (Xinhua) -- A member of the Chinese Sturgeon
Institute says recently that the rare species of fish is in bad
need of protection.
</P>
<P>
Yi Jifang says that their numbers have decreased because of the
Gezhouba Hydro-electric Power Project on the Yangtze River which
prevents them from swimming upstream to spawn on the upper reaches.
</P>
<P>
A study of the fish before and after of the building of the
project shows that a ratio of male to female sturgeons out of
proportion over the past four years with the number of male
sturgeon dropping, but with their body length increasing and the
life expectancies of female and male sturgeon increasing by 2
years and 3.5 years respectively.
</P>
<P>
Scientists say that the hydro-electric power project has
affected the breeding patterns and that the pollution and catching
are also to be blamed for the reduced population size of the rare
fish.
</P>
<P>
Yi says, however, that a natural breeding site for the fish,
which is on the verge of extinction, has formed near Gezhouba Dam
and that their numbers can be increased through artificial
insemination.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The entire Metro Manila police force
is on full alert in anticipation of massive protest actions to be
staged on Monday by militant labor groups opposing the
ratification of the proposed Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA)
between the Philippines and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Star newspaper said police and military
intelligence reports showed that two groups have been preparing
for a mammoth rally in front of the Senate building.
</P>
<P>
Police and military units have been ordered to monitor closely
all ongoing activities and to take necessary and appropriate
action, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Senate security forces and police clashed with some
300 anti-VFA demonstrators who tried to storm the Senate building.
</P>
<P>
The VFA, signed by Manila and Washington last year, would pave
the way for resumption of annual large scale joint military
exercises between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Senate is due to vote on the agreement on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The opponents oppose the pact because it gives Washington
jurisdiction over U.S. troops who may commit crimes in the
country.
</P>
<P>
They say that the pact also exposes the Philippines to nuclear
threats because it does not require the U.S. to declare whether it
has weapons aboard visiting ships.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong's Foreign Trade Balancing Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The export volume of South
China's Guangdong Province dropped 17.8 percent in the first four
months of the year, but the fall off is slowing down month by
month.
</P>
<P>
Huang Ziqang, director of the provincial foreign economy and
trade commission, expects that the export, which stood at 19.816
billion U.S. dollars in the first four month, will balance out and
even increase in the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
"China has overcome the impact of the Asian financial crisis
and achieved an 0.5 percent rise in export volume last year,"
Huang said, "and the province also saw a 1.6 percent increase in
its export volume during the same period."
</P>
<P>
Exports in the first month of this year were reported a 40-
percent drop compared with the same period of 1998, but the gap
shrank in the following months, with the rate of fall registering
only 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
The export volume in April reached 5.81 billion US dollars,
making a peak record this year, and only 10 percent down on last
April.
</P>
<P>
At a national trade fair hosted recently in Guangzhou, capital
of Guangdong, foreign trade volume achieved was 2.35 billion US
dollars, 27.3 percent more than the previous fair last year.
</P>
<P>
In Shenzhen, one of the country's earliest special economic
zones, the export volume reached 7.6 billion US dollars in April,
4.4 percent up on the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Exports in the processing trade continued to grow in the first
four months and the structure of export commodities and markets
was further improved. The share of mechanical and electrical
products in exports rose from 45 to 50.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
"To develop foreign trade and attract overseas investment, the
province is holding a major economy and technology trade fair in
Hong Kong, which usually opens in July," Huang said, adding that a
similar fair will be hosted in Japan and some European countries.
</P>
<P>
All these factors indicate that the province's foreign trade is
balancing out and forecast a brighter prospects by the end of this
year, the official noted.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Budget Gap May Soar to 2 Billion U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government may have
to revise its budget deficit target this year to 2 billion U.S.
dollars, 17 percent higher than its original target of 1.71
billion U.S. dollars, to maintain its level of expenditures and
pump prime the economy, the Manila Times newspaper said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu was quoted as saying that
since the government was able to borrow up to 1.93 billion U.S.
dollars from overseas sources to finance its budget deficit, it
can go up to 2 billion U.S. dollars only.
</P>
<P>
The government has so far raised 1.93 billion U.S. dollars from
abroad equivalent to 113 percent of the 1.71-billion-U.S. dollar
projected budget gap.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu's figure is 250 million U.S. dollars lower than the
2.25- billion-U.S. dollar deficit projected by the inter-agency
cash programming committee during its meeting on May 5, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The committee's projection was based on the assumption that
revenue collections would fall short by 516 million U.S. dollars
by yearend, the newspaper said.

was not serious enough and could not do much.
</P>
<P>
To solve the matter, he said, there should be a reversible
probe in that Soeharto and his cronies must prove that they got
their wealth rightfully.
</P>
<P>
With the reversible probe, the Attorney General's Office must
force Soeharto and his cronies to prove that they got the wealth
not through corruption during the former strongman's 32 years of
rule.
</P>
<P>
If they could not prove that they got the wealth rightfully,
they should be sent to jail, Hamzah said at a campaign rally in
Bangil, East Java, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"As a political party channelling the people's aspirations and
proposing a trial of former president Soeharto at the MPR special
session in 1998, PPP feels that it takes a moral responsibility to
uphold the MPR decree. If PPP wins, our first step is to try
former president Soeharto," he said.
</P>
<P>
In a televised appearance last Friday, Soeharto refuted Time's
report that he greedily enriched himself and his family during his
lengthy terms in power.
</P>
<P>
The National Mandate Party leader Amien Rais Sunday dismissed
Soeharto's denial of the Time reports on his KKN practices during
his 32 year rule.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto's denial only "justifies" widespread accusations that
he was involved in decades of KKN practices with his children and
cronies, Raid said in Malang, East Java, on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> New York Beats Atlanta 90-78 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The New York Knicks used another
strong effort by their bench for a 90-78 victory over the Atlanta
Hawks and got a commanding lead in their Eastern Conference
semifinal series Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Chris Dudley scored 10 points in the fourth quarter and grabbed
12 rebounds and helped limit Hawks center Dikembe Mutombo to seven
points as he was part of another strong defensive performance.
</P>
<P>
After allowing Steve Smith to score 17 points in the first half,
the Knicks held him scoreless in the second half. Atlanta had only
11 points in the third quarter and was stuck in the 70s for the
second straight game.
</P>
<P>
Allan Houston and Latrell Sprewell scored 17 points apiece for
the eighth-seeded Knicks, who hold a 3-0 lead and can advance to
the conference finals for the first time since 1994 with another
win at home on Monday. Since the playoffs expanded to 16 teams in
1984, no No. 8 seed team has won two playoff series.
</P>
<P>
Grant Long scored 17 points for the Hawks, who shot just 31
percent (27-of-87) from the field and fell to 0-3 on the road in
the postseason. Atlanta will probably become the only pre-existing
team that has failed to reach the conference finals since the NBA
split into conferences in 1970.
</P>
<P>
No NBA team has won a best-of-seven series after losing the
first three games.

<HEADLINE> Hainan's Imports From Viet Nam Show Big Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Hainan, China's southernmost
province, imported 6.13 million U.S. dollars worth of commodities
from Viet Nam during the January-April period this year, a 249
percent rise on a yearly basis.
</P>
<P>
In the four months, the island province imported 17,967 tons of
goods from Viet Nam across the Beibu Gulf, more than double the
amount a year earlier. The imported commodities are mostly
tropical products such as coconuts, palm oil and natural rubber.
</P>
<P>
The big increase is attributed to Hainan's introduction of a
preferential policy that imposes tariffs on imports from Viet Nam
which is only half the amount charged on imported goods from other
countries.

MANILA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items

</P>
<P>
The Philippine Star:
</P>
<P>
-- The entire Metro Manila police force is on full alert in

<P>
The Philippine Post:
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
The Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- The Philippines is not likely to grant a zero tariff on

<HEADLINE> Northeast China City Promotes Reemployment for Laid-Off Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The port city of Dalian in northeast
China's Liaoning Province has become one of China's most
successful cities in promoting the reemployment of workers laid
off from state-owned enterprises, and guaranteeing their basic
living standards.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, Dalian has helped nearly 200,000 of
these laid-off workers find new jobs. Moreover, last July the city
established a basic living standard guarantee system covering all
local laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
About a year ago, the city government pledged that it would
provide "instant service" for those laid-off workers eager to find
a new job. According to this pledge, any laid-off workers could be
offered a new job within 48 hours after making application.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to this kind of instant service, more than 5,000
formerly laid-off workers and jobless people have found new
employers.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, all the 518 enterprises in Dalian, in
accordance with relevant policies of the central government, have
set up their own Reemployment Service Centers, which are taking
care of the basic needs of more than 50,000 local laid-off workers,
and have helped over 20,000 of them find new jobs.
</P>
<P>
Last April, the city government also decided to give subsidies
to those former laid-off workers who successfully found new jobs
but were receiving very low pay from their new employers. These
subsidies have helped raise their monthly income to some 400 to
640 yuan, greatly relieving their economic difficulties.
</P>
<P>
In the latest move by the city to help laid-off workers, the
labor departments of Dalian have opened a "computer labor
supermarket" which puts all local employment information in a
computer network, offers vocational training, and helps laid-off
workers keep up their personal files and pay their insurance fees.

<HEADLINE> Expert Predicts Stable Real Estate Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- China's real estate market is to
remain stable in the remaining months of this year, says Ouyang
Yonghua of the China Real Estate Index System Office.
</P>
<P>
"The steady growth of urban residents' income stemming from the
country's excellent economic performance has created favorable
conditions for real estate investment and consumption," today's
China Daily quotes Ouyang as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to sources from the State Statistics Bureau, the
average per capita income of urban residents stood at 1,632 yuan (
197 U.S. dollars) in the first quarter of this year, up eight
percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the Regulation on the Public Housing Fund
and the Regulation on Economy Housing Loan Management has also
helped improve housing credit policies, according to Ouyang.
</P>
<P>
He says that economy housing construction will not pose a
threat to the commercial housing market, because commercial
housing has its own characteristics in terms of location and
public facilities.
</P>
<P>
China invested 41.3 billion yuan (4.98 billion U.S. dollars) in
the first quarter of this year, with the amount of land allocated
for real estate development rising 93 percent to 7.42 million
square meters.

<HEADLINE> Team of Women Planters in Northern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, May 24 (Xinhua) -- A team of 280 women in the Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region, north China, have been doing
afforestration work for several years now.
</P>
<P>
One 38-year old mother Yang Jinhua wrote in her diary "What did
I do yesterday? Plant trees. What have I done today and what would
I like to do tomorrow? Plant more trees." She and her team have
made a contribution to the afforestration of the Greater Hinggan
Mountains by planting over 400 hectares of trees every year for
the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
When the planting season comes, they have to work hard all day,
leveling the land and digging from 5:00 in the morning to 7:00 at
night and get calluses on their hands. The most exhausting job is
carrying saplings in a 25-kilogram box for two to three kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Xie Yazhi, a 17-year-old member of the team, once fell off a
single-plank bridge into the water below. Her first reaction, she
says, was not to catch her shoes and scarf, but the saplings
because she would have had to go back to get another bunch of
saplings if those had disappeared.
</P>
<P>
The hard work has brought a lot of happiness and they always
feel excited when they see the trees they have planted growing
taller, explains another member, Yue Xiuying. Over 97 percent of
the trees they plant survive and the team is one of the best in
the region.
</P>
<P>
"Planting trees is a comparatively light forest job," Yue says,
"and besides the salary is quite good."

<HEADLINE> Tube Babies Born in North China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Two couples with sterility problems
in north China's Shanxi Province have recently given birth to
healthy babies thanks to the help of IUI (inner uterus
insemination), an advanced medical technology.
</P>
<P>
The IUI technology in Shanxi is relatively backward compared
with other Chinese provinces, and prior to these two couples, the
province had reported no successful incidence of artificial
insemination.
</P>

Wang Yiding, a medical expert from the Second People's Hospital

WASHINGTON, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The Indiana Pacers survived a 10-
minute field-goal drought in the fourth quarter and swept the
Philadelphia 76ers with an 89-86 victory Sunday to advance to the
Eastern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
The aging but poised Pacers did not want any more to do with
the Sixers, who ran Indiana ragged before Reggie Miller throttled
them with another clutch shot.
</P>
<P>
Miller scored 23 points, saving the Pacers with a running bank
shot that gave them an 84-83 lead with 91 seconds left. That came
after the no-quit Sixers finally followed through one of their
late comebacks to take a lead in the second half for the first
time in the series.
</P>
<P>
Allen Iverson scored 25 points. The Pacers, going to their
fourth conference finals in five years, will play New York or
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Chris Mullin had 16 points, including a 3-pointer with 2:02
left that was the Pacers' first field goal of the fourth quarter
after 13 straight misses.
</P>
<P>
Matt Geiger had 23 points and 13 rebounds for the Sixers, whose
first playoff appearance since 1991 ended in defeat. The Sixers,
with shot-blocker Theo Ratliff out with a calf injury, got 13
points from Eric Snow. Iverson scored 30 points or more in 5 of 8
playoff games.

<HEADLINE> Arrest of Pak Opposition Leader Qazi Hussain Denied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 23 (Xinhua) -- A local administration of
Pakistan Sunday denied an earlier report that Qazi Hussain Ahmad,
leader of major opposition Jamaat-i-Islami (JI), had been
arrested, reported the Associated Press of Pakistan Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The District Administration of Peshawar said they forbade Qazi
from entering the de facto tribal area of Mohmand Agency but
didn't arrest him as was reported.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Commissioner Peshawar Sherzada Khan said, "Qazi was our
guest and he had a cup of tea with us in Peshawar."
</P>
<P>
Later in the evening, Qazi proceeded to Lahore by air, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The official said that District Administration Charsadda had
served a legal notice on Qazi, forbidding him from entering
Mohmand Agency.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Sunday, A JI statement said that Qazi was arrested near
Peshawar, capital of North West Frontier Province (NWFP), when he
was on his way to the tribal area in Muhammad Agency.
</P>
<P>
Qazi Hussain was proceeding to the tribal area to express
solidarity with the people who are protesting against the
government's decision to merge some parts of the agency in settled
areas, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Qazi Hussain was stopped at the entry check post of Mohammad
Agency and was not allowed to the tribal area.
</P>
<P>
The government says that no political activities are allowed in
tribal areas under the existing "Frontier Crimes Regulations."
</P>
<P>
According to a report by the News Network International, an
Islamabad-based independent news agency, a delegation from
Mohammad Agency met Qazi Hussain Saturday in Peshawar and sought
his support for their movement.
</P>
<P>
The JI chief declared his full support to the tribal people and
planned to visit the area as a sign of support, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Several people have been killed in the latest protest campaign
against the NWFP government's decision to merge several villages
of Mohammad Agency in the settled districts of Peshawar and
Charsadda.

<HEADLINE> Negotiated Solution on Kosovo Remains Target, Dini Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini
said Sunday that NATO must not think in terms of an intervention
by ground troops.
</P>
<P>
According to Dini, who was speaking in Catania, Sicily, the aim
must be a negotiated solution passing via the adoption of a
resolution by the UN Security Council incorporating the principles
agreed to by NATO, the EU and the Group of Eight.
</P>
<P>
"A political dialogue to give a solution to the Kosovo problem
must be opened up without continuing this war, without continuing
these bombardments for too long, since they hit civilians and
normal people as well as military installations," said Dini.
</P>
<P>
"I see no very rapid solution on the horizon," admitted Dini in
a later speech Sunday at a Sicilian camp for Kosovar refugees.
</P>
<P>
"There are openings and loopholes we must use to find an agreed
solution, a negotiated political solution to give autonomy and
recognize Kosovo's identity," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also voiced about the civilian deaths in the bombing
attacks, although he said that, not being a military man, he was
in no position to judge whether they were mistakes in the sense of
being avoidable.
