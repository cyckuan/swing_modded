LANZHOU, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Gansu Province
announced regulations on employing the handicapped today to
protect the rights of persons with disabilities to work.
</P>
<P>
According to the regulations, 1.5 percent of the total number
of their employees of government and social organizations,
enterprises, and certain other organizations should be handicapped
people. Before the regulations were decided on, the province
experimented in some areas and had some successful results.
</P>
<P>
Those organizations that do not employ the required number of
disabled people can be fined, and can be required to pay the
average salary of a handicapped worker for every person they fail
to employ to organizations for the handicapped.
</P>
<P>
There are about 1.24 million handicapped people in the
province, but only 400,000 can find work, and their pay and living
conditions are not as good as the average.
</P>
<P>
Some welfare enterprises have been opened for the handicapped,
bu find it difficult to survive the fierce market competition
because of aging equipment, outmoded techniques, and lack of
funds. Many wokers in these enterprises have lost their jobs.

<P>
This was stressed by Zambian Minister of Education

On the reason for stressing education, Syamujai said, "The
teacher within our sub-region faces many problems. Some unique to

problems range from lack of textbooks and basic teaching and
learning requisites to inadequate training, poor physical working
environment, lack of motivation and incentives including
professional isolation."
</P>
<P>
He noted that while in the beginning most SADC initiatives
were focussed on trade and economy, "we in education must now
take the lead because Africa's future, our future depend to a
large extent on the creativity and enterprise of our people but
both of which are routed in a sound basic education and
training."

<HEADLINE> US Housing Starts Jump to Near Three-year High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Housing starts in the U.S.
shot up by 12.2 percent in February, the highest level in nearly
three years, the U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that construction of new homes and
apartments totaled 1.53 million at a seasonally adjusted annual
rate, up from 1.36 million in January when starts rose by 0.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
The total housing starts were the highest since they hit 1.56
million rate in March 1994.
</P>
<P>
The report said that housing starts were higher in every region
except the Northeast. The starts shot up by 51.6 percent in the
Midwest. They rose by 10.9 percent in the South and 5 percent in
the West.
</P>
<P>
But the starts declined by 26.9 percent in the Northeast, the
sharpest since a 37.8 percent loss in December 1990.
</P>
<P>
Single-family starts, which account for 80 percent of new
construction, jumped by 8.8 percent to a 1.22 million rate after
rising 9.1 percent in January.
</P>
<P>
Construction of apartments and condominiums surged 27.8
percent, erasing a 25.5 percent decline a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
After hitting 1.49 million in November, U.S. housing starts
dipped to a 1.35 million rate in December when adverse weather
kept many builders from laying foundations.
</P>
<P>
However, 1.48 million new homes started in all of 1996, up from
1.35 million in 1995. The starts were on the highest level since
1.49 million in 1988.
</P>
<P>
U.S. housing market observers had expected housing activity to
level off this year but remain healthy after soaring to the best
level in eight years in 1996.
</P>
<P>
And in February, applications for building permits rose by 3
percent to a 1.44 million rate after slipping 1.5 percent a month
earlier. Permits often are a barometer of future activity.

<HEADLINE> Huge Amount of Hard Currency Circulating in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Huge amounts of hard currency
is circulating in the economically very poor country of Somalia.
</P>
<P>
One can hardly believe how much money is circulating or flowing
in to the war torn capital of Somalia, Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Four major companies are dealing with the day to day money
transactions carried out in the capital and elsewhere in country.
Two of these companies, Dahab Shil and Western Union Money
Transfer are well known in the world using hitechnology
computerized network systems.
</P>
<P>
More than 1.5 million US dollars are transferred from outside
and inside the country every month. According to the regional
director of Dahab Shil, Mr Farah Warsame Liban, his agency alone
prepares a sum between US dollars 200,000 - 300,000 in the
beginning of every month ready for distribution. Mr Liban said
from US dollars 100 to US dollars 1000 are sent to the people
here from abroad the country and that 1/3 of the Somalis depend
upon money transferred by their family members from abroad the
country through such agencies.
</P>
<P>
Also the two major combined telecommunication and money
transfer companies, Al-Barakat and Aerolite Somalia transfer
money from Australia to villages in Somalia and from Mogadishu to
Asia and Europe. Mr Abdullahi Mohamed Irbad, head of the Aerolite
Somalia Money Transfer said more than 3600 people regularly
receive money from outside through their companies, while the out
going money is very limited. Mr Irbad further more said that big
companies who import electronic equipments, goods and food items
normally use their center as the only reliable money transfer.
</P>
<P>
All these companies charge the people with US dollars 5
percent - 9 percent for the imported money from abroad, however
the interest decreases whenever the money to be transferred
exceeds US dollars 5000 where it gets down to US dollars 2 to few
cents per hundred dollars. This is usually benefitted from major
business dealers who can not take their cash money from Mogadishu
to their bases of business outside Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The yet to be recognized Al-Barakat Bank of Somalia carries on
a huge money transfer every month. More than 10,000 people go
every month to the money transfer section of Al-Barakat bank. Mr
Abbas Abdi Ali, the deputy chairman of the bank told me they help
some humanitarian agencies and business men in saving their money
also. According to Mr Ali his company operates according to the
regulations of Islam with no interests to be paid, but charge the
people what is called some service fees.
</P>
<P>
These companies maintain offices in the most Somali populated
countries which include Italy, Saudi Arabia, Canada, Britain,
Germany, U.S.A. etc. The companies also transfer money from
villages to the remote areas of the country including the towns
of Baidoa, Hargeisa, Bossaso, Kismaio and Galkaio. The money
being transferred is mainly US dollars, Saudi riyals, Italian
lira, Kenyan shillings, Ethiopian bir and the dirhams of UAE.
</P>
<P>
These major money transfer companies also control the
fluctuation of the hard currencies. For instance, when the demand
for the dollar is high, they add value to the Somali shillings,
while the devaluation comes when the export of local products
especially the livbestock is high since then the demand for the
Somali shillings increase then.

<HEADLINE> France Expects A Lot from Russian-US Summit: French FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 18 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Herve de
Charette said today that France expects a lot from the
Russian-U.S. summit to be held in Helsinki from Thursday to
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The relations between Russia and the NATO make up a decisive
element of the architecture of European security... We have
entered an active phase of negotiations which should end
positively," said de Charette during a dinner meeting with
Paris-based diplomatic journalists.
</P>
<P>
On the dispute between France and the United States over NATO's
Naples-based Southern Command, de Charette reaffirmed France's
request for "a balanced sharing of responsibilities between a
European command and an American command, placed on an equal
foot."
</P>
<P>
He said that if no progress is made over Europeanization of the
Southern Command, France "will not commit itself more forward in
the renovation of the alliance."
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that there is "no subject of conflict between
France and the United States."
</P>
<P>
The United States has reportedly suggested the establishment of
a NATO rapid force in Europe which would be headed by a French
officer, as a compromise with Paris over Southern Command.
</P>
<P>
De Charette refused to comment on particular suggestions made
by Washington, saying, "I hope that we will arrive at a response
acceptable to all."
</P>
<P>
"The good sense dictates that this decision (on Southern
Command) should come without too much delay before the Madrid
conference (of NATO in July), if one wishes it to be a success,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Zairean PM to Attend Nairobi Summit on Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister of Zaire Kengo wa
Dongo arrived here this afternoon to attend a regional summit
meeting on the crisis in his country, apparently with an aim to
seek support for the Zairean government from the outside.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in the
Kenyan capital, the prime minister said that he came here in
order to find a solution to the Zaire crisis and hoped that
Kenya's president will succeed in his efforts to bring peace to
Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The summit meeting will be held on Wednesday and chaired by
President Daniel arap Moi of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time for Zaire to be represented at such a
regional summit on its domestic conflict which is causing more
and more concern from African countries and international
community.
</P>
<P>
Kengo wa Dongo noted that "power should be taken through
polls, not by arms", adding that it cannot be conceived that
democratization and violence at the same time work together.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking to reporters, referring to rebel leader
Laurent Kabila's claim that "the Zairean administration is over
and President Mobutu Sese Seko is over."
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the Tusi-led rebels have won a victory
after another, still advancing on several fronts and threatening
to topple the long-served ruler Mobutu and his government. Under
the pressure from the advancing rebels, the Zairean government
has accepted a five-point peace plan on the conflict.
</P>
<P>
The Zairean prime minister reiterated that the Zairean
government supports the February 18 resolution of the Security
Council of the United Nations on the Zaire crisis and its
five-point peace plan.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his government's appreciation of
peace-making efforts made by Mohamed Sahnoun, special
representative of the UN and the Organization of African Unity,
who will also be present at the one-day summit.
</P>
<P>
Before his arrival, Secretary General of the OAU Salim Ahamed
Salim had reached Nairobi for tomorrow's summit meeting, during

<HEADLINE> Israel Starts Har Homa Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Israel today started the
construction of a new Jewish neighborhood in Har Homa in East
Jerusalem despite Strong opposition by the Palestinians as well as
the international community.
</P>
<P>
Israeli tractors and heavy equipment this afternoon began
rolling in to the Har Homa building site on the southeastern
outskirts of Jerusalem under extremely heavy guard.
</P>
<P>
At about 5 p.m. local time (1500GMT), the tractors completed
their work for today and were moved to a central area where they
will remain under heavy guard.
</P>
<P>
Israeli sources indicated that no equipment would be left
overnight on the work area for fear of being vandalized or
burned. The work will be continued Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A large contingent of Israeli army and other Israeli security
personnel were on hand, in the event of an outbreak of
confrontation between the Israelis and Palestinian protesters.
</P>
<P>
Following an Israeli army order to evacuate protest tents set
up near Har Homa, Palestinian National Authority Minister for
Jerusalem Affairs Faisal Husseini has added more tents. There are
now seven in all.
</P>
<P>
Several senior Israeli security officials tried to persuade
the Palestinians to move the tents several hundred meters further
south, closer to Palestinian-controlled Bethlehem, but Husseini
said he would not budge.
</P>
<P>
Husseini said that the Palestinian demonstration was not just
a protest against the building plan, but an attempt as well to
save the peace process and prevent bloodshed by channeling the
Palestinian anger into non-violent actions.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Israeli army declared the Har Homa area a
closed military zone, and security forces have been on high alert
in Jerusalem and throughout the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
To head off any possible trouble, Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai Monday ordered forces deployed along the
perimeter in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.

BONN, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk
Al-Sharaa today called on the European Union to bear pressure on
Israel as the latter began building the controversial Har Homa
settlement in East Jerusalem today.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that behind the U.S., the most important mediator
in the Middle East peace process, the EU, should make it clear
that this region is going through an especially difficult phase of
development," Al-Sharaa, who is currently on a visit to Bonn, told
German n-tv television Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"If no one puts any pressure or exerts influence on Netanyahu
(Israeli Prime Minister), then there will be a very serious, a
very dangerous development in the Middle East," he added.
</P>
<P>
Defying Palestinian and international protests, Israel today
began breaking ground for the Har Homa settlement on a hill it

<HEADLINE> European MPs Call for EU Role in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The 11th Meeting of
Cyprus-European Union (EU) Joint Parliamentary Committee opened
here today with a call for the EU to play an effective role in
efforts toward a solution of the protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Declaring the meeting open, co-chairman of the committee
Philippe Monfils, who is the Belgian Euro-MP, said the main
objective of the meeting is to facilitate Cyprus accession to the
EU.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope the Cyprus Republic will become the 16th
member state of the Union.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening session, EU presidency representative
Kester Heaslip spoke about the current U.N.-sponsored indirect
talks between Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me the two leaders are committed in principle to
entering into direct negotiations and are preparing themselves
for the necessary process of give and take to achieve a
comprehensive solution to the Cyprus problem," the EU envoy said.
</P>
<P>
He noted, however, that President Clerides and Denktash "lack
faith in each other's seriousness of purpose and good
intentions."
</P>
<P>
He called on the EU to find ways of improving the atmosphere
between the two communities on the island and encourage their
leaders to approach each other with trust and in a spirit of
compromise.
</P>
<P>
Heaslip also said that EU Commissioner for External Relations
Hans Van den Broek's visit to Cyprus earlier this month had
delivered a message to all the people of Cyprus that accession
negotiations will begin on schedule.
</P>
<P>
"The impact of the commissioner's messages on both communities
must constitute a significant contribution to the developing
peace process," the EU envoy added.
</P>
<P>
The EU Ministerial Council reaffirmed in Apeldorn, the
Netherlands Sunday its decision on March 6, 1995 that EU
accession talks with Cyprus will begin six months after the end
of the Intergovernmental Conference.
</P>
<P>
This Eastern Mediterranean island, divided since the 1974
Turkish invasion, applied for full EU membership in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Ruehe: German Soldiers' Racist Attack A Individual Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 18 (Xinhua) -- German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe
today described the Monday incident that nine off-duty conscripts
attacked foreigners as "disgraceful behavior", and assured that
German armed forces Bundestag were not a stronghold of right-wing
extremism.
</P>
<P>
Ruehe and the head of the main opposition Social Democrats in
the Bundestag, Rudolf Scharping, said that the incident did not
reflect the thinking in the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
According to Ruehe, the nine soldiers just began their military
service on January 2 and it seemed impossible for them to fully
develop right-wing radical ideas in the army.
</P>
<P>
The incident showed that social problems could be transferred
into military life through conscription, he added.
</P>
<P>
A top Bundestag official said that everything must be done to
ensure extreme right-wing thinking does not emerge in the armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred Monday night in a pedestrianized shopping
zone in the town of Detmold, southwest off Hanover, involving nine
drunken conscripts, not 10 as earlier reported. The group, wearing
uniforms, combat helmets and tank-drivers' goggles, used baseball
bats to hit and kicked two Turks aged 16 and 17 and held knife to
the throat of a 16-year-old Italian. Six of the group were
arrested by police racing to the scene, and three escaped.
</P>
<P>
The group shouted racist insults during the attack and caused
bruises and minor injuries to the three foreigners. They first
asked pedestrians where to find Turks to beat up. A passer-by
immediately called the police.
</P>
<P>
The six arrested are facing charges of causing serious bodily
injury, breaching the peace and incitement to racial hatred.
</P>
<P>
Police said the nine conscripts have since January been serving
in the 3rd Armored Reconnaissance Battalion at Rommel Army Base
in Augustdorf, 15 kilometers from Detmold. Seven of the group are
from the former East Germany.
</P>
<P>
Ruehe said the nine soldiers, aged 20 to 21, would be subject
to full weight of military discipline. A military spokesman said
one possible punishment if they were convicted would be
dishonorable discharge.
</P>
<P>
Ruehe expressed regret over the fact that the nine conscripts
were being trained for foreign service in the SFOR peace-keeping
forces in ex-Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
It was unlikely after the incident that any of the nine would
be included in SFOR, it is reported.

<P>
CAIRO, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Belgian Foreign Minister Erik
Derycke said today that his country will continue its
contributions to the development process in the Palestinian lands
along with unwavering political support.
</P>
<P>
Derycke, upon arrival at the Cairo International Airport, told
reporters that the Belgian-Palestinian relations are excellent.
"Belgium exerts every possible effort to help promote the peace
march," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat highly appreciates the
Belgian role in activating the peace drive even if it is not
welcomed by Israel and the United States," he added.
</P>
<P>
The European Union, the biggest donor to the Palestinians, is
required to contribute to the Palestinian development process in
its capacity as the largest economic bloc worldwide, Derycke said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Belgian top diplomat directed criticism at
Israel, saying that the Israeli policy has "created a worrisome
situation," and pushed the peace process into a "very critical and
difficult stage."
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need for the EU to play a role in the peace
process in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Some European countries had sponsored a U.N. Security Council
draft resolution that bars a new Jewish settlement in Arab East
Jerusalem. The U.S. vetoed the resolution despite worldwide
support.
</P>
<P>
Derycke is leading a delegation for a three-day visit to Egypt,
which is aimed at shoring up bilateral relations and giving impetus
to the Mideast peace process.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-Balkan Medical Center
and the Henri Dunant Institute of the Greek Red Cross today
announced the plan to establish a network of diagnostic centers
based in five Balkan capitals.
</P>
<P>
The President of the Inter-Balkan Medical Center George
Apostolopoulos told a press conference here today that the venture
would begin in Bucharest, where everything was ready for the
operation of the first diagnostic center.
</P>
<P>
Apostolopoulos said similar centers would also be set up in
Podgorica, the capital of Montenegro, Skopje, Sofia and Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Out-patient clinics and first aid stations will operate at all
five centers.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, the five centers will be linked on a
permanent basis with the Inter-Balkan Medical Center of the "G.
Apostolopoulos Group of Companies" and the Henri Dunant Institute
by means of an advanced tele-medicine system.
</P>
<P>
The system will enable an evaluation at any time of the
seriousness of each case and, when necessary, patients will be
transferred to the Inter-Balkan Center in northern Greek town of
Salonika or to the Henri Dunant Hospital in Athens.
</P>
<P>
Participating in the 15 million dollar investment are the "G.
Apostolopoulos Group of Companies" with 50 percent, the Greek Red
Cross with 30 percent and the "Latsis Group of Companies" with 20
percent.

<HEADLINE> Britain Raps Israel for Building New Settlements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The British government today
launched verbal attacks upon Israeli government for starting to
build new settlements in East Jerusalem, saying it would "harm the
(Middle East) peace process."
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said in a statement
this afternoon: "The start of construction at Har Homa outside
Jerusalem can do nothing but harm the (Middle East) peace
process."
</P>
<P>
"Like all settlements, this one will be illegal, and it goes
against the spirit of the Oslo Agreement. I am disappointed that
the Israeli government have taken this decision against the strong
advice of their friends in the international community," Rifkind
said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo Agreement signed in 1993, the future of
Jerusalem and the fate of Jewish settlements was to be decided
through talks between Israel and Palestine Liberation
Organization.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Secretary also urged the Palestinian leadership "to
continue to do everything possible to avoid current tensions
leading to violence."
</P>
<P>
"We are now at crossroads in the peace process. If we are to
continue on the road to peace, progress must be restored through
the urgent resumption of dialogue and negotiation," he added.

<HEADLINE> Bonn Endorses 25 Billion Mark Package for Building Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
center-right coalition cabinet today passed a 25 billion mark
(14.8 billion US dollars) investment package to boost Germany's
sluggish construction industry.
</P>
<P>
The program involves about 20 billion marks in investment to
be offered by two state-owned banks and five billion marks from
the private sector for public construction projects.
</P>
<P>
Among other aspects, the package would promote community
investment projects, modernize housing in eastern Germany, and
help improve the heating insulation of buildings. Young couples
will get housing construction loans at favorable rates.
</P>
<P>
When disclosing the investment plan, Kohl at a meeting with
industrialists in Munich last week said he hoped this would help
create jobs in the building sector.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that 400,000 out of a total of about 1.3 million
German building workers are currently jobless, as a result of a
decline in public-sector investments and low-wage competition from
foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
A decline also occurred in housing construction. Only about
670,000 new apartments are expected to be built this year,
compared with 750,000 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Amid the lowest investment in construction in 30 years, the
central association of the German building trades fears about
7,500 building outfits will go bankrupt this year.

<HEADLINE> United Govt - Key Step Toward Peace in Angola: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The formation of a government of
national unity and reconciliation is a major step toward lasting
peace in Angola, a leader of one of the opposition alliances said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Paulino Pinto Joao, coordinator of the Civil and Democratic
Opposition Party group, told a press conference that the
guideline of the new government should be agreed upon among all
the political parties and groups in the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
Pinto said the guideline should be effective for at least two
years so as to make government policies sustainable.
</P>
<P>
The opposition leader said the new government of national
unity, once established, would create conditions for "lasting
peace" in the country and also make it possible for extensive
dialogues among all groups and parties in Angola.
</P>
<P>
As one of the opposition alliances, the Civil and Democratic
Opposition Party group comprises 14 political parties, including
National Liberation Front of Angola, Social Democratic Party,
Democratic Union and Democratic Front.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Monday, Ndongala Garcia, the President of the
People's Reunification Party for Angola, urged the government and
UNITA to form a unified army and government as soon as possible
in accordance with the Lusaka accord reached in November, 1994 by
the two sides.
</P>
<P>
He said he felt worried about the establishment of a national
unity government and urged the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) to explain why nearly 20,000
ex-fighters of its 60,000 men had left the assembly camps and the
unified army.

<HEADLINE> Direct Talks on Cyprus Issue May Take Place: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- A Cypriot government official
said today that sooner or later President Glafcos Clerides will
hold direct talks with Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash to
settle the protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily press briefing here, Government Spokesman
Yiannakis Cassoulides noted, however, that the timing of the
direct negotiations depends on the outcome of the proximity
talks carried out by U.N. resident representative in Cyprus
Gustave Feissel.
</P>
<P>
He said the Greek Cypriot side will wait for the outcome of
the proximity talks to decide whether a productive direct
dialogue can be carried out.
</P>
<P>
"We have said we will enter into proximity talks in the hope
that they will pave the way for face-to-face talks between
President Clerides and Rauf Denktash," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He added that it seems reasonable to assume that direct talks
will start at the end of May or beginning of June.
</P>
<P>
He noted that these will be based on the U.N. resolutions
regarding the Cyprus question and the high level agreements
reached between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides in 1977 and
1979, which provide for the establishment of a bizonal,
bicommunal federated state.
</P>
<P>
EU presidency representative for Cyprus, Kester Heaslip, said
Monday that U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan is determined
to call a direct meeting between leaders of the two Cypriot
communities before the end of June.
</P>
<P>
Last week, U.N. envoy Feissel began indirect talks through
bi-weekly separate meetings with Clerides and Denktash to break
current deadlock and pave the way for the face-to-face
meeting. However, nothing has been revealed since the talks
began.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the Cypriot government will agree to a U.S. proposal
for a moratorium of flights by Greek and Turkish military
aircraft over Cyprus, as a good-will gesture, the spokesman said
"we will take this decision after we have entered a substantive
exchange of views."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus remains divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of an
Athens-backed coup.

<HEADLINE> Arab Lawyers Demand Halt to Dialog With Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Arab Lawyers Union today called for
halting any dialog and any normalization steps with Israel
especially within the circle of intellectuals and public opinion
leaders.
</P>
<P>
The union also appealed to different organizations and Arab
press syndicates to launch a campaign to resist the "Israeli
intransigence led by the ruling extremist group."
</P>
<P>
This came in a statement issued by the Union, an Arab
professional group renowned for its firm stand against the Jewish
state.
</P>
<P>
"The insistence of Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu on
expanding settlements in Arab territories especially in East
Jerusalem has led to the explosion of violence and insulted
worshippers of various religions," it said.
</P>
<P>
The Union accused Israel of "deliberately escalating tension
and violence in the region in a bid to thwart efforts to
accomplish just and comprehensive peace."
</P>
<P>
It cautioned that Israeli government's provocative policies
have "gone beyond all red lines," especially after rejecting the
full withdrawal from Syrian Golan Heights and Southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Mideast peace process has turned downwards as a result of
the recent Israeli decisions to build new Jewish settlement in
Arab East Jerusalem and limited further redeployment in the West
Bank as well its point-blank rejection of Syria's demand for a
full return of the Golan.
</P>
<P>
In an upbeat mood over the Palestinian-Israeli agreement on
Hebron redeployment, intellectuals and politicians from Egypt,
Jordan, Israel, Palestinian and Europe signed a document in
Copenhagen in January, creating an international pressure alliance
to push forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
However, the controversial declaration has aroused dissension
and denunciation in Egypt's intellectual circle. Many oppose
normalizing ties with Israel until withdrawal from occupied Arab
lands is achieved and Arab right restored.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is the first Arab country to make peace with Israel, but
ties have deteriorated since Netanyahu assumed power last
June.

HARARE, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Visiting COMESA Chairman said
today that a summit of the organization will be held in the
Zambian capital of Lusaka on April 10 to thrash out problems
affecting the regional organization.
</P>
<P>
Chakakala Chaziya, the chairman of the Council of Ministers of
the Common Market for East and Southern Africa (COMESA), told
journalists here after a brief meeting with Zimbabwean President
Robert Mugabe today that he is in the Zimbabwean capital to
invite the Zimbabwean leader to the summit.
</P>
<P>
Chaziya said: "I have come here to deliver a message of
goodwill from Malawian President Bakili Muluzi to President
Robert Mugabe."
</P>
<P>
"I have also come here to deliver an invitation from President
Muluzi, who is chairman of the COMESA authority, to President
Mugabe to attend the COMESA summit in Lusaka on April 10," said
Chaziya.
</P>
<P>
Asked what Muluzi is doing about current problems within
COMESA, Chaziya said: "This is why there is this summit, so that
the presidents can look at problems in COMESA."
</P>
<P>
Problems within the regional organization include alleged
mal-administration and financial mismanagement, which have since
seen COMESA Executive Secretary Bingu Wa Mutharika being sent on
three months leave, pending investigations.
</P>
<P>
Wa Mutharika has threatened not to cooperate with
investigators, branding the probe a "witch-hunt" perpetuated by
the government of Malawi through Chaziya, who is that country's
Minister of Commerce and Industry.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique and Lesotho pulled out of the 20-member COMESA in
January, saying it was an organization with more members and more
problems. They preferred to remain in the 12-nation Southern
African Development Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
The two regional groupings have 10-member states in common.

DAR ES SALAAM, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank plans to
encourage the use of local experts in foreign-funded projects
than employing foreign experts who are costly.
</P>

Brigish further said there has been too much technical
assistance to the detriment of local experts.
</P>
<P>
"We have to change the approach. There must be much more
on-the-job training for locals, greater emphasis on the use of
local experts and capacity building," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said provision of subsidy on fertilizers was
inefficient and regressive.
</P>
<P>
"If you subsidize fertilizers then it means you take money
from the health and educational sectors, areas which are equally
important for the country's development. The government should,
therefore, spend its money on health and education than providing
subsidy on fertilizers," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Settles Outstanding Contribution to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The government of Tanzania
has settled its 200,000 U.S. Dollars outstanding assessed
contribution to the Arusha-based Center on Intergrated Rural
Development for Africa (CIRDAFRICA).
</P>
<P>
The center's director A. M. Elaheikh told the official Daily
News over the phone today from Arusha in Northern Tanzania that
the money was paid toward the end of last month when he came here
to sensitize concerned government authorities to pay the debt.
</P>
<P>
The sum is part of the 7.9 million U.S. Dollars unsettled
assessed contributions by 12 out of its 15 member states.
</P>
<P>
"We are very happy that the Tanzanian government responded
immediately to our country. We were in critical financial
situation but the money at least helped to ease the situation,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Elaheikh said the money was spent settling part of the
center's staff salary arrears for 22 months which by February was
standing at one million U.S. Dollars. CIRDAFRICA has 28 employees
recruited from the member states.
</P>
<P>
"Our employees were happy with the government's move. It
revived their hope of living," he said, adding they were
optimistic that other member countries would emulate the example.
</P>
<P>
According to a report, during his trip here on February 20,
the director met Minister for Agriculture and Cooperatives Paul
Kimiti, and high commissioners for Malawi, Uganda, Kenya, Zambia,
Sudan and Nigeria and the Mozambican ambassador, all of whom
promised to take measures to ensure that their respective
governments would pay the debts.
</P>
<P>
Other member countries which have not paid their assessed
contributions are Zaire, Congo, Sierra Leone and Togo. Benin,
Lesotho and Senegal have paid their contributions in full.
</P>
<P>
Elaheikh said he was planning to come to Dar es Salaam again
next week to get feedback from the envoys he visited last month.

<HEADLINE> UK Rolls Out Plans to Bring Gas Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The British government has taken
steps to accelerate the phased opening of the domestic gas market
to full competition.
</P>
<P>
Millions of gas consumers will benefit early from lower gas
prices when domestic gas competation rolls out in Britain, President
of the Board of Trade Ian Lang announced here today.
</P>
<P>
He has laid in Parliament an Order which will allow gas
competition to commence across the country in stages as soon as
the Director General of Gas Supply considers that satisfactory
preparations have been made.
</P>
<P>
The Order says competition will start next in Scotland and the
north-east of England -- possibly as early as October this year --
and begin to roll southwards in five instalments in the rest of
England and Wales in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The move would mean that 4.5 million consumers will be able to
choose their supplier in an open market by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The government says 2 million consumers in test areas in
southern and south-west England have received discounts of about
20 percent on British Gas's standard tariffs -- 65 pounds (104 US
dollars) for an average household.
</P>
<P>
Lang said his decision was intended to +keep up the momentum of
competition+.
</P>
<P>
British Gas Trading, which supplies the domestic market, said
the interest of consumers should be paramount in deciding whether
the industry was ready to move at the pace proposed.
</P>
<P>
The Gas Consumers Council welcomed the news, but noted that
there were still some problems at the first stage of implementing
the Order.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Govt Urges Pilots to Return to Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Striking Air Zimbabwe pilots and
flight engineers should consider the plight of their passengers
and go back to work while their grievances are being attended to,
Transport and Energy Minister Simon Moyo said here today.
</P>
<P>
Short of condemning the five-day action by the pilots and
engineers, Moyo said the cabinet had endorsed a plan two weeks
before to commercialize the national airline -- a development
that could result in better remuneration and working conditions.
</P>
<P>
The government had already assumed the airline's debt and
turned it into equity, said Moyo.
</P>
<P>
The airline has been leasing four aircraft from South Africa
at a cost 54,545 U.S. Dollars a day since the strike started last
Friday.
</P>
<P>
No solution appeared to be in sight with the striking pilots
and flight engineers and management accusing each other of
spurning negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Inflation Rises in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's monthly inflation rate
soared to 19 percent in February compared with 15.5 percent the
previous month amid warnings that a rash of expected price
increases could start another devastating inflationary spiral.
</P>
<P>
The official news agency ZIANA reported today that analysts
warned there were serious inflationary pressures in the economy
stemming from the number of potential price increases expected in
the next few months including electricity and telephone rates.
</P>
<P>
Inflation increased last month mainly due to the combine
effects of price hike of fuel, meat, milk and rural bus fares.
</P>
<P>
The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe said that inflation was unlikely
to exceed 20 percent by June this year, slightly above the
original forecast of 17 percent made last September.

<HEADLINE> Italian PM Criticizes Israel's Settlement Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano
Prodi today described a recent Israeli decision to build
additional Jewish settlements in Arab East Jerusalem as the
"worst" thing which could take place.
</P>
<P>
Prodi, who arrived here this morning on the first official
visit by an Italian prime minister, made the remark at a press
conference after meeting Lebanese leaders.
</P>
<P>
He denied that he brought any "specific initiative" on the
peace talks between Lebanon and Israel and between Syria and
Israel, adding that he discussed with the Syrian and Lebanese
leaders "the general framework" of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Before flying back to Rome in the evening, Prodi held meetings
in Beirut with Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, House Speaker
Nabih Berri and President Elias Hrawi.
</P>
<P>
He said there is a common feeling among the European countries
on a necessity "to be more active" in the Middle East, predicting
that Europe will have more and more influence in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"The Italian foreign policy is more and more interested in the
Middle East," Prodi admitted, noting "we have two main streams in
our foreign policy now, one is the East and Southeast Europe and
another is the Middle East."
</P>
<P>
At the joint press conference, Hariri underlined that the two
sides "share the same point of view on the Middle East problems."
</P>
<P>
He described the relations between Lebanon and Italy as "very
strong," expressing the hope for more Italian help in his
country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Italy is Lebanon's biggest European trade partner, and
according to the Lebanese Trade and Industrial Chamber, Lebanon's
imports from Italy amounted to 915 million U.S. dollars in 1996,
when its exports to that country amounted to 39 million
U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Canada Surpasses Its Immigration Target in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government said that
225,313 people landed in the country last year, of which 196,998
were immigrants and 28,315 refugees.
</P>
<P>
The total figure is 5,313 more than the maximum the Canadian
government had expected when it set its targets in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Most of the newcomers - 120,233 - fell under the category of
economic immigrants.
</P>
<P>
The number of immigrants who fell under the family-class
category totaled 68,165, reports said today.
</P>
<P>
While admitting the numbers are highest among economic
immigrants, Immigration Minister Lucienne Robillard stressed that
this does not mean that Canada has lessened its commitment to the
family class.
</P>
<P>
"It simply means that more economic immigrants have come
forward and we must remember that they are often accompanied by
family members and will be sponsoring other family members in
future to come to Canada," Robillard noted.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the number of government-assisted refugees totaled
7,846, about 500 more than projected.
</P>
<P>
Canada expects roughly the same number of immigrants in 1997,
according to the government.

<HEADLINE> Russian Senior Official Forecasts Rise in Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 18 (Xinhua) -- A senior Russian official
today forecast a rise in Russian arms sales this year to about
4.5 billion U.S. dollars from 3 billion dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference at the ongoing Abu Dhabi
International Defense Exhibition (IDEX-97) grounds here,
spokesman of the Russian delegation to the exhibition Alexander
Kotilkini estimated the quota of Russian arms sales to Middle
East countries, particularly the Gulf states, at some 35 to 40
percent of the total Russian arms exports.
</P>
<P>
He said that worldwide sales of Russian and U.S. arms will be
on a par in 1999. By then, he said, world arms sales will stand
at 18 billion dollars, of which Russia and the U.S. will share
one third and the rest will be divided among other arms exporting
countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that Russian arms sales focus on air defense systems,
adding that the Gulf states at present possess modern warplanes
and a long time will have to pass until these countries start
renewing its warplane fleets.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman revealed that Russia will sign contracts for the
sale of more armored vehicles to countries of the region as well
as missiles and other defense equipment.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Thyssen Vows to Head Off Takeover Attempt From Krupp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Germany's largest steel concern
Thyssen today vowed to head off a takeover attempt from its
arch-rival Krupp-Hoesch, the second-largest steelmaker in the
country.
</P>
<P>
In a message to company employees signed by management, the
supervisory board and the trade union, Thyssen described the
takeover bid as "incomprehensible and completely unacceptable"
and said it would fight to ward off the attempt.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, several thousand Thyssen workers held demonstrations
at Krupp headquarters in the city of Essen against the plan which
would estimatedly endanger tens of thousands of jobs. Police had
to drive back demonstrators trying to storm the Krupp building,
reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Thyssen, with 123,700 employees and annual sales of nearly 39
billion German marks (about 22 billion U.S. dollars), last year
saw its profits cut by half to 350 million marks (about 200
million dollars), due to heavy losses in its steel operations.
</P>
<P>
With 66,000 on its payroll and annual sales of about 24 billion
marks (13.5 billion dollars), Krupp-Hoesch also saw halved
profits of 208 million marks (117 million dollars) for the same
reason. The concern itself is the result of the successful Krupp's
takeover of Hoesch five years ago.
</P>
<P>
A fusion between Thyssen and Krupp-Hoesch would create Europe's
largest steel unit, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Describing Krupp's takeover attempt as "the biggest coup in the
post-war period in the Rhine-Ruhr" heavy industrial regions of
Germany, Thyssen workers' council chairman Georg Bongen was quoted
by the German news agency DPA as saying today that a takeover would
mean that Krupp would be out to "liquidate" Thyssen's assets in
order to compensate for its own financial weakness.
</P>
<P>
Shrugging off the protests, Krupp-Hoesch chairman Gerhard
Cromme told demonstrators in Essen that back in the 1980s, it was
Thyssen which had sought to take over Krupp, so that the reverse
situation today could not be wrong.
</P>
<P>
Fearing that Krupp's plan would bring more pressure on the job
markets, Johanes Rau, premier of the North Rhine-Westfalia state,
where both companies are located, said today that the state
government can by no means approve such a hostile takeover.

<HEADLINE> Albright: US Firm on NATO Enlargement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright today reaffirmed the U.S. determination to expand the
NATO alliance into Eastern Europe despite Russia's strong
opposition.
</P>
<P>
"NATO enlargement will remain on track. New allies will enjoy
the full benefits and assume the full responsibilities of
membership," Albright told a news conference two days before a
U.S.-Russian summit to be held in Helsinki, Finland.
</P>
<P>
Albright, who will accompany President Bill Clinton to Helsinki
Thursday and Friday, was indicating in her remarks that the
differences between the United States and Russia over the
enlargement of NATO will remain unsolved when Clinton and Russian
President Boris Yeltsin hold talks in Helsinki.
</P>
<P>
The secretary of state has held what the State Department said
was "intensive" talks with Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov over the thorny issue during Primakov's stay in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
Before his return home to report to Yeltsin following his
meeting with Clinton, Primakov told reporters Monday that Russia
would neither change its opposition on the NATO enlargement.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized Russia would like to have normal relations with
NATO and the way for the normalization of the relations was to
have a legally binding treaty between the two sides, which would
include no deployment of Western permanent troops in the territory
of new members in central and eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
But the United States and its allies would not concede to the
Russian requirement and only have agreed to have a charter, under
which Russia would "have a seat at the table" to voice its views
but not a veto.
</P>
<P>
At the same news conference, national security chief Sandy
Berger urged Russia's parliament Duma to ratify the START II
treaty, another important issue on the agenda at the upcoming
Helsinki summit.
</P>
<P>
"Now we are waiting Duma ratification of START II and together
with START I, that will cut both our arsenals, both our nuclear
arsenals, by two-thirds from the Cold War levels," he told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Berger revealed that U.S officials and Primakov had discussed
guidelines for START III negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Canada Sees Record Mutual Fund Sales in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Canadians pumped a record 730
million U.S. dollars in new cash into mutual funds in February,
which is 25 percent more than the previous record set in February
1994.
</P>
<P>
During the month, the mutual fund industry's assets climbed 9.3
billion dollars to a new high of 169.4 billion or more than 5,100
dollars for every Canadian, said reports today.
</P>
<P>
Low interest rates and rising markets are believed to be the
main power behind the mutual fund sale increases.
</P>
<P>
Feburary's red-hot sales for mutual funds followed a relatively
weak one in January, which saw only 3.8 billion dollar sales.
</P>
<P>
The big winners in terms of asset growth were the major banks
and Canada Trust Co., which all expanded their fund business by at
least 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
These institutions have succeeded this year in attracting money

<HEADLINE> New Satellite Era to Emerge: Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 18 (Xinhua) -- A new generation of satellites,
which provides much faster communication, is soon to be shaped,
the Wall Street Journal reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the new systems would let consumers search
the Internet without any of today's delays and make
videoconferences as commonplace as phone calls.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Federal Communications Commission issued a license
last week to Teledesic Corp., one of 15 U.S. contenders aiming to
ring the planet with satellite systems.
</P>
<P>
The systems designed by the company are supposed to offer
high-bandwidth communications services featured by the "Ka-band,"
with which, doctors could hold an emergency videoconference,
swapping X-rays, examining the patient and plotting treatment.
</P>
<P>
In most cases, home users should be able to be fitted with
26-inch ready-to-operate receiving dishes at an initial cost of
less than 1,000 U.S. dollars, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The 9 billion-U.S.-dollar Teledesic project is perhaps the most
complex technically, with 840 small satellites to be placed in
low-earth orbit by the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
The most advanced commercial satellites in the sky now simply
receive digital data from one part of the earth and send them back
down to another. The new generation will be able to target smaller
areas of ground with narrowly focused "spot beams," making the
undertaking much more efficient, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
But contestants have argued that dozens of smaller satellites
zipping over the earth at low altitudes might not be a good
approach. Some believe it will be an ideal way to use a handful of
giant "geosynchronous" satellites that are thousands of miles
above the earth and are constantly positioned above whole
continents as they rotate along with the earth.
</P>
<P>
The paper said all the companies confess that it's unclear
exactly which service they'll be selling to whom.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the paper noted that many of the communication
giants might run into the trouble of getting public funds through
debt and equity markets. Their satellite projects will not hold
the interest of investors, because their returns are considered to
be too far away.

<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Capital's municipal
government has set aside six million yuan for the repair of winter
damage of roads from last year.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are over 20 km of damaged roads in the city,
covering a more than 12,000-sq-m area, according to officials of
the municipal public works administration.
</P>
<P>
The damaged roads were all built in the 1960s and are full of
cracks. Two heavy snowfalls coupled with low temperatures that
lasted for more than a dozen days last year worsened the situation.
</P>
<P>
The repair project started three days ago and is scheduled to
be completed around May 20, municipal officials said. The work is
done during the evening hours, from 9:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m., to
avoid traffic disruptions.

<HEADLINE> Italy Declares State of Emergency Over Albanian Influx </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Italian cabinet today declared a
state of emergency throughout the country until June 30 to deal
with the larger-than-expected entry of Albanian refugees into the
country.
</P>
<P>
At this morning's cabinet meeting, the government adopted a
decree granting "temporary" protection to a flood of Albanian
refugees who poured into following the fall of their homeland
into anarchy after the collapse of pyramid investment schemes.
</P>
<P>
However, the decree also gave law enforcement officials wider
power to expel refugees who they considered dangerous to public
security and who committed crimes.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini cautioned that
the exodus had brought more than 10,000 Albanians across the
Adriatic Sea since March 13. He said the consequences of the
influx "involved not only Italy but all Europe."
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Giorgio Napolitano proposed "urgent measures
to coordinate necessary logistic and financial action for timely
and adequate humanitarian assistance."
</P>
<P>
He told the cabinet that Italy had planned shelter for 3,500
refugees but nearly three times that number had poured in.
</P>
<P>
Dini, who was scheduled to meet later today with the European
mission on its return from Albania, and with Albanian Foreign
Minister Arjan Starova, also briefed the government on the latest
situation in Albania and diplomatic efforts by the international
community.
</P>
<P>
He called for support for Albanian Prime Minister Bashkim Fino
in restoring the government's institutional and administrative
activities, and the provision of urgent social and humanitarian
assistance.

<HEADLINE> Panel Urges Opening Up of Japan's Costly Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Japan will lose its status as an
economic superpower in the 21st century unless it alleviates its
high-cost economic structure and harmonizes its economic policies
with those of its trading allies, warns a government panel.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no bright future for the Japanese economy unless
Japan can skillfully respond to the currents of globalization" in
the fields of international finances, telecommunications,
education and trade policies, said the report released today by a
sub-committee of the Economic Council, an advisory body to the
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The report said Japan must alleviate its "high-cost economic
structure" under which business corporations had domestically
charged much higher prices on goods and services than in other
countries, the Kyodo News Service said.
</P>
<P>
In this connection, Japan "must press ahead with deregulation
to expedite the entry" of foreign and domestic competitors into
domestic industrial sectors where companies had not been subjected
to such competition, Kyodo quoted the report as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Even in the fields where the strong yen should have brought
keener competition from imports, the prices of manufactured goods
for whose sectors market access has been blocked by both domestic
policies and private commercial practices, have remained at high
levels," the report said.
</P>
<P>
"It is an urgent assignment for Japan to rethink its domestic
import regulations, harmonizing domestic industrial standards with
international standards, simplifying inspection procedures and
accepting foreign inspection data, whether the imports belong to
the goods or service sectors," the report said.
</P>
<P>
It said the high-cost structure had frightened foreign
corporations from investing in Japan, and tourists from coming on
sightseeing trips.

<HEADLINE> Education Much Improved in Hungary: Official Statistics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, March 19 (Xinhua) -- College graduates in Hungary
have increased by 140 percent in the past 26 years, official
statistics show.
</P>
<P>
Hungarian Central Statistics Bureau figures released today show
the number of people who have accepted secondary school education
had also doubled by 1996 compared with 1970.
</P>
<P>
Young people were better educated than the old. The ratio of
high school graduates among people between 20 and 24 years old was
about double those for men between 60 and 64.
</P>
<P>
The government attributed the achievements to a policy which
emphasized education.
</P>
<P>
One-third of the labor-capable people had certificates of
secondary education, and one-tenth certificates for higher
education.
</P>
<P>
There was, however, a lack of equilibrium among different
cultural levels, with people in big cities, such as the capital
Budapest, Gyor, Pecs, Szeged, and Szombathely far exceeding people
in less developed areas in education levels.

<HEADLINE> One Israeli Soldier Killed, 3 Wounded in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 19 (Xinhua) -- One Israeli soldier was killed
and three others were wounded by guerrillas of the Lebanese
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, in an operation in south
Lebanon this afternoon, according to a Hezbollah statement.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance, the military wing of the Shiite Muslim
Hezbollah, said that its fighters attacked an Israeli patrol near
the crusade castle of Shaqif in the central sector of the Israeli
self-carved "security zone."
</P>
<P>
It said that in the operation, the guerrillas destroyed an
Israeli military vehicle, killing and wounding four Israeli
soldiers inside.
</P>
<P>
Israeli military helicopters were witnessed rushing to the
area to lift the dead and the wounded, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Security sources in south Lebanon confirmed today's casualties,
adding that three Israeli soldiers have been killed and 29 wounded
in south Lebanon since the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
Also in the statement, the guerrilla group announced that
another team of its militants carried out an attack this
afternoon on the Israeli position at Ali Taher with
rocket-propelled grenades and machine guns.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli forces in the position of Qalaa Shaqif, or the
Shaqif castle, opened artillery fire at vicinities of several
south Lebanese villages opposite the Israeli buffer zone since
2:30 p.m. (12:30 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Security sources in the area said that the bombardment led
to a stop of traffic on the road between Arnoun and Yohmor.
</P>
<P>
Hit-and-run attacks by Muslim guerrillas and retaliatory
bombardments by Israeli forces constitute a daily scene on the last
battlefront of the Arab-Israel conflict.
</P>
<P>
Israel established the 1,100-square-kilometer "security zone"
in 1985 in a bid to protect northern Israel from cross-border
attacks from south Lebanon.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Zaire's Parliament overwhelmingly voted to oust Prime
Minister Leon Kengo wa Dondo. The vote was defended as a
necessary measure to bring the rebels who control eastern Zaire to
the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
-- George Tenet, who has been acting director of the CIA for
the last three months, emerged as a leading candidate to replace
Anthony Lake, who has pulled out as nominee for the CIA.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton's senior foreign policy advisers staked
out hard-line position on the core issues in security relations
with Russia. Madeleine Albright and Sandy Berger stressed the
United States would not forge a new, cooperative relationship with
Russia at the price of compromise on NATO's determination to offer
full membership to former Warsaw Pact states.
</P>
<P>
-- The Israeli government dispatched heavy earthmovers to break
ground for a new Jewish neighborhood on a disputed hillside in the
traditionally Arab part of Jerusalem on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Clinton called for bipartisan talks to lay the groundwork
for a springtime balanced-budget deal. The president was seeking
to stem the partisanship that has infected relations with the
Republican Congress.
</P>
<P>
-- A Russian airliner exploded and crashed shortly after
takeoff from the southern city of Starropol, killing all 50
aboard.

ISLAMABAD, March 19 (Xinhua) -- About 50 people were feared
dead and 150 others injured today in a bomb blast in the eastern
Afghan city of Jalalabad.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview, a Pakistani official from the border
town of Landikotal told Xinhua that the explosion wrecked the
building of the police headquarters of Jalalabad, capital of
Afghan Nangarhar province.
</P>
<P>
However, Deputy Mayor of Jalalabad Sadar Ul Azam told Xinhua in
another telephone interview that only eight were killed and 40
others injured.
</P>
<P>
Azam dispelled the impression that the blast was an act of
sabotage, saying that an old mortar shell exploded.
</P>
<P>
A United Nations official in Jalalabad said that 10 houses
collapsed and hundred damaged due to the explosion.
</P>
<P>
Jalalabad was seized by the Afghan Islamic militia Taliban
before its capture of the Afghan capital Kabul in September last
year.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak: Peace Process Meets Its Worst </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Preident Hosni Mubarak
warned today the new Israeli settlement works in East Jerusalem
threatens to bulldoze the whole Mideast peace process which has
sustained the worst blow since its birth in 1977.
</P>
<P>
What is happening in Jerusalem is the most dangerous to the
peace process which has never been hit before by such a serious
setback as it is now, Mubarak told a news conference held at
his residency.
</P>
<P>
"The peace process is in one of the most critical situations
since its start in 1977. It has never seen such a deadlock
before," he said.
</P>
<P>
Refuting the remarks by Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu that asking Israel to halt construction in Jerusalem is
to ask the U.S. to stop building in Washington or Egypt in
Cairo, Mubarak said it is a totally different story for Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"I tell him no, East Jerusalem is occupied land while Cairo and
Washington or any other capital are not occupied," Mubarak
said.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured East Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast
War and wants to establish its capital in the holy city.
</P>
<P>
"I repeat that the issue of Jerusalem is very sensitive to
Muslims and Christians as much as it is to Jews...Building on
Jerusalem is in violation of the Oslo spirit," he said.
</P>
<P>
Amid a chorus of condemnation from the international community,
Israel today continues, for the second day, the construction of a
6,500-unit new Jewish neighborhood in Arab East Jerusalem, where
the Palestinians want as the capital of their future state.
</P>
<P>
On Har Homa on the southeastern outskirts of Jerusalem,
bulldozers and steam shovels went back to work early this morning
under heavy security guard. The Palestinians have set up protest
tents on the slope of a nearby hill overlooking the construction
site.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said the Israeli practices and policies in East
Jerusalem violate the Oslo and Madrid agreements and U.N. Security
Council resolutions. "I fear this can bulldoze the entire peace
process," said the president.
</P>
<P>
"What Netanyahu says that Oslo did not stipulate the
non-construction in Jerusalem is untrue," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian leader said no changes on the ground should be
made, especially regards Jerusalem, until the final talks produce
a settlement on a series of sensitive issues.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israelis have missed the Monday deadline
for the start of the final talks due to the Israeli housing
project as well as its limited further redeployment in the West
Bank. The Palestinians fear that their hope for establishing a
state with East Jerusalem as its capital might be diminished.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli premier, at a news conference in Tel Aviv
Tuesday night, dismissed Palestinian statements that the peace
process is over and defended his action to build at Har Homa as
keeping faith with Israel's past. "For 3,000 years, Jews dreamed
of Jerusalem," he said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said Israel would not bow to terrorist attacks, which
he said has secured a green light from Palestinian leadership.
</P>
<P>
At today's press conference, Mubarak also disclosed that a
fresh round of international efforts are under way to secure a
U.N. Security Council resolution that would conform with the one
recently adopted by U.N. General Assembly barring Israeli
construction on Arab lands.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, the U.S. vetoed a Security Council draft
resolution that condemns Israel's Har Homa project, prompting the
General Assembly to adopt a similar resolution last week.
</P>
<P>
In their latest contact, Mubarak and Netanyahu discussed the
difficulties and obstacles confronting the Palestinian-Israeli
peace track during a telephone conversation on the eve of the
groundbreaking for the Jewish neighborhood Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak warned against the Israeli settlement policy, saying
the consequences would be very grave. He urged Israel not to be
overconfident in its policy and to properly re-evaluate the
issue.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is the first Arab country to make peace with Israel but
ties between the two countries have deteriorated since Netanyahu
took power last June.

<HEADLINE> African Leaders Meet Again on Zaire Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 19 (Xinhua) -- An African regional summit on
the Zaire crisis was opened here today by Kenyan President Daniel
arap Moi, aiming to find a peaceful and lasting solution to the
conflicts in the Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
Zaire is first represented at such a meeting by its Prime
Minister Kengo wa Dondo who arrived here yesterday to seek
support from outside for his weakening government.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech at the summit, President Moi said:"I
believe that with Zaire's participation, the search for peace
will indeed gain considerable momentum."
</P>
<P>
Moi, who has initiated two Nairobi regional summits for
seeking peace in Zaire, noted that "the deteriorating situation
in Zaire calls for all our energies to check it to avoid further
bloodshed and human suffering".
</P>
<P>
He said that a negotiated settlement is necessary in order to
arrive at a lasting solution at this stage, urging all the
parties involved in the conflict to "restrain themselves and
guarantee peace and security for all the people".
</P>
<P>
The current meeting was also attended by Zimbabwean President
Roberto Mugabe, Congolese President Pascal Lissouba, Deputy
President of South Africa Thabo Mbaki and Prime Minister of
Cameroun Peter Mafany Musonge in place of President Paul Biya.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Sahnoun, special representative of the United Nations
and the Organization of African Unity (OAU), and
Secretary-General of the OAU Salim Ahmed Salim, invited by
President Moi, were also present at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
What is concluded at this meeting, during which the African
leaders are looking at the ways and means of resolving the Zaire
conflict, will be presented to the larger group of heads of state
as agreed at the Nairobi II summit of last December, Moi said.
</P>
<P>
Late last year, President Moi championed two Nairobi summits
on the Zaire crisis, but Zaire refused to attend them for the
presense of Uganda and Rwanda which are accused of supporting the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, the Kenyan president visited Zairean
President Mobutu Sese Seko and discussed the situation in Zaire
and the peace efforts of the regional leaders.
</P>
<P>
Later, foreign ministers of Zimbabwe, South Africa, Cameroun
and Kenya made a fact-finding mission to Kinshasa, capital of the
war-hit country.
</P>
<P>
Despite those peace efforts, the Zaire crisis is still
continuing to escalate.
</P>
<P>
The rebels led by Laurent Kabila have won a victory after
another and are still advancing on several fronts in Zaire. They
vowed to topple President Mobutu and his government.

<HEADLINE> China's Defense Minister Calls for Greater Patriotism (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Defense Minister Chi Haotian has
called for a nationwide campaign to educate citizens in patriotism
and national defense.
</P>
<P>
"We should make full use of the historic opportunity and
mobilize the whole nation for education in patriotism and national
defense," Chi, who is also vice-chairman of the Central Military
Commission and state councillor, said at the inaugural meeting of
a committee to organize activities on "Strengthening and
Revitalizing China."
</P>
<P>
Chi pointed out that China will end a historical disgrace when
it resumes sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1, 1997, and the
People's Liberation Army (PLA) will also mark the 70th anniversary
of its founding on August 1.
</P>
<P>
"Patriotism is the common spiritual support for all ethnic
groups in China," Chi said, "and is the banner to arouse people to
unite together and work harder."
</P>
<P>
He noted that patriotism has increased the cohesion of the
Chinese nation, especially in times of peril, and "peaceful
construction of socialism also requires patriotism for social
progress and improving the nation's self respect."
</P>
<P>
"Patriotism is certainly the theme of modern China of boosting
the socialist market economy and opening to the outside world," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The country should continue patriotism by teaching the people
to believe strongly in socialism and to increase the modernization
drive in accordance with Deng Xiaoping's theory of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics," Chi stressed.

<P>
He said that in "Strengthening and Revitalizing China" efforts
should be made to publicize Deng Xiaoping's great contribution to
China's revolution and construction and the country's outstanding
economic and social achievements since the Third Plenum of the
11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 1978.
</P>
<P>
"We should carry out the behest of Comrade Deng Xiaoping to
hold high the banner of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics and adhere to the Party's basic line for 100
years," Chi said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the leadership of the CPC Central Committee with
Jiang Zemin at the core, which has the art of leadership and
ability to deal with a complicated situation, is a faithful,
promising and enterprising successor to the great cause of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics and has won the
trust and support of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Increasing patriotism means that all people should rally more
closely around the CPC Central Committee with Jiang Zemin at the
core and consciously safeguard the authority of the Central
Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core, in order to continue the
socialist modernization drive, he said.
</P>
<P>
"To enhance patriotism, we must firmly implement the strategic
ideas of 'invigorating China through science and education'
and 'strengthening the army through science and technology,' so as
to improve the whole nation's scientific and cultural quality," he
said.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Russia Still Sharply Differ on NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Neither the United States nor
Russia has signaled any change in their positions on the expansion
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) on the eve of
their Helsinki summit.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Helsinki, Russia's Presidential Press
Secretary, Sergei Yastrzhembski, told reporters today his country
will not change its position of opposing the alliance's plan.
</P>
<P>
The Russian spokesman ruled out any possibility that Russia
will give in to the NATO enlargement during the two-day meeting
between Russian President Boris Yeltsin and U.S. President Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
After meeting Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeni Primakov in
Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright affirmed
Tuesday that NATO expansion would go ahead despite Russia's
objections.
</P>
<P>
"NATO enlargement will remain on track," she said, stressing
that, "New allies will enjoy the full benefits and assume the full
responsibilities of membership."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russian Foreign Minister Primakov also reiterated
that his country continued to oppose the alliance's expansion plan.
</P>
<P>
The United States would make "a rude and serious mistake if it
implements the plan for NATO's eastward enlargement," he said,
stressing that "our diplomacy has made enough concessions to the
United States" and "to concede further is no longer possible."
</P>
<P>
NATO expansion, which is to dominate the U.S.-Russian summit,
has been set as one of the top foreign policy priorities of the
second-term Clinton administration. The 16-member alliance will
select the first group of countries to join, most likely Hungary,
Poland and the Czech Republic, at its special summit in Madrid in
July.
</P>
<P>
The alliance's move was claimed by NATO members as a way of
creating a new security order in Europe in the next century.
Russia, however, believes that NATO's expansion will be isolated
and Russia's national security will be threatened.
</P>
<P>
A NATO-Russia agreement is at the center of the discussion.
The U.S. insists that such a document, or a charter, which will
provide a permanent forum for consultation between NATO and
Russia, does not need to be ratified by parliaments of the
countries involved.
</P>
<P>
Russia, which insisted the document should be ratified by
parliaments and so legally-binding to ensure its security, demands
a veto power over Europe's security affairs. But the U.S., a
leading member of the alliance, agrees only to give Moscow a voice.
</P>
<P>
The row has long soured the relations between Russia and
Western countries, especially the U.S., although Moscow has been
promised that a NATO-Russian charter will provide it with a major
role in Europe's security order in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Russia opposes any expansion of NATO, particularly fearing
membership by the neighboring Baltic and Nordic countries. But
the U.S. insists the alliance's door will still be open after the
first group of new members enter the organization.
</P>
<P>
Failure to achieve any progress during the talks between
foreign ministers of the U.S. and Russia in Washington Tuesday
made it more difficult for the already-tough summit to produce any
substantial breakthrough on NATO's enlargement, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
Machael McCurry, the White House spokesman, told reporters
after the meeting: "There will likely continue to be disagreements
after the summit in Helsinki."
</P>
<P>
He said that Clinton told Primakov that "the United States and
Russia are in this for the long haul; that they have the capacity
together to do extraordinary things." But, the spokesman added,
"There is a substantial amount of work that needs to be done to
clear away the residue of the Cold War period."
</P>
<P>
Both the U.S. and Russia are looking forward to making progress
in the talks on arms control and economic cooperation, which are
also main subjects for the two presidents to discuss.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the U.S. might make some concessions as further
measures to win the acquiescence of Russia to the alliance's
expansion.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents are expected to discuss a possible new round
of nuclear arms reduction and changes to the Treaty on
Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) signed in 1990 by more than 30
European countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Clinton may pledge more cash for assisting Moscow's
economic reforms since Russia has repeatedly complained that the
U.S. lags far behind countries like Germany, Japan and France in
investing in Russia.

<HEADLINE> Northwest China's Peak Period of Oil And Gas Exploration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region in northwest China is entering a peak period of oil and gas
exploration and has developed an annual crude production capacity
of 15 million tons.
</P>
<P>
According to an executive with the China National Petroleum
Corp (CNPC), 40 oil and gas fields have been discovered in the
Tarim, Junggar, and Turpan-Hami basins, with proven reserves of
two billion tons of oil.
</P>
<P>
They said that out of 23 key oil wells being dug in the Tarim
Basin, rich oil-bearing layers have been found in 13. A large oil
field with 45 million tons of reserves, and a large gas field with
20 billion cu m of gas have been discovered in the Caidong Desert
and Hutubi County.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a rich oil-bearing structure with proven reserves
of more than 50 million tons of oil was discovered in the
Turpan-Hami Basin recently. The Junggar Oilfield expects to put
its Xiaoguai field, which has proven reserves of 59 million tons,
into operation this year.
</P>
<P>
The executive said that with the sharp increase in the amount
of proven oil and gas reserves, total crude production capacity in
the Tarim, Junggar, and Turpan-Hami basins is expected to go from
15 million tons to 17 million tons by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the CNPC, the three great basins in Xinjiang will
have 1.5 billion tons in proven oil reserves and crude output of
24 million tons by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> German Money Supply Growth Down in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 19 (Xinhua) -- German central bank Bundesbank said
today that the country's broad-based M3 money supply growth shrank
remarkably in February as capital formation surged following a
standstill in January.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of the average of the last quarter of 1996, the M3
supply growth rate last month was at 9.1 percent, down from 11.7
percent in January.
</P>
<P>
The M3 includes cash, sight deposits, fixed deposits under four
years and savings deposits, being one of the chief indicators
under the close watch of central bank for inflationary trends.
</P>
<P>
The Bundesbank attributed active capital formation in February
to the decline in M3 supply. Capital formation refers to
expansion of producer goods such as machinery, buildings and
equipment, which tends to bring down money supply growth by
spending money.
</P>
<P>
For the year 1997, the Bundesbank has set a target corridor of
3.5 to 6.5 percent for the M3 expansion.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Denies Any Change in Position on Kashmir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan today denied any
change in its position on the Kashmir issue but said it would hold
talks with India with an "open mind".
</P>
<P>
"There is no change on Pakistan's position on the Kashmir issue
with the change of government," a Foreign Office spokesman said in
a special press briefing on the upcoming foreign secretary-level
talks between Pakistan and India to be held at the end of March.
</P>
<P>
"We will be going to India with a sincere and open frame of
mind and hope India would respond in the same spirit," he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Pakistan had always been desirous of
cooperative, tension-free and good neighborly relations with
India.
</P>
<P>
"We feel this is historical opportunity to make beginning
towards this end," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan now had a new government which was committed
to improving its relations with India by settling outstanding
problems.
</P>
<P>
However, he said Islamabad did not expect any agreement during
the talks.
</P>
<P>
"I am neither optimistic nor pessimistic about the outcome of
the talks," he said.
</P>

The spokesman reiterated that Islamabad welcomed good offices
of friendly countries and international organizations for the
resolution of outstanding issues between Pakistan and India.

<HEADLINE> Thatcher's Archives Go to Churchill College </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Former Britain prime minister,
Magaret Thatcher, decided on Tuesday to permanently store her
personal and political archives at Churchill College, a Cambridge
college named after her predecessor, Winston Churchill.
</P>
<P>
According to today's The Times newspaper, more than 1,000 boxes
of documents, videos, photographs and personal effects will be
donated to the college. There they will join the archives of Sir
Winston Churchill. Churchill is seen by Britons as a hero for his
leadership of the United Kingdom in the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
Thatcher earlier rejected quite a few approaches from American
universities and other foreign institutions anxious to possess an
important slice of modern history.
</P>
<P>
"I have always wanted my papers to stay in the United Kingdom,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
"I am therefore delighted that they are going to Churchill
College, where they will join the papers of many distinguished
20th-century figures, including of course those of Sir Winston
Churchill himself.
</P>
<P>
"I hope they will be a valuable source for students and
scholars who wish to study the great changes brought about the
governments that I had the privilege to lead."
</P>
<P>
Lady Thatcher, a Conservative, who occupied No.10, Downing
Street from 1979 to 1990, was the country's longest-serving prime
minister this century.
</P>
<P>
Her documents have been kept at the London office of the
Thatcher Foundation since her retirement.
</P>
<P>
Scholars will not, however, have immediate and unlimited access
to the papers. Many of them will be under cover of the
government's 30-year ban on releasing state papers.
</P>
<P>
Historians are particularly interested in unearthing the
secrets of the Falklands (Malvinas) War between Britain and
Argentina, the poll tax revolt and the 1984 miner's strike --
three milestones of the Thatcher era. But they will probably have
to be patient, unless they manage to persuade the Cabinet Office
to make exceptions.

<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen
met today with the president of the France-China Committee,
Jean-Pierre Desgeorges, who is now in Beijing with a large
economic and trade delegation to attend the third symposium on the
economies of China and France.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Qian said that the symposium, coming before
President Chirac's visit to China, is significant, and that he
wishes it success.
</P>
<P>
Desgeorges said that it is necessary for France and China to
hold economic symposiums on a regular basis. This symposium,
scheduled on March 20-21, is significant because it will be held
at the conclusion of the Fifth Session of the Eighth National
People's Congress of China and before the visit by President
Chirac.
</P>
<P>
He said that it will provide an opportunity for French
entrepreneurs to establish connections with Chinese from all walks
of life and to improve mutual understanding and trust.
</P>
<P>
Desgeorges is here at the invitation of the China Council for
the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT). CCPIT President Guo
Dongpo attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-French symposium is sponsored by CCPIT and the

<HEADLINE> Syrian Papers criticize Israeli Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Syrian newspapers criticized
severely today the Israeli government's decision to start
construction of a new Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu deliberately adds
fuel to the fire he kindled as he turned against the peace
process and its foundations and principles, and placed settlement
at the top of his priorities...," the Syrian newspaper Teshreen
said in an editorial.
</P>
<P>
Peace in the Middle East has become "a mere illusion" after
Israeli Bulldozers have rumbled in Arab Jerusalem," the paper
added.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government began building a new settlement on
the Har Homa hillside in East Jerusalem by sending bulldozers
under heavy guard to tear up the area Tuesday, defying strong
warnings that the move will damage the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper, mouthpiece of Syria's ruling al-Baath party
asserted that the Israeli move "will be a deadly blow to the
peace process, but Arab hands wouldn't remain pinioned up in the
face of the settlement crime."
</P>
<P>
The paper appealed to the international community to put
practical pressure on what it called a government that threatens
the security and stability of the region with the greatest
dangers.
</P>
<P>
In an article by editor-in-chief Fayez Saegh, the state-run
Al-Thawra newspaper described the start of the settlement building
as something that is going to bury the peace process ... under the
sight of the whole world."
</P>
<P>
The paper called on the Arabs to take firm and serious
attitudes compatible with the size of the disaster caused to
Jerusalem and the entire peace process.
</P>
<P>
Saegh added that without Jerusalem there will be no peace, and
that everything will remain in ink and paper unless the
U.S. government makes serious initiatives.

<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Northwest China Non-ferrous
Metals Research Institute has developed a new generation of
zirconium alloys, that may provide a technical foundation for
developing the country's nuclear industry.
</P>
<P>
Zirconium alloy is a crucial structural component of light
water reactors and is produced in only a few countries. Since the
1960s, the research institute, in northwest China's Shaanxi
Province, has developed Zir-2 and Zir-4 alloy materials, and has
used them in the Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant in east China's
Zhejinag province.
</P>
<P>
The improved Zir-4 alloy, which recently passed the China
National Non-ferrous Metals Industry Corporation's appraisal, has
better dynamics and is resistant to corrosion, according to
Chinese nuclear energy experts, and will greatly improve the
technical level of China's nuclear power equipment.

not affect the assistance given by Japan to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He said that Japan is awaiting the results of the judicial
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
The five Japanese who have been declared to be members of the
Japanese Red Army are currently being tried in Lebanon on charges
of holding false passport and residing illegally in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The radical Japanese "Red Army", which was founded in 1971,
was accused of being responsible for a series of terrorist attacks
in the Middle East and elsewhere in the 1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese diplomat remarked that things seem complicated
but Japan is confident that the Lebanese government will tackle
the issue wisely.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question on what was announced by the Japanese
detainees that they would commit suicide in case they were
extradited to Japan, the Japanese ambassador said that the
Lebanese government will be influenced by these remarks, but he
is absolutely confident of the government's ability to tackle the
question.
</P>
<P>
He affirmed that ties between Japan and Lebanon are firm and
that the issue would have no effect on Japan's effort for helping
Lebanon's reconstruction program.
</P>
<P>
Some Lebanese and Palestinian political parties held a meeting
here Tuesday to voice their solidarity with one of the Japanese
detainees, Kozo Okamoto, who was accused of involvement in the
shooting at Israeli Lodd Airport in 1972, in which 24 people were
killed and about 100 others wounded.
</P>
<P>
Okamoto was captured by the Israeli forces and sentenced to
life imprisonment but was released in a Palestinian-Israeli
prisoner swap in May, 1985.
</P>
<P>
The meeting called for releasing Okamoto and giving him
asylum.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Military Chief Denies Killing of Civilians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces
of the Philippines Arnulfo Acedera today denied reports that
government troops conducted an attack in Buldon, the southern
Philippines on Sunday night which resulted in the death of 10
pupils and a teacher.
</P>
<P>
Acedera said in a press statement that the reports were "untrue
and just a mere propaganda" of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front
(MILF), a 12,000-member rebel group in the southern part of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Major General Raul Urgello, chief of the Philippine Army's 6th
Infantry Division, reported that his troops didn't conduct any
operations that resulted in the killing of alleged pupils and a
teacher, Acedera said.
</P>
<P>
According to reports quoting MILF Vice Chairman Al Hadj Murad
for military affairs, government troops late Sunday fired howitzer
cannons that hit an Islamic school and allegedly killed the
civilians.
</P>
<P>
"They (military) missed our troops by a very far distance,
hitting the civilians," Murad was quoted by the reports as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, Acedera said the alleged incident did not occur and
just a mere propaganda of the MILF to gain recognition through
media.
</P>
<P>
"If we fire, we make sure our exact enemy targets by means of
our forward observers," said Acedera. "I think we have been
consistent on this matter."
</P>
<P>
The government and the MILF had held two rounds of low-level
talks since the beginning of the year. The two sides agreed to
form a third party to oversee a local ceasefire deal they signed
after a massive clash in February this year.

<HEADLINE> Experts See Good Prospects for HK, Inland Economic Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Experts from Hong Kong and the
Chinese inland areas today foresaw a bright picture for the
economic and trade cooperation between the two sides after Hong
Kong returns to her motherland in mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
Their optimism was expressed at a symposium organized today by
the Hong Kong China Importers and Exporters Association and Hong
Kong Commercial Daily on the economic prospects for Hong Kong and
the inland areas.
</P>
<P>
Last year Hong Kong recorded a 4.7-percent economic growth in
real terms with per capita gross domestic product reaching 24,490
U.S. dollars, higher than the level registered in a batch of
developed countries, L. F. Ng, chairman of the Hong Kong China
Importers and Exporters Association, told the forum.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the economy of the Chinese inland areas
enjoyed a sustained and rapid growth, he said.
</P>
<P>
With the closer ties between Hong Kong and the Chinese inland
areas after the return, Hong Kong will play an increasingly
important role in and benefit more from the economic development
of the Chinese inland areas, he claimed.
</P>
<P>
Economic links between the two sides have been strengthened
substantially since 1978 and both places have obtained substantial
benefits from this growing economic relationship.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, China's inland areas were Hong
Kong's largest trading partner, accounting for 35 percent of the
territory's overall trade value. They were also the largest market
 for and the largest supplier of Hong Kong's re-exports. About 88
percent of Hong Kong's re-exports involved the inland areas in
either direction.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Wong Yue-chim, director of the Hong Kong Center for
Economic Research under the University of Hong Kong, focused his
speech on mutual investment between Hong Kong and the Chinese
inland areas.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is an important source of external direct investment
in the Chinese inland areas, accounting for 55 percent of the
total in 1995, and Guangdong, the next-door neighbor of Hong
Kong, occupied an important position in this respect, the
professor said.
</P>
<P>
Yu Fei, head of a non-governmental organization for promoting
Guangdong's cooperation with Hong Kong and Macao, highlighted the
sound cooperative foundation between Guangdong and Hong Kong,
which was characterized by a huge amount of mutual investment,
expanded trade and enlarged scope of cooperation in the past few
years.
</P>
<P>
While predicting good prospects for bilateral economic
integration after the Hong Kong's return, Yu suggested the
high-tech industry and the services sector as the key fields for
future cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Another guest speaker was Leung Chun-ying, member of the
Executive Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.

<P>
FREETOWN, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria broke its silence today
over the arrest of Corporal Foday Sankoh, the former leader of
Sierra Leone's rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF), in Lagos
about a week ago.
</P>
<P>
A statement released by the Nigerian High Commission here said
Sankoh was arrested "after he arrived in Lagos with some of his
aides carrying arms and ammunition in clear contravention of
international laws."
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, Sankoh argued he was in Nigeria on
a private visit to see a friend.
</P>
<P>
"The Nigerian government then embarked on consultations with
Abidjan and Freetown only to be told that Sankoh left Abidjan
without the knowledge nor with the expressed permission of his
Ivorian host," the statement went on.
</P>
<P>
"Nigeria was not involved nor was it even aware of any
international conspiracy to terminate Sankoh's leadership of the
RUF," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh's arrest "now adds a new dimension to the whole episode
and the Nigerian government would continue its consultation with
the governments of the Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone and Guinea to
determine how best to resolve the problems posed by Sankoh."

<HEADLINE> Thai Government Lifts Caps on Finance Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Finance Ministry
regulation, which will allow finance companies to widen their
businesses, has won cabinet approval, the Government House said.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued at midnight on Tuesday, the
Government House said the approval of the new regulation is aimed
at offering more incentives to finance companies and encouraging
fairness in financial competition.
</P>
<P>
Under the new rule, finance companies can run other financial
businesses like foreign exchange transactions.
</P>
<P>
However, before widening their businesses, a finance company
has to obtain licenses from the Finance Ministry and increase its
registered capital by 100 million baht (4 million U.S. dollars)
for each license it wants to obtain.

<HEADLINE> Interview: HK People Capable of Building Better HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong people have full
confidence in their future and have the ability to run Hong Kong
well, according to Tang Ying-yen, chairman of the Federation of
Hong Kong Industries.
</P>
<P>
"There should be no doubt about Hong Kong people's ability in
running Hong Kong; actually it was the Hong Kong people themselves
who created the Hong Kong miracle," Tang said in a recent
interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Tang has been elected as a member of the Provisional
Legislative Council and a member of the Executive Council of the
future Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), and he is
also an incumbent member of the Legislative Council of the present
Hong Kong government.
</P>
<P>
Although Hong Kong has been under British colonial rule for
over 150 years, he said, Hong Kong people have always played the
most significant role in managing Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"The majority of civil servants are Chinese. Although the most
senior officials are British, it is Chinese who are doing all the
practical things," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he does not foresee any major changes in civil
servants' loyalty to the future SAR government.
</P>
<P>
"The chief executive of the SAR has been elected through
democratic procedures. This fully reflects the choice of Hong
Kong people and represents great progress in Hong Kong's
democratic process.
</P>
<P>
"Considering Mr. Tung Chee Hwa's credibility and work
performance, I think that he will be able to lead the Hong Kong
people in building Hong Kong into one of the best economic centers
in Asia," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the foundation of "one country, two systems" policy was
laid in 1984 when the Sino-British Joint Declaration was signed
and the Basic Law has been well understood by the Hong Kong
people.
</P>
<P>
"At first many people doubted if Hong Kong could continue to
maintain its stability and prosperity and they had no idea about
how to implement the 'one country, two systems' policy."
</P>
<P>
"Now, all the issues that caused Hong Kong people's concerns
have been gradually solved, including the PLA troops' garrison in
Hong Kong, the Court of Final Appeal and the election of the SAR
chief executive. Hong Kong people are looking forward to the
arrival of July 1 with great happiness when they will return to
the motherland," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that with only 100 days to go before the handover, it
is already foreseeable that Hong Kong's legal system, life style,
fair competition, free economy and many other things will remain
basically unchanged. Thus, the Hong Kong people, who are a very
realistic community, have no reason to worry.
</P>
<P>
"You can see that in the past few years there were much fewer
emigrants and many of those who emigrated in the earlier years
have already come back," he said. "After all, we are all Chinese
and Hong Kong is the best place for us to make a fortune."
</P>
<P>
As a member of the SAR Executive Council, Tang said, he will do
his best to be a good advisor to the chief executive.
</P>
<P>
"Both before and after the election, Mr. Tung Chee Hwa has
always stressed a few issues that need to be dealt with --
housing, education, the problems of the elderly and industrial
development," he said. "These are precisely the primary issues
that Hong Kong people are concerned about."
</P>
<P>
Tang is best known for his ideas about the development of the
manufacturing industry in Hong Kong. He always believes that a
metropolis like Hong Kong should not become a city of pure service
industry; instead, it should make efforts to retain a certain
number of factories.
</P>
<P>
"Successful small economies in the world, such as Singapore,
Switzerland and Taiwan, all have policies which urge factories to
stay, because the manufacturing industry can provide fairly stable
jobs for the society," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that a healthy economy must include commerce,
industry, finance and other industries.
</P>
<P>
Tang is managing director of Peninsula Knitters Ltd. and
director of Meadville Ltd. He has been engaged in the
manufacturing industry for over 20 years and is the first Hong
Kong businessman to invest in Xinjiang and Shanghai on the
mainland and he also has joint ventures in Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
"My expertise lies in the manufacturing industry and in the
Executive Council I will give my advice on Hong Kong's industrial
development," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said high technology is another significant sector that
should not be neglected in Hong Kong. He will suggest that the
future SAR government allocate more money to scientific research
institutes and make other efforts to encourage this sector's
development.
</P>
<P>
"Personnel exchange with the mainland should also be
encouraged. The mainland is rich in high-tech personnel while Hong
Kong has sufficient development funds. Personnel exchanges would
benefit both sides," he said.

<HEADLINE> Australia Sends Top-Level Negotiator to PNG </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard sent a senior experienced negotiator as his personal
emissary to Papua New Guinea (PNG) to intensify the country's
efforts against the use of mercenaries on PNG's Bougainville
island.
</P>
<P>
Howard won approval for sending the emissary during a 10-minute
phone conversation with his PNG counterpart, Julius Chan, this
afternoon, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Affairs Department chief Philip Flood was dispatched as
the emissary and he will urge PNG to drop its planned use of
mercenaries against the secessionists on Bougainville and to
instead adopt "reasonable alternatives" outlined by Howard during
private talks with Julius two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
In an address to the parliament, Howard said, "I continue to
hold to the view that it is not in the interest of PNG, it is not
in the interest of the region, it's certainly not in our
interest."
</P>
<P>
Reports from Port Moresby, capital of the South Pacific nation,
said more than 2,000 people staged a demonstration against the
dismissal of the chief of the PNG Defense Force Jerry Singirok.
</P>
<P>
Police fired shots and tear-gas as an anti-government rally
outside the Murray army barracks in the capital erupted into
violence today. But there were no reports of injuries or arrests.
</P>
<P>
Singirok, who on Monday led a military mutiny by asking for the
resignation of the prime minister and refusing to work with the
mercenaries hired by the government, was dismissed from his post.

<HEADLINE> Sudan's Rebels Hand Over Files of Ugandan Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The rebel Sudanese People's
Liberation Army (SPLA) handed over a batch of captured files of
the West Nile Bank Front (WNBF) to the Ugandan authorities, the
New Vision reported today.
</P>
<P>
Security officers were "shocked" when they read of the names
of those persons who collaborate with the WNBF rebels, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
The names listed in the files include politicians, lawyers,
doctors, businessmen and even some people who pretended to be the
supporters of the Ugandan government, they said.
</P>
<P>
The security officers said some people involved were dealing
with Sudanese leader Omar Bashir and the WNBF.
</P>
<P>
The files have been captured by SPLA in the office of Juma
Oris, the leader of the WNBF, in the southern Sudanese city of
Morobo, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Oris is believed to be on the run in bushes with some of his
supporters surviving an ambush on Morobo-Yei road last week. He
was wounded in the battle and was hunted for by the SPLA, James Wani
Igga, the General Secretary of Sudanese People's Liberation
Movement, told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
He said that the SPLA has captured more than 500 WNBF rebels and
is ready to hand over them to Uganda through the International
Committee of Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
The SPLA killed more than 800 WNBF members in the ambush, he
added. enditem

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Establish Sugar Security Reserve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Sugar Regulatory
Administration today decided to establish a sugar security reserve
to prevent manipulators from playing around with sugar stocks and
prices.
</P>
<P>
Sugar Regulatory Administrator Wilson Gamboa said he had made
the recommendation to the Presidential Task Force on Sugar, a
multi-agency group overseeing reforms in the sugar sector.
</P>
<P>
Gamboa said the sugar reserve for a particular year should not
fall below the country's consumption for two months. The country
consumed 2 million metric tons of sugar last year.
</P>
<P>
"The sugar reserve will serve as a buffer against shortages and
manipulation, both in stock position and prices," said Gamboa.
</P>
<P>
He added that schemers would always want to play around with
sugar prices and supply because big money is involved and there
are hardly sanctions against them.
</P>
<P>
The country's sugar industry has been plagued by a price crisis
since last fall because of a glut of sugar in the domestic market
as a result of smuggling and over-importation from abroad.

<HEADLINE> UNCP Leads in Nigerian Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 19 (Xinhua) -- As more results of Nigeria's local
government elections on Saturday are coming out, the United
Nigeria Congress Party (UNCP) is still keeping its leading
position.
</P>
<P>
Figures from 33 of the 36 states show that the UNCP won the
chairmanship elections in 271 local government areas, and the
Democratic Party of Nigeria won in 156 areas.
</P>
<P>
The three other parties -- the National Center Party of
Nigeria (NCPN), the Grassroots Democratic Party (GDP) and the
Congress of National Consensus (CNC) scored 38, 39 and 42,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
An analysis of the results show that the UNCP now leads in
five of the six zones created by the 1995 Constitution of Nigeria
under which the future presidency will be rotating between the
zones.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Champion newspaper reported today that the CNC,
whose national leaders were detained for "security reason" on
Sunday, has directed its local election committees to report all
electoral malpractices to its National Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the party is not satisfied with the outcome
of Saturday's elections and is heading for electoral tribunals in
seeking to rewrite the results in several states.
</P>
<P>
"There are clear cases of manipulation and intimidation by
some NECON (National Electoral Commission of Nigeria) officials
in favor of a particular party," the party's Director of
Publicity and Documentation David Dogoh was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's Head of State General Sani Abacha is expected to
meet today in Abuja with NECON and other agencies in charge of
the transition to civil rule program to review Saturday's
elections.

<HEADLINE> More Jobs for Unemployed Workers in East China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Forty percent of the unemployed
workers in east China's Zhejiang Province have found work again,
as more than 110,000 unemployed workers in the province found jobs
through various channels last year.
</P>
<P>
The number of unemployed in China has been on the rise in
recent years because of the population growth and enterprise and
industrial restructuring. At the end of last year, over 160,000
people were registered as unemployed in Zhejiang alone.
</P>
<P>
Governments at various levels in Zhejiang started to set up
special offices to deal with the unemployment problem in 1994, and
the following year the provincial people's congress announced a
mandate on finding jobs for lay-off workers.
</P>
<P>
Special funds were set up in the cities of Ningbo and Jinhua
for training the unemployed or out-of-work people, and
unemployment in the cities is being held to within three percent.
</P>
<P>
The managerial reforms in enterprises, especially state-own
ones, will continue to be a focus of the province's economic
development this year, meaning that more redundant laborers will
need to be dealt with, officials said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Israeli Continues Har Homa Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Amid a chorus of condemnation
from the international community, Israel today continues, for
the second day, the construction of a new Jewish neighborhood in
Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
On Har Homa (Jabal Abu Ghneim) on the southeastern outskirts
of Jerusalem, bulldozers and steam shovels went back to work
early this morning under heavy security guard.
</P>
<P>
Massive Israeli security, including army helicopters circling
overhead, was deployed throughout the area and on the roads
leading to the site as police and the Israeli troops were on
full alert for any disturbances by protesting Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In the West Bank, Bethlehem and Hebron were declared closed
military areas. Joint Israeli-Palestinian patrols were
temporarily suspended and Joseph's Tomb in Nablus was closed.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani said that
the Israeli security establishment had been aware of the threats
for a long time and prepared for any flare-up, adding "our
response will be quick and hard wherever necessary."
</P>
<P>
Kahalani called for restraint and said people must understand
"that Jerusalem is our capital and we will build there. I expect
restraint from both sides for the sake of the peace process
which is good for both peoples."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu dismissed
Palestinian statements that the peace process is over and
defended his action to build at Har Homa as keeping faith with
Israel's past.
</P>
<P>
"For 3,000 years, Jews dreamed of Jerusalem," he declared.
</P>
<P>
In a concession gesture, Netanyahu said Tuesday night that
his government would consider building an additional 1,000 homes
for Palestinians on a hilltop adjacent to Har Homa.
</P>
<P>
"There is a nearby hilltop which we call Har Homa 2, which
was expropriated from private Arab hands," Netanyahu told Israel
Television. "We are considering turning this into an Arab
neighborhood," he added
</P>
<P>
The Israeli prime minister said that he had discussed this
idea with Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert.
</P>
<P>
A few weeks ago, Netanyahu's announcement that Israel would
permit 3,015 Palestinian homes to be built was met with massive
derision by Palestinians who insisted that he was not sincere.
</P>
<P>
"We do not need houses for Palestinians," said Palestinian
Council Speaker Ahmed Queria, "We do not want all this way of
bluffing."
</P>
<P>
None of the concessions offered or being considered by
Netanyahu are considered serious by Palestinians, since opening
the airport, seaport and a free passage route between Gaza and
the West Bank are guaranteed under terms of the interim
agreement, Palestinian sources said.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat
turned down an appeal by Netanyahu for a meeting Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu charged that "the Palestinian leadership has given
the green light to the worst terrorist organizations in the
world to go ahead with the kind of bus bombings and suicide
attacks, the kind of mass killings that brought a halt to the
peace process."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the release of Hamas "murderer" Ibrahim
Makadmah from prison last week was a "signal" to permit
attacks. However, PNA officials deny this.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the Israeli charge, U.S. State Department Spokesman
Nicholas Burns said in a press briefing Tuesday that the United
States has not seen any evidence that Yasser Arafat has "given a
green light" to Hamas to incite violence in Israel.
</P>
<P>
"On the contrary, we have recent assurances from Chairman
Arafat that he stands against violence, that he will encourage
all of his followers in the Palestinian community to renounce
violence," Burns said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in the Israeli Knesset (parliament), the Arab
Hadash party filed a no-confidence motion Tuesday over the
building at Har Homa.
</P>
<P>
"The government is inviting a particularly dangerous
escalation," faction chairman Salah Salim said, adding "It seems
it is prepared to sacrifice the political process on the altar of
illogical and stubborn nationalism."
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Tuesday, Tamar Gozansky and Ahmed Sa'sad, both
Hadash members of the Knesset, were removed from Har Homa by
security forces after they tried to bodily block the
bulldozers.
</P>
<P>
Other political response to the start of the construction was
predictable, with the Israeli Left warning of violence and the
end of the peace process and the Right praising the decision to
stress Israel's sovereignty over Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The first homes on Har Homa may be ready for occupancy as
early as the end of 1999, according to Israeli Housing Ministry
spokesman Moshe Eilat.
</P>
<P>
He said the surveying, that began Tuesday and intended to
chart out roads and sewage lines, could be finished within two
weeks. Then work would begin on building the infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
"It all depends on how fast the work is carried out and how
many people are involved," he said, adding it was not yet clear
how many contractors would be involved in the project.

Lagos, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has called for the
strenghtening of its military co-operation between the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea, the official News Agency of Nigeria
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi reportedly made the remarks in
Abuja on Monday at the opening of bilateral talks with a visiting
north Korea delegation headed by its Vice-Premier Kim Yong Nam.
</P>
<P>
He said that such a co-operation will enable the two
countries to respond to challenges to their independence and
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi also indicated Nigeria's interests to co-operate with north
Korea in agriculture, solid mineral and other fields, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The north Korean vice-premier called for unity among developing
nations to enable them to withstand the continuous fight among world
powers for international supremacy, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are expected to sign several agreements today
before the departure of the north Korean delegation, the report
added. Endtiem

<HEADLINE> Russia Holds Firm Opposition to NATO's Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Helsinki, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Russia said today it will not
change its opposition to the expansion plan of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) until the last moment.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters here, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, Russia's
presidential press secretary, said that his country will not
change positions on the alliance's enlargement despite the
presidential summit which is due to start on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The summit between Russian President Boris Yeltsin and U.S.
President Bill Clinton will be "an opportunity" for the two
countries to lay more bricks for building new foundations for
Russia-U.S. relationship in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Yastrzhembsky said that the summit is "of great significance"
because "it is the first summit after both presidents were
re-elected" and the first summit after a long period in which the
two presidents have not met.
</P>
<P>
NATO's expansion is expected to dominate the two-day
summit. But neither side has signaled any concessions over the
issue. The two presidents are also expected to discuss arms
control and bilateral economic relations.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia: Time Needed to Restore Ties With Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia said today that
restoration of its relationship with Singapore to the past level
will take time, but it accepted Singapore Senior Minister Lee Kuan
Yew's apology and retraction of his disparaging remarks on Johore.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian government accepted the unreserved apology
tendered by Lee and viewed positively his intention to retract
the offending remarks, Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said
in a short statement issued at a news conference here today.
</P>
<P>
"However, it should be acknowledged that this episode has
deeply hurt Malaysians of all sections of society and that
restoration of the old level relationship would take time," the
foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
The former Singapore prime minister described Johore, a
Malaysian state close to Singapore, as a place "notorious for
shootings, muggings, and car jackings" in an affidavit filed in a
defamation suit against Singapore opposition figure Tang Liang
Hong, who fled to Johore after allegedly receiving death threats.
</P>
<P>
His remarks caused a diplomatic furor.
</P>
<P>
Badawi added that the Malaysian government noted that Lee had
personally signed a press statement dated March 17 in which he
repeated his unreserved apology and stated that he had instructed

<HEADLINE> Arafat Calls For Non-Violent Reaction Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat has called on his compatriots not to resort to violence
in reaction to the construction Har Homa Jewish settlement in the
Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In a statement broadcast by Radio of Palestine today, Arafat
persuaded the furious Palestinians not to be dragged into violent
acts by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials say that the building will have a
disastrous impact on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Saeb Erekat, Palestinian negotiator and minister of Local
Government, told Israel Radio that (Prime Minister Binyamin)
Netanyahu's decision to send bulldozers Tuesday to build the
settlement was itself an incitement of violence and confrontation.
</P>
<P>
He charged that March 18 was a black day for the peace
process and Netanyahu would go down in history as a leader who
succeeded in destroying the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Only minor incidents were reported on Tuesday night in
response to the ground-breaking of Har Homa.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of Palestinian youths hurled stones at Israeli soldiers
from Umm Tuna village at the edge of the site. They burned tires
and blocked a road. In another village nearby, some youngsters
scuffled with heavily-armed Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
Arafat called his higher security committee into an emergency
session in Gaza on Tuesday night to discuss the situation.
</P>
<P>
The 88-member Palestinian Council is due to meet
Thursday. Different Palestinian factions, including opposition
groups, met in different cities to discuss ways and means to react
to Har Homa construction.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday afternoon, Arafat in Gaza received Yuval Rabin,
son of the late Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin and head of
A Whole Generation Seeks Peace organization.
</P>
<P>
Yuval asked the Palestinian leader not to commit violence
because it would not help the peace process. Arafat agreed by
saying, "We face a government which has many members who do not
understand peace, and we will have to convince them by all
means."
</P>
<P>
Yossi Sarid, chairman of the leftwing Israeli Meretz Party
and former Labor government minister of environment, also called
at Arafat's office, addressing the same issue. He told
Arafat: "Don't be so excited ... It's a long and very complicated
process...."
</P>
<P>
According to a report from Amman, Jordan, a leader of the
Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) called for violent
resistance and criticized Arafat for only launching a peaceful
one.

<HEADLINE> Social Security Web Takes Shape in Hunan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- More than 90 percent of the
employees of the state businesses in Central China's Hunan
province have fewer worries about unemployment, since their
income is protected by the province's social security network.
</P>
<P>
The network was only part of a national social security web,
which took shape in 1986 as a strategy to build a more mature and
efficient insurance system for its people, instead of the past
practice of laying the entire welfare burden on businesses.
</P>
<P>
"The new security web fits the needs better for enterprise
reforms and adjustment of the industrial structure," said an
official with the provincial labor bureau.
</P>
<P>
More than 80 percent of the workers in collectively-owned
enterprises, and a half of those with the overseas-funded
businesses were also insured against unemployment.
</P>
<P>
An old-age pension system "stabilized" the provincial economy,
paying out retirement pension to thousands of employees from
bankrupt enterprises last year, and distributing relief funds to
nearly 100,000 jobless people and workers in debt-ridden
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Medical insurance reform was well underway, while the accidents
and maternity insurance already covered workers of all the state
enterprises and most of the collectively-owned businesses in major
industrial cities including Zhuzhou, Changsha and Xiangtan.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Praises Tanzanian Govt on Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has praised
the Tanzanian government for having succeeded in reducing
expenditure from 21.4 percent to 19.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
World Bank Representative Ronald Brigish made the remarks here
on Tuesday when discussing economical activities funded by the
World Bank in Tanzania with the Tanzanian Parliamentary Foreign
Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
He also praised the Tanzania government for the reductions of
the deficit from 6.9 percent to 4.9 percent, the inflation rate
from 30 percent to 18 percent and for the increase of revenue
from 14.5 percent to 15 percent in l996.
</P>
<P>
He said the achievement was initiated by Mkapa's insistence on
adhering to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) fiscal program
whose implementation led to an agreement with the Enhanced
Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) in November.
</P>
<P>
Brigish added that the present measures introduced by the
government to liberalize the economy and reduce the role of the
public sector have yielded significant gains and won wide support
for a poverty reduction strategy through sustainable growth.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian government would secure economic stability and allow
the implementation of its medium-term development strategy so as
to reduce poverty by maximizing growth, drawing initially on the
potential of the agriculture sector and laying the ground work
for the rapid expansion of mining and tourism, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The World Bank is in broad agreement with Tanzania's
strategic objective and it will most effectively assist the
country by focusing on improving fiscal management, the rural
sector, infrastructure development and the environment for
private sector growth", he said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Portfolio Performance (PP), Brigish said that
since June 1996 active portfolio has consisted of 22 projects
with 1.2 billion U.S. Dollars of total commitments.
</P>
<P>
Currently, 13.6 percent, or three projects are rated as
unsatisfactory in the implementation performance, down from 22
percent at the end of 1996, he added.

<HEADLINE> Manager Selection Process Popular In Central China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The democratic election of
company managers by workers is catching on and giving new life to
money-losing enterprises in central China's Henan Province and has
caught society's attention.
</P>
<P>
More than 80 percent of 400 major debt-ridden enterprises that
adopted the new election policy have been turned around, the local
government reports.
</P>
<P>
As employees increase their rights through democratic elections
they show greater enthusiasm about management in their enterprises
by making proposals.
</P>
<P>
Managers in China have usually been appointed by authorities
higher up and some did not enjoy very high prestige among
employees, nor did they care very much about the opinions of
workers.
</P>
<P>
Given such circumstances, employees would naturally grow
indifferent to their work, resulting in poor performance in the
workplace.
</P>
<P>
"Once the workers become masters of their own destiny, their
initiative and power will be immense," one manager of a textile
factory in Luoyang, Henan Province, remarked.

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Open Special Lanes for Buses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Beijing will set aside a special
lane for buses on its major Chang'an Avenue to ease congestion,
officials with the municipal government said.
</P>
<P>
The move is part of the city's strategy of giving priority to
the public transport system. By the end of the year special lanes
for buses will be opened on another three major streets.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate more than 1.1 million motor vehicles
registered in Beijing, together with 9.4 million non-motor
vehicles. More than 60,000 vehicles from outside the city stop
by Beijing every day.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government's great efforts in road construction
had been outpaced by the increase in the number of vehicles,
especially that of private cars.
</P>
<P>
Urban road experts said the priority for public transport, a
common strategy in major world cities, is necessary for Beijing to
deal with its severe congestion.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government plans to add 200 buses and
trolleybuses, open 20 new bus routes, and extend the service hours
of 30 bus routes, especially in selected densely populated
residential areas.
</P>
<P>
The number of tricycles running inside the Third Beltway of
Beijing will be reduced from the present 230,000 to 80,000,
according to municipal officials.

<HEADLINE> Voluntary Service: College Students' New Choice in Spare Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, March 19 (Xinhua) -- What are university students
doing in their spare time?
</P>
<P>
Li Zhuanxia, a student at Lanzhou College of Commerce in
northwest China's Gansu province gives one answer: helping
those in need.
</P>
<P>
Li Zhuanxia said: "Contributing to society means a lot to me,
and contribution should be more than lip service."
</P>
<P>
Apart from entertainment, part-time jobs, and attending
training classes, the new trend of young volunteers reflects the
values of the college students, which emphasize contributing to
their community.
</P>
<P>
In a quiet ward in the Gansu Provincial Cadre Medical Care
Hospital, Li Xhuanxia takes care of a patient. When asked about
her experience, the girl smiled shyly: "I have taken care of my
granny. Taking care of strangers here is no different than taking
care of my family members."
</P>
<P>
Li Qi, a 19-year old Lanzhou University student, has volunteered
to take care of the two children of Zhang Aisha, a driver of the
university. Zhang must work and his wife is in poor health.
</P>
<P>
With Li Qi's help, Zhang's two children have made great
progress at school. Li Qi said that, half of her 33 classmates
have joined the voluntary service activity: "I like to stay with
children, and will provide voluntary service as long as possible."
</P>
<P>
Students of Lanzhou College of Commerce often come to the home
of Hu Jicheng, an 81-year old professor, to do some housework. The
professor said: "We are like friends and exchange our opinions
over some problems."
</P>
<P>
The students said: "This contact is not as formal as in
classroom, and we feel good. The experience and opinion of our
teachers will be a big help to us."

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Per Capita GDP 2,651 U.S. dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The per capital gross domestic
product (GDP) of Shanghai stands at 22,000 yuan, or about 2,651
U.S. dollars at current convertible rates.
</P>
<P>
Xu Kuangdi, Mayor of Shanghai, disclosed this yesterday when
addressing an on-going international symposium sponsored by the
United Nation's Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the
Pacific (ESCAP) to mark its 50th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
Half a century ago, the UN set up in Shanghai the Economic
Commission for Asia and the Far East (ECAFE), the predecessor of
the ESCAP.
</P>
<P>
As China's biggest economic and financial center, Shanghai has
many unique advantages and has entered a period of fast economic
development since the central government decided to implement the
strategy of developing and opening the Pudong New Area in early
1990s, said the mayor.
</P>
<P>
From 1992 to 1996, the metropolis had an annual GDP growth
rate of 13 percent, and service trade now contributes 42 percent
to the city's GDP, in contrast to 30 percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Pudong New Area, whose preferential policies for development,
include opening its foreign market to domestic provinces and
openinf its financial market to overseas investors, has had an
annual growth rate of 20 percent in GDP since it was allowed for
large-scale development six years ago.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, the city has invested 110 billion
yuan in infrastructure and has completed a number of municipal
projects and made progress in rebuilding old city areas.
</P>
<P>
According to the mayor, the city will build more new apartment
buildings with a combined floor space of 10 million sq m annually
in the years to come.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has established national markets involving securities,
metals, commodity futures, technologies, and foreign exchanges and
has solidified its position as a national center of resource
mobilization.
</P>
<P>
Modern enterprise system has also been tried widely in the
city, together with new mechanism for management and operation of
state-owned assets.
</P>
<P>
Annual contractual volume of foreign direct investment to the
city has been 10 billion U.S. dollars for a succession of three
years, with half of the world's top 100 industrial transnational
companies coming to invest in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Foreign financial business organizations have set up 200
branches or representative offices in the city.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Ostrich Exports Up This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The buoyant world demand for
ostriches is likely to earn Zimbabwe about 10 million US Dollars
this year, the daily the Herald reported today.
</P>
<P>
This represents an increase of 10 percent from last year's export
earnings of about nine million US Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe was one of the African countries which have been
supplementing the demand in Europe by the ostrich farmers who
have failed to produce enough to meet the soaring market.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Ostrich Producers' Association of Zimbabwe Stowe
Philip said the export of live birds to Europe had helped create
demand and build a solid base for the local industry.
</P>
<P>
Responding to criticism that live-bird exports would kill future
exports of meat, skin and feather, Philip said Zimbabwe stood to win
if it continued with the exports.
</P>
<P>
The industry hoped to slaughter about 30,000 birds this year,
which would produce slightly over 750 tonnes of export meat.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland and Belgium remain the major buyers of Zimbabwe's
ostrich meat, followed by Holland, France and Germany. There have
been a lot of inquiries from Spain and Russia. enditem

<HEADLINE> Uganda Postpones Local Government Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has postponed elections
of local governments to September this year from this month, due
to a lack of money.
</P>
<P>
An official in the Ministry of Local Government was quoted by
the People, a local newspaper, today as dislosing that the
government has no money and it had also failed to interest donors
to fund the elections.
</P>
<P>
The official preferring anonymity said revenue collection had
fallen and the money of the Uganda revenue authority goes largely
to funding the wars in the north and paying civil servants'
salaries.
</P>
<P>
He said the situation has been aggravated by famine looming in
the east and north of the country.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has five levels of local governments under the central
government, namely district councils, county councils, sub-county
councils, parish councils, and village councils.
</P>
<P>
The local council elections were anticipated to cost about 10
million US Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the ministries of Finance, Justice, Local
Government and the President's Office have been discussing
strategies for collecting the money so that the elections are
held as early as possible. enditem

<HEADLINE> Laid-off Worker Creates More Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, March 19 (Xinhua) -- A model worker in north
China's Hebei Province who was laid off has created a brighter
future for herself and more jobs for her unemployed sisters.
</P>
<P>
"Losing jobs years ago meant the end; but now it just means a
new beginning; and in the near future it will mean a chance for
the laid-off to become masters of their own destiny," says Li
Cuihua, a former worker in a canvas factory of the Fengfeng Mining
Areas of the province.
</P>
<P>
She had been a dressmaker in the factory for 16 years before
losing her job in 1992 when the factory went bankrupt. As a
provincial-level model worker, Li could count on the local
government for help. But she didn't rely on this.
</P>
<P>
The woman set up a dress-making stand along the street, and at
the end of the month, she was surprised to find that her profits
were three times that of the factory. She worked harder.
</P>
<P>
The more she earned, the more she was concerned about her
former fellow workers, most of whom were unemployed.
</P>
<P>
Her plan to process garments on a larger scale met immediate
support from authorities. A clothing factory started business on
October, 1993. A dozen of laid-off women workers took their sewing
machines and gathered around Li, their new boss.
</P>
<P>
The women cherish their new choices and adapt themselves to
market economy, updating sewing skills.
</P>
<P>
Li's brainchild is growing up, with 100 workers, and established
reputation in the local sector. The 39-year-old woman has
more ambitious ideas.
</P>
<P>
The Mining Areas invited public bidding last year for its
largest clothing factory which were stranded in heavy losses. Li
and her factory were chosen to run the plant based on their credit
and management experience.
</P>
<P>
She adopts the policy of distribution according to work, which
has brought workers' initiative into full play. The two factories
are both having good economic results and have begun to process
garments for export.
</P>
<P>
"I am the boss and a worker at the same time, and I have my own
quotas, and will be faced with unemployment again if I don't work
hard," Li says.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Zambia Ranks 3rd in ACP's Floricultural </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has become the third
largest floricultural exporter to the European Union after Kenya
and Zimbabwe among the African-Caribbean-Pacific (ACP) countries.
</P>
<P>
The country's exports of floricultural products to EU reached
four million European Currency Units (ECU) last year, according
to the latest Export Review issued by the Export Board of Zambia
(EBZ).
</P>
<P>
Kenya takes the lead with 78 million ECU of floricultural
exporting while Zimbabwe ranks second with 36 million ECU.
</P>
<P>
The other ACP big exporters are Cote d'Ivoire, Tanzania,
Malawi and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
On the whole, the ACP countries increased their market share
in the EU by exporting a total of 125 million ECU of floricultural
goods last season, accounting for over 30 percent of European
imports of fresh flowers.
</P>
<P>
The increase mainly emerges in central, eastern and southern
Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Zambia Export Growers Association (ZEGA) has excelled in
promoting the country's fresh horticultural exports on the
international arena after winning a bronze medal at an
international flower show in the Netherlands last year.
</P>
<P>
ZEGA Chairman Stephen Humphreys said that this is a big
achievement which places Zambia firmly on the map of world
floricultural products.
</P>
<P>
Zambian roses and other cut flowers have attracted
considerable interest from world buyers in the recent flower show
in the Netherlands, according to local reports. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean farmers are expected
to produce 2.4 to 2.6 million tons of maize this season, which
will meet all local demands with a surplus for increasing
strategic stocks or for exports, the Herald reported today.
</P>
<P>
The continuous rains in January and February and the
associated fungal grey leaf spot disease in some major commercial
farming areas peg the yield equal to or just below last year's
2.6 million tons, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The commercial harvest will be down over last year while the
small holders might produce maize a little more.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Commercial Grain Producers' Association Ian
Gibson said if the rains had been better spaced and the fungus
disease had not infiltrated northern Zimbabwe, the harvest could
have approached three million tons. enditem

<P>
KAMPALA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan economy has been
hurt by the twin wars currently raging in eastern Zaire and
southern Sudan, reported the local daily the Monitor today.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan Finance Minister Mayanja Nkangi was quoted Tuesday as
saying that a shortage in revenue collection is expected in the

<HEADLINE> China's "Sunglass City" Exports Millions Daily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, March 19 (Xinhua) -- In Wenzhou, a commercial city in
east China's Zhejiang Province, it's the little things that count.
</P>
<P>
The coastal city has built up fortune from minor items like
sunglasses, buttons, and cigarette lighters.
</P>
<P>
Exports of sunglasses from Wenzhou averaged one million pairs a
day and amounted to 800 million yuan in 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to Shou Jiading, a glass maker-turned-entrepreneur,
spectacle factories sprang up in Wenzhou in the early 1990s from
"only a couple of small workshops" to more than 200 firms, of
which 90 percent are export-oriented.
</P>
<P>
Shou attributes the boom to their prompt response to market
demands. "For the same quality, the spectacles made in Wenzhou are
30 percent cheaper than those available in the international
market," he said. "Also, local makers can start manufacture of a
new model in a week while our overseas counterparts need about
three months."
</P>
<P>
To upgrade the products, Shou and bosses of other key factories
will invest 100 million yuan in developing new optics in
Wenzhou.

<HEADLINE> China Eyes Bigger Role for Market-Oriented Financial Leverage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- China will resort further to
market-oriented financial leverage this year as it boosts the use
of bills, expand the bills discounting and re-discounting business
this year.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China, the central bank, will increase its
quota for bills re-discounted by 20 billion yuan this year, and
further foster a bills market, said a central bank official.
</P>
<P>
In bill re-discounting, the central bank discounts the undue
bills of commercial banks which received them through discounting
from their clients. With a modification of a re-discounted
interest rate, the business serves not just to control the note
issuing growth, it also improves the distribution of bank credit,
and thereby the industrial structures.
</P>
<P>
The adoption and expansion of bill re-discounting business
since late 1994 reflected the central bank's endeavor to shift to
indirect market-driven means from direct means like administrative
orders.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the bill discounted and re-discounted reached a total
of 226.4 billion yuan (27.2 billion US dollars) and 135.8 billion
yuan, respectively.
</P>
<P>
"The 20 billion yuan's increase of bills re-discounted this
year will inevitably grant the central bank more power in
macro-economic financial control," said the central bank
official.
</P>
<P>
Other indirect financial controls China adopted last year
included starting market operations in treasury bonds, cutting
interest rates on bank deposits and withdrawing the central bank's
discount loans to commercial banks to offset the inflationary
pressures caused by rapidly-growing foreign exchange reserves.

<HEADLINE> Hebei Wall Paintings Rival Famous Grottos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Wall paintings found in
ancient tombs in north China's Hebei Province rival those in Mogao
Grottos in northwest China's Gansu Province, a peak of ancient
Chinese arts, according to a leading Chinese archaeologist.
</P>
<P>
Yu Weichao, curator of the National Museum of Chinese History,
made the remark when the "Hebei Ancient Tomb Fresco" exhibition
was held in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The 10-day exhibition, visited by nearly 100,000 from both at
home and abroad last winter, displayed some 700 sq m of wall
paintings and copies of frescos found in tombs from the Eastern
Han Dynasty (25-220), Eastern Wei Dynasty (534-550), Northern Qi
Dynasty (550-577), Five Dynasties period (907-979), Song Dynasty
(960-1279) and Liao Dynasty (916-1125).
</P>
<P>
The earliest tomb wall paintings ever found in China date from
the Western Han Dynasty (206 BC-24 AD).
</P>
<P>
Hebei, with its earliest tomb wall paintings belonging to an
eunuch in the Eastern Han Dynasty (25-220) and thousands of square
meters of wall paintings found in tombs from the following
dynasties, outlines the history of Chinese tomb wall paintings.
</P>
<P>
According to experts, tomb wall paintings before the Northern
Dynasties (386-581) feature human, animal and mythical figures,
just as those from the Northern Qi imperial tomb that was shown at
the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
The wall paintings from the imperial tomb, two pieces each
measuring 37 m wide and 8.3 m tall, the largest ever found in
China, show a colorful procession of 53 people carrying ceremonial
banners or weapons.
</P>
<P>
The procession on the western wall of the pass leading to the
burial room was led by a green dragon, a symbol of the east in
traditional Chinese culture, while the eastern procession led by a
white tiger, a symbol of the west.
</P>
<P>
Flying above the processions are rare animals, birds, clouds
and lotus.
</P>
<P>
From the Tang Dynasty, Chinese tomb wall paintings turned to
depict realistic scenes, such as banquets and tea ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
Landscape first occurred in the Five Dynasties period in a tomb
found in Quyang in Hebei, which was displayed at the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
The best preserved wall paintings ever found in Hebei date
from the Liao Dynasty, including one depicting children playing
with a rope which has been regarded as a rare contribution to the
study of the history of China's sports.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of square meters of wall paintings have been
unearthed from tens of thousands of tombs in Hebei in the past few
years.

<HEADLINE> Hariri to Visit Cairo Today on Trade Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri will fly this evening to Cairo for talks with the Egyptian
leaders on trade dispute, the state-run Radio Lebanon announced.
</P>
<P>
Reliable Lebanese official sources said that the Lebanese
premier will meet his Egyptian counterpart Kamal Al-Ganzouri and
will wait in the Egyptian capital for an appointment with
President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Local political observers noted that Hariri's visit to Cairo
comes after a Lebanese agricultural ministry decision two weeks
ago to ban imports of potatoes drew sharp criticism over
the weekend from Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa.
</P>
<P>
In response to the Lebanese decision, the Egyptian press
hinted that Cairo might freeze its bilateral trade agreement
with Beirut.
</P>
<P>
During the two-week dispute, Lebanese Agricultural Minister
Shawki Fakhoury has been repeatedly attacked by Egyptian
Ambassador to Lebanon Adel Khodari for making "surprise decisions"
concerning the agricultural calendar.
</P>
<P>
The original agricultural calendar allows imports of potatoes
into Lebanon from February 1 to April 30.
</P>
<P>
Khodari disclosed that when the Lebanese agricultural ministry
unilaterally imposed the potato import ban, Egypt had issued an
decision to extend the period granted for the import of Lebanese
apples, an action taken upon the initiative of Al-Ganzouri.
</P>
<P>
Fakhoury has explained the ban on potato imports is a step to
"protect" local potatoes, which he said were picked earlier than
usual because of weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet approved another surprise plan last week to
prohibit all imports of agricultural produce that can be produced
in Lebanon by October 1 in a bid to help the country's ailing
agricultural sector and reduce the trade deficit.

<HEADLINE> Colleges to Continue to Enrol Recommended Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, March 19 (Xinhua) -- China's colleges will continue to
recruit recommended high school graduates without entrance exams.
</P>
<P>
However, the State Education Commission (SEC) will carefully
oversee the procedure of students recommendation and enrollment.
</P>
<P>
The SEC is to re-assess those colleges and universities which
have the right to enroll that kind of high school graduates, a SEC
official said in a recent work meeting here.
</P>
<P>
The education body began the recommendation policy in 1988,
with 52 quality universities being entitled to accept those
students.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, some outstanding high school graduates could pursue
advanced study without taking the annual college entrance
exams. Such students account for two percent of annual total
enrollment.
</P>
<P>
But some students did not live up to their recommendations. A
1997 SEC survey showed that over 20 colleges out of the 40
surveyed said they want to delay enrollment of recommended
students until troublesome students are weeded out.
</P>
<P>
The SEC is drafting a regulation on enrollment of recommended
students, which is expected to take effect from the next year on.

<HEADLINE> 8,000 S. Africans to Die of Kidney Disease, Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 19 (Xinhua) -- An estimated 8,000 South
Africans, more than 7,000 of them Black, are likely to die of kidney
disease because of the continuing acute shortage of organ donors at
the 13 medical centres throughout the country where renal
transplantation is conducted.
</P>
<P>
This was released in a paper presented to the 17th Congress of
the Southern African Transplantation Society on Tuesday in
Stellenbosch, Western Cape Province, by Professor Ernette du Toit
of the National Dialysis and Transplantation Registry in Cape
Town, reported the local daily the Citizen today.
</P>
<P>
Du Toit said the number of transplants fell far short of
requirements, adding there were an estimated 1,200 kidney patients on
the current waiting list while about 100 patients were awaiting
cardiac grafts.
</P>
<P>
According to du Toit, the acceptance rate onto South African renal
transplantation programs was 12 patients per million population,
compared to 60 in the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
However, the incidence of Black patients with end-stage renal
disease in South Africa has been estimated at 240 per million, said
the report.
</P>
<P>
Du Toit said 441 heart transplants had been carried out in South
Africa since 1967, while renal transplants now stood at 4140, livers
87, pancreas one, bone marrow 248.
</P>
<P>
A 10-year study of kidney transplantation also showed that survival
of the renal graft was not influenced by the race of the donor.

<HEADLINE> Lhasa Food Consumption Above National Average </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Although residents of Lhasa,
capital city of the Tibet Autonomous Region, eat about the same
amount of grain and edible oil as people in other parts of the
country, people here consume more meat and milk than any other
region in China, according to Lhasa city officials.
</P>
<P>
Despite drought and snow in 1996, production in Lhasa of grain
and edible oil reached 150 million kg. In this city of 400,000
people, the per capita production of grain and edible oil was 375
kg.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the production of meat and milk for each Lhasa
resident reached 30.7 kg and 30.9 kg, respectively, much higher
than the national level.
</P>
<P>
Last year, governments at various levels in the city, which has
a population of 400,000, raised more than 5.6 million yuan
(674,700 US dollars) to improve the conditions of farming and
pasturing lands.
</P>
<P>
In addition, local governments have arranged training courses
for local farmers to raise their skills in farming and breeding
animals.

<HEADLINE> Demand for Energy to Increase in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe will soon be faced with a
greater demand for energy because of the rapid urbanisation,
economic growth and population increase.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 11th command and staff course at the Zimbabwe Staff
College on the country's transport and energy sectors, Minister of
Transport and Energy Simon Moyo said yesterday that the country uses
six types of energy sources which include hydro power, coal, liquid
fuel, woodfuel, solar power and biogas.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately firewood accounts for 49 percent, coal 22
percent, petroleum 15 percent and electricity 14 percent of the
total energy used.
</P>
<P>
He said biogas and solar energy were still in the early stages of
development in Zimbabwe. Hydro-power and coal were available locally
while petroleum supplies were imported.
</P>
<P>
''This means that we have absolutely no control over fuel prices.
Also the fact that Zimbabwe cannot meet all its energy requirements
locally means that we are vulnerable in the event of civil disruption
at regional or international levels,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He recommended the development, use and management of alternative
energy sources that were environmentally friendly and affordable.

<HEADLINE> Camera System Gives Zoo Keepers Eye to Look After Animals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- When a tiger or giant panda was
about to give birth, keepers at the Beijing Zoo used to walk
barefoot towards the sealed room and listen carefully, attempting
to make sure the delivery was going smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Now the zookeepers can watch the animal on a video monitor without
fear of disturbing her.
</P>
<P>
The closed-circuit camera system was installed inside the
animal rooms last April.
</P>
<P>
The zoo authority said the installation of the system was their
new measure to increase the survival rate of rare animals, such as
Manchurian tigers, giant pandas and snow leopards.
</P>
<P>
"It's a female animal's nature to feel frightened by human
disturbance during its bearing period. Then the cub would be
killed or abandoned by its mother," said the zoo director Zong
Ying.
</P>
<P>
"So we had to seal the room and cut off the human-animal
contacts before we used the equipment," Zong said.
</P>
<P>
"Without the monitoring system, I had to listen outside the
room, and decide whether the delivery was OK just according to
conjectures and experience," said Li Junxiang, who has raised
tigers at the zoo for 26 years.
</P>
<P>
"Out of the fear that noise might scare the tiger, I even
approached the room on barefoot," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Although having "delivered" about 70 tigers, it was Li's first
time to witness, on screen, the whole process of tiger-bearing
when a Manchurian tiger, named "Ji Sheng", gave birth to four cubs
last year.
</P>
<P>
Through the monitoring system, Li and his fellow workers also
found that "Ji Seng" nursed three baby tigers only, but ignored
the fourth one. Li sneaked into the room, took the newly born out
and artificially bred it.
</P>
<P>
"If we didn't have the device, we would know nothing about that
situation and the poor cub would die," Li recalled.
</P>
<P>
Aided by the equipment, the zoo keepers successfully delivered
a giant panda last October.
</P>
<P>
A pregnant snow leopard, which is expected to give birth next
month, is currently under close observation.
</P>
<P>
"The monitoring system helps us record many valuable materials
for further research, such as reproduction and breeding of rare
animals," said Zong, who now leads one of the largest reproduction
and research center of rare animals in China.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Zoo, the home to more than 6,000 animals, adopted
advanced technology to successfully breed some 1,800 baby animals
last year. They included 77 animals which were on the verge of
extinction, such as Manchurian tigers, giant pandas, snub-nosed
monkeys, ibises and white-lip deers.
</P>
<P>
Artificial insemination has helped the zoo breed more than 40
giant pandas, which are designated as one of the world's most
endangered species.

<HEADLINE> Unauthorized Internet Users Face Penalties in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Unauthorized Internet users in
Vietnam could be taken to the court under two new government
decrees regarding the use of the worldwide computer network.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam Investment Review, a weekly newspaper, reported in the
latest issue available today that one of the decrees calls for the
establishment of a watchdog body to monitor the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The other decree, according to the newspaper report, requires
all users to apply for permission to open a network account.
</P>
<P>
"It is obvious that not everyone will be allowed to have access
to the Internet and everyone will have to apply for permission,"
an official from the Directorate General of Posts and
Telecommunications was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Violators of the decrees could be "logged off" from the on-line
service and banned from using the Internet. In more serious cases,
they could be fined or face criminal prosecution, officials said.
</P>
<P>
So far, while the Internet offers a wide range of services
worldwide, only electronic mail, or E-mail, and limited domestic
on-line services have been available in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
However, the government announced last year that Vietnam will
eventually have a direct Internet link.
</P>
<P>
The new decrees are expected to give the government better
oversight over the flow of electronic information into the
country.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Asks IFP Head to Help Broker Peace in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 19 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela has asked Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader
Mangosuthu Buthelezi to accompany him on visits to African
countries to help broker peace on the strife-torn continent.
</P>
<P>
The Business Day newspaper today quoted senior IFP sources as
saying that the party's national caucus had a lengthy debate last
week on whether Buthelezi should accompany Mandela on such
visits.
</P>
<P>
However, Buthelezi, also the Home Affairs Minister of the
African National Congress-led government of national unity, has
been "very enthusiastic" about the offer, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi believes that South Africa would benefit if he and
Mandela presented a "united face" to the world, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
In the IFP's view, the president's offer would help Buthelezi
play the role of peace broker on the continent and elevate his
stature in the international community, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, presidential spokesman Joel Netshitenzhe said it
would be unusual if Buthelezi accompanies Mandela on foreign
visits as he is part of the government of national unity.
</P>
<P>
South African cabinet ministers join the president on foreign
visits from time to time, said Netshitenzhe. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- China has expedited development
of its building materials industry by introducing five billion US
dollars in foreign funds, according to a senior government
official.
</P>
<P>
The official with the China State Administration of Building
Materials Industry said that foreign investment has been involved
in such fields as new building materials, advanced technologies,
and intensive processing of building materials.
</P>
<P>
Cement projects financed with loans from the World Bank and the
Asian Development Bank have gone into operation.
</P>
<P>
Financed with a 100 million US dollar loan from Italy, a
technical upgrading project involving sanitary ceramics production
is proceeding smoothly, as money has poured into proper channels.
</P>
<P>
The official added that China has recently signed a number of
agreements of cooperation in the building materials sector with
the Netherlands, Germany, Tailand, Greece, Australia, Japan,
France and Denmark.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that China's exports of building materials exceeded
2.1 billion dollars and its cement exports amounted to a record 12
million tons last year, up 46 percent from 1995.
</P>
<P>
To boost the technical upgrading of the sector, China has
introduced advanced precalcining kiln production lines from
foreign countries in recent years and built several modern cement
plants, adding a combined annual cement production capacity of 22
million tons.

<HEADLINE> S. African Navy to Get 4 New Corvettes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The South African Navy
would get approval from the cabinet this year to order four new
corvettes with initial funds provided by the 1998 budget, Deputy
Defence Minister Ronnie Kasrils said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Cape Town, Kasrils said he expected
the first Defence Review, due in May this year, to recommend to
the cabinet and the Parliament that the corvettes should be
bought, reported the local daily the Citizen today.
</P>
<P>
Kasrils said the Defence Review was the mechanism by which the
cabinet and Parliament would be guided on defence needs and
priorities.
</P>
<P>
Parliament's Standing Committee on Defence has already "very
strongly signaled" that the navy should be given the ships it
needed, irrespective of the cuts in defence spending.
</P>
<P>
Defence spending is decreased by 9.4 percent in the new
1997/98 budget presented to Parliament last Wednesday by Finance
Minister Trevor Manuel.
</P>
<P>
Kasrils said his ministry believes the purchase of the new
ships for the navy is a first priority because the navy has been
neglected and become rundown in the past several years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Vice-Admiral Simpson Anderson, the chief of the
navy, said the navy hopes there would be money released by the
transformation process for capital expenditure in the budget next
year. enditem

<HEADLINE> Peru Proposes Gradual Re-entry Into Andean Free Trade Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Peruvian Industry Minister Gustavo
Caillaux today presented a proposal on his country's gradual
re-entry into the Andean Group free trade zone.
</P>
<P>
The proposal presented at the Andean Group headquarters here
includes a gradual re-incorporation in seven or eight years into
the free trade zone of the Andean Group.
</P>
<P>
The Andean Group was formed by five South American countries in
1969 to try to forge regional economic integration. Chile withdrew
from the group in 1976 and Venezuela joined it in 1973. Now it
comprises Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
Peru requested a suspension of its membership in August 1992
but remained as an observer. In April 1994, it was readmitted as a
full member of the group although remained as an observer outside
the group's free trade zone.
</P>
<P>
The group's free trade zone was established in January 1992 but
little progress has been made since then.
</P>
<P>
Up to now Peru exchanges approximately 80 percent of its
products in the Andean free trade zone. The remaining 20 percent
classified as "sensitive" are not exposed to foreign competition.
</P>
<P>
The Peruvian government says that wide margins between the
lowest and highest tariff rates permit an excessive protectionism
for national production and disencourage competition that would
help improve production efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Peru says its proposal for a gradual re-entry into the Andean
Group free trade zone aims to allow other Andean countries to
eliminate "distortions" that cause unfair competition.

MONTERREY, Mexico, March 18 (Xinhua) -- President Ernesto

He said that Mexicans will, under no circumstances, allow other
countries' internal conflicts to have any influence on the

</P>
<P>
In no way "shall we accept that juridical acts derived from
those conflicts have any interference in the internal affairs of

<HEADLINE> Wreckage of Malaysian Airforce Helicopter Detected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 19 (Xinhua) -- One of the two Nuri
helicopters of the Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF) which crashed
in Sabah, East Malaysia yesterday was detected today, according to
reports from Sabah's capital Kota Kinabaru.
</P>
<P>
The wreckage of one of the two helicopters, both of which
crashed in Long Pasia, Sabah on their way back to base in Labuan
near Sabah after a routine mission, was detected in the Bukit
Moningoton ravine, Gunung Lumaku, Sipitang this morning, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
Sabah Deputy Police Chief Mohd Yusof Mohd Said was quoted as
saying the wreckage was found by two Sabah border scout platoons
from Keningau involved in the search operations.
</P>
<P>
"Efforts are being made to reach the ravine. Smoke has been
detected at an area near the ravine but it cannot be ascertained
if it is from the other Nuri," he said.
</P>
<P>
The two Nuri aircraft disappeared from radar after the last
radio contact about half an hour before they were scheduled to
arrive at the RMAF base in Labuan yesterday, according to an RMAF
statement.
</P>
<P>
RMAF Chief of Staff Operations Major General Abdul Malek Shahar
Harun said in the statement that when the two aircraft did not
return to base as scheduled, the Commander of the Fourth Air
Division, ordered a search operation, which is continuing.
</P>
<P>
The number of people on board the two aircraft could not be
ascertained yet.
</P>
<P>
"We are still unable to ascertain the number of people on board
but we fear there may be many," an RMAF spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Usually the Nuri helicopter crew comprises a pilot, a co-pilot
and an air quarter master.
</P>
<P>
The Nuri is the RMAF's main transport plane and also is used
for rescue operations, ferrying VIPs, mercy flights and for
various other air operations.

<HEADLINE> "Spring Days" in Italy to Highlight Free Visits to Monuments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Over 160 monuments in more than 90
Italian cities will open to the public for free visits during next
weekend, the Italian Environment Fund (FAI) said today.
</P>
<P>
The open-house events on March 22 and 23 would be part of the
celebration to mark the 5th "Spring Days" initiated by the FAI,
the group's president, Giulia Maria Mozzoni Crespi, said.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the FAI organized a similar program at the monuments,
which are usually closed, and attracted some 200,000 visitors.
</P>
<P>
This year, people will be allowed, for the first time, to visit
the area below the Baths of Caracalla in Rome.
</P>
<P>
Visitors could also tour other places of the capital city for
free, including Palazzetto of Sisto V, the Sant'Onofrio, Church on
the Gianicolo and Museum of Health Art.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the FAI will offer free entrance to places where
it normally charges a fee, including the San Fruttuoso Abbey in
Camogli, the Manta Castle near Cuneo, the Torba monastery in the
Varese province, Villa Balbaianello near Como and the Masino
Castle close to Turin.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Tories Promise Tax Cuts, More Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Canada's Progressive Conservative
Party announced an election platform today, promising tax cuts,
more jobs and smaller government once it comes back to power.
</P>
<P>
"It is time to renew ourselves, to think anew about our
country," said Tory leader Jean Charest while unveiling the
platform in a TV studio hooked up to party members across Canada.
</P>
<P>
Called "Let The Future Begin," the platform includes a 10
percent cut in personal taxes and the reduction of unemployment
insurance premiums by about 3.6 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
It also promises to create two million new jobs by the year
2005, reduce government spending by 8.8 billion dollars and
balance the budget by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Tory plan met immediate attack from the Reform Party and
the ruling Liberal Party.
</P>
<P>
"The Tories had nine years in government to deliver on their
promise of jobs, balanced budgets, tax cuts, and a revitalized
federation," said Reform Party leader Preston Manning.
</P>
<P>
"But they delivered record unemployment, 71 tax hikes, and two
divisive and ultimately futile debates about distinct society,"
Manning said.
</P>
<P>
The plan was also dismissed by Finance Minister Paul Martin,
who is working to bring the federal deficit down to 13.8 billion
dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
"It's simply not possible to cut taxes by a massive amount such
as they are suggesting and at the same time balance the budget
without something given," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the last election, the Tories was almost eliminated from the
political scene, retaining only two seats in the House of Commons
after winning two majority governments led by Brian Mulroney.
</P>
<P>
It is widely expected that Prime Minister Jean Chretien would
call a federal general election as early as June.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Acquire 21 New Aircraft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government has agreed to
allow Thai Airways International Plc. (THAI) to acquire 21 new
aircraft by the year 2000 to improve its fleet, a Thai government
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Government house spokesman Vorathep Rattanakorn said in a press
release on Tuesday that the cabinet approved a proposal by the
Ministry Transport and Communications for the procurement plan on
the day.
</P>
<P>
The 21 airplanes worth 68.79 billion baht (2.75 billion U.S.
dollars) will be acquired through installment, purchase or
leasing, depending on what the option is the best at the time.
</P>
<P>
The procurement package under THAI's 1996-2000 five-year
enterprise plan includes 12 aircraft from Boeing and nine from
Airbus to replace its old ones.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet has asked the airline to consult with the Ministry
of Finance to come up with a prudent financing program for the
deal.
</P>
<P>
Transport and Communications Minister Suwat Liptapallop said
that if the airline chooses to buy the aircraft on installment
terms, it would have to find countertrade deals.
</P>
<P>
As part of any countertrade deals, Thailand will persuade
Boeing and Airbus to help it regain its recently-lowered trade
privileges under the European Union's generalized system of
preferences, Suwat was quoted as saying by local newspapers.
</P>
<P>
If the airline opts for leasing, it would be exempt from the
countertrade requirement, he said.
</P>
<P>
The airline reportedly is already leasing six of the 21
aircraft.

<HEADLINE> Asia to Remain Vietnam's Largest Trading Partner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Asia will remain Vietnam's largest
trading partner until the year 2000, the Vietnam News today quoted
the trade ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
Exports to Asia last year were 4.4 billion U.S. dollars, 85
percent of Vietnam's total export earnings, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Three quarters of Vietnam's imports also come from Asia. Last
year, the country imported 8.3 billion dollars of goods from the
region, making it Vietnam's largest trading partner.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's main exports are agricultural produce, seafood,
garments, footwear, embroidery, crude oil, electronics and
engineering products.
</P>
<P>
Its main export markets are Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and
China.
</P>
<P>
To boost Vietnam's exports, the government has cut export
tariffs and provided investment to domestic companies wanting to
to produce high-quality goods for export.
</P>
<P>
Senior trade officials are also developing a modern trade
information network to provide up-to-date data about world
markets, commodity prices and trade relations.
</P>
<P>
The move is in response to criticisms that Vietnamese exporters
are missing out on business opportunities because they don't have
access to trade information.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Vietnamese exporters are now targetting
other key lucrative markets, like Europe and North America.
</P>
<P>
Two-way trade with the U.S. was 1 billion dollars last year and
is expected to increase by half this year to 1.5 billion dollars.

<P>
KATHMANDU, March 19 (Xinhua) -- A main partner in Nepal's
three-party ruling coalition has asked the government to initiate
and implement people-oriented programs for political stability in
the country.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist,
CPN-UML), the largest partner in the new government led by
Lokendra Bahadur Chand of the National Democratic Party (RPP),
held a meeting Tuesday to present suggestions to the government on
its policy program, expected to be made public soon.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-UML party also decided to direct all its 90 lower house
MPs to vote for the government when it seeks a vote of confidence
later today.
</P>
<P>
Chand's government assumed office last week to replace the
former coalition government led by the Nepali Congress (NC) party
which resigned after losing a confidence vote in the lower house
of parliament.
</P>
<P>
The new government formed by CPN-UML, RPP and another small
party is expected to win the confidence vote with a simple
majority in the 205-seat house.
</P>
<P>
A CPN-UML minority government, which was in power for nine
months till September 1995, had initiated some people-oriented
programs including a pension scheme for elder citizens and a rural
development program called "Build Our Village Ourselves".

<HEADLINE> S'pore Economy to Grow by 7.4 Pct This Year-Forecast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore economy is
expected to register a strong 7.4 percent growth in its Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) this year, up from seven percent recorded
last year, economists at the National University of Singapore
forecast.
</P>
<P>
According to local newspaper reports today, the economists with
the university's Economic Studies Unit (ESU) pointed out at a
seminar on Tuesday that the expansion would be led by a pickup in
global electronics demand during the second half of the year and
by robust growth in Singapore's top export markets.
</P>
<P>
They said that overall, external demand growth would jump to
10.7 percent in 1997, up from last year's seven percent, and
merchandise exports would grow by more than 11.1 percent, compared
with 7.5 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the economists also pointed to the "worrisome"
prospect that other than in the manufacturing sector, real wages
could grow more than twice as fast as labor productivity,
resulting in a six-percent rise in overall unit labor cost this
year, versus a three-percent increase in 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to the forecast, the construction, and financial and
business sectors, last year's star performers, are again expected
to be the leading sectors this year. The ESU said that the former
is expected to be driven by the public sector and the latter by
offshore banking, stock issues and currency trading.
</P>
<P>
The stronger growth in the latter part of the year would
continue into 1998, leading to even higher growth of 7.8 percent
next year, before returning to 7.1 percent the year after, the ESU
said.

JAKARTA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The population of the Javanese
rhino (rhinoceros sondaricus), a rare animal species in the
world, is now less than 100, a researcher said.
</P>
<P>
Of the number, only about 51 to 67 still live in the Unjung
Kulon National Park in West Java, Chairperson of the Javanese
rhino research team Harini Muntasib said in Bogor, West Java on

</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, only seven to nine rhinos live in Vietnam and some
others in Laos and Cambodia, said Harini, who along with her team
conducted research to develop an effective technique to manage the
habitats of Javanese rhinos.
</P>
<P>
She said that without an effective technique to manage their
habitats, Javanese rhinos might be unable to survive for a long
time due to natural disasters, diseases and hunting.
</P>
<P>
Harini noted that one of the main problems concerning the
survival of Javanese rhinos was the shrinking availability of
plants consumable by rhinos.

<HEADLINE> Austria Supports EU Plan to Send Experts to Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Austria Tuesday welcomed a plan by
the European Union to send an advisory mission to Albania and help
the country restore order and distribute relief food.
</P>
<P>
Austrian Federal Chancellor Viktor Klima told reporters after a
meeting of the EU Council of Ministers that it was the right time
at present to send a mission of experts to Albania.
</P>
<P>
The decision would help Albania's reconstruction, he said,
adding that on the other hand it was necessary to work out
security measures to restore stability in the Balkan state.
</P>
<P>
Albania has been rocked by unrest since the collapse in January
of pyramid investment schemes in which thousands of Albanians lost
their life savings. The protests mushroomed this month into an
anti-government revolt with widespread looting of arms from army
depots.
</P>
<P>
EU foreign ministers turned down Albania's call for military
intervention but pledged at a meeting Sunday to send military and
police advisers to Albania to help "restore civilian structures
and law and order."
</P>
<P>
The ministers also agreed to send a high-level mission to
Tirana Monday. The mission includes representatives from Albania's
EU neighbors Greece and Italy, the European Commission and the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the team arrived in Tirana and met with Prime
Minister Bashkim Fino to discuss ways to restore law and order.
</P>
<P>
The team was scheduled to visit the western ports of Durres and
Vlore, key bridgeheads in any relief aid operation, during its
two-day stay.
</P>
<P>
It will finally report back on the composition of a planned
advisory mission of experts on civil reconstruction, police and
military matters and humanitarian and financial assistance.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the mission is likely to be finalized at an EU
foreign ministers' meeting next Monday in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schussel said Tuesday that
the EU would provide "self-relief help" to Albania to prevent
larger refugee exodus.
</P>
<P>
So far about 6,000 Albanians have fled across the Adriatic Sea
to Italy from Durres and Vlore, which is under the control of the
rebels.

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian Parties Support Accord with IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria's main political parties
today formally backed the accord signed on Monday between the
caretaker government and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to
stabilize the country's shattered economy.
</P>
<P>
After meeting Bulgarian President Petar Stoianov, the party
leaders issued a joint statement saying the necessary laws to
implement the agreement would be passed after the general election
in June.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the nation after the meeting, the president said
that the monetary control and new financial disciplines which
would be imposed as part of the agreement with the IMF would
strengthen the country's economy and set it on the path to
eliminate poverty.
</P>
<P>
Monday's accord sets out a package of financial reforms and
funding worth 659 million U.S. dollars over the next year.
</P>
<P>
In return for the money, Bulgaria will have to implement a
string of reforms, including price liberalization, a major
privatization program, banking and financial reforms, strong
budgetary controls and strict monetary controls.
</P>
<P>
A fixed exchange rate system will be introduced in June to
restore confidence in the lev currency, which plummetted at the
turn of the year as the country plunged into political turmoil
triggered by an economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
The IMF package also includes 148 million dollars to buy grain
to ease shortages in the country.
</P>
<P>
The IMF signed the agreement with Bulgaria's interim government
which was formed after the ruling Socialist party was forced to
relinquish power in February.
</P>
<P>
But the funding body met with other political parties to ensure
that the program will be continued after the general election in
June.
</P>
<P>
This latest agreement on loan funding is Bulgaria's fifth with
IMF. The other four foundered because previous governments failed
to meet reform targets agreed with the fund.

<HEADLINE> Albania Asks for EU Aid to Rebuild Its Army </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Albania's Defense Minister Shagir
Vukaj asked here today for assistance from members of the European
Union (EU) for rebuilding his country's armed forces.
</P>
<P>
It is an urgent task for Albania to rebuild the army and regain
its self-defense capability, Vukaj told an EU mission led by Dutch
roving ambassador Jan Graf de Marchand et d'Ausembourg.
</P>
<P>
During the unrest in the past weeks, the Albanian military lost
much of its weapons, equipment, and technical and logistic
facilities, Vukaj noted at a meeting with the 11 EU officials.
</P>
<P>
Arriving here on Monday by helicopter from the southern Italian
port of Brindisi, the mission's primary task is to find how to
help the Albanian authorities restore normality in the country.
</P>
<P>
At meetings with military officers from the United States,
Greece and other countries in the past few days, the Albanian
defense minister has repeatedly asked for aid to the Albanian army.
</P>
<P>
The government's military reconstruction work, Vukaj said
today, will draw experience from international military
institutions and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
At least 100 Albanians were killed in more than a month of
unrest sparked by the collapse of the so-called pyramid investment
schemes, in which thousands of Albanians lost their life savings.
</P>
<P>
Protests mushroomed into a lawless anti-government revolt, with
widespread looting of arms from army depots.
</P>
<P>
Currently, situation appeared to have begun to return to normal
in the tiny Balkan republic while a government-imposed state of
emergency and a dusk-to-dawn curfew were in effect.
</P>
<P>
As of today, shops in this capital city were open again, public
transport was running and public employees obeyed a government
order to return to work.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Official Warns of "Conspiracy" by Developed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The developed countries in the
World Trade Organization (WTO) and other international groups are
behind a "conspiracy" against ASEAN, the local press today quoted
an economic official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the local press, Vice Chairman of the ASEAN Chamber
of Commerce and Industry (ASEAN CCI) Iman Taufik pointed to
difficulties faced by ASEAN countries in trade negotiations with
major developed nations which harbored "some sort of conspiracy"
against the regional grouping.
</P>
<P>
Although Indonesia and other ASEAN members have signed the WTO
agreements, several major advanced countries have put them under
the spotlight of scrutiny by bringing up non-trade related issues,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He listed some of the issues as the environment, labor and
intellectual property rights.
</P>
<P>
He did not elaborate on details of the conspiracy, but stressed
the need for ASEAN's governments and private sectors to stand
together in the international trade forum.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Atmono Suryo, a former Indonesian ambassador to the
European Union, said that "conspiracy" might not be an appropriate
choice of words to describe the thorny trade relations between
ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) and the developed
world, although there were indeed challenges facing ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
There was no denying that there was trade friction between
ASEAN and several European and North American nations, he said.
</P>
<P>
They apparently felt that ASEAN had encroached upon their
markets in the past few years, threatening jobs in several major
industries.
</P>
<P>
"This is a consequence of open trade," he said, adding that
conversely the foreign countries need ASEAN as an export
destination due to its growing economic clout.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Indonesia and other ASEAN countries should create a
mutually beneficial situation in trade negotiations with the
developed nations to try to overcome the use of non-trade issues,
he added.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Official Laments Neglect of Economic, Social, Cultural </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The safeguarding of people's
economic, social and cultural rights has been virtually ignored by
the United Nations and starved of funding, a top U.N. official
said today.
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural
Rights, Australian Philip Alston, called on the United Nations to
place economic, social and cultural rights on an equal footing
with civil and political rights.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a session of the United Nations Commission on Human
Rights, Alston put forward his committee's proposal that the
protocol of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and
Cultural Rights be adopted.
</P>
<P>
He said the purpose of the protocol was to allow individuals
and groups alleging violations of their rights under the Covenant
to submit petitions to the committee.
</P>
<P>
The term "indivisibility" was nearly always used to describe
the relationship between economic, social and cultural rights and
civil and political rights. But U.N. programs continued to devote
almost no attention to their promotion and didn't provide any
resources.
</P>
<P>
Alston said there were no Special Rapporteurs to deal
specifically with matters relating to economic, social and
cultural rights.
</P>
<P>
Their neglect was further compounded by the attitude of leading
non-governmental organizations, who Alston accused of trumpeting
their commitment to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights but
failing to undertake even sustained promotional and educational
measures in relation to one half of the catalogue of rights
reflected in the document.

This information has been transmitted by the Embassy's Defense
Attache to Sri Lankan police, the sources added.

Lankan government for a separate Tamil state in the north and
east of the country.

the suburbs of Guangzhou, the capital of south China's Guangdong
province, workers are busy loading trucks with flowers to cater to
this increasingly popular consumer item.
</P>
<P>
The garden is the brainchild of Huo Yingbo, a thirtysomething
who has become the king of flowers in this busy southern city. "I
have received orders for more than 10,000 pots of flowers in a
month, and this means a good start in this year's flower market,"
Huo says.
</P>
<P>
Huo saw the potential for flowers in the domestic market and
believed that as people's lives got better, flower consumption
would naturally increase, thanks to China's reform and opening up
policy.
</P>
<P>
Now, Guangzhou, as well as the rest of the nation, have shown
just how right he was. Fresh cut or potted flowers now appear in
hotels, office buildings, and on family balconies, and it is now
fashionable for city dwellers to send bunches of flowers to
patients and lovers.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou's flower growers have planted more than 533 ha of
flowers in the Fangcun district and another 600 ha elsewhere, and
their products are doing well both in Guangdong province and in
the rest of China.
</P>
<P>
Huo's total flower output last year was worth more than 20
million yuan, and he is said to have earned over one million
yuan. In his district there are now 300-plus households that grow
more than two ha of flowers each.
</P>
<P>
The district has long been famous for flowers. Huo took
advantage of this and of his knowledge of flowers gained in
childhood. He began his flower growing career 10 years ago when he
resigned his public job and planted 0.2 ha of flowers.
</P>
<P>
He was determined to cultivate indoor ornamental plants of
which there were few in China. And now he has done it. "Breeding
techniques and new strains in his garden serve as a kind of
weather vane whereby we grow and sell flowers," one grower said.
</P>
<P>
But Huo is not satisfied with only this and says, "We are
confronted with intense market competition as overseas investment
pours into China's flower market. A cottage industry can't stand
the competition. We must improve the scale of operation." enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Some 1,000 Moro National
Liberation Front (MNLF) members were formally accepted into the
Philippine military service as part of a peace agreement signed
between the government and the MNLF last year, the local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The rebels were drafted into the Army in a lavish celebration
Tuesday which coincided with the 29th anniversary of the MNLF's

At least 7,500 MNLF fighters will be integrated into the Armed
Forces and the National Police under the peace accord signed with
the government in September last year.
</P>
<P>
The MNLF celebrated their anniversary with prayers inside their
camp in Indanan, the southern province of Sulu. Thousands of MNLF
members dressed in combat uniforms, many of them toting AK-47
assault rifles and rocket-propelled grenades, chanted "Long live
the MNLF".

<HEADLINE> Philippine Foreign Reserves Hit Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' gross
international reserves hit an all-time high of 12.25 billion U.S.
dollars as of March 17 due to strong investment inflows, local
press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The record high level of international reserves means the
country can pay for 3.2 months of imported goods and services, the
reports quoted Philippine central bank governor Gabriel Singson as
saying Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The international reserves represent the central bank's
holdings of gold, foreign exchange and special drawing rights used
to pay off the country's foreign debt and import receipts.
</P>
<P>
Singson attributed the growing foreign reserves to strong
investment flows due to bullish sentiments about the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
He said the central bank was able to accumulate more than 12
billion dollars in its international reserves by acquiring 1.23
billion worth of foreign reserves since January.
</P>
<P>
Given the current state of investor confidence in the
Philippines, the 14 billion dollars target for foreign reserves
set by the central bank will certainly be achieved within a
shorter time, he said.

<P>
He said his department has taken many photos of the Hale-Bopp
comet. A photo taken on March 4 showed that the comet had separate

<P>
KIEV, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Ukrainian workers took
to the streets today, protesting against unpaid wages and calling
for the restoration of compulsory education and free medical care.
</P>
<P>
Union leaders who had organized the nationwide Day of Action
claimed some 342,000 people turned out in support, but Interior
Minister Yuri Kravchenko estimated some 85,000 people took part in
the protests organized by the leftist All Ukrainian Union of
Workers (AUUW).
</P>
<P>
Workers in Ukraine are now owed some 4 billion hryvnas (2
billion U.S. dollars) in unpaid wages. Thousands of public sector
employees haven't been paid for months.
</P>
<P>
Vasily Tereshuk, deputy chairman of the AUUW said between 5,000
and 20,000 workers from 34 factories in Kiev joined the
protests. Some 3,000 workers massed around the main government
building, which was guarded by riot police.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, March 19 (Xinhua) -- North China's Hebei province
has set aside 585 million yuan to repay government loans or loans
from international financial institutions that come due this year.
</P>
<P>
The province has used a total of 1.2 billion US dollars worth
of loans since 1984, mainly from the World Bank, the Asian
Development Bank, and countries like Japan and Canada, and has
repaid 310 million yuan in foreign debts over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
The funds helped the province's problem with its capital
shortage for economic and social development, and were used for
207 projects, covering agriculture, transportation, public health,
and education in more than 100 counties. The projects also
introduced overseas technology and management expertise.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the loans are from the World Bank. China has
been the Bank's largest borrower for several years and maintains a
good reputation with the international financial community.
</P>
<P>
The province developed a debt repayment fund and reserve system
last year and put foreign debts under the provincial budgetary
administration to ensure solvency.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the province's finance department say that most
of the foreign-funded projects have had good economic returns and
have been able to make payments on time. enditem

<HEADLINE> Italian Defense Minister Meets China's PLA General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 18 (Xinhua) -- As China is an important factor in
world peace, Italy is willing to work with China and its army in
all areas, Italian Defense Minister Beniamino Andreatta said today.
</P>
<P>
"Italy enjoys good relations with China and the two countries
have frequent exchanges," Andreatta told Fu Quanyou, chief of
general staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA).
</P>
<P>
He expressed his belief, at a meeting with the visiting Chinese
general here this afternoon, that China will continue its policy
of reform and opening up to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
On the Hong Kong issue, Andreatta hoped that China's resumption
of sovereignty over the territory will bring opportunities for
China and other countries to expand their economies and trade.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Fu said, "The Chinese government and army attach
importance to developing relations with the Italian government and
army."
</P>
<P>
"The growth of these ties will benefit the two countries and
two armies, as well as world peace and stability," said the PLA
general, who arrived here Monday for a five-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
He said that China is poised to further the friendly
cooperation between the two countries and the two armies in
various areas, and make contributions to world peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
China will resume sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1 this
year, he noted, adding that it will be an important event in the
country's political life and will constitute the first step toward
its national reunification.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Fu held talks with Italian Defense Chief of
Staff Guido Ventoroni.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urged to Pressure Israel to Withdraw From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The United States should exert
pressure on Israel to end its occupation of South Lebanon, said
Lebanese ambassador to Indonesia Abdullatied Mamlouk.
</P>
<P>
Withdrawal of Israel from South Lebanon was one of the agenda
items of the Madrid meeting in 1991 which discussed the Middle
East peace process, the ambassador said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The United States, a sponsor of the meeting, should have
exerted pressure on Israel to leave South Lebanon, he added.
</P>
<P>
Mamlouk refuted a recent press report quoting him as saying
that U.S. delegates to the Madrid meeting had permitted Israeli
troops to remain in the occupied Arab territories, including South
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"I did not say that because it's impossible for the U.S.
delegates to permit Israel to stay in South Lebanon," he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed regret that the United States was more inclined to
support Israel rather than the Lebanese people's rights.

<HEADLINE> Reduction of Welfare Spending in Italy Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Italy must reduce its welfare and
pensions spending to remain competitive in the global market,
Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said in a magazine article
published today.
</P>
<P>
The only way for Italy to join the European single currency and
stay within it is to launch structural reforms of the pensions and
the health service.
</P>
<P>
Dini, who heads the small Italian Renewal Party in the ruling
coalition, said, "European experience amply demonstrates that
systems which offer too many guarantees, which necessarily
translates into high social security contributions, end up by
reducing the rate of growth and the productivity of labor and
generating a cost structure incompatible with international
competitiveness,"
</P>
<P>
The Maastricht Treaty, signed in December, 1991, set out the
criteria for establishing economic and monetary union in the
European Union, including a single currency, the euro, in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The conditions for joining the euro include convergence targets
on budget deficit, debt, inflation and unemployment for EU member
states. But Italy has not met some of the demands set out in the
treaty.
</P>
<P>
Dini said Italy must enter the Europe of Maastricht, but the
government must work out a more effective economic policy
involving the reduction of welfare spending, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said Italy would not be able to join the group of countries
launchng the single currency "without putting a hand on the
automatic and structural mechanisms producing public spending."
</P>
<P>
He added, "Structural intervention cannot fail to involve
spending on pensions and health."

<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- China will spend ten years making
large and medium-sized cities, areas with high population density
and economically developed regions, able to withstand the impact
of earthquakes measuring six on the Richter scale.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-one areas have been chosen to lead efforts in quake
prevention and reduction of potential disasters, according to a
report in today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
Measures to be taken include fortifying building projects and
educating local residents on earthquakes and proper emergency
measures, the newspaper quoted He Yongnian, deputy director of the
State Seismological Bureau, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Facing a period of renewed seismic activity worldwide, China
hopes to strengthen international co-operation and exchange
information on earthquake science and technology, He said.
</P>
<P>
"In the coming decade, the issue of how to prevent and reduce
seismic hazards will remain high on the agenda in China, which is
one of the world's major earthquake-prone countries," He said.
</P>
<P>
He said China wishes to attract foreign capital and expand
co-operation in developing seismological technology, equipment and
academic research with developed countries, such as the United
States and Japan, and with international organizations.
</P>
<P>
China has signed bilateral agreements with more than 20
countries and has seismic data exchange relationships with more
than 40 countries.
</P>
<P>
The country has entered its fifth seismic activity period this
century, which should last until early next century.

<HEADLINE> ABC De-links from Investment and Trust Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Agricultural Bank of China
(ABC) has disengaged itself from the trust and investment business
with the opening of the Great Wall Trust and Investment Company
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The de-linking was conducted under a central bank order to
separate the banking sector from the trust and investment
business, which makes the Great Wall a wholly-ABC-owned financial
corporation," said Wang Chuan, vice president of the ABC.
</P>
<P>
The major difference is that the ABC will supervise the Great
Wall management through a board of directors rather than sending
out administrative orders for the company to obey, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Great Wall will no longer hand over all its annual profits to
the ABC, instead, the company will pay its single shareholder
dividends at year-end.
</P>
<P>
Wang also said that the newly-organized Great Wall, with its
assets valued at nearly 600 million yuan and ten million US
dollars, was meant to evolve into a large-scale financial
enterprise with adept management in the trust, investment, and
securities sector.
</P>
<P>
The company also plans to acquire 25 securities business
departments of the ABC and take over five investment funds this
year.
</P>
<P>
The ABC used to own 45 trust and investment companies, with
eight of them transferred or to-be-transferred and 36 of them
restructured into branches or business departments of the ABC.
</P>
<P>
Most of the ABC-owned 220 securities business departments will
be revoked except thosed already acquired or to-be-acquired.

JAKARTA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Businessmen are not
concerned about Indonesia's trade relationship with Hong Kong
after the territory's return to China on July 1 this year,
Chairman of the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry
(KADIN) Aburizal Bakrie said here.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong is Hong Kong, and every area around the world will

Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Bakrie said business people know very well the efficiency and

</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hong Kong's Secretary for Trade and Industry Denise
Yue said at the seminar that Hong Kong will continue to increase
its foreign investment after the handover.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no shortage of funds ... (and) no outflows of
funds from Hong Kong," she said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong ranks fourth among countries and regions giving
foreign direct investment to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was jointly organized by KADIN and the Hong Kong
Economic and Trade Office to plan trade relations between

<HEADLINE> Farmers Become Marketing Agents In Rural Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in East China's Shandong
Province have started to get involved in the marketing business
to give themselves a closer link to processors elsewhere in the
country.
</P>
<P>
One of this new style of entrepreneur, Xu Dengjun, a villager
in Shandong's Cangshan county, purchases more than 100,000
sheepskins annually in pastoral areas of northwest China and sells
them to factories in the south for processing.
</P>
<P>
Xu started in the early 1980s as a simple pedlar around his own
county, and gradually established contacts in other places,
eventually even getting contracts with factories in the south.
</P>
<P>
Now, more than 300 households in Xu's village have followed his
example, often serving as his agents. Xu and two other families in
the village gather more than a million sheepskins every year and
have sales worth over 100 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Xu's prosperity is evident in his annual taxes, which are
nearly 300,000 yuan. Some other households are well-off enough to
be able to buy Volkswagen cars.
</P>
<P>
Sun Dexing, a farmer in Pingdu city, is another example. He set
up a fruit company in 1993 by acting as a marketing agent for
local fruit growers. He purchased more than 1,000 tons of apples
from a dozen suppliers he had contracts with, in spite of some
marketing difficulties in some places last year.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the province's agriculture department say that one
result of this new activity has been that farmers have begun to
organize large-scale cooperatives on an individual basis,
marketing farm products and processing goods in a coordinated
way. In Laiyang city, they have established 348 vegetable or fruit
co-ops, involving 158,000 households. enditem

</P>
<P>
Lagging behind 1-0 from the first leg of this quarter-final,
the Spaniards attacked the Danes from the start and levelled the
tie when Antonio Pinilla slid the ball past Brondby goalkeeper
Mogens Krogh in the 21st minute.
</P>
<P>
With the match going into extra-time there were chances at both
ends, Brondby's Bo Hansen grabbed the best by heading towards goal
only to see Julio Gento clear the ball to safety.
</P>
<P>
Just as it looked as though a penalty shoot-out would be
needed to separate the teams, Tenerife made it 2-0 on the night
and 2-1 on aggregate.
</P>
<P>
From a free-kick on the edge of the Brondby penalty area, Mata
Olivera struck the ball past the defensive wall and propelled the
Spaniards into the last four.

HUHHOT, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Since 1994, over 3,000 girls in
north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region who dropped out of
school have been able to return to school with the help of the
"Spring Bud" program.
</P>
<P>
The program was launched by the All-China Women's Federation
and the China Children's Foundation in 1994 to help poor rural
girls complete primary education.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years, women's associations at various
levels in Inner Mongolia have embraced the plan as a major part of
their work, publicizing it to increasing numbers of people.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 1,077 dropout girls in the region returned to school
thanks to the plan, including 675 girls who benefited from a
250,000-yuan donation from Chow Jiebing in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
However, there are nearly 10,000 dropouts in Inner Mongolia, 60
percent of whom are girls, according to Yun Shubi, director of the
Inner Mongolia Children's Foundation.

GUANGZHOU, March 19 (Xinhua) -- State enterprises in Guangzhou
achieved more than 57 billion yuan in industrial added value in
1996, nearly 15 percent more than the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Increased productivity has been attributed to their adoptiion
of modern corporate structures that separate government
administration from enterprise management.

The city generated nearly 206 billion yuan in industrial output
value last year, up nearly 17 percent over 1995, with the
sales-production ratio reaching 96.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Last year asset-liability ratio of the local state industrial
enterprises fell six percentage points from the previous year.
</P>

Guangzhou exerted greater efforts to set up 56 large-sized
state enterprise groups. Each of them is expected to have more
than 500 million yuan worth of assets and three billion yuan in
annual sales by the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
Last year the city invested four billion yuan in technological
improvements. New products brought in five billion yuan in output

<HEADLINE> Romania Allows Foreign Investors to Purchase Lands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Romanian parliament approved a
bill today allowing foreign-funded and joint enterprises to
purchase lands in the country for their invested projects.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which is complementary to the existing investment
law, is designed to draw more foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
J. A. Serousii, chairman of the Romanian Foreign Investors'
Association, said last month that allowing foreign investors to
purchase lands was not the key to attracting investment.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that Romania adopt a preferential policy in terms
of the income tax of these enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors in Romania currently are not allowed to remit
their profits back home.
</P>
<P>
So far, Romania has got a total of 2.3 billion U.S. dollars of
foreign investment, far behind Hungary, Poland and the Czech
Republic.
</P>
<P>
Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ciorbea has promised that the
government would complement and revise the investment law as soon
as possible, so as to provide more conveniences for foreign
investors.
</P>
<P>
He added that the government's economic reform plan has given
priority to introducing more foreign investment.

<P>
HAVANA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The book "Secreto de Generales"
(Generals' Secret), in which Cuban military officers reveal
episodes of the revolutionary process in the Caribbean island,
aroused a great interest, the local press reported.
</P>
<P>
"Secreto de Generales", written by journalist Luis Baez, is a
collection of conversations with 41 high-ranking military officers
-- 41 men and one woman -- among them Ulises Rosales del Toro,
general staff of the army chief, and Interior Minister Abelardo
Colome Ibarra.
</P>
<P>
Armed Revolutionary Forces Minister Raul Castro, who wrote the

from the people, studied and developed themselves.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Archeologists Explore Desert, Buddhist Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, March 19 (Xinhua) -- An expedition to a Buddhist site
in China's largest sand waste, suggests that the desert has
expanded some 90 km to the south in the past 1,200 years.
</P>
<P>
Tracing along ancient river routes, a Chinese archaeological
team has found Dandanulik, a Buddhist site from the Tang Dynasty
(618-907) discovered by Swedish explorer Seven Hedin in 1896, in
the Taklamakan Desert in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The archaeologists say that three rivers ran from the south to
Dandanulik some 1,200 years ago, indicating that the desert was
limited to the north of the site at that time.
</P>
<P>
The site, covering an area of one sq km, was found with remains
of a Buddhist temple, some building ruins, glass beads, red clay
fragments and textile tools.

SOFIA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria's top tennis player
Magdalena Maleeva has withdrawn from the Federation Cup tennis
qualifiers in Bari on April 21, state news agency BTA said on
Tuesday.
</P>

because it cannot win against teams like Italy, Hungary, etc, as
the country has no strong players," BTA quoted Maleeva's letter to
the Bulgarian Tennis Federation as saying.

The Federation said Bulgaria's team for the qualifiers would
comprise Dessislava Topalova, Galina Dimitrova, Teodora Nedeva and

ROME, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Napoli coach Gigi Simoni said on

"I asked for a two-year contract but they only wanted to renew
me for one year. That's why I'm going," Simoni said.

<P>
PARIS, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Newcastle United's dreams of UEFA
Cup glory crashed Tuesday as they went down 3-0 to Monaco in their
quarter-final second leg in Monaco to bow out 4-0 on aggregate.
</P>
<P>
A powerful drive from Sylvain Legwinski three minutes before
the interval left Newcastle, who lost the home leg 1-0 at
St. James' Park a fortnight ago to a goal from Brazilian striker
Sonny Anderson, with a mountain to climb.
</P>
<P>
Algerian international Ali Benarbia delivered the killer blow
five minutes after the restart to send Kenny Dalglish's men
spinning out of the tournament in some disarray.
</P>
<P>
The brilliant Benarbia then crowned his performance with the
third from a stunning freekick midway through the second half
before being substituted near the end to a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
The French title favourites were bidding to become only the
third French side to ever to oust an English team in European
competition, Newcastle themselves being the last victims when they
lost to Bastia back in 1977 in the UEFA Cup second round.
</P>
<P>
United, cheered on by some 3,000 of their travelling fans in a
capacity 18,000 crowd, were missing the injured Les Ferdinand, and
Alan Shearer, who were ruled out following groin surgery.

<HEADLINE> Germany's Net Capital Outflow Hits Record in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Net investment outflow in Germany
reached a record of about 47 billion marks (27 billion US dollars)
last year, compared with 38 billion marks (21.8 billion dollars)
in 1995, the German central bank Bundesbank said today in its
monthly report for March.
</P>
<P>
The report said the deficit in capital flows resulted from the
42 billion mark (24 billion dollar) overseas investments by German
firms last year and the withdrawal by foreign companies of 5
billion mark (2.87 billion dollar) capital out of Germany.
</P>
<P>
German investments abroad last year declined by 13.5 billion
marks (7.755 billion dollars) from a record of 55.5 billion marks
(31.88 billion dollars) in 1995, the report noted, which according
to it reflected a correction to the unusually large size of
investment in 1995, not fundamental change in investment trends.
</P>
<P>
According to the Bundesbank report, the United States topped
the list of individual countries receiving German capital last
year. By region, 47 percent of German investments abroad went to
other European Union member states, and 25 percent flowed to
Eastern Europe and to developing countries.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls, Mark Surges in New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar fell sharply and
the mark surged today after a senior bank official of Germany
offered another strong warning that Germany might not qualify for
Europe's planned single currency.
</P>
<P>
The saying that the most economically powerful country in
Europe can't meet the strict entry criteria of euro would still
leave the mark as the pre-eminent European currency.
</P>
<P>
In New York, the dollar cost 1.6727 marks, down from 1.6894
Monday and the lowest level in three weeks. The dollar cost 122.43
yen, down from 123.66 yen. The pound cost 1.5901 U.S. dollars, up
from 1.5888 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
It was the second straight day of big gains in the mark on
EMU-related anxieties.

<P>
NEW YORK, March 18 (Xinhua) -- New York stocks slid sharply
today after another robust economic report fanned inflation
worries and firmed belief the Federal Reserve will raise interest
rates soon to check inflation.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average, down nearly 101 points during
the afternoon, finished with a loss of 58.92 points to 6,898.56.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by nearly a 2-to-1
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, with NYSE volume totaling
467.30 million shares as against the 494.43 million in the
previous session.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list fell 6.05 to 789.66, and
the NYSE's composite index fell 2.97 to 415.40.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index fell 10.09 to 1,269.34, and the
American Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.79 to 595.45.
</P>
<P>
Bonds initially sank after the Commerce Department reported
that construction of new homes unexpectedly shot up 12.2 percent
in February to the highest level in nearly three years.
</P>
<P>
Although there's been few indication of rapid inflation,
analysts are concerned that the economy may be growing too fast
and generating price pressures. Those fears have been enhanced by
more data ranging from tight labor markets to strong consumer
spending.
</P>
<P>
As bond prices fell, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond
briefly jumped above 7 percent before pulling back near late
Monday's 6.95 percent.

<HEADLINE> US Congress Urged to Approve Peacekeeping Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The commander of U.S. forces
in Europe today urged Congress to quickly approve the 2 billion
U.S. dollars for peacekeeping in Bosnia, warning that the fighting
readiness of U.S. troops there will suffer if it will not be
approved in April.
</P>
<P>
"I need the supplemental by April. It will have an effect on
readiness if I don't get it," said Army Gen. George Joulwan in
testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon has asked Congress to approve the special
appropriation as part of the expected cost of 6.5 billion dollars
to maintain some 8,000 U.S. troops in Bosnia through mid-1998.
</P>
<P>
Congressional appropriations committees are expected to take up
the 2 billion dollar request early next month.
</P>
<P>
Joulwan, who is also commander of all NATO forces in Europe,
said U.S. forces operations in Europe, the Near East and Africa
have increased five-fold in the last seven years, including the
evacuation of hundreds of Americans and other foreigners from
Albania.
</P>
<P>
He said his 100,000 U.S. troops in the region are being
increasingly called on to provide rescue and other extra services
at high cost after the Cold War. But he said, "We are concerned
with the costs of that operation and its effects on our readiness
to deploy forces elsewhere."

<HEADLINE> CIA: Iraqi Chemical Explosion Fallout May Not Widespread </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Officials of the U.S. Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) said today the poison gas fallout from
the explosions by the U.S. Army of an Iraqi chemical weapons
stockpile in 1991 may not widely spread.
</P>
<P>
The CIA has determined that the U.S. Army exploded about 1,400
Iraqi rockets containing chemical agents in a shallow "pit" south
of Khamisiyah on two days, March 10 and 12, rather than on March
10 alone as previously believed, said CIA spokeswoman Carolyn
Osborn.
</P>
<P>
The explanation suggests the possibility that the cloud of
gases from the explosions was smaller and covered a narrower area.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon has acknowledged that the demolition work could
have led to inadvertent exposure of U.S. troops to poison gases.
Some believe these exposures might lead to the mysterious Gulf War
illnesses suffered by thousands of veterans.
</P>
<P>
Ms. Osborn said the latest information about the demolition
work near Khamisiyah was being presented today at a public meeting
in Salt Lake City of the Presidential Advisory Committee on Gulf
War Veterans' Illnesses.
</P>
<P>
The CIA also said Robert Walpole was appointed as special
assistant for Persian Gulf War illnesses and has created a special
task force to coordinate support for Walpole.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Osborn said the CIA was releasing to the committee a
photograph of the pit where the March 10 and 12 demolitions took
place. She said the CIA hoped it would jog memories of some U.S.
soldiers who were there but had not realized it was the pit in
question.
</P>
<P>
The CIA hoped this could help U.S. investigators to determine
local weather conditions on March 10 and 12.

<HEADLINE> Barshefsky Stresses Importance of NAFTA Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. will suffer a serious
setback in global economic competition unless Congress soon gives
the government new trade negotiating authority to expand the North
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), U.S. Trade Representative
Charlene Barshefsky said today.
</P>
<P>
Testifying before the Ways and Means Committee of the U.S.
House of Representatives, Barshefsky urged the U.S. Congress not
to allow concerns such as Mexico's drug policies to derail a
government proposal to expand the NAFTA.
</P>
<P>
"Our competitors would like nothing better than for us to
sideline ourselves, debating NAFTA and our relationship with
Mexico for several more years while they move ahead," Barshefsky
said.
</P>
<P>
Barshefsky noted that French President Jacques Chirac, on a
trade mission to Latin America, said the region's "essential
economic interests... lie not with the United States but with
Europe." Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto had also led a
recent trade mission to the region.
</P>
<P>
"In every region of the world, but particularly in Asia and
Latin America, the two fastest-growing regions of the world, our
competitors are pursuing strategic trade policies, and in some
cases, preferential trade arrangements that will open up markets
for their exporters, their products, their workers, their
farmers," she said.
</P>
<P>
She warned against "the dangers of inaction" in competing the
market in the area with other countries.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government set in 1994 a goal of creating a free-trade
zone in the Western hemisphere by 2005. But it has been unable to
get new negotiating authority through the U.S. Congress in the
past two years because of a dispute over whether new pacts should
include protections for worker rights and environmental standards.
</P>
<P>
The NAFTA now covers the United States, Canada and Mexico. The
Clinton administration wants to extend it to other nations in
Latin America.

NEW YORK, March 18 (Xinhua) -- AT&AMP;T, the world's communication
giant, signed today a memorandum of understanding with the
Guangdong Posts and Telecommunications Administration (GPTA) of
China to cooperate with the GPTA to optimize its
telecommunications network.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the memorandum, AT&AMP;T will provide the
Chinese province with technical support and business consultancy
to the GPTA on nine proposed projects including establishing a
provincial electronic data interchange (EDI) network, various
value-added network services and on-line opportunities, wireless
network optimization, advanced value added networks management,
setting up a call center, integrated networking, an electronic
tax-payment system and Internet operations.
</P>
<P>
The project will also feature the development of broadband,
multi-media applications in the flourishing southern Chinese
province.
</P>
<P>
Art Kobler, president of AT&AMP;T China Inc. and GPTA Director
General Cui Xun, who is visiting the United States, signed the
long-term memorandum at AT&AMP;T's operational headquarters in New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
"Guangdong telecommunications has been developing rapidly
since China opened up to the outside world," said Cui Xun. "An
advanced telecommunications network has been established in
Guangdong. It is both necessary and realistic to further develop
applications and offer new services. I believe the cooperation
will benefit both parties."
</P>
<P>
John J. Legere, president and chief executive officer of the
AT&AMP;T Asia/Pacific, said at the ceremony, "We see this agreement as
an important step in what we expect will be a long and mutually
rewarding relationship with GPTA."

UNITED NATIONS, March 18 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan today expressed "disappointment" and "deep concern"
with an Israeli decision to proceed with construction in East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"The secretary-general has learned with disappointment and deep
concern that, despite international appeals, the Israeli
authorities have decided to proceed with construction at Abu
Ghaneim," said a statement by his spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"He called on the parties to do their utmost to find mutually
acceptable solutions and proceed with the peace negotiations," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government approved in late February a plan to
build 6,500 houses for Jewish settlers at Abu Ghaneim, East
Jerusalem. The plan met strong opposition from the international
community.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. General Assembly adopted last Thursday a resolution,
calling upon Israel to refrain from all actions or measures,
including settlement activities, which alter the facts on the
ground, preempting the final status negotiations, and have
negative implications for the Middle East peace process.

Balkans states in cooperation with the International Monetary
Fund, the World Bank, the European Investment Bank and other

<HEADLINE> Canada Supports UN Reform Package: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Canada supports the first phase of
the United Nations reform measures, Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd
Axworthy said here today.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome the wide range of reforms announced by (UN)
Secretary-General Annan. They are a worthy contribution to the
overall reform agenda of the UN," Axworthy said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The measures announced at the UN General Assembly by Kofi Annan
include, among other things, proposals for a reduction in the next
UN regular budget, and elimination of some 1,000 positions.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, Axworthy also noted the financial crisis that
the UN has experienced in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Canada is one of a handful of members that always pays its
annual UN assessments "on time, in full and without conditions,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"This has given Canadian representatives added credibility in
their efforts to promote UN renewal," he said.

<HEADLINE> US Urges Israelis, Palestinians to Negotiate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States today urged
the Israelis and Palestinians to avoid any possible violent
clashes and go to the negotiating table as Israel's bulldozers
started clearing away rocks and earth for a Jewish housing project
in Arab east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"We would very much want to see a return to the (negotiating)
table," Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said at a news
conference. "That is the only time that there has been talking to
each other at the table. And that is the way we would like to see
things proceed."
</P>
<P>
Albright made mild reproaches on the Israeli move of breaking
ground for the housing project, saying: "I think that the Israelis
understand the difficulties that we see with their going forward."
</P>
<P>
She noted President Bill Clinton had said publicly that he
wished Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had not decided
to start the project.
</P>
<P>
Albright meanwhile urged the Palestinians not to go to streets
for any demonstrations against the Israeli move for fear there
might provoke violent backlash.
</P>
<P>
"We are obviously concerned about the fact that violence is
never an answer to the problems in the Middle East."

<HEADLINE> US Senate Rejects Constitutional Amendment on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate today voted
61-38 to reject a proposed constitutional amendment that would
have let Congress set spending and contribution limits on
campaigns for federal office.
</P>
<P>
The amendment, which also would have allowed states to set
contribution and spending limits for state and local elections.
Fifty Republicans and 11 Democrats voted against the amendment.
</P>
<P>
The vote was 29 short of the two-thirds majority needed to win
Senate approval of a constitutional amendment. The House of
Representatives has not voted on it.
</P>
<P>
The amendment's supporters argued that money has overwhelmed
the election process and limits are needed to prevent a repeat of
last year's improprieties.
</P>
<P>
But opponents focused on the amendment's potential to limit
free speech.
</P>
<P>
The notion that campaign spending is free speech protected by
the Constitution comes from a 1976 Supreme Court ruling, Buckley
vs. Valeo. The ruling overturned spending caps on elections,
saying such restrictions inappropriately restrained First
Amendment free-speech rights. The court upheld, however, numerous
limits on campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
Supporters maintained that they were contradicting not the
Constitution but the five justices who made the 1976 ruling.
</P>
<P>
The main bipartisan campaign finance bill pending in Congress
would, among other things, bar the unlimited "soft-money"
contributions to the political parties and encourage candidates to
limit spending voluntarily, offering them discounted TV time and
postage in exchange.
</P>
<P>
A number of Democratic senators announced a new bill today
seeking public financing of congressional campaigns.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Manufacturing Rises in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Canada's manufacturers started
this year with a substantial rise in production and a significant
increase in their order books after five lacklustre months.
</P>
<P>
In January, Canadian factory shipments rose 2.2 percent in
January to 25.6 billion U.S. dollars, while new orders climbed 4.3
percent to 26.3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the closely watched ratio of inventories to
shipments fell close to the record lows it reached two years ago,
which is another good sign for the Canadian economy.
</P>
<P>
Most of the power for the January surge in manufacturing
activity came from the auto industry, as shipments of autos and
parts rose 9.2 percent from December.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, sales of other factory goods increased 0.7
percent, said reports today.
</P>
<P>
The shipment and order surge came as a result of the export
demand for autos and parts, and a sliding Canadian dollar.

<HEADLINE> European Shares Down on Fears of Interest Rate, EMU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- All the three major stock markets
in Europe fell and closed sharply lower today, depressed by
worries over possible higher US interest rates, the UK's election
campaign and talks of a delay of the European monetary union
(EMU).
</P>
<P>
Uncertainty over US interest rates and the EMU cast a shadow
over London's FTSE 100 index, which ended 16.5 points lower at
4,356.8 after having dipped to a low of 4,340.1 earlier in the
day.
</P>
<P>
Traders said that the market was also kept subdued by Wall
Street's mixed start today and by worries about a six-week general
election campaign and the prospect of a change of government.
</P>
<P>
Of all the three leading European markets, Frankfurt suffered
the most losses, with the DAX-30 index ending 59.80 points down at
3,291.19, once again breaching the important 3,300-point level,
also undermined by worries about a possible delay for the EMU and
the prospect of a US interest rate rise.
</P>
<P>
A downturn on Wall Street, doubts about the starting time of
the EMU and a weaker dollar all helped to hit the Paris bourse,
with its CAC-40 index finishing the session 14.43 points down at
2,573.95.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 index of leading British shares ended 16.5
points lower at 4,356.8. The Frankfurt DAX-30 index closed 59.80
points weaker at 3,291.19. In Paris, the CAC-40 index finished
