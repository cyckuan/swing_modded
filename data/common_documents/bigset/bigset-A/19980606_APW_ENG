	   In Arlington, Texas, Juan Gonzalez hit his 19th homer and had
three RBIs to boost his major league-leading total to 76 as Texas
beat San Diego.
	   Gonzalez homered off former Rangers pitcher Kevin Brown in the
sixth inning and also had an RBI double in the second and a
sacrifice fly in the fourth.
	   Tim Crabtree (3-0) retired the final batter in the seventh to
pick up the victory, and John Wetteland pitched the ninth for his
15th save.
 &UR; Giants 3, Cardinals 2 &QC; 
	   In St. Louis, after missing three games with back spasms, Mark
McGwire didn't waste any time resuming his chase of Roger Maris'
home run record.
	   However, his major league-leading 28th homer wasn't enough to
prevent another loss for the St. Louis Cardinals.
	   McGwire hit a two-run homer off Orel Hershiser in his first
at-bat Friday night, but Hershiser (6-3) recovered to win his sixth
straight decision in San Francisco's 3-2 victory in the opener of
the only non-interleague series of the weekend.
	   Jeff Kent had a two-run double in the third for the Giants, who
won their season-high seventh straight and sent the Cardinals to
their sixth loss in seven games. Kent Bottenfield (1-3) took the
loss.

Evacuated foreigners tell of rising tension in Eritrea

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Weary from overnight travel and
concerned about friends left behind, almost 200 foreigners
evacuated from Eritrea arrived in Frankfurt before dawn Saturday.
	   The 194 evacuees included 129 Americans, many of them U.S.
government workers or Peace Corps volunteers in the East African
nation that is heading toward war with neighboring Ethiopia.
	   They described a rising tension in Eritrea, with army reservists
called up in recent weeks to bolster forces at the disputed border
with Ethiopia that is the focus of the conflict.
	   But only when they heard the blasts of bombs dropped by
Ethiopian jet fighters Friday did the evacuees feel any fear.
	   ``We heard the sound of planes, and the bombs going,'' said
Barbara Kelly, who worked with her husband, Mike, as a teacher for
Britain's Volunteer Service Overseas charity.
	   Outside the Ethiopian Embassy in Asmara, the Eritrean capital,
people cheered and blared car horns over the downing of two
Ethiopian jets by Eritrean forces, the evacuees said.
	   ``The cars were driving past it (the embassy) and honking their
horns,'' said Aaron Greenberg, 22, of New York city, a Peace Corps
volunteer in Eritrea for the past year. ``We didn't see anything.
We were told later a plane was shot down.''
	   Eritrea gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993. Before that,
Eritrean rebels were instrumental in helping the Ethiopian People's
Revolutionary Democratic Front overthrow a 17-year military regime
in July 1991.
	   Greenberg and others said Eritrean friends started heading for
the border with Ethiopia four weeks ago, facing the prospect of
fighting former allies.
	   ``When they started pulling people out to the border, you knew
something was going on,'' he said. But he described the atmosphere
as basically calm, with Eritreans expressing confidence about a
possible war.
	   ``They were saying if they (Ethiopians) want war, we'll give
them war,'' he said.
	   The flight chartered by the U.S. government left Asmara at 7
p.m. Friday night (1600 GMT) and arrived in Frankfurt at about 3:30
a.m. (0130 GMT Saturday) after a refueling stop in Cairo, Egypt.
	   Katharine Puffenberger, who works for the U.S. Agency for
International Development in Asmara, said there was no panic as
people prepared to evacuate.
	   ``We weren't afraid,'' said Puffenberger, of Ogden, Utah.
``There was nothing happening in Asmara.''
	   Josh Simko, 24, of Santa Barbara, California, said he worried
about what a possible war would do to the young country.
	   ``We have friends who are at the border, and some of our
students didn't finish'' their studies because of the conflict,
said Simko, a Peace Corps teacher.

<TEXT>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ The Chicago Bulls' dysfunctional dynasty
became a two-part harmony again, and it was enough to tie the NBA
Finals at one game apiece.
	   Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen scored all but two of
Chicago's points in the fourth quarter, and the Bulls stopped
yapping at each other and started looking like a championship team
again as they defeated the Utah Jazz 93-88 Friday night.
	   Aside from a strong first half by Toni Kukoc, the Bulls didn't
get much help from anyone other than Pippen and Jordan. But there
were enough scattered offensive rebounds and defensive stops, and a
pair of foul shots by Steve Kerr with 19.5 seconds left essentially
locked up the win.
	   The series resumes Sunday night at Chicago with the Bulls now
holding homecourt advantage.
	   The Bulls avoided falling behind 0-2 in a series for the first
time since 1994 and handed the Jazz their first consecutive losses
this season with John Stockton in the lineup.
	   Jordan finished with 37 points, Pippen had 21 and Kukoc scored
all 13 of his in the first half. The Bulls grabbed 18 offensive
rebounds _ twice their total from Game 1 _ and scored 33 points off
Utah's 20 turnovers.
	   Most important of all, the Bulls closed the game with a strong
flourish and did something to debunk the theory that they have
forgotten how to finish.
	   That line of thinking, along with the short fuses and quick
tempers that were on display in Game 1 _ the byproducts of the
expected end of the Bulls decade-long run _ had people thinking
that Chicago might not be able to beat a Jazz team that showed off
superior depth and precision in Game 1.
	   Instead, the Bulls did enough in the final few minutes to head
back to Chicago in a whole new frame of mind.
	   Utah had a 12-4 run, ending with a 3-pointer by Jeff Hornacek
with 1:46 left for an 86-85 lead.
	   With the crowd chanting ``Beat the Bulls,'' Chicago missed two
shots and Utah rebounded, but Stockton threw a bad pass that was
picked off by Kukoc. Kerr missed an open 3-pointer and grabbed his
own rebound, feeding Jordan for a layup. He was fouled on the play,
and his free throw made it 88-86.
	   Malone missed a 20-footer (6-meter attempt) with the shot clock
running down, and Rodman rebounded with 25 seconds left. Kerr then
made two foul shots, making it 90-86.
	   The Jazz threw away the ensuing inbounds pass _ their 20th
turnover of the night _ and Jordan made a free throw with 14.5
seconds left.
	   All the Jazz could do after that was heave up a pair of
3-pointers, and they wouldn't have done much good even if they went
in. A tip-in by Morris made it 91-88 with 3.7 seconds left, and
Jordan finished the scoring from the line with 1.7 left.
	   The crowd had already started filing out, and the elation this
city felt after the Jazz's overtime victory in Game 1 had
evaporated.
	   Jordan shot 14-for-33 from the field and 9-for-10 from the line,
Pippen was 7-of-13 and Kukoc was 6-for-16. Dennis Rodman grabbed
nine rebounds, including five on the offensive end to help Chicago
score 19 second-chance points.
	   Jeff Hornacek had 20 points to lead the Jazz, who got only four
second-half points from Karl Malone as he finished with 16.
	   Malone had four turnovers and John Stockton, Bryon Russell, Jeff
Hornacek and Howard Eisley had three each.
	   Utah went 7-for-13 on 3-pointers after going 0-for-8 in Game 1,
but the sharp shooting was negated by the sloppiness the Jazz
showed throughout the game.
	   In the first quarter, Kukoc was 4-for-6, Jordan was 4-for-8 and
Pippen 3-for-6 as three scored all 23 of Chicago's points. The
quarter ended with the Bulls ahead 23-20.
	   The Bulls' bench started contributing in the second quarter,
with 3-pointers by Scott Burrell and Kerr _ along with one by Kukoc
_ helping Chicago open a 46-39 lead with 2 1/2 minutes left.
	   The calls and non-calls really started going Chicago's way over
the rest of the half. Jordan drew a chippy touch foul, then knocked
Hornacek over as he backed his way in. No call was made as Hornacek
fell on his back, but the whistle blew after Hornacek knocked the
ball out of Jordan's hands.
	   Replays showed a clean steal, and the crowd was livid as Jordan
sank two free throws. They got even more steamed on Utah's next
trip downcourt when Malone fell hard to the floor and nothing was
called.
	   When the first half ended with Chicago ahead 50-46, the refs
were the target of even more abuse as they walked to their locker
room.

Jazz collapse raises disturbing questions for Game 3 With Sports-Basketball-NBA Finals 
</HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ At the end of the third quarter, Utah
seemed in command of Game 2 of the NBA Finals. Twelve minutes
later, after one of their worst quarters of basketball this season,
the Jazz were wondering what hit them.
	   Nerves, poor shot selection, some good defense by Chicago and
almost a complete lack of rebounding combined to send Utah to a
93-88 defeat.
	   Instead of the veteran team that they are, the Jazz looked like
the scared big-game novices that folded during crunch time in last
year's finals against the Bulls.
	   Utah roared into the fourth quarter, using an 11-0 run to take a
73-70 lead on Howard Eisley's 3-pointer with 8.9 seconds left in
the third. More important, the Jazz were controlling the tempo of
the game even with their reserves on the floor.
	   Then the bottom fell out. Suddenly, the Jazz, playing four subs,
looked lost early in the quarter, committing turnovers on their
first three possessions. They went without a field goal over the
first 7:04 of the fourth quarter.
	   When the Bulls took the lead with 6:35 to play, the Jazz didn't
respond. Utah was 4-for-15 from the field in the quarter and
committed seven of their 20 turnovers down the stretch.
	   The Jazz lost from the top down as Karl Malone had his second
straight off game, shooting 5-for-16 and scoring 16 points.
	   Chicago grabbed 18 offensive rebounds compared to just nine for
the Jazz.
	   With 26 seconds to play and the Jazz down 88-86, Malone, instead
of driving to the hoop, took a fallaway 20-foot (6-meter) jumper
that missed badly. Chicago rebounded, and the Jazz were forced to
foul the Bulls.

	   ESCHEDE, Germany (AP) _ Rescue crews searching for victims of a
deadly high-speed train crash in Germany prepared for rest and
reflection as they hoped to finish clearing the site by Saturday.
	   ``I've never had to deal with so many dead people,'' said Dirk
Winkler, a 25-year-old soldier whose tank battalion has been using
its vehicles to pull back the wreckage from Wednesday's crash of
the InterCity Express 884.
	   Rescuers uncovered two more bodies Saturday morning when they
lifted the last chunk of concrete, said Gerhard Thielbeer,
spokesman for the district of Celle. The discovery of brings the
death toll to 100, including five people who died in hospitals.
	   Police expected to finish clearing the site of bodies by
Saturday morning, although heavy rains overnight threatened to slow
the work.
	   While doctors working round the clock will continue to identify
the victims over the weekend, the rescuers _ soldiers, firefighters
and Red Cross volunteers _ should get some needed rest. But rest
will also bring reflection, time to consider the grim impact of
what they've been doing.
	   By Friday, investigators had identified a likely cause of the
disaster: A wheel broke on the first passenger car. Two minutes
later, the derailed train started breaking apart and crashed into
supports of an overpass.
	   After recalling all the ICE trains for inspection, the German
Rail company ordered trains returning to circulation to run slower,
with a top speed of 160 kph (100 mph), rather than the usual
maximum of 280 kph (175 mph).
	   When the train hit the bridge, it was traveling at 200 kph (125
mph). With a huge yellow crane, rescuers on Friday lifted the last
fragment of the collapsed bridge from the top of the smashed train.
The cable creaked from the weight.
	   All the bodies found under the wreckage were taken to a hospital
morgue in Hanover, 50 kilometers (30 miles) to the south. By
Friday, only 19 victims had been identified because of the mangled
condition of many of the bodies.
	   ``We don't want any relatives to have to go from body to body
because it's unbearable. It's arms and legs and heads. It's
awful,'' said Christian Jung, spokesman for the Hanover medical
school hospital.
	   Rescuers, like the doctors, have worked almost continuously
since arriving at the scene of the worst accident on Germany's
railways since World War II on Wednesday. During a break on Friday,
they seemed both dazed and animated, pumped up from stress and on
automatic-pilot to cope with it.
	   Some described little tricks _ everyday chit-chat at the site,
silly jokes on the way home in the car. Anything to distract the
mind from what the hands have been doing, and the eyes seeing.
	   ``We have to be strong,'' said Birgit Aust, 25, a Red Cross
volunteer. ``The worst moment was when I got there and saw the
bridge on top of the train. Then I shut off. You have to suppress
all that right now. Otherwise, you can't keep going.''
	   Aust said she expected to work through the weekend, recovering
the remains of the dead and comforting the victims' relatives.
	   Next week _ when the gravity hits _ she plans to seek comfort
herself, through counseling.

	   In Arlington, Texas, Juan Gonzalez hit his 19th homer and had
three RBIs to boost his major league-leading total to 76 as Texas
beat San Diego.
	   Gonzalez homered off former Rangers pitcher Kevin Brown in the
sixth inning and also had an RBI double in the second and a
sacrifice fly in the fourth.

pick up the victory, and John Wetteland pitched the ninth for his

McGwire didn't waste any time resuming his chase of Roger Maris'
home run record.
	   However, his major league-leading 28th homer wasn't enough to
prevent another loss for the St. Louis Cardinals.
	   McGwire hit a two-run homer off Orel Hershiser in his first
at-bat Friday night, but Hershiser (6-3) recovered to win his sixth
straight decision in San Francisco's 3-2 victory in the opener of
the only non-interleague series of the weekend.
	   Jeff Kent had a two-run double in the third for the Giants, who
won their season-high seventh straight and sent the Cardinals to
their sixth loss in seven games. Kent Bottenfield (1-3) took the
loss.

Politicians criticize bribery investigation as going `too far' 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Their image sullied in the wake of yet another
bribery scandal, politicians in Japan's ruling party say it's time
to take firm action to punish wrongdoers.
	   Their target: the prosecutors who investigated the scandal.
	   Liberal Democratic Party lawmakers have taken the offensive
against the Tokyo Public Prosecutors Office, which they say went
``too far'' in this year's investigation into influence peddling by
officials, Japanese newspapers reported Saturday.
	   ``It's democratic for the legislative branch to take a firm
stand when the judicial branch goes too far,'' ruling party
lawmaker Tokuichiro Tamazawa was quoted as saying by the Asahi
newspaper.
	   In particular, the lawmakers are furious that their names
appeared in the press as the investigation proceeded. They accuse
prosecutors of leaking such details to win public support.
	   The scandal drove one lawmaker to commit suicide in March as
prosecutors sought his arrest for allegedly taking bribes from
Nikko Securities Co. Nikko's president later admitted the company
made illegal payoffs to the lawmaker, Shokei Arai.
	   Investigators also arrested five officials from the Finance
Ministry and central bank between January and March on suspicion of
giving favored treatment to banks and brokerages in exchange for
lavish entertainment. The arrests forced the resignation of the
finance minister and the head of the Bank of Japan.
	   The Liberal Democrats first won a majority in Japan's parliament
in 1955 and have been embroiled in successive bribery scandals ever
since. Most recently, the Recruit scandal in 1989 toppled the
cabinet of Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, and party kingpin Shin
Kanemaru was arrested in 1993 on tax evasion charges. Prosecutors
unearthed more than dlrs 40 million worth of gold bars and stock
from his Tokyo apartment.

Indonesian rights watchdog ready to defend ex-president 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's official human rights
watchdog has said it was ready to defend former President Suharto
against calls for unlawful revenge.
	   The National Human Rights Commission said it would stand up for
Suharto's rights as a citizen and that any action taken against the
former autocrat should be done according to the law.
	   ``We have to be fair because our country is a lawful country,''
the official Antara news agency Saturday quoted Commission member
Bambang W. Soeharto as saying.
	   Suharto resigned on May 21 following a wave of riots and
protests that were triggered by the worst economic crisis in 30
years.
	   Since then, there have been calls for the former autocrat to be
put on trial.
	   Many want an investigation into the wealth of Suharto's family,
who made billions of dollars during his 32-year rule.
	   Some say the state should seize Suharto's fortune and use it to
help the nation overcome its acute economic problems.
	   At the height of student protests last month, demonstrators even
called for Suharto to be hanged.
	   Since then, the powerful military and some leading opposition
figures have called for restraint.
	   Bambang said proper legal processes should be followed.
	   ``If he does wrong or breaks the law, then we have to bring him
to court to prove his guilt,'' Bambang said of Suharto.
	   The National Human Rights Commission was appointed by Suharto's
old government but has a track record for independence.

Minister: Sanctions will not slow Indian economic reforms 
</HEADLINE>
By NEELESH MISRA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India will not compromise either its
security or the six-year-old economic liberalization program under
pressure from sanctions imposed after its nuclear tests, its junior
foreign minister said Saturday.
	   The United States, Australia, Japan and other countries have cut
loans and all but humanitarian aid and imposed other punishments on
India and Pakistan for the series of tit-for-tat nuclear tests the
neighboring rivals conducted last month.
	   ``We intend to continue with our liberalization process, and we
realize there are costs but the country's security comes first,''
Vasundhara Raje Scindia said in an on-line chat organized by the
U.S. network MSNBC. Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee also
kept the foreign minister's portfolio, but Scindia is his top
foreign affairs aide.
	   Scindia's colleague, Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha, has said
the impact of the sanctions has been ``overplayed and highly
exaggerated.''
	   India said it was threatened by neighbors China, a declared
nuclear power, and Pakistan _ which until last month had kept
secret its nuclear capabiity. India and Pakistan now both claim to
be nuclear weapons states, but experts question whether either has
the capability to deliver a nuclear bomb to a target.
	   Meanwhile at the United Nations, the Security Council has
reached tentative agreement on a Japanese resolution urging India
and Pakistan to halt their nuclear weapons programs and denying
them status as nuclear states.
	   India accused the council of overstepping its authority. Its
envoy questioned in a letter to the council president why the
members were tolerating ``the continued retention of nuclear
weapons by the nuclear weapons states'' _ which are also the five
permanent members of the council.
	   ``Across the world people should think about disarming,''
Scindia was quoted as saying in an MSNBC transcript provided to The
Associated Press.
	   A South African user asked if India saw the tests as a victory
even though they led the five traditional nuclear powers to openly
discuss the situation in Kashmir, the territorial issue at the
heart of the Indo-Pakistan rivalry. India has long resisted
international pressure on the Kashmir issue, while Pakistan has
wanted outside mediation because it feels at a disadvantage in
one-on-one talks with its larger and more powerful neighbor.
	   ``Kashmir is a bilateral situation. There is no question of it
being internationalized. It is the business of India,'' Scindia
said.

Official: GDP growth expected at 6.5-6.8 percent 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ A senior Vietnamese official said his
country's economy is expected to grow at only 6.5 percent to 6.8
percent in the first six months of 1998, down from 9.1 percent the
same time last year, a newspaper reported Saturday.
	   Nguyen Tan Dung, first deputy prime minister and a member of the
powerful Politburo, was quoted as saying the country is coping with
problems much greater than foreseen earlier this year.
	   He blamed low economic efficiency and competitiveness, damage
from Typhoon Linda in 1997, the worst drought in a century and the
impact of the Asian financial crisis.
	   ``The bad impact of the regional crisis on our economy was not
within our prediction,'' Dung was quoted as saying by the Thanh
Nien newspaper.
	   ``Vietnam is not at the eye of the regional crisis and its
impact has not yet reversed our (economic) development, but it left
a relatively heavy impact on our economy,'' he said.
	   In an interview with the Labor newspaper, Deputy Prime Minister
Nguyen Cong Tan said unemployment is the government's biggest
concern.
	   He outlined several measures to revive lagging foreign
investment, including streamlining procedures. Many foreign
businessmen complain about Vietnam's red tape.
	   Dung said Typhoon Linda, which swept across the Mekong Delta
leaving more than 300 people dead and thousands missing last year,
and the drought have caused a combined dlrs 1 billion in damage.
	   Dung also said that over the last six months, the trade deficit
has risen by 20 percent and industries have laid off 250,000
workers due to shrinking production.

King denies he is behind Constitutional Council rift 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ King Norodom Sihanouk denied
Saturday any role in a boycott at the country's highest legal
appeals body that could affect the credibility of upcoming
elections.
	   The inaugural meeting of the Constitutional Council, a
nine-member body charged with solving election-related disputes,
was stalled for the second time Friday when the king's three
appointees failed to show.
	   The three elder statesman appear to be boycotting the opening
meeting in protest of the make-up of the body, which is supposed to
be neutral but is heavily stacked in favor of Cambodian strongman
Hun Sen. Six members are affiliated to his Cambodian People's
Party.
	   In a faxed statement, the king strongly denied ``any
ill-intentioned allegations'' that he was behind the boycott.
	   Hun Sen ousted the king's son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, as his
co-premier in a bloody coup d'etat 11 months ago. He has sought new
elections to win back aid and legitimacy lost after the violent
takeover.
	   The Constitutional Council, charged with determining the
constitutionality of all laws, would be called on to resolve any
problems that arise with Cambodia's controversial electoral and
political parties laws.
	   The former chairman of the Supreme Court, Chan Sok, who also
sits on the body, warned Friday that a further deadlock could call
into question the credibility of elections scheduled for July. He
said Sihanouk might be asked to intervene if the stalemate
continues.
	   ``We are taking no decision now, but we will wait and see if
they (the three appointees) change their minds and return to the
meeting,'' Chan Sok said, adding that no date has been set for the
next session.

Two Indonesian police go on trial in killings of four student protesters

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Two police lieutenants accused in the
killing of four student protesters were tried in a military court
Saturday as hundreds of students demonstrated outside.
	   The May 12 shootings at Trisakti University in the capital,
Jakarta, sparked several days of deadly rioting that helped oust
former President Suharto, who had been facing growing challenges to
his rule amid the worst economic crisis in decades.
	   The two officers are among 18 policemen who face court martial
as the military responds to a public clamor for accountability and
democracy under Indonesia's new President B.J. Habibie.
	   In opening remarks, military prosecutor Col. Hadi Purnomo said
the two defendants caused the deaths of the students because they
had been undisciplined and unable to control their troops during
the rally against Suharto.
	   He did not immediately announce the charges, but the officers
are likely to face dismissal and lengthy jail time if found guilty.
Hearings in the case could last weeks.
	   Outside the courthouse, students from the university where the
victims were slain held up banners that read, ``Put the masterminds
of the killings on trial'' and ``Hey general, why are the
defendants just low-ranking officers?''
	   Some critics speculate that the students were gunned down on
orders from top military brass, possibly in an attempt to snuff out
near-daily student protests that were growing in size and
intensity.
	   ``The two defendants are people who have been sacrificed,''
defense lawyer Buyung Nasution told a packed courtroom. ``It is
possible they are not the real killers.''
	   The two uniformed officers, First Lt. Agus Pri Haryanto and
Second Lt. Paryo, sat impassively before a military judge. Fellow
officers on the benches periodically applauded remarks by the
defense attorney and students outside listened on loudspeakers.

Bulls 93, Jazz 88 AP Basketball Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with quotes
AP Photos
By CHRIS SHERIDAN
<TEXT>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ Reports of the Bulls' demise proved
premature.
	   The dysfunctional dynasty became a two-part harmony again Friday
night behind Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen.
	   The two scored all but two of Chicago's points in the fourth
quarter as the Bulls stopped yapping at each other and started
looking like a championship team again as they defeated the Utah
Jazz 93-88.
	   ``People were talking about our age, about playing too many
minutes, whatever. But we're here, we beat some good teams to get
here,'' Jordan said. ``If that's what it means to be dead, I want
to be dead for a while longer.''
	   Aside from a strong first half by Toni Kukoc, the Bulls didn't
get much help from anyone other than Pippen and Jordan. But they
had enough offensive rebounds and defensive stops, and the Jazz got
too little offense from Karl Malone.
	   The Jazz also were hurt by a long drought in the fourth quarter.
They scored just one point in the first six minutes of the period,
which began with them ahead 73-70. It was the first time in 60
games that they lost after carrying a lead into the fourth.
	   ``They were the aggressors all night,'' Utah coach Jerry Sloan
said. ``That is a great defensive team. They're very good, very
quick. This is a rhythm team, and they created a rhythm for their
offense and kept it for almost the entire game.''
	   The series resumes Sunday night at Chicago with the Bulls now
holding homecourt advantage.
	   They avoided falling behind 0-2 in a series for the first time
since 1994 and will have a chance to hand the Jazz their first
consecutive losses this season with John Stockton in the lineup.
	   Jordan finished with 37 points, including 13 in the fourth,
Pippen had 21 and Kukoc scored all 13 of his in the first half. The
Bulls grabbed 18 offensive rebounds _ twice their total from Game 1
_ and scored 33 points off Utah's 20 turnovers.
	   Most important of all, the Bulls closed the game with a strong
flourish and did something to debunk the theory that they have
forgotten how to finish.
	   That line of thinking, along with the short fuses and quick
tempers that were on display in Game 1 _ the byproducts of the
expected end of the team's decade-long run _ had people thinking
that Chicago might not be able to beat a Jazz team that showed
superior depth and precision in Game 1.
	   Instead, the Bulls did enough in the final few minutes to head
back to Chicago in a whole new frame of mind.
	   Utah had a 12-4 run, ending with a 3-pointer by Jeff Hornacek
with 1:46 left for an 86-85 lead.
	   With the crowd chanting ``Beat the Bulls,'' Chicago missed two
shots and Utah rebounded, but Stockton threw a bad pass that was
picked off by Kukoc. Steve Kerr missed an open 3-pointer but
grabbed his own rebound, feeding Jordan for a layup. He was fouled
on the play, and his free throw made it 88-86.
	   Malone missed a 20-footer (6-meter attempt) with the shot clock
running down, and Rodman rebounded with 25 seconds left. Kerr then
made two foul shots, making it 90-86.
	   The Jazz threw away the ensuing inbounds pass _ their 20th
turnover of the night _ and Jordan made a free throw with 14.5
seconds left.
	   All the Jazz could do after that was heave up a pair of
3-pointers, and they wouldn't have done much good even if they went
in. A tip-in by Morris made it 91-88 with 3.7 seconds left, and
Jordan finished the scoring from the line with 1.7 left.
	   The crowd had already started filing out, and the elation this
city felt after the Jazz's overtime victory in Game 1 had
evaporated.
	   Jordan shot 14-for-33 from the field and 9-for-10 from the line,
Pippen was 7-of-13 and Kukoc was 6-for-16. Dennis Rodman grabbed
nine rebounds, including five on the offensive end to help Chicago
score 19 second-chance points.
	   Hornacek had 20 points to lead the Jazz, who got only four
second-half points from Malone as he finished with 16 on 5-for-16
shooting. In Game 1 he was 9-for-25, scoring 21 points.
	   Malone had four turnovers and Stockton, Hornacek, Bryon Russell
and Howard Eisley had three each.
	   Utah went 7-for-13 on 3-pointers after going 0-for-8 in Game 1,
but the sharp shooting was negated by the sloppiness the Jazz
showed throughout the game.
	   In the first quarter, Kukoc was 4-for-6, Jordan was 4-for-8 and
Pippen 3-for-6 as the three scored all 23 of Chicago's points. The
quarter ended with the Bulls ahead 23-20.
	   The Bulls' bench started contributing in the second quarter,
with 3-pointers by Scott Burrell and Kerr _ along with one by Kukoc
_ helping Chicago open a 46-39 lead with 2 1/2 minutes left.
	   The calls and non-calls really started going Chicago's way over
the rest of the half. Jordan drew a chippy touch foul, then knocked
Hornacek over as he backed his way in. No call was made as Hornacek
fell on his back, but the whistle blew after Hornacek knocked the
ball out of Jordan's hands.
	   Replays showed a clean steal, and the crowd was livid as Jordan
sank two free throws. They got even more steamed on Utah's next
trip downcourt when Malone fell hard to the floor and nothing was
called.
	   When the first half ended with Chicago ahead 50-46, the refs
were the target of even more abuse as they walked to their locker
room.

North Korea gearing up for first parliamentary election in eight years 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ North Korea is establishing election
committees throughout the isolated communist state for its first
parliamentary election in eight years, the official news media
reported Saturday.
	   The election, slated for July 26, will choose deputies to the
Supreme People's Assembly, the North's rubber-stamp legislature,
whose major mission will likely be to elect leader Kim Jong Il as
president.
	   The 1994 death of Kim's father, longtime President Kim Il Sung,
left North Korea a headless state. The junior Kim, 56, has been in
firm control but has yet to become president.
	   ``Preparations for the election of deputies to the 10th Supreme
People's Assembly of (North Korea) are briskly going on in all
parts of the country,'' the North's official Korean Central News
Agency said.
	   Kim Jong Il currently leads North Korea as the supreme military
commander and general secretary of the ruling Workers' Party.
	   North Korea elected 687 deputies to its single chamber
parliament in 1990. A new election at the end of their four-year
term was canceled because of Kim Il Sung's death in 1994.
	   North Korea has since been operating without a legislative body.
	   In May, the North announced it will hold the new election on
July 26.

	   At Anaheim, California, Jason Dickson pitched 7 1-3 shutout
innings as the Angels, hit by suspensions earlier in the day, won
their sixth in a row.
	   Dickson (5-4), who had been relegated to the bullpen after a
shaky start this season, limited the Rockies to five singles,
walked three and struck out two. Cecil Fielder hit a pair of solo
homers and Gary DiSarcina had three hits, including an RBI double
that snapped a scoreless tie in the third.
 &UR; Mariners 4, Dodgers 0 &QC; 
	   In Seattle, Bill Swift and two relievers combined on a nine-hit
shutout as the Mariners snapped a four-game losing streak.
	   Swift (5-3) left with the bases loaded and one out in the
seventh, but Mike Timlin got out of the jam by striking out Jose
Vizcaino and getting Gary Sheffield to ground out. Heathcliff
Slocumb pitched the ninth.

Don't depend on foreign experts to sort out Malaysia's economic problems: Mahathir 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on
Saturday once again exhorted Malaysians not to rely on foreign
experts to solve their country's economic ills.
	   Countries that have turned to outside advice have all
experienced economic turmoil, the outspoken leader said in a speech
at the National Palace to celebrate the birthday of Malaysia's
king.
	   Their reliance on foreign expertise only brought these countries
political instability, massive unemployment, surging bankruptcies
and escalating inflation, he warned.
	   Mahathir said all this could happen in Malaysia if more pressure
was imposed on the ringgit and the local stock exchange. But he
said the government had taken several measures to revive the
nation's economy.
	   He said the people's faith and confidence in the government were
vital because not all the government's measures could be publicly
announced.
	   Steps to support the ringgit include reducing imports and
encouraging prudent spending, he said.
	   Touching on recovery, he said it would not come easy, but he was
confident that reducing the country's dependence on foreign
exchange ``we will somewhat escape the threats of attacks on our
currency and the nation's economy'' he said.
	   He said the Malaysia would use the ringgit and other local
currencies in its trade with other countries.

Singapore survey says foreign workers welcomed by most 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Three-fourths of Singaporeans in a survey
supported the government's moves to welcome more skilled foreign
workers, a major newspaper reported Saturday.
	   Those in their 20s were most enthusiastic, and people in their
40s the most worried, according to the survey of 505 people by The
Straits Times. No margin of error was given.
	   The paper said that those who supported the government feel
foreigners bring economic benefits to the island nation of 3.1
million and make it more exciting.
	   The minority who oppose the plans told the surveyors they felt
foreigners bring economic and social problems.
	   Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong announced the policy last August,
saying Singapore needs foreign talent at all levels of the economy
because of the small local talent pool.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Two police lieutenants accused in the
killing of four student protesters were arraigned in a military
court Saturday in what defense lawyers said was a hasty, misguided
attempt to satisfy public clamor for reform.
	   The May 12 shootings at Trisakti University in the capital,
Jakarta, sparked several days of deadly rioting that helped oust
former President Suharto, who had been facing growing challenges to
his rule amid the worst economic crisis in decades.
	   The two officers are among 18 policemen who face courts-martial
as the military responds to demands for accountability and
democracy under Indonesia's new president, B.J. Habibie.
	   In opening remarks, military prosecutor Col. Hadi Purnomo said
the two defendants caused the deaths of the students because they
had been undisciplined and unable to control their troops during
the rally against Suharto.
	   First Lt. Agus Tri Heryanto and Second Lt. Pariyo, who were
charged with disobeying orders and flouting proper procedures, are
likely to face dismissal and jail time if found guilty. The case
was adjourned until Tuesday.
	   Outside the courthouse, students from the university where the
victims were slain held up banners that read, ``Put the masterminds
of the killings on trial'' and ``Hey general, why are the
defendants just low-ranking officers?''
	   Some critics speculate that the students were gunned down on
orders from top military brass, possibly in an attempt to snuff out
near-daily student protests that were growing in size and
intensity.
	   ``The two defendants are people who have been sacrificed,''
defense lawyer Buyung Nasution told a packed courtroom. ``It is
possible they are not the real killers.''
	   Another defense lawyer, police Lt. Col. Suseno, said the
prosecutor accused his clients ``in order to make the students or
the people in this era of reform satisfied.''
	   The two uniformed officers sat impassively before a military
judge. Fellow officers on the benches periodically applauded
remarks by the defense attorney. Students outside listened to
loudspeakers.

Singapore to test U.S., Japanese, European digital TV 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The competing digital television systems of
Japan, the United States and Europe will be tested in Singapore
this year, and officials will decide which to adopt within a year ,
officials were quoted Saturday as saying.
	   The three standards for the new high-definition television were
demonstrated for the first time together at the BroadcastAsia '98
trade show in Singapore during the past week.
	   ``None of the three standards has been perfected. Each has its
own shortcomings and price tag,'' Yatiman Yusof, a member of
parliament who oversees information and the arts, told The Straits
Times after watching a demonstration of the three systems.
	   The paper quoted Lim Hock Chuan, chief executive officer of the
Singapore Broadcasting Authority, as saying the government expects
to pick one of the systems within a year.
	   No Southeast Asian nation has decided on a digital system.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ President Kim Dae-jung embarked
Saturday on a nine-day trip to the United States, where he will
seek more economic assistance and propose a new policy of
engagement toward North Korea.
	   Kim has said his talks with President Clinton in Washington on
June 9 will focus on international assistance to help rebuild South
Korea's battered economy and ways to lead communist North Korea to
peace talks with rival South Korea.
	   In the United States, Kim, a longtime opposition leader, will
receive a human rights award. He will also speak at Stanford and
Georgetown universities and meet with Secretary of Treasury Robert
Rubin as well as International Monetary Fund and World Bank
officials.
	   South Korea's economy was bailed out by the IMF in December.
	   Kim has focused his first 100 days in office on restructuring
the economy to woo back foreign investors whose flight aggravated
the country's financial turmoil late last year.

Scots beat New South Wales 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Scotland continued its buildup for two
tests against Australia by beating an under strength New South
Wales team 34-10 at the Sydney Football Stadium on Saturday.
	   The Waratahs were missing their top players _ in action for
Australia in Saturday's test against England in Brisbane _ and were
hit hard early in the match.
	   The Scots, well led by veteran back Gregor Townsend and captain
Rob Wainwright played a tougher match than against New South Wales
Country midweek. Former Wallaby scrum half Steve Merrick described
the tourists as soft after that match.
	   Scotland started with a blaze of scoring Saturday, running in
three tries to take a 21-0 lead after just 16 minutes.
	   No. 8 Eric Peters and lock Stuart Grimes set up the first for
winger Shaun Longstaff after eight minutes. Four minutes later the
Scots grabbed a second when fly-half Townsend broke through the
defense and sent fullback Glenn Metcalfe over.
	   Townsend also engineered the third try, combining with Metcalfe
and Longstaff to put lock Scott Murray across the line.
	   Shell-shocked New South Wales recovered briefly as former
Springbok No.8 Tiaan Strauss and center Jason Jones-Hughes set up
Matt Dowling for a 65-meter dash to the try line.
	   Scotland led 21-5 at half-time and won comfortably in the end.
	   ``It's a big confidence boost for us,'' Townsend said. ``We had
a slow start to the tour but we're slowly building.''
	   Townsend said the Scottish scrum was the best he has seen it all
season while the attack was also impressive.
	   Scorers:
	   Scotland 34 (Shaun Longstaff, Glenn Metcalfe, Scott Murray,
Craig Joiner tries; Rowen Shepherd 4 goals, 2 penalty goals) def.
New South Wales 10 (Matt Williams, Brendan Williams tries).

Philippine Airlines fires officers of pilots' union

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine Airlines on Saturday fired
the 29 officers of its striking pilots' union and told other
members to return to work by the next day or face dismissal.
	   In a statement, the airlines said it sent a letter to the
officers of the Airline Pilots Association of the Philippines
telling them, ``you have lost your employment status with PAL,
effective today, for having organized, staged, led and knowingly
participated in an illegal act.''
	   The airline also ordered the rest of the 620-member union to
report for work by Sunday or face dismissal. The union went on
strike Friday to protest an early retirement policy.
	   The airline cited two orders by the Department of Labor and
Employment prohibiting the union from ``aggravating the situation''
at the struggling airline.
	   There was no immediate comments from the union.
	   A meeting by representatives of the union, management and the
labor department was held Saturday morning, but officials gave no
immediate word on the outcome of the talks.
	   On Friday, union spokesman Florendo Umali said it was striking
to protest a new policy of early retirements for pilots who have
reached 20 years of service or flown 20,000 hours, regardless of
age.
	   This policy puts about 200 pilots in danger of being
``retired,'' he said.
	   Over the past four years, the airline has incurred annual losses
ranging from 451.4 million pesos (dlrs 11.3 million) to 2.5 billion
pesos (dlrs 62.5 million), in part because of large debts, an aging
fleet and Asia's currency crisis.
	   The airline says it faces an ``uncertain future,'' and announced
plans earlier this year to cut expenses by as much as 40 percent by
slashing flights and sharply reducing its work force. The airline
hasn't disclosed an estimate for its manpower reduction, but
employees fear it could be as much as 30 percent.
	   The strike canceled all Philippine Airlines international
flights except one to Hong Kong Saturday afternoon. The airline
operated only 13 domestic flights out of Manila, stranding hundreds
of passengers.
	   More than 500 passengers were stranded at the Kai Tak airport in
Hong Kong early Saturday as two fully-booked flights for Manila and
central Cebu City were canceled.
	   The airline said it would refund tickets paid in cash and send
international passengers to other airlines.

ASMARA: been hit.

<TEXT>
	   There were no immediate report of injuries. The airport had been
closed to civilians since Friday.
	   In the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, the Foreign Ministry said
the bombing Friday was in retaliation for an Eritrean attack on
Mekele, 200 kilometers (125 miles) north of Addis.
	   At least 44 Ethiopians were killed and wounded 135 in the attack
on Melele Friday, Radio FANA, run by the ruling party, reported
Saturday.
	   Eritrea and Ethiopia are at odds over a border region that is
claimed by both sides.
	   Ethiopian MiG-23s bombed two hangars Friday at an air base
outside Asmara next to the international airport. A commercial
airliner on the tarmac was reported damaged. Eritrean guns then
shot down the two jets.
	   Witnesses saw several injured people being transported in
trucks, but it was not immediately possible to determine the number
of casualties or the fate of the Ethiopian pilots.
	   The escalating conflict prompted the State Department to order
nonessential staff out of Eritrea and urge other Americans to
leave. A plane flew out Friday with 122 Americans and 70 other
foreigners, mostly Britons and Canadians, the State Department
said. Peace Corp volunteers also were evacuated.
	   Evacuation flights were being planned for Saturday by Britain,
the United Nations and the European Union.

	   Ethiopian sources said fighting continued for a third day Friday
around the border town of Zala Ambassa, about 100 kilometers (60
miles) north of Mekele, where both sides traded tank, artillery and
mortar fire. Ethiopian fighters attacked Eritrean tanks that were
moving toward Adigrat, about 20 kilometers (10 miles) west.
	   Both nations _ two of the world's poorest _ used aircraft, tanks
and artillery supplied to Ethiopia by the Soviet Union during the
Cold War.
	   The attacks came a day after Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles
Zenawi agreed to a proposal put forth by the United States and
Rwanda to end the two countries' border conflict peacefully.
	   But Meles warned that his country's patience with Eritrea was
wearing thin because of Eritrea's refusal to withdraw from
territory Ethiopia claims it occupied a month ago.
	   The Eritrean government issued a statement Friday saying there
were ``still serious issues of detail and implementation to be
worked out'' with the proposal.
	   Jubilant Eritreans poured into the streets of Asmara waving the
blue, green and red flags of their young nation after the Ethiopian
fighters were shot down.
	   The State Department urged Ethiopia and Eritrea to cease all
hostilities while outside envoys seek a peaceful resolution of the
dispute.
	   At the United Nations in New York, the Security Council on
Friday called for an immediate cease-fire and Secretary-General
Kofi Annan appealed to both sides to ``give diplomacy a chance.''
	   ``The Security Council deplored this escalation and called for
an immediate cease-fire'' and ``urged Eritrea and Ethiopia to
affirm their commitment to resolve the dispute peacefully,''
council President Antonio Monteiro of Portugal said.
	   One of the recommendations of the U.S.-Rwandan proposal was that
Eritrea withdraw to positions held before May 6.
	   Eritrea, which gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993, has
always claimed it remains inside its own territory as determined by
Italian colonial boundaries.
	   Eritrean rebels under the command of President Isaias Afwerki
were instrumental in helping Meles' Ethiopian People's
Revolutionary Democratic Front overthrow a 17-year military regime
in July 1991.

North Korea gearing up for first parliamentary election in eight years

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ North Korea is establishing election
committees throughout the isolated communist state for its first
parliamentary election in eight years, the official news media
reported Saturday.
	   The election, slated for July 26, will choose deputies to the
Supreme People's Assembly, the North's rubber-stamp legislature,
whose major mission will likely be to elect leader Kim Jong Il as
president.
	   The 1994 death of Kim's father, longtime President Kim Il Sung,
left North Korea a headless state. The junior Kim, 56, has been in
firm control but has yet to become president.
	   ``Preparations for the election of deputies to the 10th Supreme
People's Assembly of (North Korea) are briskly going on in all
parts of the country,'' the North's official Korean Central News
Agency said.
	   Kim Jong Il currently leads North Korea as the supreme military
commander and general secretary of the ruling Workers' Party.
	   North Korea elected 687 deputies to its single chamber
parliament in 1990. A new election at the end of their four-year
term was canceled because of Kim Il Sung's death in 1994.
	   North Korea has since been operating without a legislative body.
	   In May, the North announced it will hold the new election on
July 26.
	   North Korea reported near 100 percent voter turnouts in all its
nine previous parliamentary elections. Usually, a candidate
recommended by the regional communist party runs alone in each
voting district and wins the polls with near 100 percent support,
experts on North Korea said.

	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Ethiopian warplanes bombed a military and
an international airport outside Asmara Saturday, escalating the
border dispute between the two East African nations.
	   The civilian airport was struck by several bombs, setting off
bursts of flames as expatriates were trying to leave the capital.
	   It was the second day in a row the military air base was hit by
Ethiopian warplanes. Anti-aircraft guns fired on the two Mig-23s,
but neither appeared to have been hit.
	   There were no immediate report of injuries. The airport had been
closed to civilians since Friday.
	   In the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, the Foreign Ministry said
the bombing Friday was in retaliation for an Eritrean attack on
Mekele, 200 kilometers (125 miles) north of Addis.
	   At least 44 Ethiopians were killed and wounded 135 in the attack
on Melele Friday, Radio FANA, run by the ruling party, reported
Saturday.
	   Eritrea and Ethiopia are at odds over a border region that is
claimed by both sides.
	   On Friday, Ethiopian MiG-23s bombed two hangars the air base
outside Asmara next to the international airport. A commercial
airliner on the tarmac was reported damaged. Eritrean guns then
shot down the two jets.
	   Witnesses saw several injured people being transported in
trucks, but it was not immediately possible to determine the number
of casualties or the fate of the Ethiopian pilots.
	   The escalating conflict prompted the State Department to order
nonessential staff out of Eritrea and urge other Americans to
leave. A plane flew out Friday with 122 Americans and 70 other
foreigners, mostly Britons and Canadians, the State Department
said. Peace Corp volunteers also were evacuated.
	   Evacuation flights were being planned for Saturday by Britain,
the United Nations and the European Union.
	   Ethiopian sources said fighting continued for a third day Friday
around the border town of Zala Ambassa, about 100 kilometers (60
miles) north of Mekele, where both sides traded tank, artillery and
mortar fire. Ethiopian fighters attacked Eritrean tanks that were
moving toward Adigrat, about 20 kilometers (10 miles) west.
	   Both nations _ two of the world's poorest _ used aircraft, tanks
and artillery supplied to Ethiopia by the Soviet Union during the
Cold War.
	   The attacks came a day after Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles
Zenawi agreed to a proposal put forth by the United States and
Rwanda to end the two countries' border conflict peacefully.
	   But Meles warned that his country's patience with Eritrea was
wearing thin because of Eritrea's refusal to withdraw from
territory Ethiopia claims it occupied a month ago.
	   The Eritrean government issued a statement Friday saying there
were ``still serious issues of detail and implementation to be
worked out'' with the proposal.
	   Jubilant Eritreans poured into the streets of Asmara waving the
blue, green and red flags of their young nation after the Ethiopian
fighters were shot down.
	   The State Department urged Ethiopia and Eritrea to cease all
hostilities while outside envoys seek a peaceful resolution of the
dispute.
	   At the United Nations in New York, the Security Council on
Friday called for an immediate cease-fire and Secretary-General
Kofi Annan appealed to both sides to ``give diplomacy a chance.''
	   ``The Security Council deplored this escalation and called for
an immediate cease-fire'' and ``urged Eritrea and Ethiopia to
affirm their commitment to resolve the dispute peacefully,''
council President Antonio Monteiro of Portugal said.
	   One of the recommendations of the U.S.-Rwandan proposal was that
Eritrea withdraw to positions held before May 6.
	   Eritrea, which gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993, has
always claimed it remains inside its own territory as determined by
Italian colonial boundaries.
	   Eritrean rebels under the command of President Isaias Afwerki
were instrumental in helping Meles' Ethiopian People's
Revolutionary Democratic Front overthrow a 17-year military regime
in July 1991.

Business, environmentalists argue merits of genetically altered food 
</HEADLINE>
By GEIR MOULSON
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Switzerland, the pure Alpine wonderland, is pitted
against Switzerland, the high-tech research lab, in a referendum
Sunday on whether to ban genetically altered plants and animals.
	   Passions are running strong over the vote, even though Swiss
tend to troop to the polls at least three times a year to settle
big national issues.
	   At stake could be Switzerland's position as a leader in
biotechnology: Pharmaceutical companies and the government say a
ban would put a clamp on research, sending high-paying jobs to
other countries.
	   Environmentalists and consumer activists who support the ban are
sweetening their appeals to voters by tucking an irresistible
national symbol of purity _ Swiss chocolates _ into mailings.
	   The opposition's literature isn't nearly so enticing, but the
Nobel prize winners and researchers trying to kill the ban hope it
will scare up ``No'' votes. A bald woman is shown in a hospital bed
in an ad warning that the ban could end crucial research into cures
for cancer or Alzheimer's disease. ``Don't strangle medical
progress!'' another ad admonishes.
	   Opponents of the ban, who have been demonstrating by the
thousands in Zurich, Geneva and Lugano, also say it could end
research into creating plants that require less fertilizer and
pesticides.
	   The proposal, backed by 60 consumer and environmental groups
including the World Wildlife Fund and Greenpeace, would ban the
patenting, production, sale and acquisition of genetically modified
animals. Field tests and patenting of genetically altered plants
also would be outlawed.
	   The ``Yes'' campaign doesn't, of course, depend solely on
bonbons.
	   Supporters of the ban try to frighten consumers, too, arguing
that too little is known about the consequences of letting
genetically modified organisms into the food chain.
	   A close vote was expected Sunday, with polls giving mixed
indications of which side was leading.
	   Economics Minister Pascal Couchepin has warned that approval of
the ballot initiative would cause biotechnology to ``come to a
standstill here, and both research and its industrial application
will go abroad.''
	   Novartis and Roche, both based in Basel, rank with St.
Louis-based Monsanto Co. among world leaders in the pharmaceutical
field.
	   Bruce Lehman, U.S. commissioner for patents and trademarks, said
during a visit to Geneva this spring that stricter Swiss laws could
further benefit the United States, where many European companies
already conduct much of their research because regulations are less
strict.
	   Thomas Cueni, secretary-general of the pharmaceutical industry
association Interpharma, disagrees. Academic research would suffer
more, he says, because of the ban on genetically modifying animals.
	   ``It's highly unlikely that (the initiative) will have an impact
on what companies are doing outside Switzerland,'' Cueni said
Wednesday.
	   The ballot initiative, launched in 1993 with more than 110,000
signatories, comes up almost six months after the government began
allowing imports of a genetically modified corn.
	   But Swiss regulators so far have refused to allow Swiss farmers
to grow the corn, which was developed by Novartis, saying no one
knows what will happen when the corn hits the natural world. The
corn can be used in other products, if they are labeled as
genetically modified.
	   Many U.S. farmers already use corn, soybean and potato seeds
genetically altered to be more pest resistant. Researchers in the
United States also are looking into ways to genetically create, for
example, a low-fat soybean or a leaner cut of beef.
	   American entertainers and activists have, however, been urging
the Agriculture Department not to allow genetically altered foods
to be labeled organic.

Buddhist monk charged with murder in Russian roulette killing 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A Buddhist monk has been charged with
murder and two others were defrocked after a man died while they
were playing Russian roulette with a pistol.
	   The death is the latest in a series of scandals ranging from
corruption to rape and murder involving the normally revered clergy
in this overwhelmingly Buddhist country.
	   The monks and a layman were playing the game Thursday, in which
they took turns pointing a revolver loaded with a single bullet at
each other's heads and pulled the trigger, newspapers reported
Saturday.
	   The gun finally went off and killed the layman, Ritthirong
Khachawitee, who had apparently had brought the gun to the Wat Wang
Sala temple in the eastern town of Kanchanaburi and invited the
monks, whom he knew, to play with it.
	   Police charged Samart Phakphum, the temple's vice abbot, with
murder Friday. He was defrocked, as were the two others.
	   Police were quoted by The Nation newspaper as saying there had
been no previous reports about the monks misbehaving and they had
not been drinking when they started the game.
	   In traditional Russian roulette, a player points a partially
loaded gun at his own head and pulls the trigger.

Singapore Airlines running gambling flights 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore Airlines has quietly begun providing
blackjack, poker and jackpot games to passengers on flights to
Tokyo, Taiwan and Hong Kong, a newspaper reported Saturday.
	   The first gambling flight, which the airline prefers to call
``gaming,'' was a June 1 trip to Tokyo in a Boeing 747-400 Megatop,
The Business Times reported Saturday.
	   Passengers can place bets from 25 U.S. cents to dlrs 3 by
swiping their credit cards through a machine. Wins, limited to dlrs
3,500, are credited to the cards.
	   The airline said last year it would introduce the credit-card
gambling, but it made no announcement when the project actually
began. It is the third airline in the world, following Swissair and
Lauda Air, to offer in-flight gambling.
	   Over the next two years, the games will be installed in all
Singapore Airlines aircraft that have personal entertainment
systems.

Raids prompted by bombings, blasts yield 196 tons of explosives 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Police inspections prompted by a spate of
bombings have yielded some 196 tons of explosives and other
contraband and led to the closing of hundreds of factories and
shops, the state-run newspaper China Daily reported Saturday.
	   The nationwide crackdown on explosives that began at the end of
March was the result of a sharp rise in criminal and accidental
explosions across the country, the report said.
	   It said that 721 people were killed and 905 injured in some 466
explosions last year.
	   The problem was most severe in the mining and construction
industries, where safety standards are often ignored in the
transport, storage and use of explosives, the report added.
	   ``Management of explosives within these operations was slack and
many explosives slipped into the wrong hands,'' it said.
	   The report said that 577 explosives makers and 1,202 shops
selling explosives had been closed down, and 1,272 lawbreakers
punished after an inspection of some 17,000 places involved in the
explosives business.
	   In addition to explosives, police also confiscated 310,000
detonators and 300,000 meters (990,000 feet) of blasting fuses.
	   Police said an explosion in February on a public bus in the
central city of Wuhan that killed 16 people and injured 45 others
was caused by a homemade bomb.
	   Three people were arrested for planting a car bomb that exploded
on May 10, killing a bank executive, according to state media
reports.

Chinese authorities execute man for armed robbery 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Authorities in the southern province of Guangdong
have executed a man convicted of stealing 300,000 yuan from a taxi
passenger and severely injuring a soldier while trying to escape,
the state-run Liberation Army Daily reported Saturday.
	   The Shaoguan Intermediate People's Court sentenced Zhong
Wangxing to death at a public rally on Friday and fined him 20,000
yuan (dlrs 2,421) for the Dec. 13 robbery, the report said.
	   It said the execution was conducted shortly after sentencing.
	   According to the report, Zhong used a cleaver to force his way
into a taxi and to seize the money. A female soldier who attempted
to capture him suffered serious injuries and hearing loss after
Zhong slashed her with the knife.
	   Six other people from Zhong's village who attempted to help him
escape were being tried separately, the report added.

Two Thai undercover officers released by drug dealers 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MAE SOT, Thailand (AP) _ A gang of drug traffickers who took two
undercover narcotics officers hostage released their captives and
fled Saturday as more than 100 police were closing in on them.
	   A police spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
that the five hostage-takers and three other gang members tried to
flee the hilly area and that two had been arrested.
	   The rest were on the run in the rugged terrain around Mae Sot,
370 kilometers (230 miles) northwest of Bangkok. The freed officers
were flown to the capital for debriefing.
	   The officers were unmasked as undercover men Thursday while
posing as buyers in an amphetamine deal. They were beaten by their
captors, who demanded 3 million baht (dlrs 75,000) for their
release.

Privatization of Thai Airways faces hurdles 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The privatization of state-owned Thai
Airways International still faces problems though the Cabinet is
expected to back a share sale next week.
	   Thai newspapers reported Saturday that the Finance Ministry is
being challenged by other government agencies over how many shares
should be offered to the carrier's foreign airline partners
compared to non-airline Thai investors.
	   The partial privatization of Thai Airways is a condition set by
the International Monetary Fund for the dlrs 17.2 billion bailout
it has arranged for Thailand's troubled economy.
	   Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai's Cabinet is expected to approve a
privatization plan Tuesday, but disputes have arisen over ministry
plans to reduce the government's stake to under 70 percent, the
minimum required under a 1954 law.
	   The plan would cut the government's stake from 97 percent to 68
percent, offering 380 million shares to Thai's partners in the Star
Alliance _ United, Lufthansa, Air Canada, SAS and Varig.
	   Transport, budget and airline officials want the 70 percent
minimum retained and object to ministry plans to limit the
offering, saying it will cheapen the share price.
	   Some shares should be offered to financial institutions as well
as Thai and foreign investors and airline employees, they said.
	   The Cabinet is also to rule on a proposed rehabilitation plan
under which the airline will switch its strategy toward European
and North American markets, away from crisis-stricken Asia.
	   The airline is also required to slash 11.9 billion baht (dlrs
297 million) from expenditures from the fiscal year ending Sept.
30.

China says site of fatal boat attack now safe for tourists 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ The government has launched a publicity campaign
intended to encourage tourists to visit a lake that was the site of
a 1994 attack that killed 32, including tourists from Taiwan.
	   In the past four years, the local government at Qiandao Lake has
set up a satellite telecommunications network, equipped tour boats
with alarm systems and telephones and assigned police to regular
patrols to prevent any further incidents, the newspaper China Daily
reported Saturday.
	   Any tourist who encounters trouble can dial ``110'' and a police
official will travel to his aid by motorboat within 10 minutes, the
report said.
	   Tourism around the lake dropped sharply after the March 31,
1994, attack said to have been staged by robbers who set fire to a
tour boat, killing its crew and passengers.
	   Qiandao, a man-made reservoir built in 1960 about 250 kilometers
southwest of Shanghai, is a popular sightseeing location because of
the 1,078 scenic islands that dot its clear waters, the report
added.

Paramilitary to guard Bangladesh power stations during World Cup 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   DHAKA , Bangladesh (AP) _ Paramilitary forces will guard
Bangladeshi power stations during the World Cup to save them from
possible attacks by soccer-crazy television viewers angry at power
cuts, a senior official said Saturday.
	   Soldiers and police will take positions around all major power
stations 12 hours before the inauguration of the World Cup in
France on June 10, Nuruddin Mohammad Kamal, chairman of the
state-owned Power Development Board told reporters.
	   Soccer is the national game of Bangladesh, though its team did
not find place among the qualifiers for the World Cup.
	   Bangladesh, which needs over 2100 Megawatts of electricity each
year, generates only 1,700 Megawatts.
	   Major cities like Dhaka, Chittagong, Khulna and Rajshahi face
regular power outage and citizens have often taken to the streets
in violent demonstrations at power stations.

Chinese bishop arrested; government takes passport of 96-year-old cardinal 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A bishop in the underground Roman Catholic church
has been arrested, according to a U.S.-based advocacy group for the
underground church.
	   Bishop Zhang Weizhu of Xianxian, in Hebei province near Beijing,
was detained on May 31, Pentacost Sunday, while traveling to his
village, Joseph Kung, director of the Cardinal Kung Foundation,
said in a statement received Saturday in Beijing.
	   It said no other details were available about Zhang's arrest.
	   Meanwhile, the group said the Chinese government had refused to
renew the passport of its namesake, 96-year-old Cardinal Ignatius
Kung Pin-mei.
	   Cardinal Kung, the bishop of Shanghai, was imprisoned in China
for more than 32 years and now lives in exile in the United States.
	   The cardinal recently submitted his passport to the Chinese
Consulate in New York, seeking to have it renewed. But the
consulate refused. It confiscated the document, leaving Kung
stateless, Joseph Kung said.
	   Official comment was not immediately available because
government offices were closed for the weekend.
	   The underground Roman Catholic church remains loyal to the
Vatican and rejects the state-approved Catholic church, autonomous
from Rome, that was set up by the government in the 1950s.
	   Like Cardinal Kung, many clerics of the underground church have
been imprisoned for refusing to participate in the official
Catholic church.

Thousands call for self-determination in East Timor capital 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ With political freedom flowering in the
rest of Indonesia, several thousand people gathered Saturday at a
forum in East Timor and called for a referendum on independence for
the former Portuguese colony.
	   Participants at the meeting in the local government office in
Dili, capital of disputed East Timor, also urged the release of
jailed rebel chief Xanana Gusmao.
	   Bowing to demands for democratic reform, the Indonesian
government has launched the phased release of political prisoners,
but the fate of Gusmao remains uncertain.
	   On Monday, authorities released four East Timorese activists who
had been jailed in September on charges of possessing bomb-making
materials.
	   Chances of a referendum on independence are remote, for now.
While new President B.J. Habibie has pledged to lead Indonesia
toward democracy, he has said that East Timor will remain part of
Indonesia.
	   Habibie took over from his autocratic mentor and predecessor,
Suharto, who quit May 21 amid Indonesia's worst economic and
political turmoil since the former army general rose to power in
the 1960s.
	   Suharto engineered Indonesia's invasion of East Timor in 1975
and declared the territory a province a year later. A small band of
separatist guerrillas continues to fight and the United Nations
does not recognize Indonesian authority there.
	   At the forum in Dili, Gov. Abilio Soares suggested that the
territory be made a special district with some autonomy, but the
vast majority of participants rejected his view, saying
self-determination was the best path.

Seventeen plundered Italian works identified in Germany 
</HEADLINE>
By DANIEL J. WAKIN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Three years after Italy published and distributed a
catalog in an effort to find 1,500 works plundered by the Nazis or
lost in war, the first fruits have arrived.
	   The German government has acknowledged that 17 works reside in
its museums, including pieces purchased for Adolf Hitler and
Hermann Goering, the Italian diplomat in charge of the recuperation
effort said Friday.
	   Now, Italy must rely on the kindness of curators to get them
back.
	   Most of the identified statues and paintings were bought by
German agents or given as gifts. In most cases, trying to force
their return would be unproductive, said Mario Bondioli Osio, head
of a joint committee from the foreign and culture ministries.
	   ``We will rely on the professional correctness and sense of
honesty,'' of the curators, he said.
	   ``It is not a question of life and death to get them back. (The
Germans) are relaxed, perhaps a bit too much, and we are relaxed,
perhaps a bit too much.''
	   He said he is waiting to hear from the foreign ministry in
Germany to set up a meeting _ a contact that could pave the way to
discuss the matters with curators.
	   The identified works include the ``Portrait of Pier Maria
Rossi'' by the 16th century painter Parmigianino, which was sold to
Hitler's agents, and a 2nd century statue of Venus that Italo
Balbo, the Fascist aviation minister, gave Goering in 1940.
	   A German edition of the catalog, the result of more than 20
years of research, was distributed to more than 700 museums. The 17
works were identified by German curators in Hanover, Berlin,
Wurzburg and elsewhere.
	   Still missing is the sculpted mask of a faun by Michelangelo,
stolen from a castle near Arezzo in Tuscany by German troops and
art by Sandro Botticelli, Hans Holbein and Rembrandt.
	   Despite the few identifications so far, Bondioli Osio said he
was ``optimistic, but not enthusiastic'' that more will come to
light. Many on the list probably have been destroyed, he said.
Others may be in private hands.
	   Italy has a right to the pieces in Germany because they left the
country without export licenses, the diplomat said. He also cited
the Allies' London Declaration of 1943, which deemed null and void
all art acquisitions by the Nazis.
	   It's debatable, though, how much the Italians would want at
least one of the pieces, a statue of a male torso dated to the 2nd
century.
	   Bondioli Osio said it is a 20th century reproduction. He also
said the Parmigianino may not be an original.

	   ESCHEDE, Germany (AP) _ Dogs sniffed at the side of the
wreckage, locating the spot. With shovels, the rescuers prodded the
sandy dirt with slow gentle care until they uncovered it _ the 93rd
body in three days.
	   That was noon on Friday. By Saturday morning, rescuers found
three additional bodies, coming close to the end of their their
search for victims of Wednesday's high-speed train crash, the
deadliest rail disaster in Germany since World War II.
	   The latest discoveries brought the death toll to 101, including
five who died in hospitals.
	   Police expected to finish clearing the site of bodies on
Saturday, although heavy rains overnight slowed the work.
	   While doctors working round the clock will continue to identify
the victims over the weekend, the rescuers _ soldiers, firefighters
and Red Cross volunteers _ should get some needed rest. But rest
will also bring reflection, time to consider the grim impact of
what they've been doing.
	   ``I've never had to deal with so many dead people,'' said Dirk
Winkler, a 25-year-old soldier whose tank battalion has been using
its vehicles to pull back the wreckage of InterCity Express 884.
	   By Friday, investigators had identified a likely cause of the
disaster: A wheel broke on the first passenger car. Two minutes
later, the derailed train started breaking apart and crashed into
supports of an overpass.
	   After recalling for inspections all the ICE trains of the type
that crashed, the German Rail company ordered trains returning to
circulation to run slower _ top speed of 160 kilometers (100 miles)
per hour, rather than the usual maximum 280 kilometers (175 miles).
	   Transportation Minister Matthias Wissmann rejected a long-term
speed limit for the trains. The daily Neuen Osnabrucker Zeitung
quoted him Saturday as saying that the trains and tracks had been
designed for the higher speeds.
	   But Wissman said in an interview with Focus magazine that the
ministry and the Deutsche Bahn railroad were considering a security
system that would warn of wheel breaks and derailments.
	   When the train hit the bridge, it was going 200 kilometers (125
miles). With a huge yellow crane, rescuers on Friday lifted the
last fragment of the collapsed bridge from the top of the smashed
train. The cable creaked from the weight.
	   All the bodies found under the wreckage were taken to a hospital
morgue in Hanover, 50 kilometers (30 miles) to the south. In teams,
doctors catalog distinguishing features _ teeth, scars, moles,
facial hair, jewelry. Then they match their records with
information from relatives. It's difficult, because so many bodies
were mangled, and by Friday only 19 victims had been identified.
	   ``We don't want any relatives to have to go from body to body.
because it's unbearable. It's arms and legs and heads. It's
awful,'' said Christian Jung, spokesman for the Hanover medical
school hospital.
	   Accounting of the victims has been difficult partly because,
unlike in an airline disaster, there are no passenger lists on
ICEs. People may buy a ticket on board, so authorities don't even
know how many passengers they're trying to account for.
	   Wissman also ruled out the introduction of passenger lists as
inpractical, according to Neuen Osnabrucker Zeitung.
	   Rescuers, like the doctors, have worked almost continuously
since arriving at the scene midday Wednesday. During a break on
Friday, they seemed both dazed and animated, pumped up from stress
and on automatic-pilot to cope with it.
	   Some described little tricks _ everyday chit-chat at the site,
silly jokes on the way home in the car. Anything to distract the
mind from what the hands have been doing, and the eyes seeing.
	   ``We have to be strong,'' said Birgit Aust, 25, a housewife,
mother of three and Red Cross volunteer.
	   ``The worst moment was when I got there and saw the bridge on
top of the train. Then I shut off. You have to suppress all that
right now. Otherwise, you can't keep going.''
	   Aust said she expected to work through the weekend, recovering
the remains of the dead and comforting the victims' relatives.
	   Next week _ when the gravity hits _ she plans to seek comfort
herself, through counseling.

Ethnic tension surfaces in Taipei's mayoral election 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Ethnic tension surfaced Saturday as two
prominent candidates prepared to begin their campaign for the
crucial Taipei mayoral election in December.
	   Former Justice Minister Ma Ying-jeou, who favors reunification
with China, has vowed not to stir up ethnic conflict since he
announced last week he will run against the incumbent
pro-independence Mayor Chen Shui-bian of the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party.
	   But at a rally early this week, Ma criticized Chen for showing
his eagerness to formally break away from China by refusing to
hoist the national flag.
	   ``If I win the race, you will see our national flag hoisted at
the city hall,'' Ma said.
	   Ma, son of a ruling Nationalist official from central Chinese
Hunan province, vehemently backs the Nationalist doctrine of
reunification with China, from where his family fled after a civil
war ended in 1949.
	   In a rebuttal, Chen's aides on Saturday criticized Ma for his
inability to speak the Taiwanese dialect.
	   ``Ma Ying-jeou speaks perfect English but can hardly speak the
Taiwanese dialect although he has lived here for more than 40
years,'' Chen's top aide Ma Yung-cheng told reporters.
	   The Democratic Progressive Party advocates formal independence
from China.
	   Mayor Chen has removed from the city hall any symbols of ties
with China and the old authoritarian era, including portraits of
Sun Yat-sen, founder of modern China, and the late Nationalist
leader Gen. Chiang Kai-shek.
	   Chen was born in Taiwan like 70 percent of Taipei's population
of 2.6 million.
	   A survey released Saturday said 35.6 percent of Taipei citizens
feared the mayoral race could trigger ethnic conflicts.
	   Another 37 percent of the respondents said they did not believe
ethnic tension would be raised. The survey of 867 Taipei citizens
conducted June 1-4 by Nationalist city councillor Chen Shueh-fen
did not give a margin of error.
	   Mayoral elections in Taipei and the southern Kaohsiung city will
be held in conjuction with legislative elections.
	   Surveys indicated the mayoral races are even.

Foreign Office advises Britons to leave Eritrea nationals 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with Britain trying to get out remaining
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain said Saturday it is having difficulty
getting a plane into Eritrea to evacuate Britons and other
foreigners who want to escape fighting in the East African nation.
	   ``Obviously this is a war zone and it proved just not possible
for safety reasons to get that plane in,'' Foreign Office Minister
Tony Lloyd told BBC Radio 4. ``We are actually seeking the
opportunity to get a plane in as quickly as we can.''
	   The Foreign Office on Friday advised about 120 British citizens
in Eritrea to leave as soon as possible because of a worsening
border conflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia.
	   ``We are working closely with our European Union partners and
the Canadians and Americans to make the necessary provision for
flights out of the capital Asmara as soon as possible,'' a Foreign
Office spokesman said, speaking with customary anonymity.
	   Forty eight Britons left Eritrea Friday night on a U.S. aircraft
which landed in Frankfurt early Saturday. The Foreign Office said
the Britons, mainly working for the non-governmental organization
Voluntary Service Overseas, then flew to London.
	   Britain is still trying to evacuate between 60 and 80 people
from Britain, the European Union and Commonwealth nations, Lloyd
said.
	   For the second day on Saturday, Ethiopian warplanes bombed
airports outside the Eritrean capital. The civilian airport was
struck by several bombs, setting off bursts of fire as foreigners
were trying to leave the country. The military airport was also
bombed.
	   Lloyd said there will be ``enormous difficulties'' evacuating
foreigners if the fighting continues.
	   ``The difficulty really comes down to the potential for attack
upon the airfield or for a plane in the area to be seen as part of
the combat. We are seeking safe passage for a plane going in,'' he
said.
	   Britain is supporting U.S. and Rwandan efforts to broker a peace
deal between the warring countries, Lloyd said.
	   ``If we can get a ceasefire, then of course it is possible to
begin the process of negotiation and arbitration to resolve the
issue. We have pushed for both sides to recognize there cannot be a
military solution to this problem. We will support the Americans
and Rwanda to broker a regional solution to this problem,'' he
said.
	   Eritrea, which gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993, has
always claimed it remains inside its own territory as determined by
Italian colonial boundaries.

<TEXT>
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Ethiopian warplanes bombed a combined
military-civilian airport Saturday outside the Eritrean capital,
escalating a border dispute between the two East African nations.
	   Several bombs struck the civilian part of the airport, setting
off fires as foreigners were trying to leave the country.
Anti-aircraft guns fired on two Ethiopian warplanes, but neither
appeared to have been hit.
	   There was no immediate report of casualties.
	   It was the second day in a row that the airport was hit by
Ethiopian bombs. On Friday, Ethiopian MiG-23s bombed two hangars at
the military air base next to the civilian airport. A commercial
airliner on the tarmac was reported damaged. Eritrean guns then
shot down the two jets.
	   Witnesses saw several injured Eritreans on Friday being
transported in trucks, but it was not immediately possible to
determine the number of casualties or the fate of the Ethiopian
pilots.
	   Jubilant Eritreans poured into the streets of Asmara waving the
blue, green and red flags of their young nation after the Ethiopian
fighters were shot down.
	   ``The cars were driving past (the Ethiopian Embassy) and honking
their horns,'' said Aaron Greenberg, 22, an American Peace Corps
volunteer who arrived early Saturday on an evacuation flight to
Frankfurt, Germany.
	   In the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, the Foreign Ministry said
Friday's bombing was in retaliation for an Eritrean attack on
Mekele, 200 kilometers (125 miles) north of Addis. At least 44
Ethiopians were killed and 135 wounded in the Mekele attack, Radio
FANA, run by the Ethiopian ruling party, reported Saturday.
	   Eritrea and Ethiopia are at odds over a border region that is
claimed by both sides. Both nations _ two of the world's poorest _
have used aircraft, tanks and artillery supplied to Ethiopia by the
Soviet Union during the Cold War.
	   The escalating conflict prompted the U.S. State Department to
order nonessential staff out of Eritrea and urge other Americans to
leave.
	   Britain, the United Nations and the European Union were planning
evacuation flights for Saturday.
	   A German military plane en route to Asmara to evacuate German,
Swiss and other European nationals was diverted to a ``neighboring
country'' because of the airport attacks, a German foreign ministry
spokesman said Saturday.
	   A flight chartered by the U.S. government left Asmara Friday
night and arrived in Frankfurt early Saturday after a refueling
stop in Cairo, Egypt.
	   The plane carried 194 evacuees, including 129 Americans, many of
them U.S. government or Peace Corps volunteers in the East African
nation, said the U.S. Consulate in Frankfurt.
	   The evacuees after landing in Frankfurt described rising tension
in Eritrea, with army reservists called up in recent weeks to
bolster forces at the disputed border with Ethiopia. But only when
they heard the blasts of bombs dropped by Ethiopian warplanes
Friday did the evacuees feel any fear.
	   ``We heard the sound of planes, and the bombs going,'' said
evacuee Barbara Kelly, who worked with her husband, Mike, as a
teacher for Britain's Volunteer Service Overseas charity.
	   Ethiopian sources said fighting continued Friday for a third day
around the border town of Zala Ambassa, about 100 kilometers (60
miles) north of Mekele, where both sides traded tank, artillery and
mortar fire. Ethiopian fighters attacked Eritrean tanks that were
moving toward Adigrat, about 20 kilometers (10 miles) west.
	   The attacks came a day after Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles
Zenawi agreed to a U.S. and Rwandan proposal to end the border
conflict peacefully.
	   But Meles warned that his country's patience was wearing thin
because of Eritrea's refusal to withdraw from territory Ethiopia
claims it occupied a month ago.
	   The Eritrean government issued a statement Friday saying there
were ``still serious issues of detail and implementation to be
worked out'' with the proposal.
	   The U.S. State Department urged Ethiopia and Eritrea to cease
all hostilities while outside envoys seek a peaceful resolution of
the dispute.
	   At the United Nations in New York, the Security Council on
Friday urged an immediate cease-fire and Secretary-General Kofi
Annan appealed to both sides to ``give diplomacy a chance.''
	   ``The Security Council deplored this escalation and called for
an immediate cease-fire'' and ``urged Eritrea and Ethiopia to
affirm their commitment to resolve the dispute peacefully,''
council President Antonio Monteiro of Portugal said.
	   One of the recommendations of the U.S.-Rwandan proposal was that
Eritrea withdraw to positions held before May 6.
	   Eritrea gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993. Eritrean
rebels were instrumental in helping the Ethiopian People's
Revolutionary Democratic Front overthrow a 17-year military regime
in July 1991.

	   PARIS (AP) _ French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin on Saturday
said he did not think the Air France strike would disrupt the World
Cup but that he was worried about the future of the airline
company.
	   ``It's not the World Cup that concerns me, it's the recovery
underway of the company and its future,'' said Jospin as he went
into a meeting of the national council of the Socialist Party.
	   The World Cup will take place ``normally,'' Jospin said.
``French people don't need to take a plane to attend the World Cup.
Nor do Europeans, and we are going to find a lot of airline
companies to transport the rest at the expense of Air France.''
	   Jospin said the French government was ready to intervene to help
end the the strike and would play a role ``in the hours to come.''
	   Meanwhile, talks between Air France management and the
representatives of the striking pilots broke off Saturday shortly
before 8 a.m. (0600 GMT) after an entire night of negotiations.
	   The stumbling blocks remain planned salary cuts and a proposal
by Air France to give pilots stock in exchange for the pay
reductions.
	   Jean-Cyril Spinetta, the president of Air France, said the two
sides had worked out a way to end the conflict and talks were
simply suspended to give both parties time to reflect.
	   The pilots appeared more pessimistic.
	   ``It's so serious I prefer not to talk to you about it,'' said
Christian Paris, the spokesman for the SNPL, the main pilots'
union.
	   Only about 25 percent of Air France's flights were expected to
take off Saturday. Meanwhile, a train strike disrupted service
Saturday, although many lines were running as scheduled.
	   Top sports officials on Friday insisted that the June 10-July 12
World Cup would go ahead and that France would play the perfect
host.
	   ``I can assure you all 64 matches will be played and the French
will do everything possible to welcome the foreigners coming to
France,'' said Sepp Blatter, a senior soccer official and candidate
for the sport's top job _ head of the world governing body FIFA.
	   Michel Platini, former French soccer great and co-president of
the World Cup organizing committee, said five years of planning
would not be wrecked by labor disputes.
	   ``De Gaulle once said it was difficult to govern a country with
360 types of cheese. But we shall persevere,'' he said, referring
to former French leader Gen. Charles de Gaulle.

Pakistani prime minister seeking help to combat sanctions

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pinched by sanctions for his nuclear
ambitions, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was heading Saturday to the
Gulf region to ensure oil keeps flowing to Pakistan.
	   Officials said Sharif's mission to Saudi Arabia and the United
Arab Emirates was aimed at securing the credit needed to maintain
oil imports. Pakistan bought dlrs 1.2 billion of petroleum products
over nine months up to March, the latest figure available.
	   Speaking to a joint session of Parliament before his scheduled
departure, Sharif justified his decision to follow India's lead in
testing nuclear devices, saying Pakistan had taken its future in
its own hands.
	   ``The future of every Pakistani is now secure,'' he said. He
said Pakistan was forced to go nuclear when the international
community failed to tackle what he called India's aggressive
posture.
	   He repeated Pakistan's moves were defensive. ``We do not intend
to wipe out anyone from the face of the earth,'' he said.
	   Led by the United States, several countries imposed economic
sanctions against the two South Asian rivals designed to discourage
foreign investment and credit.
	   Islamabad expects to be squeezed by sanctions that will cut off
financing for some aid projects through the International Monetary
Fund, and by a lowering of its credit rating that will make
commercial borrowing more expensive.
	   The U.N. Security Council was expected to pass a resolution
urging the India and Pakistan to halt their nuclear weapons
programs, and denying them status as nuclear weapons states.
	   The resolution evolved from a meeting Thursday in Geneva by the
foreign ministers of the five permanent Security Council members _
the original nuclear weapons states.
	   Both Pakistan and India declined to address the specific demands
by the foreign ministers to refrain from turning their nuclear
capability into weapons, to end missile testing and to abide by the
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which has been signed by 186 other
nations.
	   In its response Friday, Pakistan said it would ``not allow
itself to be placed in a position of strategic vulnerability or
inequality,''
	   While Pakistan welcomed the initiative of the five trying to
contain the nuclear threat on the subcontinent, India rejected the
offer of help from the United States, Britain, Russia, France.
	   ``There is no room for any outside involvement of any nature
whatsoever in this process,'' an Indian government statement said.
	   Both India and Pakistan said they have completed their series of
nuclear tests, and India announced a moratorium on future testing
which it was prepared to make binding through international
negotiations.
	   Pakistan has made no commitment against more.
	   The Frontier Post, citing defense sources, reported Saturday
that four tunnels at the test site in the Baluchistan desert remain
unused and ready for future tests. Six of the 10 tunnels dug near
the Iranian border were used to contain the explosions May 28 and
May 30, it said.

Military regime warns teachers to curb unrest at schools 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ One of Myanmar's most senior ruling
generals has warned school teachers to curb alleged attempts by
dissidents to spark political unrest in the country's education
system, official newspapers reported Saturday.
	   The warning by Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt precedes the return of
students to primary, middle and high schools after a three-month
annual holiday Thursday. Universities have been closed since unrest
in December 1996.
	   Khin Nyunt, the powerful head of military intelligence, urged
teachers in a speech Friday to be aware of ``subversive elements''
seeking to create disturbances.
	   ``It is necessary to be vigilant against attempts by internal
traitors and some neo-colonialists to create disturbances in the
education sector,'' Khin Nyunt said.
	   Though he did not mention her by name, Khin Nyunt appeared to be
referring to pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi, winner of the
1991 Nobel Peace Prize.
	   Suu Kyi's advocacy of democracy and human rights is viewed by
ruling State Peace and Development Council, the latest incarnation
of 36 years of military rule, as a plot orchestrated by foreign
powers to subjugate Myanmar, also known as Burma.
	   A student-led uprising against military rule was bloodily
crushed in 1988. Suu Kyi, daughter of independence hero Aung San,
rose to prominence amid the unrest.
	   Suu Kyi's National League of Democracy party last month held its
first congress allowed by the government to mark a landslide
victory in parliamentary elections in 1990. The military never
allowed the legislature to convene.
	   Indonesia's longtime authoritarian ruler, Suharto, one of the
Myanmar military government's strongest allies, was brought down by
student-led protests against his 32-year rule last month.

<TEXT>
	   ESCHEDE, Germany (AP) _ Rescuers wound up their search Saturday
for victims in postwar Germany's deadliest train accident,
delicately digging the last of the bodies from a sandbank by hand.
	   A special commission sealed the final part of the accident site
for its investigation into the cause of Wednesday's high-speed
train derailment that killed 102 people in northern Germany.
	   Investigators so far have focused on a wheel failure as the
likely cause.
	   Rescuers used their hands to sift through sand at the scene to
avoid any further damage to already mangled bodies. Four additional
bodies were found early Saturday, bringing the total number
recovered to 97. Five people have died in hospital.
	   While doctors working round the clock will continue to identify
the victims over the weekend, the rescuers _ soldiers, firefighters
and Red Cross volunteers _ should be able to get some needed rest.
But rest will also bring reflection, time to consider the grim
impact of what they've been doing.
	   ``I've never had to deal with so many dead people,'' said Dirk
Winkler, a 25-year-old soldier whose tank battalion has been using
its vehicles to pull back the wreckage of InterCity Express 884.
	   Investigators say a wheel had broken on the first passenger car.
Two minutes later, the derailed train started breaking apart and
crashed into supports of an overpass.
	   After recalling for inspections all the ICE trains of the type
that crashed, the German Rail company ordered trains returning to
circulation to run slower _ top speed of 160 kilometers (100 miles)
per hour, rather than the usual maximum 280 kilometers (175 miles).
	   Transportation Minister Matthias Wissmann rejected a long-term
speed limit for the trains. The daily Neuen Osnabrucker Zeitung
quoted him Saturday as saying that the trains and tracks had been
designed for the higher speeds.
	   But Wissmann said in an interview with Focus magazine that the
ministry and the Deutsche Bahn railroad were considering a security
system that would warn of wheel breaks and derailments.
	   When the train hit the bridge near Eschede, it was going 200
kilometers (125 miles). With a huge yellow crane, rescuers on
Friday lifted the last fragment of the collapsed bridge from the
top of the smashed train. The cable creaked from the weight.
	   All the bodies found under the wreckage were taken to a hospital
morgue in Hanover, 50 kilometers (30 miles) to the south. In teams,
doctors catalog distinguishing features _ teeth, scars, moles,
facial hair, jewelry. Then they match their records with
information from relatives. It's difficult, because so many bodies
were mangled, and by Friday only 19 victims had been identified.
	   ``We don't want any relatives to have to go from body to body.
because it's unbearable. It's arms and legs and heads. It's
awful,'' said Christian Jung, spokesman for the Hanover medical
school hospital.
	   Accounting of the victims has been difficult partly because,
unlike in an airline disaster, there are no passenger lists on
ICEs. People may buy a ticket on board, so authorities don't even
know how many passengers they're trying to account for.
	   Wissmann also ruled out the introduction of passenger lists as
inpractical, according to Neuen Osnabrucker Zeitung.
	   Rescuers, like the doctors, have worked almost continuously
since arriving at the scene midday Wednesday. During a break on
Friday, they seemed both dazed and animated, pumped up from stress
and on automatic-pilot to cope with it.
	   Some described little tricks _ everyday chit-chat at the site,
silly jokes on the way home in the car. Anything to distract the
mind from what the hands have been doing, and the eyes seeing.
	   ``We have to be strong,'' said Birgit Aust, 25, a housewife,
mother of three and Red Cross volunteer.
	   ``The worst moment was when I got there and saw the bridge on
top of the train. Then I shut off. You have to suppress all that
right now. Otherwise, you can't keep going.''
	   Aust said she expected to work through the weekend, recovering
the remains of the dead and comforting the victims' relatives.
	   Next week _ when the gravity hits _ she plans to seek comfort
herself, through counseling.

U.S. general says Russian nuclear weapons systems safe 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's control systems for nuclear weapons are
just as reliable as those in the United States, the head of the
U.S. Strategic command said Saturday.
	   Gen. Eugene Habinger, following an inspection tour of weapons
sites and storage facilities, said Russia's strategic forces were
capable of protecting nuclear facilities and preventing any
unsanctioned use of the weapons, the ITAR-Tass and Interfax news
agencies reported.
	   ``Despite the difference in approach, Washington and Moscow have
a common goal: to guarantee the impossibility of any unsanctioned
actions,'' Interfax quoted Harbinger as saying.
	   Harbinger called for the speedy ratification of the START-2 arms
limitation treaty by Russia's parliament, saying ratification would
be in the best interests of both countries.
	   Commenting on the recent nuclear tests carried out by India and
Pakistan, Harbinger said the two countries would need at least
three years to move from testing to fully deployment of nuclear
weapons systems.
	   During his stay, Harbinger visited a base for SS-19 rockets at
Kozelsk, a strategic bomber base in Engels and a missile complex in
Irkutsk. On Saturday, he and Vladimir Yakovlev, commander of
Russia's strategic forces, flew to the northern port of Murmansk to
visit a nuclear submarine base.

	   ROSTAQ, Afghanistan (AP) _ Their villages in ruins, dispirited
Afghans complained Saturday about the slow pace of international
aid, as more aftershocks sent people scurrying in panic into the
open.
	   In the week since a massive quake devastated a 700-square-mile
(1,750-square-kilometer) region of northern Afghanistan, few relief
flights have reached this miserable region that was struck twice in
four months.
	   Estimates say up to 5,000 people died from the May 30 quake,
more than twice as many fatalities as in the February disaster.
	   ``People have forgotten us,'' said Mullah Suban Qulle, the
deputy governor of Rostaq. ``The help is limited and it's too
late.''
	   The latest aftershock Saturday morning sent shudders under feet,
rattled walls in Rostaq and sent clouds of dust spiraling from the
mountainsides.
	   Stunned townspeople tumbled into the streets, misery and fear
written on their faces.
	   Dozens villages in the Rostaq were annihilated in the February
quake, when relief efforts were stymied by deep snow and freezing
temperatures.
	   ``It is the second time these people have suffered. They cannot
stay in their villages any more. They are hungry, and there are no
facilities to take care of them,'' the deputy governor told the
first journalist to reach the town since the quake.
	   Qulle charged that the United Nations and non-governmental
organizations involved in the relief were poorly coordinated, which
was costing lives.
	   In Faisabad, the headquarters for the relief operation, food
distribution and evacuation of the injured resumed Saturday after
being interrupted by heavy rains. Faisabad is 70 kilometers (40
miles) over rugged mountains from Rostaq.
	   But there were conflicting demands for the three helicopters and
meager fuel the United Nations and Red Cross have been able to
muster at the airstrip.
	   The helicopters are the sole means to deliver food, carry
doctors to treat the injured and evacuate the serious hurt.
	   One of the helicopters leased from Tajikistan was used to fly
journalists to the Tajik capital of Dushanbe instead of for aid
flights.
	   The scarce fuel came under more pressure when three Pakistani
helicopters that had brought rice to Faisabad demanded refueling
from U.N. stocks at the airstrip.
	   ``I'm afraid it's a lack of coordination between the (U.N.)
people here and in Islamabad, said Ayaz Wazir, the director of
Pakistan's Foreign Ministry. He said he was assured in the
Pakistani capital that enough fuel was available.
	   One helicopter reached the village of Angaryan, 30 kilometers
(18 miles) west of Faisabad, where it was approached by a
distraught Moqim Ahmad who had lost all four of his children.
	   ``When I left early in the morning, everything was fine. After
the earthquake, I came back and the house had collapsed. I looked
for two days and gave up. Everybody here gave up.'' From his
village of 1,100 people, 30 died and 25 are missing.
	   Doctors in Faisabad said they were worried about the spread of
disease among survivors whose homes were destroyed and who have no
food or drinking water.
	   Panna Erasmus, a Faisabad-based specialist in maternal and child
care, expressed concern that respiratory diseases and diarrhea
could worsen. Tuberculosis is already common in the area where
people live in close quarters and have poor hygiene.

EDS : Minor changes in lead. Adds ``World Cup'' in slug. No pickup. Paramilitary to guard Bangladesh power stations during World Cup 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   DHAKA , Bangladesh (AP) _ Paramilitary forces will guard
Bangladeshi power stations during the World Cup to guard them from
possible attacks by soccer-crazy television viewers in case of
power outages, a senior official said Saturday.
	   Soldiers and police will take positions around all major power
stations 12 hours before the inauguration of the World Cup in
France on June 10, Nuruddin Mohammad Kamal, chairman of the
state-owned Power Development Board told reporters.
	   Soccer is the national game of Bangladesh, though its team did
not find place among the qualifiers for the World Cup.
	   Bangladesh, which needs over 2100 Megawatts of electricity each
year, generates only 1,700 Megawatts.
	   Major cities like Dhaka, Chittagong, Khulna and Rajshahi face
regular power outage and citizens have often taken to the streets
in violent demonstrations at power stations.

Trial of BBC reporters opens in Yemen 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ The trial of three British Broadcasting
Corp. television journalists charged with filming without
government permission opened Saturday with a judge hearing the
charges against the men, court officials said.
	   The three men appeared in court with their lawyer, al-Sheik
Tareq Abdullah, said the officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   BBC producer Robin Barnwell, reporter Ragi Ommar and cameraman
Frank Smith were charged with breaking Yemen's press law by filming
without permission in a remote area.
	   The men are accused of failing to obtain permission from
authorities to travel to areas in western Yemen where kidnappings
have taken place.
	   The law, however, requires only that resident journalists inform
authorities of their movements.
	   The journalists were arrested after returning to the capital
San`a after spending a week with the Bani Dhabyan tribe near Marib,
170 kilometers (105 miles) northeast of San`a.
	   The Bani Dhabyan have carried out numerous kidnappings,
including the seizure of a British teacher, David Mitchell, his
wife Caroline, and their 14-year old son, Ben.
	   Armed tribesmen who rule over large parts of Yemen have
kidnapped foreigners and demanded concessions from the government
in return for their release. The hostages are usually well treated.

68 countries, territories confirm participation in Commonwealth Games 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ With less than 100 days to go
before the 16th Commonwealth Games in September, 68 of the 69
members of the British Commonwealth have replied that they will
take part, a newspaper said Saturday.
	   The 68th member to announce its participation was the South
Atlantic island of St.Helana. The only country that that has yet to
confirm is tiny Tuvalu, the New Straits Times said.
	   The last Games in Victoria Canada in 1994 attracted 63 members.
	   As the Games here will be the last this century, organizers are
determined to make them the best so far. Worries remain, though,
about the region's haze problem, transportation difficulties and
Southeast Asia's financial crisis.
	   The paper said that St. Helena, which did not take part in the
past three Games, will send three athletes and two officials.
	   The Games' organisers have been instructed by the Minister of
Youth and Sport, Muhyiddin Yassin, to invite two officials from
Tuvalu.
	   Tuvalu which has a population of about 10,000 and was formerly
known as Ellice Islands, is a group of islands in the South Pacific
and formed part of the former British colony of the Gilbert and
Ellice Islands.

Palestinians urge swift Israeli acceptance of U.S. proposal 
</HEADLINE>
By IBRAHIM BARZAK
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ A senior Palestinian official said
Saturday ``the clock is ticking very fast'' on Israeli acceptance
of a U.S.-authored troop-pullback plan.
	   Signs have been growing that the government of Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu is close to accepting the U.S. plan, which would
leave 40 percent of the West Bank under full or partial Palestinian
control and restrict Jewish settlement expansion.
	   U.S. officials expect a decision from Israel within days. The
Palestinians have already accepted the initiative, which has been
widely reported but not formally unveiled.
	   The Palestinian Cabinet, meeting late Friday night in Gaza, was
briefed on two days of talks in London this week by Palestinian
negotiators and U.S. envoy Dennis Ross.
	   Israel army radio had said Ross asked the two Palestinians,
Arafat deputy Mahmoud Abbas and Parliament Speaker Ahmed Qureia, to
accept some changes in the original U.S. proposal.
	   But after the Cabinet meeting, Palestinians said no changes were
in the works now, and that the ball was in the court of Israel and
the Clinton administration.
	   ``We accepted the (U.S.) initiative, trying to be helpful in
getting the peace process back on track,'' said Cabinet minister
Hanan Ashrawi. ``We are not willing in any way to renegotiate the
initiative ... I think the clock is ticking very fast.''
	   Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat urged Israel to swiftly
accept the American initiative. Otherwise, he said, ``we will
continue to see this government's policy of stealing (land) and
wasting time.''
	   Meanwhile, Jewish settler leaders have intensified a campaign to
scuttle any pullback. Far-right lawmakers have said that if
Netanyahu agrees to a withdrawal, they would try to bring him down
at the next possible opportunity by voting against the government
in a no-confidence motion.
	   Israeli media speculated Friday that faced with defections by
the far right, Netanyahu would soon try to form a national unity
government with the opposition Labor Party as a junior partner.
Such a coalition would have to be formed immediately after any
parliament vote on a troop withdrawal.

Russia regrets delay in Latvia's law on citizenship 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian Foreign Ministry said Saturday that
Latvia should have immediately implemented changes in the
citizenship law that were given preliminary approval by Latvia's
parliament.
	   ``Instead of taking emergency measures, the Latvian parliament
failed to reach a final decision on any of the acute humanitarian
problems facing Latvian society,'' the ministry said in a
statement, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Latvia's parliament gave preliminary approval to changes in the
citizenship law on Thursday. The measure must pass a final reading
before becoming law.
	   The Russian Foreign Ministry regretted parliament's decision to
consider amendments to the country's law on citizenship in a third
reading rather than adopt them at once, Interfax said.
	   Russia, which accounts for about 20 percent of Latvia's foreign
trade, in April said it would impose sanctions against Latvia
unless it took quick and substantial steps to improve the status of
Latvia's ethnic Russians, about 400,000 of whom do not have
citizenship.
	   President Guntis Ulmanis has called on the parliament take a
final vote on the bill before the start of summer recess in two
weeks.

Philippine Airlines fires officers of pilots' union 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with union vowing to continue strike new 5th-8th graf
AP Photos Available
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine Airlines on Saturday fired
the 29 officers of its striking pilots' union and told other
members to return to work by the next day or face dismissal.
	   In a statement, the airlines said it sent a letter to the
officers of the Airline Pilots Association of the Philippines
telling them, ``you have lost your employment status with PAL,
effective today, for having organized, staged, led and knowingly
participated in an illegal act.''
	   The airline also ordered the rest of the 620-member union to
report for work by Sunday or face dismissal. The union went on
strike Friday to protest an early retirement policy.
	   The airline cited two orders by the Department of Labor and
Employment prohibiting the union from ``aggravating the situation''
at the struggling airline.
	   ``With this kind of management, the only recourse is to continue
of the strike,'' union spokesman Florendo Umali said. ``To
capitulate now would be the end of the union.''
	   Umali said the management ``pre-empted and even usurped'' the
authority of the labor secretary in declaring the strike illegal.
	   Secretary Crescenciano Trajano told representatives of the union
and management in a telephone conference earlier in the morning
that the determination of the legality of the strike falls under
his authority and will require a hearing.
	   Umali said a conciliation meeting late Saturday has been
scheduled, but he expressed pessimism over its outcome.
	   The union went on strike to protest a new policy of early
retirement for pilots who have reached 20 years of service or flown
20,000 hours, regardless of age.
	   This policy puts about 200 pilots in danger of being
``retired,'' the union said.
	   Over the past four years, the airline has incurred annual losses
ranging from 451.4 million pesos (dlrs 11.3 million) to 2.5 billion
pesos (dlrs 62.5 million), in part because of large debts, an aging
fleet and Asia's currency crisis.
	   The airline says it faces an ``uncertain future,'' and announced
plans earlier this year to cut expenses by as much as 40 percent by
slashing flights and sharply reducing its work force. The airline
hasn't disclosed an estimate for its manpower reduction, but
employees fear it could be as much as 30 percent.
	   The strike canceled all Philippine Airlines international
flights except one to Hong Kong Saturday afternoon. The airline
operated only 13 domestic flights out of Manila, stranding hundreds
of passengers.
	   More than 500 passengers were stranded at the Kai Tak airport in
Hong Kong early Saturday as two fully-booked flights for Manila and
central Cebu City were canceled.
	   The airline said it would refund tickets paid in cash and send
international passengers to other airlines.

Ghana's parliament chamber damaged by fire 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ACCRA, Ghana (AP) _ The main hall of Ghana's parliament building
was damaged by a fire that may have been triggered by a faulty
wiring in the press gallery, the parliamentary security force said
Saturday.
	   The fire late Thursday night destroyed furniture, wooden
paneling and parts of the building's electrical system, said
security guard Nicholas Opoku, who was on duty at the time of the
fire.
	   ``Two of us quickly reached for fire extinguishers while we
asked our third colleague to call the fire service,'' Opoku said.
	   Much of the building's main chamber is covered with a thick
layer of black soot, he said.
	   News of the fire was only made public Saturday, as members of
parliament convened a special meeting to discuss alternative
locations to conduct business.
	   A panel of government ministers and members of parliament are
expected to decide by Monday whether recess the current legislative
session or move to an new location on a temporary basis.
	   A full assessment of the damage is expected by mid-week, said
Parliamentary Affairs Minister J.H. Owusu Acheampong.

	   ANTALYA, Turkey (AP) _ A French plane carrying passengers from a
Mediterranean holiday made an emergency landing Saturday in
Turkey's Antalya airport, after circling for hours.
	   AOM airline flight MD83 touched down at 1:40 a.m. (2240 GMT) on
its belly on the foam- covered runway of the Ataturk airport of
Antalya, television reports said.
	   None of the 157 passengers and six crew members were injured,
AOM airline said in a statement.
	   During the take off at 10:30 p.m. (1930 GMT) one of the plane's
tires was punctured, forcing the pilot to ask airport authorities
to prepare for an emergency landing.
	   ``We heard a big explosion following the takeoff,'' a French
passenger, only identified by his first name Nicolas, told private
ATV television as he left the plane.
	   Airport authorities asked the pilot to discharge some fuel in
the sea to lighten the plane. The pilot was unable to do so and
instead circled over the airport to reduce the aircraft's fuel
charge, authorities said.
	   The Anatolia news agency reported that the pilots sang to the
passengers to ease tension during this time.
	   The wheels of the plane collapsed during the landing, causing it

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's control systems for nuclear weapons are
just as reliable as those in the United States, the head of the
U.S. Strategic Command said Saturday.
	   Gen. Eugene Habiger, following an inspection tour of weapons
sites and storage facilities, said Russia's strategic forces were
capable of protecting nuclear bases and preventing any unsanctioned
use of the weapons, the ITAR-Tass and Interfax news agencies
reported.
	   ``Despite the difference in approach, Washington and Moscow have
a common goal: to guarantee the impossibility of any unsanctioned
actions,'' Interfax quoted Harbiger as saying.
	   Harbiger called for the speedy ratification of the START-2 arms
limitation treaty by Russia's parliament, saying ratification would
be in the best interests of both countries.
	   Commenting on the recent nuclear tests carried out by India and
Pakistan, Harbiger said the two countries would need at least three
years to move from testing to fully deployment of nuclear weapons
systems.
	   The U.S. Strategic Command is located at Offutt Air Force BAse
in Omaha, Nebraska, and is in charge of the planning for potential
nuclear confrontation. Its forces also do analytical studies for
strategic nuclear policy and arms control matters.
	   During his stay, Harbiger visited a base for SS-19 rockets at
Kozelsk, a strategic bomber base in Engels and a missile complex in
Irkutsk. On Saturday, he and Vladimir Yakovlev, commander of
Russia's strategic forces, flew to the northern port of Murmansk to
visit a nuclear submarine base.

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pinched by sanctions for his nuclear
ambitions, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was heading Saturday to the
Gulf region to ensure oil keeps flowing to Pakistan.
	   Officials said Sharif's mission to Saudi Arabia and the United
Arab Emirates was aimed at securing credit needed to maintain oil
imports. Pakistan bought dlrs 1.2 billion of petroleum products
over nine months up to March, the latest figure available.
	   Speaking to a joint session of Parliament before his scheduled
departure, Sharif renewed a proposal to his Indian counterpart,
Atal Bihari Vajpayee, to abandon the arms race and hold talks on
their problems.
	   ``Pakistan has already offered to India a meaningful and
purposeful dialogue, and we still offer the same,'' he said.
	   The two men are due to attend a regional summit in Sri Lanka
next month, where they will have their first chance to meet
privately since the each authorized nuclear tests.
	   Sharif called on Vajpayee to discuss the dispute over Kashmir,
which both countries claim and which is divided between them.
Kashmir was the flash point of two Indo-Pakistan wars, and the deep
divisions have sabotaged all previous attempts to negotiate an end
to 50 years of hostility.
	   Sharif said Kashmir will continue receiving moral and political
support from Pakistan until Kashmiris are given self-determination.
India accuses Pakistan of providing military aid to separatist
guerrillas, and fighting a proxy war of terrorism.
	   Sharif justified his decision to follow India's lead in testing
nuclear devices, saying Pakistan had taken its future in its own
hands.

Ramos orders withdrawal of recommendation to overturn Marcos conviction 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Fidel Ramos on Saturday
ordered the justice secretary to withdraw a recommendation by the
government's chief prosecutor to overturn the graft conviction of
the widow of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos.
	   Solicitor General Romeo de la Cruz, commenting on an appeal by
Imelda Marcos of her 1993 graft conviction, had said there was no
strong evidence against her.
	   Ramos ordered Justice Secretary Silvestre Bello to withdraw de
la Cruz's motion and restudy it.
	   Mrs. Marcos was sentenced to up to 12 years in prison and is
appealing the verdict with the Supreme Court.
	   Ramos on Friday accepted de la Cruz's resignation and made it
effective Monday rather than on June 30 as the prosecutor had
requested.
	   The President said de la Cruz's actions ``indicate that the
political will of this administration is weakening, that's why I
fired him.''
	   President-elect Joseph Estrada has indicated he favors a pardon
or dismissal of the case against Mrs. Marcos, and some analysts
speculate that de la Cruz's abrupt recommendation to overturn the
conviction was an attempt to stay on as solicitor general in
Estrada's administration.
	   The case is the only one in which Mrs. Marcos, 68, has been
convicted, although she faces numerous other criminal and civil
cases related to the 20-year rule of her husband.
	   She and her late husband have been accused of stealing billions
of dollars during his presidency. They were ousted in a 1986
``people power'' revolt and Marcos died three years later in exile
in Hawaii.
	   Mrs. Marcos was convicted of having granted leases on
government-owned land at improperly low rates to the Philippine
General Hospital Foundation, which she headed. The land was then
sublet to another company at much higher rates.
	   Mrs. Marcos insists she did not personally benefit from the
deal, and prosecutors did not challenge this, but they maintained
that the foundation should have been charged more.
	   A five-judge Supreme Court panel upheld her conviction in
January, but ruled that she could appeal one more time to the
entire court before going to prison. It sentenced her to nine to 12
years in prison and ordered her to pay 189 million pesos (dlrs 4.9
million) in damages to the government.

	   DHAKA , Bangladesh (AP) _ Paramilitary forces will guard
Bangladeshi power stations during the World Cup to prevent attacks
by angry soccer fans in the event of power outages, a senior
official said Saturday.
	   Soldiers and police will take positions around all major power
stations 12 hours before the June 10 inauguration of the World Cup
in France, Nuruddin Mohammad Kamal, chairman of the state-owned
Power Development Board told reporters.
	   The nation's major cities, including Dhaka, Chittagong, Khulna
and Rajshahi, face regular power outages and citizens have often
staged violent demonstrations at power stations.
	   Bangladesh, which needs over 2,100 megawatts of electricity each
year, generates only 1,700 megawatts.
	   Bangladesh did not qualify for the World Cup.

Indonesian rights watchdog ready to defend ex-president 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: CORRECTS verb tense in lede
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's official human rights
watchdog group has said it is ready to defend former President
Suharto against calls for unlawful revenge.
	   The National Human Rights Commission said it would stand up for
Suharto's rights as a citizen and that any action taken against the
former autocrat should be done according to the law.
	   ``We have to be fair because our country is a lawful country,''
the official Antara news agency Saturday quoted Commission member
Bambang W. Soeharto as saying.
	   Suharto resigned on May 21 following a wave of riots and
protests that were triggered by the worst economic crisis in 30
years.
	   Since then, there have been calls for the former autocrat to be
put on trial.
	   Many want an investigation into the wealth of Suharto's family,
who made billions of dollars during his 32-year rule.
	   Some say the state should seize Suharto's fortune and use it to
help the nation overcome its acute economic problems.
	   At the height of student protests last month, demonstrators even
called for Suharto to be hanged.
	   Since then, the powerful military and some leading opposition
figures have called for restraint.
	   Bambang said proper legal processes should be followed.
	   ``If he does wrong or breaks the law, then we have to bring him
to court to prove his guilt,'' Bambang said of Suharto.
	   The National Human Rights Commission was appointed by Suharto's
old government but has a track record for independence.

World Cup: Third England player in drinking controversy 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ On the eve of the World Cup, a third England
player was caught up Saturday in reports he was out drinking late,
defying orders from England coach Glenn Hoddle.
	   News reports said Darren Anderton was involved in a nightclub
brawl in the southern town of Bournemouth Wednesday. Anderton
denied he took part in the fight, although a friend was reported to
have been punched in the face.
	   The reports Saturday came just a day after Hoddle held a
closed-door meeting with striker Teddy Sheringham.
	   Sheringham's photo was splashed across papers Friday, showing
him with a cigarette in the mouth and his arm draped a young woman
at a bar on Portugal's Algarve coast. Accompanying stories said he
had been partying and drinking until dawn.
	   The incidents put Hoddle on a spot.
	   After breaking training camp in Spain on Sunday, Hoddle reminded
players they were ``on England duty'' and ask them to return home
for a quiet few days before training resumed.
	   Hoddle dismissed midfielder Paul Gascoigne from the team Sunday,
arguing he lacked fitness. Hoddle was also reportedly angered by
Gascoigne's late-night partying and drinking.
	   Hoddle was to meet again Saturday with Sheringham with some
newspapers calling for him to be dropped from the England side.
	   On Friday, Sir Bobby Charlton _ a member of England's 1966 World
Cup-winning side _ lambasted Sheringham for his lack of discipline
and suggested he had made England the laughingstock of world
soccer.
	   ``You are the focus of the whole country and if the players
don't have the common sense to behave themselves and act in a
reasonable manner it is absolutely nonsensical to think we have a
chance of winning it,'' Charlton said.

World Cup: Japanese team adjusting to warmer French camp 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   AIX-LES-BAINS, France (AP) _ The Japanese team is struggling to
adjust to the more humid, warmer weather at the southeastern resort
that will serve as its World Cup base training camp.
	   Coach Takeshi Okada moved up Saturday's afternoon practice to
the middle of the afternoon to allow his players to get used to the
heat.
	   ``I'm not used to this yet,'' said midfielder Hiroshi Nanami,
25, sweating after the team's light jog Saturday morning. ``I'll be
OK in about three days. It's getting there.''
	   Usually at about 25 degrees Centigrade (77 degrees Fahrenheit),
the weather in Aix-les-Bains is similar to Tokyo's at this time of
the year.
	   But it was exceptionally warm Friday, the day the team arrived,
hitting about 30 degrees C (86 F).
	   The players have been spoiled by the cooler winds at their
previous camp in Nyon, Switzerland, where they trained for about a
week.
	   ``I was a little surprised because it was so terribly hot
yesterday,'' said striker Masashi Nakayama. ``But I think I'll
adjust little by little.''
	   Careful to allot plenty of time for stretching after his run, he
was the last player to come off the field.
	   ``I get yelled at these days if I don't stretch. I've reached
that age, I guess,'' said Nakayama, who at 30 is one of the oldest
players on the team.
	   Okada said he will not go easy on the players.
	   ``We have to think about what lies ahead,'' he said. ``It's best
for the players to keep moving.''
	   The opener for Japan's World Cup debut is against Argentina June
14.

Trial opens against would-be king Leka in absentia 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ A trial in absentia opened here Friday
against would-be king Leka, who is charged with organizing an armed
rebellion against the election commission following the June 1997
ballot, court officials said Saturday.
	   Leka Zogu returned to Albania in 1997 from Johannesburg, South
Africa, where he is a businessmen. He left on a private jet after
refusing a state prosecutor's summons to discuss a July 3 shootout
that left one man dead.
	   The clash occurred when monarchists staged a demonstration
against what they alleged were rigged results in the defeat of a
referendum asking Albanians if they wanted to restore the monarchy.
Violence erupted after Leka joined the protest. He and some of his
companions were armed.
	   Leka, whose army officer father became Albania's king in 1928,
appeared at the rally dressed in camouflage and armed with a pistol
and an Uzi submachine gun. He then led 300 supporters to the
election commission's headquarters.
	   However, they failed to enter the election commission building.
Leka and his supporters fled after a wild shootout in which one man
was killed.
	   The court has a list of 61 people scheduled to testify, mainly
policemen involved in the shootout.
	   Leka was an infant when his father fled Albania's Italian
invaders in 1939.

Neutrino researchers say their project threatened by budget cuts 
</HEADLINE>
By TODD ZAUN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The team of physicists who stunned the scientific
world with evidence Friday that neutrinos have mass, now says
government budget cuts threaten to halt their experiments.
	   The group of a 120 scientists from around the world, known as
the Super-Kamiokande Collaboration, has appealed to the Japanese
government to reconsider planned 15 percent cuts in its
contribution to the project both this year and next.
	   The budget cuts may force the scientists to stop the experiment
for 2 months this year and four months next year, the group said in
a statement received Saturday by the Associated Press.
	   The physicists warned the government against implementing
across-the-board cuts ``without consideration of the relative
scientific importance of the projects or the devastating impact
that such cut may have.''
	   On Friday, the group said it had found evidence the neutrino, a
tiny and elusive subatomic particle, has mass.
	   The discovery forces a revision of a decades-old theory of the
fundamental structure of matter. It may also compel scientists to
confront the possibility that neutrinos make up a significant chunk
of the ``dark matter'' that they believe exists but have so far
been unable to observe.
	   Neutrinos are one of nature's basic building blocks. They have
no charge and are so small that they were previously thought to
have no mass at all.
	   Neutrinos produced by nuclear fusion at the sun's core are being
constantly hurled toward the earth at the speed of light. Trillions
of them pass through the earth and on into the cosmos every second.
	   To detect the particles, Japan, with some funding from the
United States, built a 50,000 ton water tank one kilometer (half a
mile) down a mine shaft in the central Japan city of Takayama.
	   The apparatus doesn't actually allow scientists to capture
neutrinos or even see them but it can detect and measure the debris
left by collisions between neutrinos and subatomic particles in the
water.
	   The physicists said data collected over the last two years shows
that neutrinos ``oscillate'' or change type as they pass through
the earth, something that only things with mass do.

Foreign Office advises Britons to leave Eritrea Eritrea

Eds: UPDATES in grafs 8-9 with quotes from Britons returning from
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain said Saturday it is having difficulty
getting a plane into Eritrea to evacuate Britons and other
foreigners who want to escape fighting in the East African nation.
	   ``Obviously this is a war zone and it proved just not possible
for safety reasons to get that plane in,'' Foreign Office Minister
Tony Lloyd told BBC Radio 4. ``We are actually seeking the
opportunity to get a plane in as quickly as we can.''
	   The Foreign Office on Friday advised about 120 British citizens
in Eritrea to leave as soon as possible because of a worsening
border conflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia.
	   ``We are working closely with our European Union partners and
the Canadians and Americans to make the necessary provision for
flights out of the capital Asmara as soon as possible,'' a Foreign
Office spokesman said, speaking with customary anonymity.
	   Forty eight Britons left Eritrea Friday night on a U.S. aircraft
which landed in Frankfurt early Saturday. The Foreign Office said
the Britons, mainly working for the non-governmental organization
Voluntary Service Overseas, then flew to London.
	   Britain is still trying to evacuate between 60 and 80 people
from Britain, the European Union and Commonwealth nations, Lloyd
said.
	   For the second day on Saturday, Ethiopian warplanes bombed
airports outside the Eritrean capital. The civilian airport was
struck by several bombs, setting off bursts of fire as foreigners
were trying to leave the country. The military airport was also
bombed.
	   ``We had seen tanks driving through the streets and we saw the
MiGs bombing the airport which was frightening,'' said Jenny
Tinker, 26, from Reading, who has been teaching in Eritrea for two
years and was among the 48 Britons who returned to London on
Saturday.
	   ``The Eritreans are used to it,'' said Debbie McGrath, who also
worked in the education field in Eritrea. ``They have had 30 years
of fighting. People stood out and watched for the MiGs as they went
over and clapped when one was shot down.''

	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Ethiopian warplanes bombed a combined
military-civilian airport and the outskirts of the Eritrean capital
Saturday, escalating a border dispute between the two nations in
the Horn of Africa.
	   Several bombs struck the civilian part of the airport, setting
off fires as foreigners were trying to leave the country.
Anti-aircraft guns fired on two Ethiopian warplanes, but neither
appeared to have been hit.
	   Reports said the fuel depot on the military side of the airport
was also hit.
	   The Eritrean Foreign Ministry said the MiG fighter-bombers also
struck the southern outskirts of Asmara and that Eritrean gunners
shot one of them down.
	   The ministry said no information was yet available on
casualties.
	   It was the second day in a row that the airport was hit by
Ethiopian bombs. Initial reports said two Ethiopian Migs had been
shot down Friday, but Eritrea later said only one had been hit.
	   A source familiar with the Eritrean Air Force, who asked not to
be further identified, said it was clear Ethiopia was trying to
wipe out Eritrea's small air force.
	   Because of the airport attacks, Britain and Germany were having
difficulty Saturday trying to send aircraft to evacuate their
nationals from Eritrea.
	   Asmara residents again poured into the streets Saturday to
celebrate the downing of the second aircraft.
	   Aaron Greenberg, 22, an American Peace Corps volunteer among 129
Americans and 65 other evacuees who arrived early Saturday in
Frankfurt, Germany on a charter flight from Asmara said residents
drove by the Ethiopian Embassy Friday honking their car horns and
cheering.
	   The escalating conflict prompted the U.S. State Department to
order nonessential staff and dependents out of Eritrea and urge
other Americans to leave.
	   Ethiopia said Friday's attack was in retaliation an Eritrean
attack on Mekele, 200 kilometers (125 miles) north of Addis. At
least 44 Ethiopians civilians were killed and 135 wounded in the
Mekele attack, according to Radio Fana of the Ethiopian People's
Revolutionary Democratic Front.
	   But reports from Mekele said the Eritreans did not strike until
6 p.m. (1500gmt) Friday, almost four hours after the attack on
Asmara airport.
	   Eritrea and Ethiopia, among the world's poorest nations, are at
odds over at least six areas along their common border which was
traced by Italy after it conquered Eritrea in 1885.
	   Both armies have been trading artillery and mortar fire in the
contested areas with weapons supplied to Ethiopia by the Soviet
Union during the Cold War.
	   The first airstrikes came a day after Ethiopian Prime Minister
Meles Zenawi agreed to a U.S. and Rwandan proposal to end the
border conflict peacefully.
	   But Meles warned that his country's patience was wearing thin
because of Eritrea's refusal to withdraw from territory Ethiopia
claims it occupied a month ago.
	   The Eritrean government issued a statement Friday saying there
were ``still serious issues of detail and implementation to be
worked out'' with the proposal.
	   The U.S. State Department urged Ethiopia and Eritrea to cease
all hostilities while outside envoys seek a peaceful resolution of
the dispute.
	   U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Susan Rice
was in the West African Nation of Burkina Faso Saturday where
foreign ministers from the Organization of African Unity were
meeting in Ouagadougu prior to Monday's summit.
	   The Ethio-Eritrean conflict was expected to feature high on the
agenda.
	   At the United Nations in New York, the Security Council on
Friday urged an immediate cease-fire and Secretary-General Kofi
Annan appealed to both sides to ``give diplomacy a chance.''
	   ``The Security Council deplored this escalation and called for
an immediate cease-fire'' and ``urged Eritrea and Ethiopia to
affirm their commitment to resolve the dispute peacefully,''
council President Antonio Monteiro of Portugal said.
	   One of the recommendations of the U.S.-Rwandan proposal was that
Eritrea withdraw to positions held before May 6.
	   Eritrea gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993. Eritrean
rebels were instrumental in helping the EPRDF overthrow a 17-year
military regime in July 1991.

New leader says probe into Suharto regime corruption must be lawful

By GEOFF SPENCER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Fearing that demands for swift action
against ex-President Suharto could degenerate into a lynching,
Indonesia's new leader insisted Saturday that an inquiry into
corruption under the old autocrat proceed lawfully.
	   In a wide-ranging two and half hour presentation to Indonesian
media executives, Habibie also outlined an ``accelerated
evolution'' reform program to end the nation's political turmoil
and worsening economic crisis.
	   In his most specific reference yet to a timetable for change,
Habibie said electoral reforms would be in place by August this
year and parliamentary and presidential elections held before
December 1999.
	   A new Cabinet would then be formed at the start of 2000. He did
not specify if he would run for office, but later described himself
as ``an integrated part of the Indonesian people.''
	   He said all future presidents should be limited to only two
five-year terms in office.
	   Suharto ruled for 32 years. He resigned on May 21 in favor of
Habibie following a wave of riots and protests that were triggered
by the worst economic crisis in 30 years. At least 1,188 died in
the violence that scarred Jakarta and other cities.
	   Since then, many have called for Suharto to face trial for
corruption and abuse of power. Some want the state to seize
billions of dollars amassed by his super-rich family and use it to
help the nation overcome its acute economic problems.
	   At the height of student protests last month, demonstrators even
called for Suharto to be hanged for his alleged misdeeds.
	   They also called for Habibie to step down.
	   ``I ask the people of the Republic of Indonesia to concentrate
on the future. It doesn't mean that corruption and nepotism and so
on will be forgotten. I ask them to leave it to the legal
process,'' Habibie said.
	   ``I am not going to introduce, just like 200 years ago in Texas,
where people would take their own justice and hang somebody, and
afterwards, after he is dead, find out that he is innocent.''
	   Habibie said a proper and lawful corruption inquiry was ``in the
pipeline.''
	   He called on Indonesians to wait for its outcome, saying
patience was part of the Indonesian culture.
	   The powerful military and some leading opposition figures have
also called for restraint.
	   Indonesia's National Human Rights Commission said it would stand
up for Suharto's rights as a citizen.
	   Habibie also called on Indonesia's indigenous, mainly Muslim,
majority not to persecute the nation's ethnic Chinese minority.
	   During last month's rioting many Indonesian-born Chinese were
targeted by mobs. Although they make up only a tiny fraction of
Indonesia's 202 million people, they dominate trade and commerce.
Thousands of Chinese homes and shops were looted and burned. Tens
of thousand of Chinese have left the country.
	   Only two weeks in the job, Habibie has instituted several major
reforms, including the holding of new elections next year.
	   On Friday the government announced it had lifted draconian
controls used by Suharto to suppress press freedoms.
	   He has released four political prisoners and has promised to
free more soon.
	   A range of economic reforms have also been put into place.
	   A team from the International Monetary Fund is due to arrive in
Jakarta next week to asses how to restart a dlrs 43 billion
economic rescue package that was derailed by political events.
	   Habibie said that Indonesia's would cooperate with the IMF.
	   ``We do not have a problems,'' he said in reference to relations
to the Washington-based Fund.
	   Last week hundreds of students staged noisy demonstrations
outside of the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta and the U.S. Consulate in
the second city of Surabaya, claiming that Washington was
interfering in Indonesia's internal affairs.
	   Some accused the Clinton administration of trying to delay loan
payments to Indonesia from the IMF and of funding groups to
undermine the government.
	   Habibie flatly rejected the claim, saying that the United States
and other industrialized powers belonging to the G-7 group of
nations wanted to help Indonesia.

Iranian spiritual leader sick, but illness is minor 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranian spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei is suffering from a minor illness and there is no cause
for concern, his office said in a statement Saturday.
	   At a ceremony Thursday marking the anniversary of Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini's death, Khamenei, 58, gave a 15-minute speech in
an unusually quiet voice and said his doctors would not allow him
to talk longer.
	   In previous speeches on the anniversary of the death of
Khomeini, Iran's revolutionary patriarch, Khamenei, who succeeded
him, has spoken emotionally for nearly an hour.
	   ``We would like to clarify that (the illness) is only minor.
According to physicians in charge . . . there is no cause for
concern,'' said the statement carried by state-run Tehran radio.
	   Journalists who cover Khamenei on a daily basis said he had a
bad cold but the ailment was not serious.

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ After centuries of sinking into moist clay,
Mexico City's cathedral is finally being set straight by experts
who are trying to save the largest church in the Americas.
	   The imposing stone building with twin bell towers overlooking
the vast Zocalo square will never stop sinking, but the experts
hope that with its tilt lessened the cathedral won't crumble.
	   In a project that began a decade ago, workers have been
painstakingly removing soil from under the structure's northern
side, which was once more than 8 feet (2-1/2 meters) higher than
the other end. Bit by bit, the high side has come down a little
over three feet (one meter) _ leaving the church not completely
level, but good enough to prevent collapse.
	   ``We are achieving our goal so the structure can now sink more
evenly,'' said Sergio Zaldivar, an architect who heads a government
restoration team of 230 geophysicists, engineers and other experts.
	   ``After that we can start mending the cracks in the walls, the
floor, and repairing other parts of the structure,'' Zaldivar added
in an interview. ``Even so, the foundations will have to be watched
year after year and maybe further corrected.''
	   The Metropolitan Cathedral, 363 feet (111 meters) by 215 feet
(66 meters) and weighing 127,000 metric tons, was in trouble from
the day construction began in 1573 atop an Aztec ceremonial center
that included at least one pyramid.
	   Roman Catholic priests accompanying the Spanish conquerors
regularly built churches atop Indian ceremonial sites in an effort
to convert the Aztecs and end practices like sacrificing humans
alive by cutting their hearts out.
	   The Aztecs themselves had run into trouble building the
ceremonial center, which also kept sinking. They had to tamp down
the extremely soft soil of what _ like the rest of the Valley of
Mexico _ were lake beds and marshes drained over the centuries.
	   In the 240 years that the cathedral was under construction
before its consecration in 1813, architects made continual
adjustments to compensate for sinking. Work stopped when a huge
flood in 1629 that lasted nearly eight years forced half of Mexico
City's population to move to neighboring Puebla.
	   The cathedral was erected on a masonry platform about four feet
(a meter) thick that rests on a mass of short wooden pilings.
	   In addition to its historical importance, the building is unique
because of its various architectural styles _ a harmonious blend of
Gothic, baroque and others. It also houses priceless art treasures.
	   Not only the cathedral is sinking. Most of Mexico City, which
sprawls over a bowl-shaped valley 7,250 feet (2,200 meters) above
sea level, is slowly subsiding because 80 percent of its water
comes from wells that tap aquifers under the city. Although rains
are heavy during the rainy season, it isn't enough to replenish the
aquifers, so the ground is compacting.
	   The city has sunk about 24 feet (seven meters) this century,
and, like the cathedral, none of it evenly. The sinking worsened
considerably after 1934, when a population boom began that has
boosted the city from 435,000 people in 1910 to an estimated 18
million today.
	   The cathedral was already in crisis when an 8.1-magnitude
earthquake devastated Mexico City on Sept. 19, 1985, killing 10,000
people. The 6-foot-thick (two-meter-thick), mostly sandstone walls
withstood the shocks _ as they had countless big quakes before _
but sustained terrific stress.
	   More walls cracked and a fissure on the floor ran almost all the
way down the middle of the church. Interior columns tilted, arches
flattened and the floor humped.
	   Mexico's Education Department soon decided to spend dlrs 2
million to dlrs 3 million annually to save the cathedral.
	   After much study, Zaldivar and his team came up with a plan for
lowering the cathedral's back side.
	   Under the building, crews drilled 32 concrete-lined holes about
10 feet (3 meters) in diameter to depths of 60 (18) to 75 feet
(23). Workers then drilled unlined, three-inch-wide
(eight-centimeter-wide) holes out horizontally to draw out slowly
and carefully tons of muddy clay.
	   ``It took almost a decade but we did it,'' Zaldivar said.
	   ``Now we have to repair the rest inside,'' he added, pointing to
green metal scaffolding that covers the cathedral's inner walls.
	   They also plan to clean the outer walls, which are covered with
grime from decades of smog and pigeon droppings.

Saturday, escalating a border dispute between the Horn of Africa
nations. Several bombs struck the airport, setting off fires as
foreigners were trying to leave the country. Anti-aircraft guns

	   ESCHEDE, Germany (AP) _ Rescuers wound up their search Saturday
for victims in postwar Germany's deadliest train accident,
delicately digging the last of the bodies from a sandbank by hand.
A commission sealed part of the accident site for its investigation
of the cause of Wednesday's high-speed train derailment that killed
102 people in northern Germany. Investigators have focused on a
wheel failure as the likely cause. Four additional bodies were
found early Saturday, bringing the total recovered to 97. Five
people have died in hospital. (GERMANY-TRAIN DERAILS)

an ``accelerated evolution'' reform program to end the nation's
political turmoil and worsening economic crisis. In his most
specific reference yet to a timetable for change, Habibie said
electoral reforms would be in place by August and parliamentary and
presidential elections held before December 1999.

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pinched by sanctions for his nuclear
ambitions, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was heading to the Gulf
region Saturday to ensure that oil keeps flowing to Pakistan.
Officials said Sharif's mission to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates was to secure credit needed to maintain oil imports.
Pakistan bought dlrs 1.2 billion of petroleum products over nine
months up to March, the latest figure available. Speaking to a
joint session of Parliament before his scheduled departure, Sharif
renewed a proposal to his Indian counterpart, Atal Bihari Vajpayee,
to abandon the arms race and hold talks. The two are to attend a
regional summit in Sri Lanka next month, where they will have their
first chance to meet privately since each authorized nuclear tests.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Several of Britain's national newspapers reacted
Saturday with anger at critical remarks made about Princess Diana's
mother by Mohamed Al Fayed, whose son Dodi died in the Paris car
crash that killed the princess. Al Fayed said Friday that Frances
Shand Kydd was ``a bad mother,'' accused her of ``snobbery'' and
said Diana ``did not give a damn about her.'' The Sun, Britain's
biggest-selling daily tabloid, called Al Fayed a ``heartless
creep.'' ``Fayed Savages Diana's Mother,'' said the headline in the
Daily Mail, Britain's top selling mid-market tabloid. Al Fayed
spoke after he and Mrs. Shand Kydd attended a meeting in Paris
called by French Judge Herve Stephan, who is investigating the
deadly crash. Al Fayed said he was offended that Shand Kydd refused
to speak to him. (BRITAIN-DIANA-EL FAYED)

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Police arrested three men believed linked
to an international counterfeiting ring early Saturday,
confiscating dlrs 160,000 worth of forged bills.
	   The three Greek nationals will be charged with possession of
counterfeit money with intent to sell, financial crimes squad
officials said.
	   The men were arrested in an open-air parking lot in the central
Greek city of Lamia while trying to negotiate a sale with an
unknown party. Police found 50,000 forged bills in 10,000-drachma
(dlrs 30) denominations, along with two forged Russian passports.
	   In March, police arrested a man in Athens with dlrs 562,000

Generale Bank board chooses Fortis over ABN Amro takeover bid 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The board of Belgium's Generale Bank on
Saturday declared hostile a dlrs 12 billion takeover bid from the
Dutch bank ABN Amro and moved instead to accept a rival offer from
the Belgium-Dutch financial group Fortis.
	   The decision came after an 14-hour board meeting that ended at
dawn. The Generale board voted 18 to 7 against the ABM Amro bid
with one abstention.
	   To protect Belgium's largest bank from the ABM Amro takeover,
the board voted 17 to 9 to increase Generale's capital by 10
percent. The capital increase was wholly subscribed and paid up by
Fortis at a cost of 47.4 billion francs (dlrs 1.295 billion).
	   Fortis increased its bid for Generale late Friday to 28,675
francs (dlrs 783) per share, a premium of 7.2 percent over the Amro
bid. Fortis already controls 35.4 percent of Generale's existing
shares.
	   ``We have spent many months analyzing the synergies and benefits
of a combination ... we are wholly confident that these benefits
justify our offer in full,'' Fortis Chairman Maurice Lippens said
in a statement.
	   The Fortis-Generale group will be the 15th largest European
financial institution by market capitalization, Fortis said.

Indonesia's president says he's committed to IMF reform 
</HEADLINE>

By GEOFF SPENCER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's new President B.J. Habibie
said Saturday he remained committed to carrying out tough reforms
under a dlrs 43 billion International Monetary Fund rescue package.
	   Habibie's comments came two days before an IMF team was due to
arrive in Jakarta to help put the battered economy back on track.
	   The president, who has been in office for only 14 days,
identified currency stability and the control of soaring inflation
as key immediate goals for Indonesia.
	   ``We have a program with the IMF and we are going to follow that
program and make the best of that,'' Habibie said in reply to a
question from The Associated Press at gathering of media executives
at Jakarta's State Palace.
	   ``We do not have a problem,'' he said of relations between his
new government and the Washington-based Fund.
	   Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous nation, has been the
hardest hit by Asia's financial meltdown.
	   Habibie became head of state on May 21 when former President
Suharto quit after a wave of protests and riots swept several
cities, including the capital.
	   Several attempts to implement the IMF package stalled under
Suharto who was accused of tryiong to protect business empires
built by his family and friends under his patronnage.
	   The economic crisis has seen massive rises in inflation and mass
unemployment.
	   Indonesia's currency, the rupiah, has lost about 80 percent of
its value against the U.S. dollar, bringing most trade and
production to a standstill, and making many foreign debt-ladened
companies and banks insolvent.
	   Habibie said Indonesia urgently needs to stabilize the rupiah
and to rein in the runaway inflation rate, which some predict could
top 85 percent, or even 100 percent, by the end of the year.
	   He said once these goals were in place the government could
address the question of the rupiah's low value against the U.S.
dollar.
	   Before the economic crisis hit last July, one dollar was worth
2,400 rupiahs. Last week it was trading at around 11,500 rupiahs,
with no immediate sign of recovery.
	   ``When the rupiah is stabilized and inflation is controlled, we
can adjust the exchange rate,'' Habibie said.
	   Habibie also defended a decision to save the country's largest
privately-owned bank after a prolonged run by nervous depositors.
	   Bank Central Asia, or BCA, is controlled by one of Suharto's
close business associates, Liem Sioe Liong, Indonesia's richest
man, and part-owned by two of Suharto's children.
	   Last week the bank was placed under the supervision of the
Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency, which is looking after dozens
of other troubled financial institutions.
	   Habibie said this was not taken to help the bank's owners, but
to safeguard the savings of millions of Indonesians.
	   He said BCA was important to Indonesia's economy and its
possible demise could have caused a ``snowball effect'' on the rest
of the troubled banking sector.
	   Habibie, a German-educated engineer, also said an expert from
the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, would be stationed in
Jakarta for one year to advise on how to reform Indonesia's central
bank in line with the IMF program.

Two Frenchmen abducted off northern Somalia coast 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ Somali gunmen are holding two French
nationals for ransom after seizing them and their sailboat in the
Gulf of Aden off northern Somalia, one of the kidnappers said
Saturday.
	   Gunmen loyal to the Somali Salvation Democratic Front said the
men were seizied when their sailboat came too close to fishing
waters controlled by the group.
	   In a separate incident Friday, gunmen abducted a Somali employed
by the European Union.
	   Abdalla Musa Abdi, a former employee of the U.S. embassy, was
abducted following prayers at a mosque in northern Mogadishu, an
area controlled by faction leader Hussein Mohamed Aidid. The reason
for the kidnapping and Abdi's whereabouts were not clear.
	   The French hostages, who were not identified, are being held in
the northeastern Somali coastal town of Bossaso. Sources said they
were being held in a small room in a house and were being
adequately fed and treated.
	   ``There will be no other way out but a huge ransom to be paid in
exchange for the release of the French men,'' said Saeed Baniadam,
a leader of the abductors. He did not elaborate.
	   The kidnappers, who spoke with reporters in Mogadishu by high
frequency radio, said the hostages told them their boat was headed
from the French port of Marseille to the island of Madagascar off
the southeastern African coast.
	   The abductors said the French vessel had been three kilometers
(1.8 miles) from the SSDF-controlled fishing waters when gunmen in
a speedboat forced them to shore.
	   Foreign seafaring vessels are a profitable source of revenue for
the gunmen from the SSDF, one of a more than a dozen factions
controlling parts of Somalia.
	   Somalia has been without a central government since faction
leaders combined to oust President Siad Barre in 1991, then turned
on each other, turning the counry into armed fiefdoms.
	   Kidnappings are a danger for foreigners in and around Somalia.
In November, further west along Somalia's northern coast, five
international aid workers were seized on the way to a barbeque on a
yacht. They were later released unharmed.
	   In April, eight Red Cross workers and two pilots were taken
hostage in Mogadishu. They were later released after extended
negotiations.

Third arrest in South Africa military weapons heist 
</HEADLINE>
By PAT REBER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ A third suspect was arrested
Saturday in connection with the theft of South African military
ammunition, capping a week of saber-rattling by white and black
politicians.
	   The 42-year-old man arrested in Bloemfontein is not a member of
the military, said spokeswoman Superintendent Johlene van der
Merwe.
	   Earlier in the week, police arrested a sergeant connected to an
army base in Bloemfontein, 400 kilometers (240 miles) southwest of
Johannesburg, and his brother, a farm foreman.
	   The three are suspected of involvement in Monday's theft of
200,000 rounds of ammunition from a truck carrying it off the base.
The bodies of the two truck drivers were found in a river.
	   The suspects were also believed to have been involved in last
month's theft of 117 weapons, including mortars and rocket
launchers, from the same base. Most of the weapons have been
recovered, and six suspects were arrested in May.
	   Suspicion has focused on right-wing elements in the military
seeking weapons for a campaign to destabilize the country in the
run-up to next year's national election, just the second all-race
polling since South Africa dismantled its apartheid regime in 1994.
	   Deputy Defense Minister Ronnie Kasrils told Parliament last week
that some of the arrested men had right-wing connections.
	   On Friday, a group calling itself the Boere Weerstandsbewging,
or Boer's Resistance Movement, claimed the theft was done by Boers
_ a political reference to descendants of original Dutch settlers
who want a separate homeland.
	   In a statement faxed to Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, the BWB
warned that fears he expressed earlier this week about whites
taking up arms ``should be taken seriously.''
	   Mbeki, the likely successor to President Nelson Mandela in next
year's elections, said recently that privileged whites have not
done enough to help the poor blacks that are the country's
majority.
	   On Wednesday in Parliament, a conservative Freedom Front Party
member said that Mbeki and the ruling African National Congress
were determined to disempower all Afrikaners _ white descendants of
settlers who speak Afrikaans.
	   ``If this ANC government wants confrontation, so be it. We are
ready to take up that challenge,'' said Corne Mulder.

Fresh Hindu-Muslim rioting kills three in southern India 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HYDERABAD, India (AP) _ Fanatic Hindus and Muslims clashed in at
least half a dozen places in the southern Indian city of Hyderabad
for the second straight day Saturday, killing at least three people
and injuring 40 more, police said.
	   Police fired gunshots to disperse the rioters who attacked each
other with swords, knives and stones in the capital of Andhra
Pradesh state, said Ram Pratap Singh, the city police chief.
	   Those killed included a police officer whose home was attacked,
Singh said. Police imposed curfew as nearly 1,500 Hindus and
Muslims, split into at least six groups, rampaged through the
southern parts of the city, 1,300 kilometers (about 800 miles)
south of New Delhi.
	   Nearly 5,000 policemen fanned out and controlled the rioting
after nearly four hours. ``The situation is quite tense in the
city,'' Singh said.
	   Hyderabad's 5 million population is equally divided between
Hindus and Muslims.
	   Trouble erupted on Friday when Muslims, angered by pamphlets
denigrating their religion, attacked the Hindus after noon prayers.
At least 25 people were injured. They targeted homes, buses and
cars.
	   No one claimed responsibility for distributing the offensive
pamphlets.
	   Fresh rioting started Saturday after rumors spread that Hindus
had burned down a city mosque, Singh said. Six of the 40 injured
were hospitalized in serious condition.

Iranian spiritual leader sick, but illness is minor 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranian spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei is suffering from a minor illness and there is no cause
for concern, his office said in a statement Saturday.
	   At a ceremony Thursday marking the anniversary of Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini's death, Khamenei, 58, gave a 15-minute speech in
an unusually quiet voice and said his doctors would not allow him
to talk longer.
	   In previous speeches on the anniversary of the death of
Khomeini, Iran's revolutionary patriarch, Khamenei, who succeeded
him, has spoken emotionally for nearly an hour.
	   ``We would like to clarify that (the illness) is only minor.
According to physicians in charge . . . there is no cause for
concern,'' said the statement carried by state-run Tehran radio.
	   Journalists who cover Khamenei on a daily basis said he had a
bad cold but the ailment was not serious.

More shelling, more dead in Kosovo 
</HEADLINE>
By ISMET HAJDARI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Dozens of houses were aflame and
Serb gunners kept shelling villages in Kosovo, where another four
people were killed in fighting, ethnic Albanian and Serb sources
said Saturday.
	   The Kosovo Information Center close to the Albanian leadership
said fighting continued Saturday in the Decani area, some 70
kilometers (45 miles) west of provincial capital Pristina. The
villages of Shaptej, Gramocel and Babaloc were targeted by the
Serbs' heavy artillery.
	   One three-year old child, identified as Leutrim Aga, was killed
sleeping in his bed in Gramocel and three more ethnic Albanians
were wounded in that village. Another ethnic Albanian was found
dead in nearby Babaloc.
	   Dozens of houses in the region were burning, the Kosovo
Information Center said. It also claimed that Serbian forces were a
shelling border strip west of Djakovica, 75 kilometers (47 miles)
southwest of Pristina and that police reinforcements were sent in.
	   Serbian sources said two men were killed in a border clash
between Serb-led Yugoslav army troops and an armed group attempting
to illegally enter the province from Macedonia Saturday. They were
the first dead at the Macedonian border.
	   The clash occurred in the early morning near Brod outpost, 85
kilometers (53.1 miles) south of Pristina, reported the
pro-government Media Center in Pristina. The identity of the two
killed was not reported.
	   A Serb policemen was also reported to have died in the Belgrade
military hospital of injuries sustained in previous fighting in
Kosovo.
	   Speaking to reporters on Brioni island, Croatia, Ilir Meta,
Albania's state secretary for European integration, said the
situation in Kosovo was getting ``more and more explosive'' each
day.
	   He repeated his government's calls for outside assistance to
cope with the continuing influx of Kosovo refugees.
	   ``If this situation is not stopped immediately, in the coming
hours and days, it can bring an unforeseen catastrophe not only for
the Albanians or Serbs but for the whole region,'' Meta said.
	   ``We consider that enhancement of NATO presence in the region
can help the strengthening of the security,'' he added.
	   Meanwhile, German foreign ministry official Wolfgang Ischinger,
touring the Balkans, met with ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova
in the provincial capital Pristina.
	   Ischinger was later scheduled to travel to Belgrade for meetings
with top government officials. On Friday, he visited neighboring
Macedonia where he called the expulsions of Kosovo Albanians
``unprecedented,'' saying the international community ``cannot shut
its eyes before that problem.''
	   He added international pressure on Belgrade government must
continue.
	   On Friday, the United Nations, in an unusually strong statement,
accused Serbian forces of atrocities in Kosovo where more than 250
people have died since March 1, in escalating clashes between
government forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army, the armed wing of
the Albanian independence movement.
	   In the Decani offensive this week, ethnic Albanian sources
earlier reported 50 dead, 200 missing and several villages
destroyed. There were also unconfirmed reports of a mass grave
containing 300 bodies.
	   A statement by Serbian police issued late Friday, contradicted
by the subsequent Albanian account, indicated the latest offensive
had ended, with the ``terrorist gangs'' who tried to block the key
north-south Pec-Decani-Djakovica road being ``destroyed.''
	   Most of western Kosovo remained sealed-off Saturday, and it was
impossible to verify the conflicting reports.
	   More than 10,000 Kososo Albanian refugees fled to northern
Albania this week, the largest exodus since ethnic tensions erupted
into large-scale violence in March. Thousands more are in

Neutrino researchers say their project threatened by budget cuts

By TODD ZAUN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The team of physicists who stunned the scientific
world with evidence Friday that the tiny particles known as
neutrinos have mass, now says government budget cuts threaten to
halt their experiments.
	   The group of a 120 scientists from around the world, known as
the Super-Kamiokande Collaboration, has appealed to the Japanese
government to reconsider planned 15 percent cuts in its
contribution to the project both this year and next.
	   The budget cuts may force the scientists to stop the experiment
for 2 months this year and four months next year, the group said in
a statement received Saturday by The Associated Press.
	   The physicists warned the government against implementing
across-the-board cuts ``without consideration of the relative
scientific importance of the projects or the devastating impact
that such cut may have.''
	   On Friday, the group said it had found evidence the neutrino, a
tiny and elusive subatomic particle, has mass.
	   The discovery forces a revision of a decades-old theory of the
fundamental structure of matter. It may also compel scientists to
confront the possibility that neutrinos make up a significant chunk
of the ``dark matter'' that they believe exists but have so far
been unable to observe.
	   Neutrinos are one of nature's basic building blocks. They have
no charge and are so small that they were previously thought to
have no mass at all.
	   Neutrinos produced by nuclear fusion at the sun's core are being
constantly hurled toward the earth at the speed of light. Trillions
of them pass through the earth and on into the cosmos every second.
	   To detect the particles, Japan, with some funding from the
United States, built a 50,000 ton water tank one kilometer (half a
mile) down a mine shaft in the central Japan city of Takayama.
	   The apparatus doesn't actually allow scientists to capture
neutrinos or even see them but it can detect and measure the debris
left by collisions between neutrinos and subatomic particles in the
water.
	   The physicists said data collected over the last two years shows
that neutrinos ``oscillate'' or change type as they pass through
the earth, something that only things with mass do.
	   The scientists don't know how much mass a neutrino has, but
suspect they are many billions of times lighter than an electron,
the particle with the smallest known mass.

More shelling, more dead in Kosovo 
</HEADLINE>
By ISMET HAJDARI

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Dozens of houses were aflame and
Serb gunners kept shelling villages in Kosovo, where another four
people were killed in fighting, ethnic Albanian and Serb sources
said Saturday.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, which close to the ethnic
Albanian leadership in the Serb province, said fighting continued
Saturday in the Decani area, about 70 kilometers (45 miles) west of
provincial capital Pristina. The villages of Shaptej, Gramocel and
Babaloc were targeted by the Serbs' heavy artillery.
	   A 3-year-old child, identified as Leutrim Aga, was killed as he
slept in his bed in Gramocel and three other ethnic Albanians were
wounded in that village. Another ethnic Albanian was found dead in
nearby Babaloc.
	   Dozens of houses in the region were burning, the Kosovo
Information Center said. It also claimed that Serbian forces were
shelling border a strip west of Djakovica, 75 kilometers (47 miles)
southwest of Pristina, and that police reinforcements were sent in.
	   Serbian sources said two men were killed in a border clash
between Serb-led Yugoslav army troops and an armed group attempting
to illegally enter the province from Macedonia on Saturday. They
are the first dead at the Macedonian border.
	   The clash occurred in the early morning near the Brod outpost,
85 kilometers (53 miles) south of Pristina, the pro-government
Media Center in Pristina said. The identity of the two killed was
not reported.
	   A Serb policemen was also reported to have died in the Belgrade
military hospital of injuries sustained in previous fighting in
Kosovo.
	   Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million people
and demand independence from Serbia, the larger of two republics
remaining in Yugoslavia. More than 250 people have died since March
1 in escalating clashes between government forces and the Kosovo
Liberation Army, the armed wing of the Albanian independence
movement. Serbian troops are trying to quash the separatist
movement. More than 10,000 Kososo Albanian refugees fled to
northern Albania this week, the largest exodus since ethnic
tensions erupted into large-scale violence in March. Thousands more
are in neighboring Montenegro, which with Serbia, forms present-day
Yugoslavia.
	   Speaking to reporters on Brioni island, Croatia, Ilir Meta,
Albania's state secretary for European integration, said the
situation in Kosovo was getting ``more and more explosive'' each
day.
	   He repeated his government's calls for outside assistance to
cope with the continuing influx of Kosovo refugees.
	   ``If this situation is not stopped immediately, in the coming
hours and days, it can bring an unforeseen catastrophe not only for
the Albanians or Serbs but for the whole region,'' Meta said.
	   ``We consider that enhancement of NATO presence in the region
can help the strengthening of the security,'' he added.
	   Meanwhile, German foreign ministry official Wolfgang Ischinger,
touring the Balkans, met with ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova
in Pristina.
	   Ischinger was scheduled to travel on to Belgrade for meetings
with top government officials. On Friday, he visited neighboring
Macedonia, where he called the expulsions of Kosovo Albanians
``unprecedented,'' saying the international community ``cannot shut
its eyes before that problem.''
	   He added that international pressure on Belgrade government must
continue.
	   On Friday, the United Nations, in an unusually strong statement,
accused Serbian forces of atrocities in Kosovo.
	   In the Decani offensive this week, ethnic Albanian sources
earlier reported 50 dead, 200 missing and several villages
destroyed. There were also unconfirmed reports of a mass grave
containing 300 bodies.
	   A statement by Serbian police issued late Friday contradicted by
the subsequent Albanian account, indicated the latest offensive had
ended, with the ``terrorist gangs'' who tried to block the key
north-south Pec-Decani-Djakovica road ``destroyed.''
	   Most of western Kosovo remained sealed-off Saturday, and it was
impossible to verify the conflicting reports.

<TEXT>
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Ethiopian warplanes bombed a combined
military-civilian airport as well as the outskirts of the Eritrean
capital Saturday, escalating a border dispute between the two
nations in the Horn of Africa.
	   Several bombs struck the civilian part of the airport, setting
off fires as foreigners were trying to leave the country.
	   The government said one MiG fighter-bomber was shot down and the
pilot captured.
	   Reports said the fuel depot on the military side of the airport
was also hit.
	   There was no information available on casualties.
	   ``At the moment, I'm not seeing any light at the end of the
tunnel,'' President Isaias Afwerki told reporters. ``But when I see
it, I want peace.''
	   It was the second day in a row that the airport was hit by
Ethiopian bombs. Initial reports said two Ethiopian Migs had been
shot down Friday, but Eritrea later said only one had been hit.
	   A source familiar with the Eritrean Air Force, who asked not to
be further identified, said it was clear Ethiopia was trying to
wipe out Eritrea's small air force.
	   Isaias, however, said he didn't think the air raids represented
``a great escalation'' in hostilities because the Ethiopians ``have
already taken much more significant actions.''
	   He did not elaborate.
	   Because of the airport attacks, Britain and Germany were having
difficulty Saturday trying to send aircraft to evacuate their
nationals from Eritrea.
	   There were reports that the Dutch government was sending a
frigate to evacuate Europeans from the Red Sea port of Massawa, 75
kilometers (46 miles) northeast of Asmara.
	   Asmara residents again poured into the streets Saturday to
celebrate the downing of the second aircraft.
	   Aaron Greenberg, 22, an American Peace Corps volunteer among 129
Americans and 65 other evacuees who arrived early Saturday in
Frankfurt, Germany on a charter flight from Asmara said residents
drove by the Ethiopian Embassy Friday honking their car horns and
cheering after the first Ethiopian fighter was downed.
	   The U.S. embassy was preparing a second evacuation Saturday of
U.S. citizens still in Asmara. It was not clear where the aircraft
was coming from or where it would go.
	   Ethiopia said Friday's attack was in retaliation an Eritrean
attack on Mekele, 200 kilometers (125 miles) north of Addis. At
least 44 Ethiopians civilians were killed and 135 wounded in the
Mekele attack, according to Radio Fana of the Ethiopian People's
Revolutionary Democratic Front.
	   But reports from Mekele said the Eritreans did not strike until
6 p.m. (1500gmt) Friday, almost four hours after the attack on
Asmara airport.
	   Eritrea and Ethiopia, among the world's poorest nations, are at
odds over at least six areas along their common border which was
traced by Italy after it conquered Eritrea in 1885.
	   The first airstrikes came a day after Ethiopian Prime Minister
Meles Zenawi agreed to a U.S. and Rwandan proposal to end the
border conflict peacefully.
	   But Meles warned that his country's patience was wearing thin
because of Eritrea's refusal to withdraw from territory Ethiopia
claims it occupied a month ago.
	   The Eritrean government issued a statement Friday saying there
were ``still serious issues of detail and implementation to be
worked out'' with the proposal.
	   U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Susan Rice
was in the West African Nation of Burkina Faso Saturday where
foreign ministers from the Organization of African Unity were
meeting in Ouagadougu prior to Monday's summit.
	   The Ethio-Eritrean conflict was expected to feature high on the
agenda.
	   One of the recommendations of the U.S.-Rwandan proposal was that
Eritrea withdraw to positions held before May 6.
	   Eritrea gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993. Eritrean
rebels were instrumental in helping the EPRDF overthrow a 17-year
military regime in July 1991.

South Korea to close six diplomatic missions 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea will close its embassies
in Belgium, Uruguay, Cameroon, Zambia and Yugoslavia by August as
the government tightens its budget, Foreign Ministry officials said
Saturday.
	   The belt-tightening also forced South Korea to close its
consulate-general in Jidda of Saudi Arabia, the officials said.
	   Diplomatic operations in those missions will be taken over by
South Korean embassies in neighboring countries, they said.
	   South Korea called in the International Monetary Fund in
December to bail out its battered economy. Earlier this year, the
government said it planned to close 20 diplomatic missions overseas
to cut costs.

Seles, Sanchez Vicario to meet in women's final 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Monica Seles seeks her fourth French Open title
Saturday, meeting Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in the finals just three
weeks after her father's death.
	   A heavy rain began falling a half hour before the 1300 GMT
starting time, putting the starting time in jeopardy.
	   Seles won three times from 1990-92. Then she was stabbed by a
crazed fan in 1993. She returned two and a half years later, and
took her ninth Grand Slam title at the Australian Open in 1996.
	   Seles ousted top-seeded Martina Hingis in the semifinals here.
	   Entering the match, she was 14-2 against Sanchez Vicario,
including a 6-3, 6-4 win in the 1991 final.
	   Then, Seles' father was watching from the players' box. This
time, she'll be wearing his ring on a chain around her neck.
	   Sanchez Vicario took the French Open titles in 1989 and 1994 and
also captured the U.S. Open in 1994.

Generale Bank board chooses Fortis over ABN Amro takeover bid 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: CORRECTS name of Dutch bank in 2nd, 3rd grafs
<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The board of Belgium's Generale Bank on
Saturday declared hostile a dlrs 12 billion takeover bid from the
Dutch bank ABN Amro and moved instead to accept a rival offer from
the Belgium-Dutch financial group Fortis.
	   The decision came after an 14-hour board meeting that ended at
dawn. The Generale board voted 18 to 7 against the ABN Amro bid
with one abstention.
	   To protect Belgium's largest bank from the ABN Amro takeover,
the board voted 17 to 9 to increase Generale's capital by 10
percent. The capital increase was wholly subscribed and paid up by
Fortis at a cost of 47.4 billion francs (dlrs 1.295 billion).
	   Fortis increased its bid for Generale late Friday to 28,675
francs (dlrs 783) per share, a premium of 7.2 percent over the ABN
Amro bid. Fortis already controls 35.4 percent of Generale's
existing shares.
	   ``We have spent many months analyzing the synergies and benefits
of a combination ... we are wholly confident that these benefits
justify our offer in full,'' Fortis Chairman Maurice Lippens said
in a statement.
	   The Fortis-Generale group will be the 15th largest European
financial institution by market capitalization, Fortis said.

World Cup: Manchester United forward is back in form after ankle injury AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By STEPHAN NASSTROM
<TEXT>
	   LA BAULE, France (AP) _ Sitting on Manchester United's bench
didn't help striker Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's chances of making
Norway's World Cup team.
	   ``I understood that I had to play well in the last two games
before the World Cup,'' Solskjaer said as the Norwegians continued
their preparations Saturday for next week's Group A opener against
Morocco.
	   ``I had to improve and impress my coach (Egil Olsen).
	   Solskjaer did, netting twice in a 6-0 rout of Saudi Arabia in
Norway last week. It was his eighth goal in only 13 national team
appearances and his third of the year. He salvaged a 2-2 draw with
a goal against Belgium in late March.
	   It didn't look like he would make it to the squad after a
disappointing season in the Premier League with United.
	   ``The season started off very badly because I got an ankle
injury and I struggled for two or three months,'' Solskjaer said.
	   ``I didn't play many matches after the Monaco (Champions League)
game in March. I just had to keep my mood up.''
	   Solskjaer, 25, isn't sure if Olsen picked him for the squad
because of his two goals last week or because the coach knows his
capability now that he's finally healthy.
	   ``Maybe he suspects me to play well in big tournaments,''
Solskjaer said. ``I don't know. But I know I'm a much better player
that I've been showing in the last three or four months. My form is
improving all the time and I'm looking forward to the first game.''
	   In its final three exhibitions, the Norwegians beat fellow World
Cup sides Denmark, Mexico and Saudi Arabia by a combined 13-2!
They've won nine and drawn five since losing 1-0 away to Australia
early in 1997.
	   ``It's a very big tournament for Norway, just the third time
we've been in the World Cup,'' Solskjaer said. ``It's the biggest
event in Norway this summer. Everybody's watching us and the
expectations are high. But so are the expectations for the players.
But to win the World Cup, we have to be very, very, very lucky.''
	   Solskjaer's favorite is defending champion Brazil, Norway's last
opponent in Group A. The other one is Scotland.
	   ``I think Brazil has the best team in the world,'' Solskjaer
said. ``When it comes to the big tournaments they always seem to
get going again. It will be a very difficult game for us.''
	   Brazil has never defeated Norway. Despite Ronaldo on the team,
Brazil lost the latest match 4-2 in Oslo last year.
	   ``But just wait,'' Solskjaer said. ``We've played two games in
the last 10 years. But they were just friendlies and this is the
World Cup -- two big differences.
	   ``When we played them last year it looked like they were not 100
percent focused. But we know they're going to be 100 percent this
time. You always want to challenge yourself and play against the
best and Brazil is the best team. If I score against Brazil I will
remember it all my life.

35 people sentenced to life in prison in mass genocide trial 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ A court has convicted 35 people on charges
of genocide and sentenced them to life in prison at the conclusion
of a mass trial in connection with the 1994 slaughter, Radio Rwanda
said Saturday.
	   The court in northeastern Byumba opened a mass trial of 51
defendants in March to accelerate efforts to speed up judicial
proceedings for 130,000 people packed into Rwandan jails in
connection with the genocide.
	   On Friday, the court convicted 38 defendants, sentencing 35 to
life in prison and three to lesser terms. Nine were acquitted, and
four defendants died prison.
	   The 38 were convicted of taking part in, but not organizing, the
90-day slaughter of more than 500,000 minority Tutsis and moderate
Hutus organized by the former Hutu extremist government.
	   The killings ended when Tutsi soldiers ousted the government in
July 1994.
	   Since the first genocide trial in December 1996, Rwandan courts
have convicted more than 350 people. A third were sentenced to
death, most others received prison sentences and a small number
were acquitted.
	   On April 24, the first 22 convicts were executed by firing
squad.
	   Justice officials say they believe the executions prompted more
than 2,000 prisoners to confess to crimes in exchange for leniency.
	   Under a 1996 genocide law, those who confess can have their
sentences reduced if they implicate and help convict the organizers
and leaders of genocide _ most of them former Hutu authorities.
	   On Thursday, a court in Butare, 75 kilometers (45 miles) south
of Kigali, convicted and sentenced to death two former university
professors. They were accused of leading the massacres of Tutsis at
the University of Butare.

World Cup: Sheringham apologizes for late-night drinking 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: LEADS with Sheringham apologizing, adds quotes
Pvs: London
<TEXT>
	   BISHAM ABBEY, England (AP) _ England striker Teddy Sheringham
apologized Saturday for a late-night drinking spree at a Portuguese
nightclub, which openly defied instructions of coach Glenn Hoddle.
	   Hoddle, under some pressure to drop Sheringham, said there was
no similarity between this case and that of Paul Gascoigne. Hoddle
cut Gascoigne last weekend, distressed by his late-night habits and
lack of fitness.
	   ``I've been proud to be a professional footballer for 15
years,'' said Sheringham, speaking in a subdued tone at the team's
training site in southern England.
	   ``I've played 33 times for England and been very proud to do so.
I care about what I do and I want to continue playing for England.
	   ``I have explained what happened in Portugal to Glenn Hoddle. I
now want to put this matter behind me and the England team as
quickly as possible. I intend to learn from the experience.''
	   Sheringham's photo was splashed across papers Friday, showing
him with a cigarette in the mouth and his arm draped a young woman
in a bar on Portugal's Algarve coast. Accompanying stories said he
had been partying and drinking until dawn.
	   After breaking training camp in Spain last weekend, Hoddle
reminded players they were ``on England duty'' and ask them to
return home for a quiet few days before training resumed.
	   The incident put Hoddle on the spot, particularly since
Sheringham is regarded as a much less-talented player than
Gascoigne.
	   ``This is unlike the Paul Gascoigne case,'' Hoddle said. ``I'm
sure people will say they are being treated differently but with
Paul it wasn't a case of a drinking situation but about his
fitness.''
	   On Friday, Sir Bobby Charlton _ a member of England's 1966 World
Cup-winning side _ lambasted Sheringham for his lack of discipline
and suggested he had made England the laughingstock of world
soccer.
	   ``You are the focus of the whole country and if the players
don't have the common sense to behave themselves and act in a
reasonable manner it is absolutely nonsensical to think we have a
chance of winning it,'' Charlton said.
	   Just as the Sheringham and Gascoigne cases were clearing up,
England was rocked Saturday by the antics of a third England
player.
	   News reports said Darren Anderton was involved Wednesday in a
nightclub brawl in the southern town of Bournemouth. Anderton
denied he took part in the fight, although the tabloid Sun reported
a friend was punched in the face.

Violent storm sweeps northern France, one person killed 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A violent hail storm swept across northern France
on Saturday, killing one man who perished house when his house was
set on fire by lightning.
	   Several supermarkets were destroyed in the Pas-de-Calais region
near the English Channel. The hail ruined crops and turned roads
into rivers in a matter of minutes Saturday morning.
	   Houses were flooded, trees were downed and public parks filled
with debris near Bethune, a town 200 kilometers (123 miles)
northwest of Paris.
	   Weather officials predicted further storms in the area.

Test pilot dies in vintage jet crash 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A test pilot died when a vintage jet aircraft he
was flying crashed during a practice flight, police said Saturday.
	   John Davies, 42, made several mayday calls before his Hawker
Hunter jet, a front-line Royal Air Force fighter during the 1950s
and 1960s, crashed nose-down during an emergency landing Friday at
Dunsfold Aerodrome near Godalming, about 30 miles (48 kms)
southwest of London.
	   Davies was found 40 feet (12 meters) from the wreckage wearing a
parachute and pronounced dead at the scene.
	   Davies joined British Aerospace in 1989 and recently became
chief test pilot for its regional aircraft.
	   A company spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, called
him ``a highly professional and widely respected pilot.''
	   He said a flying display at Dunsfold scheduled for Saturday had
been canceled.

Seles faces Sanchez Vicario in final 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES in first 5 grafs with rain delaying play.
By JOCELYN NOVECK
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Spanish players have always excelled on clay
courts. This year, they have a chance to prove that in grand style,
with a sweep of the men's and women's French Open titles.
	   Arantxa Sanchez Vicario gets the first shot. She won two of her
three Grand Slam titles here, and is very comfortable on the red
clay of Roland Garros.
	   But she's up against someone who's done even better here. Monica
Seles won three times, from 1990-92. Then came the horrible
stabbing by a crazed fan in 1993, which kept her off the tour for
2{ years.
	   Now, she's turned adversity into her ally. Her father's death
May 14 seems to have given her new reason to excel; she says her
dad would have wanted her to play here, and she's looking like the
old Monica again.
	   Saturday's final was delayed indefinitely by a rainstorm.
	   Seles shook up the tournament Thursday when she ousted
top-seeded Martina Hingis, the overwhelming favorite, in the
semifinals.
	   Even more daunting for Sanchez Vicario, Seles is 14-2 against
the Spaniard, including a 6-3, 6-4 win in the 1991 final.
	   Then, Seles' father was watching from the players' box. This
year, she is wearing his ring on a chain around her neck.
	   Whatever happens on the women's side, the men's champion will be
a guy from Barcelona.
	   Carlos Moya went out with buddy Felix Mantilla for ice cream
before clobbering him in the semifinals. Now Moya is making dinner
plans with another close friend, Alex Corretja, whom he'll face in
an all-Spanish men's final on Sunday.
	   ``Maybe we can have dinner together. That's the most important
thing, we're going to be friends even if I win or if he wins,''
Corretja said. ``We have to find our game on the court, and then
just enjoy the party.''
	   Moya, Mantilla and Corretja all live in Barcelona and hang out
together on the road.
	   On a muggy center court Friday, Corretja defeated local hero
Cedric Pioline of France 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 to join Moya in the final.
Moya won 5-7, 6-2, 6-4, 6-2 over Mantilla, yet another Spaniard.
	   It will be the second all-Spanish men's final in five years at
the French Open. Sergi Bruguera defeated Alberto Berasategui for
the 1994 title.
	   ``Alex is a close friend of mine,'' Moya said. ``But when you
get on the court, you fight like crazy, you run, you do everything,
you try to step on him if necessary.''
	   Pioline, hoping to become the first Frenchman to win at Roland
Garros since Yannick Noah in 1983, played three five-setters in
reaching the semifinals and appeared drained.
	   ``I felt I did everything a bit slowly. On top of that, you're
not as focused when you're tired. You don't make the right
decisions,'' he said.
	   Corretja noticed.
	   ``I saw that Cedric was not feeling so well, he was struggling
on the court,''
	   Moya mixed powerful groundstrokes with delicate drop shots to
throw off Mantilla, who preferred to rally patiently from the
baseline. Moya also served 10 aces.
	   The Spaniards split the first two sets and Mantilla took a 4-1
lead in the third. But Moya won the next five games, losing just
five points.
	   ``I just decided to take more risks than I was taking before,''
Moya said. ``I decided there had to be a change, otherwise that set
was for him. Two sets to one down, it's tough to come back.''
	   Moya got to match point with a 127-mph serve, then hit a 122-mph
service winner to finish off the 2-hour, 42-minute match. He hit a
ball into the stands, then tossed his white bandana to fans.
	   Moya was runnerup at the 1997 Australian Open, but said he will
be less awed in a final this time.
	   ``In Australia, just to be in the final was a surprise for me.
But here is different.
	   ``I don't want to lose in the final again.''

Reports: Italy fashion company Prada acquires slice of Gucci 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Designer Miuccia Prada has bought a 5
percent share of fashion company Gucci, Italian news reports said
Saturday.
	   No one could be reached at either Prada or Gucci to comment on
the reports carried by Italian news agencies.
	   The ANSA news agency quoted Prada's husband Patrizio Bertilli,
who is Prada's managing director, as saying the operation reflected
the ``diversification strategy'' in the fashion business.
	   ANSA said the operation was valued at dlrs 142 million.
	   The share acquisition appeared to have been unwanted by Gucci.
	   ``Gucci Group announces today that it was informed about the
purchase by the Prada group of 5 percent of Gucci shares,'' a Gucci
statement said, according to ANSA. ``Gucci Group points out that
this investment was not solicited by Gucci and, what's more,
declares that there is no accord or negotiations, under way or
foreseen, with Prada.''
	   Gucci Group shares are quoted on stock exchanges in New York and
Amsterdam.
	   Gucci, whose shoes, bags and other products carry the
distinctive double-G logo, was once a family company.
	   Maurizio Gucci, grandson of the company founder, was the last
family member to sell his shares. He sold his stake to the
Bahrain-based Investcorp in 1993, two years before he was shot to
death in Milan.
	   His ex-wife is among five people on trial here for the slaying.

	   MOSTAR, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ An association of Bosnian
Croat truck drivers from this southwestern city on Saturday called
for internationally-recognized car documents and license plates
their leaders had rejected.
	   Carlos Westendorp, the top international official in Bosnia,
imposed new, common Bosnian documents, after Muslims, Croats and
Serbs failed to agree on them.
	   The new documents are written in both Latin and Cyrillic
alphabet, and the new common car plates are designed in a way that
makes it impossible to recognize from which region the car comes.
	   Westendorp said the citizens with old documents and license
plates will not be able to travel abroad as of June 1.
	   Bosnian Croat leaders bluntly refused the new documents,
claiming they could not accept the Cyrillic script.
	   But the move obviously affected Croats engaged in trade, the
most profitable activity in post-war Bosnia.
	   ``If our (local) governments do not want or cannot act according
to the internal community's rules, then they should compensate for
our losses,'' the Mostar truck drivers said in their open letter to
their leaders, as reported by the Croatian state news agency HINA.
	   They said they cannot travel abroad and if their leaders do not
meet their demands, thy would apply methods ``used by drivers all
around the world.'' They apparently meant road blockades.

Seles faces Sanchez Vicario in final 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES in 5th graf with play beginning after rain delay.
By JOCELYN NOVECK
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Spanish players have always excelled on clay
courts. This year, they have a chance to prove that in grand style,
with a sweep of the men's and women's French Open titles.
	   Arantxa Sanchez Vicario gets the first shot. She won two of her
three Grand Slam titles here, and is very comfortable on the red
clay of Roland Garros.
	   But she's up against someone who's done even better here. Monica
Seles won three times, from 1990-92. Then came the horrible
stabbing by a crazed fan in 1993, which kept her off the tour for
2{ years.
	   Now, she's turned adversity into her ally. Her father's death
May 14 seems to have given her new reason to excel; she says her
dad would have wanted her to play here, and she's looking like the
old Monica again.
	   Saturday's final began 35 minutes late due to a rainstorm.
	   Seles shook up the tournament Thursday when she ousted
top-seeded Martina Hingis, the overwhelming favorite, in the
semifinals.
	   Even more daunting for Sanchez Vicario, Seles is 14-2 against
the Spaniard, including a 6-3, 6-4 win in the 1991 final.
	   Then, Seles' father was watching from the players' box. This
year, she is wearing his ring on a chain around her neck.
	   Whatever happens on the women's side, the men's champion will be
a guy from Barcelona.
	   Carlos Moya went out with buddy Felix Mantilla for ice cream
before clobbering him in the semifinals. Now Moya is making dinner
plans with another close friend, Alex Corretja, whom he'll face in
an all-Spanish men's final on Sunday.
	   ``Maybe we can have dinner together. That's the most important
thing, we're going to be friends even if I win or if he wins,''
Corretja said. ``We have to find our game on the court, and then
just enjoy the party.''
	   Moya, Mantilla and Corretja all live in Barcelona and hang out
together on the road.
	   On a muggy center court Friday, Corretja defeated local hero
Cedric Pioline of France 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 to join Moya in the final.
Moya won 5-7, 6-2, 6-4, 6-2 over Mantilla, yet another Spaniard.
	   It will be the second all-Spanish men's final in five years at
the French Open. Sergi Bruguera defeated Alberto Berasategui for
the 1994 title.
	   ``Alex is a close friend of mine,'' Moya said. ``But when you
get on the court, you fight like crazy, you run, you do everything,
you try to step on him if necessary.''
	   Pioline, hoping to become the first Frenchman to win at Roland
Garros since Yannick Noah in 1983, played three five-setters in
reaching the semifinals and appeared drained.
	   ``I felt I did everything a bit slowly. On top of that, you're
not as focused when you're tired. You don't make the right
decisions,'' he said.
	   Corretja noticed.
	   ``I saw that Cedric was not feeling so well, he was struggling
on the court,''
	   Moya mixed powerful groundstrokes with delicate drop shots to
throw off Mantilla, who preferred to rally patiently from the
baseline. Moya also served 10 aces.
	   The Spaniards split the first two sets and Mantilla took a 4-1
lead in the third. But Moya won the next five games, losing just
five points.
	   ``I just decided to take more risks than I was taking before,''
Moya said. ``I decided there had to be a change, otherwise that set
was for him. Two sets to one down, it's tough to come back.''
	   Moya got to match point with a 127-mph serve, then hit a 122-mph
service winner to finish off the 2-hour, 42-minute match. He hit a
ball into the stands, then tossed his white bandana to fans.
	   Moya was runnerup at the 1997 Australian Open, but said he will
be less awed in a final this time.
	   ``In Australia, just to be in the final was a surprise for me.
But here is different.
	   ``I don't want to lose in the final again.''

Polgar hopes to wipe smile off Karpov's face in battle of the sexes 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Eight speed matches start Tuesday
between Judit Polgar, the world's top female player, and disputed
World Chess Champion Anatoly Karpov, Judit's father Laszlo Polgar
said Saturday.
	   The matches will take place June 9-12 at a Budapest hotel.
	   Polgar, affectionately known in Hungary as ``Papa Polgar,'' was
his usual noncommittal self: ``The match can go one of three
ways.''
	   Judit, 21, was more upbeat in a television interview Friday
evening, in which she was shown pursuing a variety of physical
sports, like tennis.
	   When asked what sort of man Karpov is, she said ``He smiles a
lot,'' but hastened to add ``when things go his way.''
	   ``I hope they won't next week,'' she added with a smile.
	   Karpov is the reigning champion of the World Chess Federation,
known by its French acronym FIDE, although fellow Russian Garry
Kasparov is considered the true world champion.
	   Karpov defended his title against India's Viswanathan Anand in
January.
	   Laszlo Polgar recalled that when he was training his three
daughters - Zsofia, 23, and Zsuzsa, 29, are the other two - to be
chess geniuses, ``people like Karpov had a 100-member team behind
them, something we could never afford.''
	   Now computerized chess has pretty well leveled the field, Polgar
added.

Israeli, Egyptian peace activists meet 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Amid stalled peace talks, Israeli and
Egyptian activists met Saturday to discuss ways of building a
grass-roots peace campaign.
	   The Israeli delegates were from Peace Now, Israel's largest
peace group, which has thousand of members. The Egyptians
represented the Egyptian Peace Movement, a small group that
features several prominent writers and intellectuals.
	   The two groups are trying to hammer out a document that will
``clearly define the aims of ... peace and the mechanism to achieve
it,'' the London-based Al-Hayat newspaper quoted Lotfi el-Khouli of
the Egyptian group as saying.
	   Palestinian and Israeli peace talks stalled after Israel refused
to accept a U.S. proposal for a further 13.1 percent Israeli troop
withdrawal from the West Bank. The Palestinians have accepted the
proposal.
	   The Peace Now delegation arrived in Cairo Friday night.

BBC reporters plead innocent to illegal filming in Yemen overline

Eds: UPDATES with pleas, further charges; ADDS byline; CHANGES
By AHMAD AL-HAJ
<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Three British Broadcasting Corp. television
journalists pleaded not guilty here Saturday to a charge of filming
without government permission.
	   The journalists, who came to Yemen to report on kidnapping, also
pleaded innocent to charges of filming military installations and
importing a satellite telephone without informing the authorities.
	   BBC producer Robin Barnwell, reporter Rageh Omaar and cameraman
Frank Smith appeared in court with their lawyer, al-Sheik Tareq
Abdullah.
	   After a short hearing, the judge adjourned the case to Sunday.
	   The journalists were arrested May 26 when they returned to the
capital, San`a, after spending a week with the Bani Dhabyan tribe
near Marib, 170 kilometers (105 miles) northeast of San`a.
	   The Bani Dhabyan have carried out numerous kidnappings,
including the seizure in April of a British teacher, David
Mitchell, his wife Caroline, and their 14-year old son, Ben. The
Mitchells were released unharmed after two weeks.
	   The prosecutor told the court the journalists had hung ``Do Not
Disturb'' signs on their San`a hotel doors to trick the authorities
into thinking they had not left town.
	   He said they had traveled to parts of western Yemen where
kidnappings have taken place, despite being refused permission by
the government. As such they had violated the law by illegally
entering an area and gathering information.
	   The prosecutor handed into the court six video cassettes
confiscated from the BBC team.
	   During the past few years, armed tribesmen, who rule over large
parts of Yemen, have kidnapped numerous foreigners. They demand
concessions from the government in return for the hostages, who are
usually released unharmed.

Air France strike enters sixth day; pilots pessimistic suspended, smaller union pessimistic.

EDS: LEDES with new quotes, Air France president saying talks only

By DEBORAH SEWARD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin on Saturday
said the government was prepared to intervene in the Air France
strike, which is now in its sixth day and could tarnish the World
Cup.
	   Air France President Jean-Cyril Spinetta said talks that lasted
all night without reaching agreement had been ``suspended.'' The
pilots indicated that new talks could take place Monday.
	   The strike has embarrassed France ahead of the World Cup, which
opens Wednesday.
	   ``It's not the World Cup that concerns me, it's the recovery
underway of the company and its future,'' Jospin told reporters
before a meeting of the national council of the Socialist Party.
	   Air France is in the midst of a major restructuring process and
needs to make pay cuts to free up capital to modernize the company
and its fleet of planes.
	   The World Cup will take place ``normally,'' Jospin said.
``French people don't need to take a plane to attend the World Cup.
Nor do Europeans, and we are going to find a lot of airline
companies to transport the rest at the expense of Air France.''
	   Air France is the official World Cup carrier and is committed to
transporting the teams from one venue to another. The company has
said it will meet that obligation.
	   Jospin said the French government was ready to intervene to help
end the the strike and would play a role ``in the hours to come.''
There have been suggestions the government may name a mediator, but
Jospin did not elaborate.
	   Talks between Air France management and the representatives of
the striking pilots broke off Saturday shortly before 8 a.m. (0600
GMT) after an entire night of negotiations.
	   The stumbling blocks remain planned salary cuts and a proposal
by Air France to give pilots stock in exchange for the pay
reductions, as well as a two-tier pay scale in which younger pilots
earn less.
	   Spinetta, the president of Air France, said the two sides had
worked out a way to end the conflict and talks were simply
suspended to give both parties time to reflect.
	   Spinetta said there had been ``very positive advances'' in the
discussions which ``have only been suspended.''
	   The pilots appeared more pessimistic.
	   ``It's so serious I prefer not to talk to you about it,'' said
Christian Paris, the spokesman for the SNPL, the main pilots'
union. However, SNPL President Jean-Charles Corbet indicated new
talks could eventually take place Monday.
	   Etienne Lichtenberger, president of the SPAC, one of the smaller
unions, said Air France's proposals were ``insufficient'' and that
it was ``out of the question'' to sign an agreement this weekend.
	   Only about 25 percent of Air France's flights were expected to
take off Saturday. Meanwhile, a train strike disrupted service
Saturday, although many lines were running as scheduled.
	   Top sports officials on Friday insisted that the June 10-July 12
World Cup would go ahead and that France would play the perfect
host.
	   ``I can assure you all 64 matches will be played and the French
will do everything possible to welcome the foreigners coming to
France,'' said Sepp Blatter, a senior soccer official and candidate
for the sport's top job _ head of the world governing body FIFA.
	   Michel Platini, former French soccer great and co-president of
the World Cup organizing committee, said five years of planning
would not be wrecked by labor disputes.
	   ``De Gaulle once said it was difficult to govern a country with
360 types of cheese. But we shall persevere,'' he said, referring
to former French leader Gen. Charles de Gaulle.

Yeltsin urges India to sign non-proliferation pact 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin spoke with India's
prime minister on Saturday and urged India to sign the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty, the Kremlin said.
	   In a telephone conversation with Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee, Yeltsin expressed concern over the recent spate of
nuclear testing by India and Pakistan, according to Yeltsin's
presidential press service.
	   ``It was stressed that the Indian-Pakistani nuclear competition
has spread far beyond the region. It undermines the nuclear
non-proliferation regime and sets a dangerous precedent of nuclear
weapons spread,'' the press service said.
	   The Kremlin also said Yeltsin and Vajpayee discussed how Russia
might play a role in encouraging a dialog between India and
Pakistan.
	   India set off five underground nuclear tests last month,
prompting Pakistan to retaliate with a series of tests two weeks
later.
	   Under the 1970 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the five
members of the United Nations Security Council are the only nations
allowed to maintain nuclear arsenals. India and Pakistan have
refused to sign the treaty.
	   The Security Council has tentatively agreed on a resolution
urging India and Pakistan to stop their nuclear testing and denying
them status as nuclear states.

One killed, 12 wounded in four explosions in Hyderabad 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ A vegetable vendor selling his goods
from an open cart was killed Saturday and 12 people were wounded in
a series of explosions in the Pakistani city of Hyderabad, police
said.
	   No one claimed responsibility, but police said they suspected
extremists from a Sindh nationalist movement who had called a
general strike to protest the attempted assassination of their
leader two days earlier.
	   Five hand grenades or small bombs exploded in several areas of
the city. A 60-year-old man selling vegetables in the open-air
market was the only fatality. Four others were wounded by the same
device, said police officials on customary condition of anonymity.
	   A total of eight others were wounded in the other four attacks.
	   Activists of the Jeay Sindh movement, which wants more autonomy
and economic development for the Sindh province, also demonstrated
and burned tires in Karachi, the provincial capital, 180 kilometers
(110 miles) to the southwest of Hyderabad.

Generale Bank board chooses Fortis over ABN Amro takeover bid 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with more details, quotes from Generale spokeswoman
<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The board of Belgium's Generale Bank NV
voted Saturday to declare hostile a dlrs 12 billion takeover bid
from the Dutch bank ABN Amro Holding NV and accept a rival offer
from the Belgium-Dutch financial group Fortis AG.
	   The decision came after an 14-hour board meeting that ended at
dawn. The Generale board voted 18 to 7 against the ABN Amro bid
with one abstention.
	   To protect Belgium's largest bank from the ABN Amro takeover,
the board voted 17 to 9 to exercise a ``poison-pill'' option that
increases Generale's capital by 10 percent.
	   The capital increase was wholly subscribed and paid up by Fortis
at a cost of 47.4 billion francs (dlrs 1.295 billion).
	   Fortis increased its bid for Generale 16 percent late Friday to
28,675 francs (dlrs 783) per share, a premium of 7.2 percent over
the ABN Amro bid.
	   Fortis already controls 35.4 percent of Generale shares and its
stake will rise to 42 percent with the capital increase.
	   ``We have spent many months analyzing the synergies and benefits
of a combination ... we are wholly confident that these benefits
justify our offer in full,'' Fortis Chairman Maurice Lippens said
in a statement.
	   The Fortis-Generale group will be the 15th largest European
financial institution by market capitalization, Fortis said.
	   Roughly half of the remaining Generale Bank shares are owned by
the public and half by institutional investors, said Generale
spokeswoman Kathleen Steel.
	   She said Fortis will have to pay a total of around 500 billion
francs (dlrs 13.7 billion) to buy all the remaining shares.
	   She said the board members turned against ABN Amro's bid because
they were concerned a takeover by the Dutch bank would lead to the
dismantling of Generale.
	   ``The said ABN's assurances that it would create a European
decision-making center in Brussels aren't sufficient to protect the
integrity of Generale Bank,'' she said.

	   CAZORLA, Spain (AP) _ Spain's Alexei Shirov will face Gary
Kasparov in a World Chess Council championship match next fall
after defeating Vladimir Kramnik of Russia on Saturday in the WCC
challenger's competition in Spain.
	   Shirov, 25, who was born in Riga, Latvia, and is now a Spanish
citizen, beat Kramnik, 22, on the 48th move in the ninth game of
the match. His score went up to 5.5 after the win, with Kramnik
trailing him with 3.5.
	   Kramnik, who is seen by many as a future world champion and
ranked third after Russian Anatoly Karpov and Indian Viswanathan
Anand, lost concentration in his games and lost all chances of
taking the match when he was defeated by Shirov in the fourth game.
	   On Oct. 15 Spain's representative will try to claim the World
Chess Council championship in an 18-game match against title-holder
Kasparov that will be played in the southern city of Seville. The
second part of the match will be taken to Linares.

BBC reporters plead innocent to illegal filming in Yemen 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with pleas, edits. ADDS byline.
By AHMAD AL-HAJ
<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Three British Broadcasting Corp. TV
journalists pleaded not guilty in Yemen on Saturday to a charge of
filming without government permission.
	   The journalists, who came to Yemen to report on kidnapping, also
pleaded innocent to charges of filming military installations and
importing a satellite telephone without informing authorities.
	   BBC producer Robin Barnwell, reporter Rageh Omaar and cameraman
Frank Smith appeared in court with their lawyer, al-Sheik Tareq
Abdullah.
	   The judge adjourned the case until Sunday after a short hearing.
	   The journalists were arrested May 26 when they returned to the
capital, San`a, after spending a week with the Bani Dhabyan tribe
near Marib, 170 kilometers (105 miles) northeast of San`a.
	   The Bani Dhabyan have carried out numerous kidnappings,
including the April seizing of a British teacher, his wife, and
their 14-year old son. They were released unharmed after two weeks.
	   The prosecutor told the court the journalists hung ``Do Not
Disturb'' signs on their San`a hotel-room doors to trick
authorities into thinking they were still in town.
	   He said they traveled to parts of western Yemen where
kidnappings have taken place despite being refused permission by
the government. As such, they violated the law by illegally
entering an area and gathering information, he said.
	   The prosecutor handed into the court six video cassettes
confiscated from the BBC team.
	   During the past few years, armed tribesmen who rule over large
parts of Yemen have kidnapped numerous foreigners. They demand
concessions from the government in return for the hostages, who are
usually released unharmed.

Sri Lanka spinners put team on course to victory BY CALLISTUS DAVY

<TEXT>
	   GALLE, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lanka's spinners put their side on
course to a possible victory over New Zealand in the second cricket
test at the Galle cricket stadium on Saturday.
	   After taking a first innings lead of 130 runs, Sri Lanka plucked
five quick wickets to leave New Zealand on a shaky 94 for 5 with
Adam Parore and Chris Cairns struggling at the crease on 25 and 16
respectively.
	   Left-arm spinner Niroshan Bandaratilleke accounted for three of
the wickets _ Bryan Young (11), Mathew Horne (3) and Craig Mcmillan
(1) _ on a pitch that offered plenty of turn and bounce.
	   Young was caught by Hashan Tillekaratne at mid off after Horne
was adjudged leg-before. Mcmillan was caught by Sanath Jayasuriya
at slip.
	   Stephen Fleming looked as if he could cope with the turn and
bounce as the dug in for 115 minutes. But with his score on 10, he
was ruled out leg-before offering no stroke to a ball from
off-spinner Muttiah Muralitheran that bounced and straightened.
	   Nathan Astle faced 70 balls before he played a ball from
Aravinda De Silva onto his stumps for 13.
	   New Zealand earlier managed to restrict Sri Lanka from the
overnight 197 for 3 to a total of 323, but could not prevent Mahela
Jayawardena from making his maiden test century (167).
	   Jayawardena defied New Zealand for 335 minutes and was adjudged
leg-before off Chris Harris after 18 hits to the ropes.
	   Sri Lanka's hopes of making a bigger first innings total was
thwarted by quick dismissals of Arjuna Ranatunga and Romesh
Kaluwitharana.

Central European and Balkan countries condemn Kosovo violence 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BRIONI, Croatia (AP) _ A group of 16 central European and Balkan
countries on Saturday condemned violence and all forms of terrorism
in the embattled southern Serbian province of Kosovo.
	   They also called for an ``immediate halt to violence that is
escalating,'' urged political dialogue between the Serbian
government and ethnic Albanians and expressed concern over the
``recent increase in the use of force by the Yugoslav
authorities.''
	   The group, called Central European Initiative, met amid reports
of more shelling and casualties in Kosovo.
	   More than 250 people have died since March 1 in worsening
clashes between government forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army,
the armed wing of the Albanian independence movement.
	   The Central European Initiative was formed in 1989 to boost
cooperation between its member countries. Yugoslavia, now composed
of Serbia and Montenegro, is not a member. Italy and Austria are
the only European Union members in it.
	   The countries' foreign affairs ministers debated for hours on
whether to describe the Kosovo conflict as violence or Serb
``ethnic cleansing,'' a term coined during the Bosnian war to
describe the mass expulsion of ethnic minorities.
	   They eventually decided to use both terms in their statement.
	   Albania, the poorest European country now accommodating
thousands of Kosovo refugees, is also a member of the group.
	   Its minister for European integrations, Ilir Meta, called on the
West to act toughly against Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
``in order to push him to stop his strategy of ethnic cleansing''
of Albanians in Kosovo.
	   ``If this situation is not stopped immediately, in the coming
hours and days, it can bring an unforeseen catastrophe not only for
the Albanians or Serbs but for the whole region,'' Meta said.
	   He said that an increased NATO presence in the region would
improve the security.
	   Austria's Foreign Minister, Wolfgang Schuessel, said he would
ask Europe to increase its aid to Albania.
	   Schuessel, who met Milosevic in Belgrade on Friday, said the
latest Kosovo developments are ``clear evidence that it is a well
planned action and offensive by (Serbian) special forces, police
and the army.''
	   Speaking for neutral Austria, which is not a member of the North
Atlantic Alliance, he seemed to be reluctant to support an
intervention by NATO.

May, Powell lead Hanshin in win against Yokohama 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Alonzo Powell drove in three runs and Darrel May
went the distance in a four-hit shutout, leading the Hanshin Tigers
to a 5-0 win over the Yokohama Baystars.
	   Powell, formerly of the Seattle Mariners, drove in one run with
a first-inning double before smashing a two-run homer in the fifth.
It was his sixth homerun of the year.
	   May, a left-hander formerly with the Anaheim Angels, struck out
10 and went the distance for his first win in Japan.
	   Yokohama starting pitcher Hiroki Nomura dropped to 4-4 after
giving up four runs on seven hits over five innings.
	   At the Nagoya Dome, the Yomiuri Giants Korean pitching star Cho
Sung-min earned his second complete-game shutout of the season as
Yomiuri trounced the Chunichi Dragons 10-0. It was Cho's sixth win
of the season against 2 losses.
	   Giants catcher Shinici Murata went 4-for-4 and drove in three
runs including his first homer of the season.
	   In Iwate, northern Japan, Mitsuru Manaka drove in three runs
with a bases-loaded triple in the eighth to push the Yakult
Swallows past the league-leading Hiroshima Carp 6-2.
	   Yakult hurler Kazuhisa Ishii struck out nine for the win,
improving to a record of 5-2.
	   In the Pacific League, Julio Franco, formerly of the Milwaukee
Brewers, hit a two-run homer and teammates Koichi Hori and Takashi
Tachikawa each followed with two-run homers of their own as the
Chiba Lotte Marines rolled over the the Nippon Ham Fighters 9-3.
	   Lotte starter Tomohiro Kuroki earned his fifth win after giving
up five hits over five innings.
	   At the Fukuoka Dome, Daiei's Koji Akiyama hit a three-run homer
and Chihiro Hamana drove in three runs to lift the Fukuoka Daiei
Hawks past the Kintetsu Buffaloes 10-4. With the victory, Daiei
moved into a tie for first place in the league with the Nippon Ham
Fighters.
	   Rain postponed a scheduled afternoon game between the Seibu
Lions and the Orix BlueWave.

Southern African commercial corridor to boost development 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   RESSANO GARCIA, Mozambique (AP) _ Two African leaders launched a
transport project Saturday that is expected to be a linchpin for
development in once strife-torn southern Africa.
	   South African President Nelson Mandela and Mozambique President
Joaquim Chissano dedicated construction for a toll road that will
connect the region's industrial heartland around Johannesburg with
one of the world's poorest nations.
	   The 2 billion rand (dlrs 400 million) toll road, expected to be
finished in three years, is being built by a private binational
company, Trans African Concessions, that will collect tolls for 30
years, then turn it over to the governments.
	   ``We are saying to the world that Africa is not only a zone of
instability, but rather one of economic progress and development,''
Chissano said to the audience of more than 1,000 gathered at the
remote border post of Ressano Garcia.
	   The 350 kilometer (217 mile) project is part of the Maputo
Development Corridor, which includes the upgrading of the port in
Mozambique's capital city to accommodate larger ships and increased
trade.
	   The toll road will improve the current stretch between Witbank
in South Africa _ 125 kilometers (78 miles) east of Johannesburg _
to Maputo on the Indian Ocean.
	   Mozambique offers harbor access to landlocked Zimbabwe, Malawi,
Zambia and Swaziland, and extra capacity for goods that now move
through overcrowded South African ports.
	   The corridor will provide the finishing stretch for the newly
opened Trans Kalahari Highway through Namibia and Botswana that
will eventually tie together Atlantic and Indian Ocean ports,
providing a much shorter route to European and American markets.
	   The projects open up economic opportunities for the southern
African region emerging from the stagnation of the apartheid era
that ended in 1994 with South Africa's first all-race elections.
	   ``As we co-operated in our struggle for liberation, as we stood
together against oppression and violence, so we now take hands to
improve the lives of our people,'' Mandela said.
	   South African Transport Minister Mac Maharaj said the corridor
had already attracted project proposals worth more than 35 billion
rand (dlrs 7 billion).
	   Two projects for Mozambique include a dlrs 1.1 billion aluminum
smelter project expected to begin production in 2000; and an iron
and steel plant that will use waste magnetite transported by slurry
pipe or rail from South Africa. Energy for the steel plant will
come from Mozambique's Pande gas fields, being developed by the
American company Enron.

World Cup: Spaniards weary of dismissing Nigeria despite 5-1 thrashing 
</HEADLINE>
By CIARAN GILES
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   CHANTILLY, France (AP) _ A third consecutive defeat for Nigeria
should augur well for the team's first World Cup opponent, Spain,
but Javier Clemente's Iberian crew are taking the African side's
woes with caution and believe the team cannot be dismissed yet.
	   ``They're just preparatory games, the World Cup is different,''
Spanish defender Abelardo Fernandez said Saturday after the squad's
training session. ``In the cup everyone is much more motivated and
eager.''
	   Up to now Spain has feared Nigeria, the 1994 Olympic champion,
more than its other Group D opponents Bulgaria and Paraguay.
	   But although the Super Eagles have had their wings severely
clipped in exhibition games by a 1-0 defeat against Germany
followed by a 3-0 drubbing by Yugoslavia and Friday's 5-1 trouncing
by the Netherlands, the Spaniards are wary.
	   ``I think they're still a strong team, despite the goals and the
defeats,'' added Abelardo. ``They're going to cause a lot of
problems, that's for sure.''
	   Spanish coach Javier Clemente was equally dismissive of the
Nigerians' defeat saying such results ``don't count.''
	   As the June 13 game against Nigeria gets nearer, Clemente looks
to be slowly stepping up the pressure on his players. On Saturday,
the 22-man squad was put through a tough, fast-paced two-hour
exercise and playing session in hot and humid conditions at their
base just north of Paris.
	   Veteran keeper Andoni Zubizarreta was back between the posts
indicating that his recovery from a muscle injury is on track.
	   The session was attended by some 200 spectators while the
presence of some 100 journalists from a wide variety of countries
appeared to be a sign that more is expected of Spain in this its
11th World Cup appearance.
	   ``We have the team to achieve something big now,'' said
Abelardo. ``All we need is that little bit of luck to get that step
further and consecrate Spain, in results and titles, among the
greats.''
	   Despite being ranked among the world's leading soccer nations,
at international level the side has only won the European
championship in 1964 and the Olympic gold in 1992. The furthest it
has reached in the World Cup was fourth place in 1950.

Eds: Updates with Sanchez Vicario winning first set
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Arantxa Sanchez Vicario took the lead over Monica
Seles by capturing the first set tiebreaker 7-6 (7-5) Saturday at
the French Open
	   Seles served for the first set at 5-3 but failed, missing an
easy overhead that could have given her set point.
	   Yet Sanchez Vicario battled back to win the tiebreaker 7-5.
	   A heavy rain began falling a half hour before the start and
delayed the match about 40 minutes.
	   Once it began, Seles jumped to a 2-0 lead, breaking Sanchez
Vicario in the second game behind hit some driving winners and a
smash of a weak defensive lob.
	   The fourth-seeded Sanchez Vicario took the break back in the
next game and evened it at 2-2.
	   Sanchez Vicario was scrambling to get the ball back in the
points but Seles was not pounding the groundstrokes with the same
accuracy as she did in pounding top-seeded Martina Hingis in the
semifinals.
	   The pair held to make it 3-3 and Seles won her next service at
love to go up 4-3 then took a 5-3 lead and served for the set.
	   At 30-30, Seles had a chance to get to set point at but sent a
smash into the net to give Sanchez Vicario a break point.
	   Sanchez Vicario came back to win the game, and held to make it
5-5. She forced a tiebreaker at 6-6 with Seles starting to make
unforced errors, four in the 12th game.
	   In the tiebreaker, Seles got in trouble with two drop shots
failing to put her down 1-4.
	   After Sanchez Vicario went up 5-1, Seles came back to even it at
5-5.
	   A service return into the net by Seles gave Sanchez Vicario a
set point and another unforced error by Seles gave the Spainiard
the first set.
	   Seles ended the 51-minute first set with 26 unforced errors,
Sanchez Vicario had just 13.
	   Seles was seeking her fourth French Open title, Sanchez Vicario
her third.
	   Seles won three times from 1990-92. Then she was stabbed by a
crazed fan in 1993. She returned two and a half years later, and
took her ninth Grand Slam title at the Australian Open in 1996.
	   Entering the match, she was 14-2 against Sanchez Vicario,
including a 6-3, 6-4 win in the 1991 final.
	   Then, Seles' father was watching from the players' box. This
time, she'll be wearing his ring on a chain around her neck.
	   Sanchez Vicario took the French Open titles in 1989 and 1994 and
also captured the U.S. Open in 1994.

Leading party congress: full steam ahead with coalition talks 
</HEADLINE>
By ALEX BANDY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ The winner of last month's elections
got a resounding endorsement from his party's congress Saturday to
negotiate with a populist party in order to form Hungary's next
government.
	   ``The election results made a coalition unavoidable,'' Viktor
Orban, the head of the Young Democrats-Civic Party, told party
delegates in a Budapest sports.
	   With 393 voting in favor, two against and two abstentions, they
authorized leaders to start negotiations with the Independent
Smallholders Party.
	   ``We are happy with the decision and hope the two delegations
will do everything in their power to have a government as soon as
possible,'' Zsolt Lanyi, the Smallholders' vice-president, told the
state news agency MTI after the vote.
	   The center-right Young Democrats-Civic Party won 147 seats in
the elections, well short of a majority in the 386-seat parliament.
	   Since Orban's other allies, the Hungarian Democratic Forum, only
have 18 seats, the Smallholders Party is pivotal for his governing
coalition.
	   Some in Orban's party had second thoughts.
	   ``It's impossible to govern with the Smallholders, but we must
try, because we have no choice,'' said Peter Toelgyessy, a leading
member in the Orban party.
	   It is not going to be a placid marriage.
	   Orban, a bright, 35-year-old law graduate is known for his quick
mind and rapid-fire talk. He will have to stand his ground against
Small Holders' leader Jozsef Torgyan, a 65-year-old former lawyer,
who is Hungary's most colorful politician, but something of a loose
cannon.
	   Orban has emphasized his party will retain the portfolios of
finance and a new big ministry in charge of the economy.
	   Those tapped for these posts agree on the need to pursue a
strict fiscal policy, something very hard to reconcile with the
Smallholders' budget-busting election promises.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Floodwaters forced the closure of an airport
Saturday in the remote diamond-producing region of Yakutia, the

Exiled general says Cabinet ministers tried to assassinate him 
</HEADLINE>

By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Exiled Lebanese Gen. Michel Aoun said
Saturday he is reluctant to go home because three current Cabinet
ministers once conspired to assassinate him.
	   Aoun would not name the alleged assassins in the Cabinet of
President Elias Hrawi. He said he would like to carry on his
crusade against Syrian domination once it becomes safe for him to
return to Lebanon.
	   Aoun said the attempts on his life occurred during his 1988-90
tenure as an interim prime minister, when he launched a doomed
``war of liberation'' against Syria's 40,000 forces in Lebanon and
then took on powerful right-wing Christian militiamen.
	   ``I had a close shave. Three ministers right now, three separate
ministers were behind these attempts on my life,'' Aoun said in an
exclusive interview with The Associated Press.
	   ``You don't know if they are going to kill you, to put you in
jail, or to `have an accident,''' he said.
	   His political downfall came in a 1990 Syrian army offensive that
ended the civil war. He sought asylum in the French Embassy and
then fled to France, where he has lived ever since.
	   Aoun said he would like to go home to promote his cause but
insisted he would never again seek public office.
	   Though Aoun has not seen his homeland since 1990, the Maronite
Catholic general still inspires strong passions in Lebanon.
	   Late last year, a Lebanese government ban on a TV interview with
Aoun led to clashes between his supporters and security forces
outside the television station in Beirut.
	   Though most of his partisans are Christian, he also has Muslim
and Druse backers who see him as a potential national savior.
	   Aoun made it clear Saturday that his long campaign to end
Syria's domination has merely shifted to the political front _ he
has abandoned his combat fatigues for a gray flannel suit.
	   ``The main part of our struggle is to liberate the country,''
Aoun said. ``Before the liberation of the country, no reform is
possible.''
	   Making his first foreign visit since going into exile, Aoun is
spending two weeks in Australia rallying the huge expatriate
Lebanese community here and lecturing on the Mideast crisis.
	   Hundreds of Lebanese Australians cheered him on his arrival at
Sydney's airport Saturday afternoon, waving signs and posters of
him.

World Cup: Loud, costly campaign for soccer's boss nears an end With Sports-Soccer-Havelange AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By LARRY SIDDONS
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The spending and shouting are just about over. Now
comes the vote to decide who will lead soccer into the 21st
century.
	   The race between Lennart Johansson, head of Europe's soccer
union UEFA, and Sepp Blatter, general secretary of the
international federation FIFA, has been expensive and nasty, with
the two campaigns costing more than dlrs 1 million and slinging
more mud than a motocross rally.
	   A close outcome is expected Monday, when 192 members of FIFA
vote for a successor to Joao Havelange, the Brazilian industrialist
who has held the presidency like a personal fiefdom for 24 years.
	   The job is traditionally part-time and unpaid, but it is one of
the two most powerful positions in international sports, perhaps
even more so than the presidency of the International Olympic
Committee.
	   It carries the flag of soccer, the game that elicits passion and
attracts sponsor dollars like no other. That attraction has led
critics to question how the FIFA presidency might have added to
Havelange's personal wealth; a recent article in the German
newspaper Frankfurter Rundschau said the outgoing president rang up
dlrs 2.7 million in travel, hotel and other expenses in the past
four years, about 4 percent of FIFA's budget.
	   Although he supports Blatter and urged him to run, Havelange
said Saturday he had no idea who would take over once he departs at
the end of the World Cup next month.
	   ``The outcome will be known when the vote is held, not before,''
he said. ``It's like when a child is born _ you have to give it
time.''
	   Johansson was supposed to attend the same news conference where
Havelange appeared but pulled out at the last minute. Officials
said he wanted to have lunch with his home-country Swedish soccer
federation instead.
	   For more than a year, Johansson was the only candidate in the
race. But after much waffling, Blatter announced his candidacy 2
1/2 months ago and since then has waged a globe-girdling campaign
seeking votes.
	   He predicted Friday that he would win, even saying that he was
sure of almost half the votes from Europe, where Johansson has been
seen as unchallengeable. Soon after his prediction, Blatter won an
important endorsement from the English Football Association, which
sent Johansson into a rage.
	   The UEFA head accused Keith Wiseman, chairman of the English FA,
of breaking his word of support and called it a ``very personal
decision'' aimed at securing a seat for Wiseman on the FIFA
executive committee. Johansson also said he remained confident of
victory.
	   Name-calling and backstabbing has been prominent in this
campaign. Johansson has accused Blatter of stealing his platform
and acting as a straw man for Havelange; Blatter, in turn, has said
that Johansson was a puppet of the German soccer federation and
Antonio Matarese, the powerful head of the Italian soccer
federation who probably would take over at UEFA if the Swede is
elected FIFA president.
	   There even has been a dispute over the voting itself, normally
just a mundane procession of dark-suited officials to a voting
booth. UEFA said last month that it would keep a close watch on how
FIFA handled the balloting, lest it favor Blatter.
	   And not only has the campaign been nasty, it's been expensive.
Blatter said he has spent $300,000, and estimates put Johansson's
campaign costs at up to $800,000, much of it financed by UEFA.
	   Havelange said he was not dismayed at the conflicts that have
arisen.
	   ``I have said before that FIFA is not a dictatorship, and to
have an election you need two candidates. I wish we had four or
five,'' he said. ``To have free competition is very good for
football. I would hope that my successor would carry on our good
results.''
	   Whoever succeeds Havelange won't have to worry about money. The
outgoing president said FIFA had a cash reserve of dlrs 4 million,
with dlrs 800 million in sponsorships and uncounted millions more
in TV rights fees. ``Enough to stage two World Cups,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Arantxa Sanchez Vicario took the lead over Monica
Seles by capturing the first set 7-6 (7-5) Saturday at the French
Open.
	   Seles served for the first set at 5-3 but failed, missing an
easy overhead that could have given her set point.
	   Yet Sanchez Vicario battled back to win the tiebreaker, 7-5,
after a hard-fought set in which both players lost their serve
twice. There were no aces in the first set.
	   A heavy rain began falling a half hour before the start and
delayed the match about 40 minutes.
	   Once it began, Seles jumped to a 2-0 lead, breaking Sanchez
Vicario in the second game behind some driving winners and a smash
of a weak defensive lob.
	   The fourth-seeded Sanchez Vicario took the break back in the
next game and evened it at 2-2.
	   Throughout, Sanchez Vicario scrambled well to get the ball back.
Seles was not pounding the groundstrokes with the same accuracy as
she did in pounding top-seeded Martina Hingis in the semifinals.
	   Both held serve to make it 3-3, and Seles won her next service

	   At 30-30, Seles had a chance to get to set point, but sent a

	   The Spaniard came back to win the game, and held to make it 5-5.
She forced a tiebreaker at 6-6 with Seles starting to make unforced

	   In the tiebreaker, Seles got into trouble, missing two drop
shots to put her down 1-4.
	   After Sanchez Vicario went up 5-1, Seles came back to even it at
5-5.
	   A service return into the net by Seles gave Sanchez Vicario a
set point, and another unforced error gave the Spaniard the first
set.
	   Seles ended the 51-minute first set with 26 unforced errors.
Sanchez Vicario had just 13.
	   Seles was seeking her fourth French Open title, Sanchez Vicario
her third.
	   Seles won three times from 1990-92. Then she was stabbed by a
crazed fan in 1993. She returned two and a half years later, and
took her ninth Grand Slam title at the Australian Open in 1996.
	   Entering the match, she was 14-2 against Sanchez Vicario,
including a 6-3, 6-4 win in the 1991 final.
	   Then, Seles' father was watching from the players' box. This
time, she'll be wearing his ring on a chain around her neck.
	   Sanchez Vicario took the French Open titles in 1989 and 1994 and
also captured the U.S. Open in 1994.

Eds: Contains items on Egypt and Kuwait
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egyptian geologists have discovered in the
Gulf of Suez what they say is Egypt's largest oil deposit, the
leading newspaper Al Ahram reported Saturday.
	   The deposit will have an estimated output of 19,500 barrels per
day, Al-Ahram said.
	   It lies about 18 kilometers (11 miles) off the coast of Ras
Gharib, which is 250 kilometers (156 miles) southeast of Cairo.
	   The largest deposit currently being exploited in Egypt has an
output of 10,000 barrels per day.
	   The find is expected to boost Egypt's output, which currently
stands at 850,000 barrels of oil per day. The country exports about
half of this amount.
	   ____
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Kuwait will not announce any further oil cuts in
production before Gulf ministers meet in the Saudi Arabian capital
of Riyadh later this month, Oil Minister Sheik Saud al-Sabah said
in remarks published Saturday.
	   Sheik Sabah said Kuwait would not ``take any steps'' regarding
production cuts before the Gulf Cooperation Council meeting on June
16, the newspaper Al-Anba reported. The GCC groups Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman and the United Arab Emirates.
	   Sheik Saud welcomed the latest pledges to cut output by the
so-called ``Riyadh Pact'' producers. Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and
Mexico announced Thursday that they would cut a combined 450,000
barrels per day of their output on July 1 in order to boost
depressed prices.
	   This would be in addition to earlier voluntary cutbacks agreed
by Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC
countries in March. Those cuts totaled around 1.5 million barrels
per day.
	   However, the market remains skeptical about the impact of the
latest cuts. It is widely expected that additional cuts from Kuwait
and United Arab Emirates will be announced soon to support the
Riyadh Pact move.
	   Kuwait, which has an OPEC production quota of 2.19 million
barrels a day, cut back by 125,000 barrels per day on April 1.
	   ____
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ A parliamentary panel has slashed the deficit in
the proposed 1998-99 budget by some 400 million dinars (dlrs 1.30
billion), reducing it to 1.33 billion dinars (dlrs 4.34 billion),
Al-Watan daily reported Saturday.
	   The head of the parliament's financial and economic committee,
Ahmed al-Nassar, told the newspaper the cuts were made from
military spending and money earmarked for transportation equipment
and services.
	   The 50-seat legislature has to vote on the budget before the
beginning of the fiscal year that starts July 1.
	   The budget forecasts revenues of 3.12 billion dinars (dlrs 10.19
billion), mostly from oil calculated at dlrs 12 a barrel.
	   Al-Nassar said the budget did not include taxes and fees for
services the government wants to introduce as part of a plan to
reform the economy, which is dependent on oil and government
spending. Lawmakers have criticized the measures.
	   The government had originally estimated the expenditure at 4.86
billion dinars (dlrs 15.88 billion).

	   FAISABAD, Afghanistan _ Pakistan tried Saturday to exact a heavy
price for delivering relief supplies to earthquake-stricken
northern Afghanistan, where up to 5,000 people were killed: enough
fuel to get its three helicopters back home.
	   The hours-long standoff between Pakistani and U.N. officials at
the Faisabad airstrip illustrated the competition for scarce
supplies that has plagued the relief operation from the start,
slowing aid and prolonging the misery of the tens of thousands of
survivors.
	   The United Nations and Red Cross have been able to muster only
three small helicopters to shuttle aid to the estimated 100 damaged
villages. The mountainous area is remote, and many roads were
damaged or destroyed in the May 29 quake, which local officials
estimate killed up to 5,000 people.
	   That paltry fleet and a severe shortage of aircraft fuel set the
aid effort back several days.
	   Now there is enough fuel to keep the three helicopters ferrying
back and forth all day long. But earlier Saturday. three Pakistani
helicopters delivered their goods and demanded a fill-up nearly
equal to the entire U.N. store, about 5,000 liters.
	   Ayaz Wazir, director of Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
said he had been promised the fuel by the U.N. office in Islamabad.
Asked by reporters why he didn't donate the helicopters to the aid
effort instead of taking them back to Pakistan, he said, ``First
give us the fuel. Then we'll give you an answer.''
	   The United Nations prevailed, persuading the Pakistanis to
siphon fuel from an Afghan military plane parked on the airstrip.
	   Meanwhile, the U.N. and Red Cross helicopters resumed delivery
of wheat, oil and plastic sheeting to the worst-hit villages.
	   But the deliveries were still behind survivors' needs. As of
Saturday, a full week after the earthquake, they had reached only
31 villages.
	   Survivors have besieged arriving helicopters, asking for food,
water and material to build shelters. In the hard-hit area of
Rostaq, villagers kicked bags of wheat, saying they were inadequate
to feed the hungry survivors.
	   An aid official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the
humanitarian effort was being hindered by companies trying to
charge exorbitant prices for planes or helicopters _ dlrs 7,000 an
hour in one case _ and crews refusing to fly in Afghanistan, which
they consider a war zone.
	   In Aspakhan, a village reached Saturday, three woman crouched
atop a tangle of broken sticks and dried mud, just above what used
to be the window of their house. Hiding their faces with their
veils and sheltering two nursing babies from the dust of the ruined
village, they watched warily as an aid worker approach.
	   ``We have been waiting for you,'' said a woman known only as
Farishtana, as a couple of toddlers peeked from behind her
shoulder.
	   ``All we've had to eat is tea and a little bread. The vegetables
are there _ under that wall,'' she said, pointing down the ravine
below the village. ``Our animals are all dead.''

World Cup: Teammates vie for Romario's spot on Brazilian team 
</HEADLINE>
By PETER MUELLO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   OZOIR LA FERRIERE, France (AP) _ Romario is gone, and the battle
is on for his place in Brazil's starting lineup.
	   For now, Bebeto is the No. 2 striker, alongside Ronaldo. But
Edmundo openly says he deserves the job, and Denilson could upstage
them both once the Cup starts next Wednesday.
	   The rivalry has created a problem for coach Mario Zagallo. While
he encourages healthy competition among his players, the dispute
has created rifts that veterans say could weaken the group.
	   The disharmony was Edmundo's doing. In an interview Friday with
a Rio de Janeiro radio station, Edmundo said he deserved to start
because he was ``in better physical and technical shape, and
overall I'm better than Bebeto.''
	   The comment created turmoil at training camp and drew a sharp
reply from the high command. Team coordinator Zico said no one
would be allowed to disrupt the group, and Zagallo added that if
there were disciplinary problems among his 22 players, Brazil could
easily ``finish the Cup with 21.''
	   The problem is, Edmundo may be right.
	   At 27, Edmundo is at peak form. Last year he broke Brazil's
single-season scoring record with 29 goals and led Rio's Vasco da
Gama to the national championship, before jumping to Italy's
Fiorentina.
	   On the national team, he has nine goals in 34 games and was a
standout last year in the Tournoi de France and the America Cup,
which Brazil won for the first time away from home.
	   Edmundo's problem is his temper. Nicknamed ``Animal,'' he was
red-carded seven times last year and routinely fights with opposing
players, teammates and referees.
	   For now, the starter is Bebeto, Romario's co-star on Brazil's
1994 World Cup champions. Bebeto started in Brazil's 3-0 win over
Andorra this week, and Zagallo confirmed he would also start in the
Cup opener against Scotland.
	   The coach insisted his reasons for choosing Bebeto were purely
technical.
	   ``He can score, he moves well, he's more of an attacker than
Edmundo,'' Zagallo said. ``And he played in the (1996) Olympics
with Ronaldo, so they are better meshed.''
	   But Zagallo puts a high premium on experience. On his original
22-player roster, nine were World Cup veterans, although injuries
removed Romario and fullback Marcio Santos. Bebeto is playing in
his third World Cup _ Edmundo in his first.
	   Bebeto also was something of a surprise on the Cup roster. At
34, he has lost the mercurial quickness of four years ago. On his
Botafogo club, he has failed to produce the goals fans expected.
	   Neither Bebeto nor Edmundo can fill the role of Romario, who was
cut this week after reinjuring his calf. Brazil's offense pivoted
around Romario, the team's point of reference in the penalty area.
No one on the team now has his style or presence.
	   Many fans want to see 20-year-old sensation Denilson join
Ronaldo, 21, in what promises to be the Brazilian attack of the
future.
	   Denilson won a starting berth at the 1997 America Cup and held
it until last month, when Zagallo opted to start Rivaldo and
Giovanni, teammates on Spain's FC Barcelona.
	   But Zagallo is an unabashed admirer of Denilson, whose wizardly
ball-handling skills and brash, in-your-face dribbles have earned
him comparisons with the legendary Garrincha.
	   Zagallo guaranteed Denilson will see playing time in the Cup _
and possibly on the front line, his true position. If Bebeto and
Edmundo don't measure up, the anticipated Denilson-Ronaldo dynasty
could start now.

World Cup: Boyd sees Brazil game as chance for Scottish redemption 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   AVIGNON, France (AP) _ Scotland, which hasn't made a splash on
the international scene in decades, is looking for a little
redemption at the World Cup.
	   It could come in a hurry. The Scots play defending champion
Brazil in the tournament's opening match on Wednesday.
	   ``We probably wanted to avoid Brazil, but since they came out of
the hat, we have been up for it,'' defender Tom Boyd said at
Saturday's training session. ``To be honest, I think we've got a
good chance and if we play at our best, we can certainly take
something.''
	   Scotland is one of the oldest soccer-playing nations in the
world, but it has never made it past the first round in seven
previous appearances at the World Cup, and its storied club teams
such as Rangers and Celtic have met with little success in recent
European competitions.
	   ``In recent years, it has been nothing short of deplorable,''
Boyd said. ``There is a gulf between international and club level,
that is without question. You just have to look at the results we
have had in Europe.''
	   Boyd expects this team, which won seven of 10 games in
qualifying, will be different. Even if Scotland loses to Brazil, it
can advance from Group A with victories over Norway and Morocco.
	   ``As a nation getting all the best players together, we have
performed,'' Boyd said. ``We're leading the way, and hopefully the
clubs can follow _ we can spark them to improve by doing well
here.''

Seles evens final in second set 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with second set
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Monica Seles evened the French Open women's final
against Arantxa Sanchez Vicario Saturday, routing the Spaniard 6-0.
	   After losing a tight first set, 7-6 (7-5), Seles came into the
second set a new player. Gone were the errors that hampered her in
the first.
	   She broke Sanchez Vicario three times, jumping to a 5-0 lead in
just 18 minutes.
	   At that point, with Seles about to serve for the set, Sanchez
Vicario elected to take a bathroom break, and Seles decided to
follow.
	   When the players came back, Seles was still on target, hitting
two winners on the line for a 40-0 lead. She closed out the set
with an ace _ the first of the match.
	   It was a contrast to the first set, when Seles had served for
the set at 5-3 but missed an easy overhead that could have given
her set point.
	   Sanchez Vicario battled back to win the tiebreaker, 7-5, after a
hard-fought set in which both players lost their serve twice.
	   A heavy rain began falling a half hour before the start and
delayed the match about 40 minutes.
	   Once it began, Seles jumped to a 2-0 lead, breaking Sanchez
Vicario in the second game behind some driving winners and a smash
of a weak defensive lob.
	   The fourth-seeded Sanchez Vicario took the break back in the
next game and evened it at 2-2.
	   Throughout, Sanchez Vicario scrambled well to get the ball back.
Seles was not pounding the groundstrokes with the same accuracy as
she did in beating top-seeded Martina Hingis in the semifinals.
	   Both held serve to make it 3-3, and Seles won her next service
at love to go up 4-3. She then took a 5-3 lead and served for the
set.
	   At 30-30, Seles had a chance to get to set point, but sent a
smash into the net to give Sanchez Vicario a break point.
	   The Spaniard came back to win the game, and held to make it 5-5.
She forced a tiebreaker at 6-6 with Seles starting to make unforced
errors _ four in the 12th game.
	   In the tiebreaker, Seles got into trouble, missing two drop
shots to put her down 1-4.
	   But after Sanchez Vicario went up 5-1, Seles came back to even
it at 5-5.
	   A service return into the net by Seles gave Sanchez Vicario a
set point, and another unforced error gave the Spaniard the first
set.
	   Seles ended the 51-minute first set with 26 unforced errors.
Sanchez Vicario had just 13.
	   Seles was seeking her fourth French Open title, Sanchez Vicario
her third.
	   Seles won three times from 1990-92. Then she was stabbed by a
crazed fan in 1993. She returned two and a half years later, and
took her ninth Grand Slam title at the Australian Open in 1996.
	   Entering the match, she was 14-2 against Sanchez Vicario,
including a 6-3, 6-4 win in the 1991 final.
	   Then, Seles' father was watching from the players' box. This
time, she was wearing his ring on a chain around her neck.
	   Sanchez Vicario took the French Open titles in 1989 and 1994 and
also captured the U.S. Open in 1994.

14 life sentences, 12 other convictions in Uffizi and other car bombings 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   FLORENCE, Italy (AP) _ Twenty-four mobsters, including top Cosa
Nostra bosses, were convicted Saturday of a rash of 1993 car
bombings that claimed 10 lives, damaged the Uffizi Gallery here,
two churches in Rome and an art gallery in Milan.
	   The court agreed with prosecutors that 14 of the 26 defendants
deserved Italy's stiffest punishment, life in prison. Among those
getting life sentences were top mob bosses Leoluca Bagarella and
Filippo Graviano, as well as fugitive Bernardo Provenzano, the man
many investigators believe may run Cosa Nostra from his hideouts.
	   The bombings were allegedly carried out to avenge the arrest in
Palermo in January 1993 of Salvatore Riina, the reputed ``boss of
bosses,'' who had been a fugitive for more than 20 years.
	   Riina, who is already serving several life sentences, will be
tried separately for the bombings. Prosecutors alleged that the
Mafia decided to target places of art and religion since culture is
Italy's biggest resource.
	   In May 1993, a car bomb blast narrowly missed an Italian talk
show host, who had denounced the Mafia, as he was leaving his
studio in Rome. A few days later, a car bomb went off in Florence,
killing five people in apartments near the Uffizi and seriously
damaging the museum and more than 200 works of art.
	   In July 1993, on the same night, a blast in Milan near a modern
art gallery killed five people, and two separate car bombings in
Rome devastated San Giorgio Velabro church in the historic center
and heavily damaged St. John Lateran basilica.
	   A 20-year-sentence was handed down to Giovanni Brusca, a Mafioso
who has been trying to convince authorities to let him join a
witness protection program in exchange for testimony in this and
other cases.
	   Other sentences ranged from 12 to 28 years in prison.
	   Two defendants were acquitted.
	   The convictions of the mob bosses of the bombings ``is a sign
that the Mafia then had taken on a terroristic dimension,'' said
Prosecutor Pierluigi Vigna.
	   The reading of the verdicts was interrupted for more than an
hour when tecnical problems cut off a video connection from the
courtroom to several Italian prisons where the defendants are
serving out other sentences.
	   Italian defendants don't have to be in court for their trials
and can be tried while fugitive.

ambitions, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif headed to the Gulf region
Saturday to ensure that oil keeps flowing to Pakistan.
	   Officials said Sharif's mission to Saudi Arabia and the United

Britain denies plans it plans to legalize the Irish Republican Army 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The British government denied
Saturday that it plans to lift an 80-year ban on the Irish
Republican Army under new legislation providing for the release of
paramilitary prisoners.
	   Pro-British Protestant politicians opposed to the Northern
Ireland peace agreement claimed after Friday's publication of the
bill that it opened the way for legalizing membership of the IRA.
Victims of IRA bombings and their relatives also voiced dismay.
	   ``It's absolutely disgusting. It's beyond belief,'' said Jim
Dixon, who was injured in an IRA bombing in Enniskillen in 1987 and
is now a candidate for the new Northern Ireland Assembly on a
``voice for victims'' ticket. He warned that the IRA has said
clearly it will resume fighting ``if they don't get what they
want.''
	   Responding to the criticism, Northern Ireland Secretary Mo
Mowlam, the chief British official in the province, issued a
statement Saturday saying: ``Reports that I am preparing to make
the IRA a legal organization are absolutely untrue.''
	   Under the bill published Friday, up to 400 prisoners belonging
to the IRA and pro-British Protestant paramilitary groups could be
released by mid-2000 - but only if the groups maintain cease-fires
and cooperate with a commission charged with supervising the
handover of weapons.
	   ``The Northern Ireland Bill simply provides a means for
specifying organizations whose supporters will not benefit from
early releases,'' Mowlam said.
	   But Unionist opponents of the peace agreement described the
legislation as a ``legal muddle'' and said they believe it clears
the way for the IRA to be declared legal.
	   ``The IRA is proscribed, yet in this legislation they would not
be deemed a terrorist organization,'' said Peter Robinson, deputy
leader of the hard-line Protestant Democratic Unionist Party.
	   ``We will be putting down a series of amendments to try and
tighten this up and make more rigorous the terms which define a
terrorist organization,'' he said.
	   Early releases are a key provision of the peace agreement which
approved in a May 22 referendum. It provides for this British
province to have a Protestant-Catholic power-sharing assembly and
formal links with the Irish Republic.
	   The bill stipulates that each prisoner's case will be reviewed
individually, that prisoners deemed still dangerous to the public
would be kept inside, and that those released will be jailed again
if they commit new violence. Publishing the bill is the first step
toward introduction in Parliament.
	   The IRA and two Protestant-based groups, the Ulster Defense
Association and Ulster Volunteer Force, have maintained cease-fires
and their political allies endorsed the agreement.
	   Members of dissident groups that have not declared cease-fires,
including the Irish National Liberation Army and Loyalist Volunteer
Force, are not eligible for parole.
	   The province's largest Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists,
whose support was vital for the agreement, said it accepted the
wording of the bill, but would suggest some amendments in the House
of Commons ``to try to make it watertight.''

Dutch pilot inadvertently drops missile on Bavarian field 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   GRAFENWOEHR, Germany (AP) _ A Dutch helicopter pilot fired wide
of the mark during missile practice on Saturday, hitting an open
field near a Bavarian town instead of a military training area.
	   The impact left a crater 50 centimeters (20 inches) deep and one
meter (yard) across about 500 meters (550 yards) from the intended
target area on U.S. military grounds, police said. No one was
injured.
	   The pilot was firing a J-model ``Hellfire'' missile as part of a
training exercise, the U.S. Seventh Army training command said in a
news release. The cause of the error was under investigation.

High-Rise wins English Derby 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   EPSOM, England (AP) _ High-Rise with Olivier Peslier aboard won
the English Derby Saturday, beating City Honours by a nose with
third place to Border Arrow.
	   High-Rise _ an unbeaten colt _ went off as a 20-1 shot in the
mile-and-a-half race with City Honours 12-1 and Border Arrow 25-1.
Outsider Sunshine Street, who led for much of the early going,
finished fourth at 150-1.
	   It was the talented French jockey's fourth ride in the English
Derby and his first victory. He was the first French rider in 35
years to win England's most important flat race.
	   The favorites in the 15-horse field all faltered including Cape
Verdi, who was trying to become the first filly since 1916 to win
this race.
	   Cape Verdi went off as an 11-4 favorite but finished ninth.
	   Also back in the pack were other pre-race favorites like Greek
Dance (fifth), Second Empire (eighth), and King of Kings (15th).
	   ``I knew he was very well _ he had been working incredibly
well,'' said High-Rise trainer Luca Cumani. ``He is an unbeaten
horse and you must give him credit for that.
	   ``The immediate plan in my opinion ought to be to go for the
Irish Derby. A mile and a half suits him very well.''

Pantani wins time trial, virtually clinching Giro 
</HEADLINE>
EDs: will be updated
<TEXT>
	   LUGANO, Switzerland (AP) _ Marco Pantani virtually clinched the
1998 Tour of Italy Saturday after surprising even his biggest
supporters by finishing ahead of Russian Pavel Tonkov in the
individual time trial.
	   Tonkov, who trailed Pantani by 1-minute, 28-seconds going into
the Giro's penultimate stage, was largely expected to defeat
Pantani in Saturday's time trial. In a slightly longer time trial
last week, Tonkov beat Pantani by over two minutes.
	   But, charged up by the prospect of winning his first Giro,
Pantani burst out of the start and rode powerfully throughout the
34-kilometer (21-mile) race, gaining another 5 seconds on Tonkov.
The Italian now has a 1-minute, 33-second advantage over Tonkov.
	   ``I was extremely concentrated from the start,'' said an
exuberant Pantani. ``I warmed up well -- better than in other
occasions -- and then I gave everything I had.''
	   It is next to impossible for Tonkov, the 1996 Giro winner, to
catch Pantani in Sunday's final stage, a mostly flat 173-kilometer
(107-mile) ride from Lugano, Switzerland to Milan, Italy.
	   Pantani, 28, who was sidelined for the entire 1996 season with a
broken leg, took over the leader's pink jersey on Tuesday and has
held it ever since.

World Cup: FIFA president hopes for joint Korean team for next World Cup With Sports-Soccer-FIFA Meetings AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By LARRY SIDDONS
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A united Korean team should be fielded for the next
World Cup and a mammoth stadium in North Korea's capital used for
some of the games, the outgoing president of soccer's world body
said Saturday.
	   FIFA head Joao Havelange said a joint North-South team had been
a success at the last under-16 world championships in Portugal and
that a similar effort for the World Cup would fulfill one of the
goals of his long-running presidency.
	   ``My idea is to unite the two countries on the sports field for
the World Cup in 2002,'' Havelange said at a news conference.
	   He said he had visited Pyongyang, North Korea's capital, four
times and seen the construction of a 100,000-seat stadium there.
	   ``With a united team, perhaps that stadium could be used for
some matches,'' Havelange said.
	   South Korea and Japan were picked by FIFA to co-host the 2002
World Cup, the first time soccer's world championship will be held
in two nations.
	   Havelange, who steps down from the FIFA presidency after 24
years at the end of this year's World Cup, also said he hoped to
eventually help stage an exhibition match between Israel and
Palestine in New York.
	   That idea was broached to him four years ago by Vice President
Al Gore, Havelange said, but it remained one of the unfulfilled
goals of his tenure despite repeated efforts and three meetings
with Palestine leader Yassar Arafat.
	   ``I would like to help prepare a match in New York City between
the two national sides,'' he said. ``Unfortunately, that has not
been possible.''
	   North and South Korea remain technically at war and eye each
other across the world's most heavily armed border. They
traditionally have fielded separate teams for international sports
events and South Korea's soccer team is competing in the World Cup
for the fourth consecutive tournament. North Korea did not qualify.
	   When the International Olympic Committee awarded 1988 Summer
Games to the South Korean capital of Seoul, North Korea demanded
that it share in the host role. Almost two years of negotiations
failed to resolve the dispute and the North boycotted the Seoul
Olympics.
	   North Korea, the last Stalinist state, has been wracked by
famine in recent years and is receiving various types of foreign
aid. The new president of South Korea, Kim Dae-jung, has called for
a softer approach to the North by the United States and other
Western nations.

Pakistani Prime Minister arrives in Emirates on Gulf tour 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif arrived here Saturday for talks on the consequences of
the Indian and Pakistani nuclear tests, the official Emirates News
Agency reported.
	   Sharif, accompanied by Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khan and
Petroleum Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan, is expected to meet
Emirates President Sheik Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the agency
said.
	   Pakistani diplomats said Sharif would head later Saturday for
Saudi Arabia. He is expected to hold talks with King Fahd and Crown
Prince Abdullah on Sunday in the Red Sea port of Jiddah, said the
Pakistani consul general in the city, Omar Khan Ali Shersay.
	   Sharif's mission to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates
was aimed at securing the required credit to maintain oil imports,
government officials in Islamabad said.
	   Pakistan bought dlrs 1.2 billion of petroleum products from Gulf
states during the nine months up to March.
	   India exploded five nuclear devices last month. Pakistan replied
with six nuclear tests, despite warnings from the U.N. Security
Council, the United States and other nations.
	   Led by the United States, several countries imposed economic
sanctions against the two South Asian rivals. The embargo is
designed to hinder foreign investment and credit.
	   Islamabad expects the sanctions to cut off financing for aid
projects from the International Monetary Fund, and to lower
Pakistan's credit rating, making borrowing more expensive. Oil
concessions from the oil-rich Gulf could help offset the effect of
the sanctions.
	   Last week, both Saudi Arabia and the Emirates expressed
understanding for Islamabad's view that its nuclear tests were a
means to preserve its security and territorial integrity. However,
both countries also said the tests increased tension in the region.
	   Sharif is expected to return to Pakistan Sunday.

European Union deplores bombings by Ethiopia and Eritrea, calls for ceasefire 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The European Union on Saturday deplored the
``serious escalation'' in the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea
and called for an immediate ceasefire.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, whose country holds the
rotating EU presidency, said the 15 member states were ``extremely
concerned'' at the increased attacks. The EU ``particularly
deplores'' Ethiopia's bombing of Eritrea's main airport at Asmara
and Eritrea's bombing of the Ethiopian town of Mekelle on Friday
and Saturday, he said in a statement.
	   ``We urge both parties to agree a ceasefire and to resume
cooperation with the facilitators who are working to find a
peaceful negotiated settlement. We remind both parties of the
potential consequences this dispute has for future regional
stability,'' Cook said.
	   Britain and other EU members are supporting U.S. and Rwandan
efforts to broker a peace deal between the warring countries.
Britain and other countries have been unable to evacuate their
nationals from Eritrea becausing of the bombings.
	   ``These unnecessary developments threaten the lives of innocent
civilians and jeopardize plans for the evacuation of foreign
nationals, including EU citizens and other foreign nationals, who
wish to leave,'' Cook noted.

Former French defense minister appeals for conservative unity 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Former Defense Minister Charles Millon appealed
Saturday for French conservatives to unite in order to fight both
the left and the far right National Front.
	   Speaking at the first national convention of his new movement
called ``The Right,'' Million said no racists, antismemites or
xenophobes would be accepted into his movement.
	   French conservatives were badly shaken following local elections
this spring when a handful of them, including Millon, accepted the
backing of the far right in order to win regional presidencies.
	   Millon decided to form The Right after the Union for French
Democracy (UDF) party to which he belonged expelled him and others
who won regional presidencies National Front backing.
	   The UDF and the Rally for the Republic, the party of President
Jacques Chirac, recently decided to join forces in a new movement
called the Alliance.
	   The National Front has sapped the strength of traditional
conservatives in regional years. And the conservatives themselves
have lost the last legislative and regional elections to the left.
	   Both The Right and the Alliance are expected to hold political
conventions early this fall to work out their programs and
electoral strategies.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Arantxa Sanchez Vicario won the French Open
Saturday for the third time, defeating Monica Seles 7-6 (7-5), 0-6,
6-3.
	   The victory spoiled what would have been a fairy-tale ending for
Seles, who was playing just three weeks after the death of her
father, coach and mentor, Karolj Seles.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Hoping to curb a dangerous arms race in
South Asia, the U.N. Security Council agreed Saturday on a Japanese
resolution urging India and Pakistan to halt their nuclear weapons
programs and denying them status as nuclear states.
	   Council ambassadors met privately Saturday morning for final
consultations. Council President Antonio Monteiro then scheduled a
formal meeting later in the day to take a vote.
	   That signaled the 15 members' agreement to the text, which was
tentatively accepted late Friday. Council ambassadors forwarded the
text to their capitals overnight and then reconvened to report
their instructions.
	   ``By their actions, India and Pakistan have seriously threatened
their global non-proliferation regime,'' British Ambassador John
Weston said.

World Cup: France still looking striker who can score 
</HEADLINE>
By MARIUS TURULA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ France is still at a loss as to how it
will score at the World Cup. The latest hope is David Trezeguet,
only 20 years old and largely untested at the international level.
	   At the end of yet another frustrating exhibition match,
Trezeguet came on as a late substitute and scored the lone goal in
Friday's 1-0 win over Finland, further underlining the inefficiency
of starting forwards Stephane Guivarc'h and Christophe Dugarry.
	   ``(Trezeguet) is always good when he comes into a game as a
substitute,'' coach Aime Jacquet said Saturday. ``When the
opponents are a bit tired, it is always easier to play.''
	   France plays its World Cup opener against South Africa on Friday
and Trezeguet could well be France's best bet.
	   Guivarc'h has hit only one goal in his seven internationals and
Jacquet admitted that the French league's top scorer did not move
well against Finland. Guivarc'h also failed to set up a good
partnership with Zinedine Zidane and Youri Djorkaeff, an essential
link if France is to get on the scoresheet.
	   Jacquet used the backbone of his starting World Cup lineup
Friday and hoped the strike force would click. It didn't.
	   ``Our efficiency in front of goal is our big problem,'' said
captain Didier Deschamps.
	   ``Trezeguet the Savior,'' headlined L'Equipe sports daily
Saturday. It was his first goal for France in five appearances this
year, all of them from the substitutes bench. He had been hampered
by a thigh injury early on in France's preparation campaign and
hasn't had too much match rhythm recently.
	   But Trezeguet had a great season with Monaco, which rode his
goals into the semifinals of the European Champions Cup. Trezeguet
was born in France, but moved to Argentina at the age of 2 and even
made his debut in the Argentine league at 16 before returning to
France.
	   His rise could well be the demise of Dugarry, the Marseille
striker who long looked a longshot to make it on the French squad.
	   After a game of futility, Dugarry missed an open shot on goal
from 10 meters out just before being replaced the second half.
	   ``When it's really important, I won't miss a shot like that,''
Dugarry said.
	   But, Saturday, the big question was whether he would get another
shot in the World Cup.

It was a very difficult match, filled with emotion.''

old form so soon after her father's death. Sanchez Vicario

Once disgraced Albanian leader finds opportunity in Kosovo crisis

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ An orgy of arms looting last year began
former Albanian President Sali Berisha's tumble from power. The
weapons _ and the fighting in Kosovo where many of them are being
used _ could now figure in his strategy for a political comeback.
	   Berisha's power base in northern Albania is the conduit for
automatic rifles, mortars and other guerrilla-type weapons reaching
ethnic Albanian separatists in the neighboring Serbian province of
Kosovo. The arms are lugged across the rugged border on rutted
roads or overland by mule.
	   Some diplomats are drawing a clearer link between the convoys
and Berisha's own battles against Prime Minister Fatos Nano.
	   The arms traffic puts needed money in the pockets of Berisha's
hard-core political backers while making Nano's government appear
unable to control the northeastern frontier, diplomats said.
	   At the same time, Berisha can portray himself as a champion of
Albanian nationalism and the outgunned Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Internal unrest in Albania, touched off by Kosovo, could offer
Berisha and his allies the footholds they need to climb back toward
power, diplomats speculated.
	   This is an alarming prospect for many European leaders, who have
repeatedly urged Berisha to end anti-government ``agitation'' since
his election defeat in June 1997.
	   ``No one is saying _ yet _ that Berisha is orchestrating the
arms trafficking,'' said a Balkan diplomat who spoke on condition
of anonymity. ``But he's certainly not doing anything to discourage
it. It's to his advantage.''
	   At a meeting of opposition parties on Friday, Berisha called
Nano's government an ``enemy of the Albanian nation'' _ a reference
to ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and elsewhere in the Balkans. He
called the Serb forces ``barbarians'' and the rebels ``blessed.''
	   Such rhetoric further alienates Berisha from the West, where
political and military leaders have expressed resolve not to allow
the Kosovo conflict to escalate. About 10,000 refugees have fled to
Albania to escape a Serb offensive opened last week.
	   Fighting in Kosovo since March has claimed at least 250 lives.
But refugees have given unconfirmed reports of a mass grave with
300 bodies, according to the Belgrade-based Beta news agency.
	   ``Berisha is playing a dangerous game,'' said a Western
diplomat. ``If he is seen as encouraging the (Kosovo Liberation
Army), then he can become something of a pariah.''
	   The diplomat added that there are indications that the arms
trafficking is becoming more consolidated and moving away from a
``bazaar of freelancers.'' Also, the amount of weapons crossing the
border appears to have increased significantly since the Kosovo
rebels ``have grown in support so quickly,'' the diplomat said.
	   Some Kosovo separatist bands are now outfitted with looted
Albanian army uniforms, giving at least the appearance of greater
unity among the ragtag units.
	   ``Signals are showing that a new Bosnia is coming up,'' Ilir
Meta, Albania's state secretary for European integration, said at
an international conference in Brioni, Croatia.
	   In the Albanian capital, Tirana, Nano has felt the pressure. He
has been forced to fend off Berisha's political attacks while
trying to cope with the refugee dilemma.
	   Nano appealed to opposition parties on Saturday ``to stop using
this critical situation for electoral intentions.''
	   He allocated more than dlrs 300,000 from Albanian meager
treasury reserves to help Albanian families housing refugees. He
also urged at least dlrs 20 million in international aid.
	   Yet the main thrust of the Albanian effort is to secure a
commitment for an international force, possibly under NATO command,
to watch the border. This could not only curb the arms and refugee
flow, but give Nano an important political buffer: he wouldn't have
to use Albanian forces against Albanian arms smugglers.
	   ``We need international assistance ... especially on stopping
all the types of (arms) smuggling,'' said Nano, who estimated that
2,000 tons of looted military shells and other explosives are
stashed around Albania.
	   Hundreds of thousands of guns and other military equipment were
taken in the anarchy in early 1997 following the collapse of dodgy
investment schemes that cost many Albanians their entire savings.
Berisha's government was widely blamed for permitting the financial
meltdown.
	   But the Kosovo conflict has given him a new political rallying
cry.
	   ``No government, no matter how bad it is, steps down on its own
unless we make it do so,'' said Genc Pollo, the Democratic Party
deputy chairman.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ An orgy of arms looting last year began
former Albanian President Sali Berisha's tumble from power. The
weapons _ and the fighting in Kosovo where many of them are being
used _ could now figure in his strategy for a political comeback.
	   Berisha's power base in northern Albania is the conduit for
automatic rifles, mortars and other guerrilla-type weapons reaching
ethnic Albanian separatists in the neighboring Serbian province of
Kosovo. The arms are lugged across the rugged border on rutted
roads or overland by mule.
	   Some diplomats are drawing a clearer link between the convoys
and Berisha's own battles against Prime Minister Fatos Nano.
	   The arms traffic puts needed money in the pockets of Berisha's
hard-core political backers while making Nano's government appear
unable to control the northeastern frontier, diplomats said.
	   At the same time, Berisha can portray himself as a champion of
Albanian nationalism and the outgunned Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Internal unrest in Albania, touched off by Kosovo, could offer
Berisha and his allies the footholds they need to climb back toward
power, diplomats speculated.
	   This is an alarming prospect for many European leaders, who have
repeatedly urged Berisha to end anti-government ``agitation'' since
his election defeat in June 1997.
	   ``No one is saying _ yet _ that Berisha is orchestrating the
arms trafficking,'' said a Balkan diplomat who spoke on condition
of anonymity. ``But he's certainly not doing anything to discourage
it. It's to his advantage.''
	   At a meeting of opposition parties on Friday, Berisha called
Nano's government an ``enemy of the Albanian nation'' _ a reference
to ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and elsewhere in the Balkans. He
called the Serb forces ``barbarians'' and the rebels ``blessed.''
	   Such rhetoric further alienates Berisha from the West, where
political and military leaders have expressed resolve not to allow
the Kosovo conflict to escalate. About 10,000 refugees have fled to
Albania to escape a Serb offensive opened last week.
	   Fighting in Kosovo since March has claimed at least 250 lives.
But refugees have given unconfirmed reports of a mass grave with
300 bodies, according to the Belgrade-based Beta news agency.
	   ``Berisha is playing a dangerous game,'' said a Western
diplomat. ``If he is seen as encouraging the (Kosovo Liberation
Army), then he can become something of a pariah.''
	   The diplomat added that there are indications that the arms
trafficking is becoming more consolidated and moving away from a
``bazaar of freelancers.'' Also, the amount of weapons crossing the
border appears to have increased significantly since the Kosovo
rebels ``have grown in support so quickly,'' the diplomat said.
	   Some Kosovo separatist bands are now outfitted with looted
Albanian army uniforms, giving at least the appearance of greater
unity among the ragtag units.
	   ``Signals are showing that a new Bosnia is coming up,'' Ilir
Meta, Albania's state secretary for European integration, said at
an international conference in Brioni, Croatia.
	   In the Albanian capital, Tirana, Nano has felt the pressure. He
has been forced to fend off Berisha's political attacks while
trying to cope with the refugee dilemma.
	   Nano appealed to opposition parties on Saturday ``to stop using
this critical situation for electoral intentions.''
	   He allocated more than dlrs 300,000 from Albanian meager
treasury reserves to help Albanian families housing refugees. He
also urged at least dlrs 20 million in international aid.
	   Yet the main thrust of the Albanian effort is to secure a
commitment for an international force, possibly under NATO command,
to watch the border. This could not only curb the arms and refugee
flow, but give Nano an important political buffer: he wouldn't have
to use Albanian forces against Albanian arms smugglers.
	   ``We need international assistance ... especially on stopping
all the types of (arms) smuggling,'' said Nano, who said 2,000 tons
of military shells and other explosives at armories were being
guarded to prevent looting.

	   Sanchez Vicario depended on her ability to run down almost any
shot, and it served her well. But she also took advantage of errors

Seles' game. She let Sanchez Vicario come back from 15-40 on her
serve to win the first game and stop Seles' streak.
	   Seles had eight unforced errors in that set's first three games;
she had only five in the entire second set.
	   Sanchez Vicario was in trouble in almost every service game in

errors. She ended the match at 6-2 with another long backhand from

	   The Spaniard's victory means there will be a Spanish sweep this
year, the first since 1994. Both men's finalists are from Spain.
	   Carlos Moya went out with buddy Felix Mantilla for ice cream
before clobbering him in the semifinals. Now Moya is making dinner
plans with another close friend, Alex Corretja, whom he'll face on
Sunday.
	   ``Maybe we can have dinner together. That's the most important
thing, we're going to be friends even if I win or if he wins,''
Corretja said. ``We have to find our game on the court, and then
just enjoy the party.''
	   On a muggy center court Friday, Corretja defeated local hero
Cedric Pioline of France 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 to join Moya in the final.
Moya won 5-7, 6-2, 6-4, 6-2 over Mantilla, yet another Spaniard.
	   It will be the second all-Spanish men's final in five years at
the French Open. Sergi Bruguera defeated Alberto Berasategui for
the 1994 title.
	   ``Alex is a close friend of mine,'' Moya said. ``But when you
get on the court, you fight like crazy, you run, you do everything,
you try to step on him if necessary.''
	   Pioline, hoping to become the first Frenchman to win at Roland
Garros since Yannick Noah in 1983, played three five-setters in
reaching the semifinals and appeared drained.
	   ``I felt I did everything a bit slowly. On top of that, you're
not as focused when you're tired. You don't make the right
decisions,'' he said.

Attack on Nicaragua police spokesman; drug plane scandal could be linked 
</HEADLINE>
By RODOLFO GARCIA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ Gunmen fired shots at the new
spokesman for Nicaragua's national police Saturday, wounding his
10-year-old son in an attack that police said could be linked to a
drug-smuggling scandal.
	   Carlos Bendana, who has been on the job for only two days, was
suspended last month from his job as Nicaragua's go-between with
Interpol after a scandal involving a stolen plane used by drug
smugglers as well as by the president and vice president.
	   Eduardo Cuadra Ferrey, second-in-command of the national police
force, said, ``We aren't discounting the possibility that the
attack on Bendana could be a conspiracy of international drug
smugglers.''
	   Bendana's son suffered a minor wound to his head. Three men were
arrested.
	   The Learjet 35A stolen in Florida had apparently been registered
in Nicaragua with the help of government officials and used to
transport drugs. Nicaraguan leaders were offered free use of it as
a way of diverting suspicion. Traces of cocaine were later found
inside. At least eight officials were dismissed and six people were
charged.

Sanchez Vicario wins French Open

Eds: CORRECTS typo in third-set score, Combines urgent series.
By JOCELYN NOVECK
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Arantxa Sanchez Vicario won the French Open
Saturday for the third time, defeating Monica Seles 7-6 (7-5), 0-6,
6-2.
	   The victory spoiled what would have been a fairy-tale ending for
Seles, who was playing just three weeks after the death of her
father, coach and mentor, Karolj Seles.
	   It was the first Grand Slam title for the Spaniard since the
1994 U.S. Open.
	   ``I can't express what I feel right now,'' Sanchez Vicario said.
It was a very difficult match, filled with emotion.''
	   The emotional favorite was clearly Seles, who had recaptured her
old form so soon after her father's death. Sanchez Vicario
mentioned the death while accepting her trophy, saying, ``I'm so
sorry I beat you. I don't think you are the one who deserved to
lose.''
	   Seles also saluted her opponent, and added: ``It's been so
special coming back this year. As always, I will be back.''
	   Sanchez Vicario depended on her ability to run down almost any
shot, and it served her well. But she also took advantage of errors

Teen-age BMX champ killed for his bicycle 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ A 14-year-old champion cross-country
bicycle racer with dreams of racing internationally was killed with
a gunshot to the chest by a gang of youths who stole his bike and
sneakers, the boy's father said.
	   William Alexander Jimenez, a favorite to win next month's
national BMX cycling championship in Medellin, was returning to his
home in Cali on Thursday night after visiting his girlfriend when
he was accosted by the youths.
	   The six assailants demanded Jimenez's bicycle and sneakers. When
he refused, one youth shot Jimenez in the heart. The assailants
took the bike, removed Jimenez's sneakers and left him bleeding in
the street. The bike racer died before reaching the hospital.
	   Jimenez's father, Flavio, said his son wasn't much of a student
but was totally dedicated to bike racing.
	   ``He fixed bicycles, painted them and with the money he earned
bought his uniforms,'' Flavio Jimenez told the Bogota newspaper El
Espectador between sobs. And though William had once broken a leg
racing on a hilly BMX course, he was fearless, his father said.
	   ``The higher he jumped, the better,'' Flavio said, adding that
his son had an excellent shot at advancing to an international race
in Canada.
	   Colombian BMX racers have been targeted by criminals before.
	   In 1996, 13-year-old junior national champion Andres Varela was
seized from his school bus in Medellin by kidnappers, then later

Billy Joel pulls out of British concerns - but Elton John goes ahead solo 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Suffering from a throat infection, American singer
Billy Joel pulled out of two more concerts with Sir Elton John on
Saturday and Sunday - but the shows will go on with the British
singer doing a solo act.
	   Joel also backed out of a joint concert Thursday in Manchester,
northern England because he was suffering from asthma and it was
canceled because promoters said Elton John would not appear alone.
	   But facing more disappointed fans in London, the British
singer-songwriter agreed to perform solo at Wembley Stadium.
	   During their joint concerts, the two stars face each other over
their pianos, swapping comments, and each makes an appearance in
the other's set.
	   At their opening concert in Glasgow, Scotland, on Tuesday, Joel,
49, suffered an acute asthma attack brought on by an upper
respiratory infection. Reviewers had noted bitter winds at the open
air concert.
	   Wembley Stadium has offered refunds to the 30,000 fans who have
booked tickets for each concert because Joel is not performing.
``But so far we have had only a handful of returns. People are
disappointed but happy to come and see Elton anyway,'' a
spokeswoman said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The Wembley concerts would have been Joel's last in Britain. But
Joel and John still have 13 dates on their world tour, and it
wasn't clear whether the American singer would be able to perform.
	   Joel admitted on Friday he did not think he would be able to
``hack'' going on tour again.
	   ``In the old days I could scream and punch my way through it,
but now it wouldn't be fair to my fans,'' he said.

Air France strike enters sixth day; pilots ready to talk again

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said Saturday
the government was prepared to intervene in the Air France strike,
which is now in its sixth day and could tarnish the World Cup.
	   Air France President Jean-Cyril Spinetta said talks that lasted
all night without reaching agreement had been ``suspended.''
	   The pilots appeared divided, with the head of the main pilots'
union indicating new talks could take place Monday and a spokesman
saying they could go back to the table over the weekend.
	   The strike has embarrassed France ahead of the World Cup, which
opens Wednesday.
	   ``It's not the World Cup that concerns me, it's the recovery
underway of the company and its future,'' Jospin told reporters
before a meeting of the national council of the Socialist Party.
	   Air France is currently restructuring and needs to make pay cuts
to free up capital to modernize the company and its fleet of
planes.
	   The World Cup will take place ``normally,'' Jospin said.
``French people don't need to take a plane to attend the World Cup.
Nor do Europeans, and we are going to find a lot of airline
companies to transport the rest at the expense of Air France.''
	   Air France is the official World Cup carrier and is committed to
transporting the teams from one venue to another.
	   Jospin said the French government was ready to intervene to help
end the the strike and would play a role ``in the hours to come.''
	   There have been suggestions the government may name a mediator,
but by early evening no proposals were forthcoming.
	   Talks between Air France management and the the striking pilots
broke off Saturday about 8 a.m. (0600 GMT) after all night
negotiations.
	   The stumbling blocks remained planned salary cuts and an Air
France proposal to give pilots stock in exchange for the pay
reductions, as well as a two-tier pay scale in which younger pilots
earn less.
	   Spinetta, the Air France president, said there had been ``very
positive advances'' in the talks.
	   The pilots appeared more pessimistic.
	   ``It's so serious I prefer not to talk to you about it,'' said
Christian Paris, the spokesman for the SNPL, the main pilots'
union.
	   However, SNPL President Jean-Charles Corbet indicated new talks
could eventually take place Monday. However, another SNPL official,
Christian Roger, said talks could be resumed over the weekend.
	   Etienne Lichtenberger, president of the SPAC, one of the smaller
unions, said Air France's proposals were ``insufficient'' and that
it was ``out of the question'' to sign an agreement this weekend.
	   Only about 25 percent of Air France's flights were expected to
take off Saturday. Meanwhile, a train strike disrupted provincial
service.

Spain's Sergio Garcia wins British Amateur Championship 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   GULLANE, Scotland (AP) _ Sergio Garcia, expected to be Spain's
next great golfer, won the British Amateur Championship Saturday,
beating Craig Williams of Wales 7 and 6.
	   The 18-year-old Spaniard becomes the first player to hold both
the British Boys and British Amateur titles since countryman Jose
Maria Olazabal.
	   Garcia advanced to the final after winning a sudden-death
semifinal playoff Friday on the 23rd hole to beat Mark Hilton of
England.
	   He took a four-hole lead after the opening 18 and was eight up
after 26 holes on a day of on-and-off rain at Muirfield.
	   Garcia fell back to a six-hole advantage after losing the 27th
hole (No. 9), but won the 30th and halved the next two holes to
close out the Welshman.
	   Williams won his Friday semifinal 3 and 2 over Ben Mason of
England.

World Cup: Teammates vie for Romario's spot on Brazilian team 
</HEADLINE>
By PETER MUELLO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   OZOIR LA FERRIERE, France (AP) _ Romario is gone, and the battle
is on for his place in Brazil's starting lineup.
	   For now, Bebeto is the No. 2 striker, alongside Ronaldo. But
Edmundo openly says he deserves the job, and Denilson could upstage
them both once the Cup starts next Wednesday.
	   The rivalry has created a problem for coach Mario Zagallo. While
he encourages healthy competition among his players, the dispute
has created rifts that veterans say could weaken the group.
	   The disharmony was Edmundo's doing. In an interview Friday with
a Rio de Janeiro radio station, Edmundo said he deserved to start
because he was ``in better physical and technical shape, and
overall I'm better than Bebeto.''
	   The comment created turmoil at training camp and drew a sharp
reply from the high command. Team coordinator Zico said no one
would be allowed to disrupt the group, and Zagallo added that if
there were disciplinary problems among his 22 players, Brazil could
easily ``finish the Cup with 21.''
	   The problem is, Edmundo may be right.
	   At 27, Edmundo is at peak form. Last year he broke Brazil's
single-season scoring record with 29 goals and led Rio's Vasco da
Gama to the national championship, before jumping to Italy's
Fiorentina.
	   On the national team, he has nine goals in 34 games and was a
standout last year in the Tournoi de France and the America Cup,
which Brazil won for the first time away from home.
	   Edmundo's problem is his temper. Nicknamed ``Animal,'' he was
red-carded seven times last year and routinely fights with opposing
players, teammates and referees.
	   For now, the starter is Bebeto, Romario's co-star on Brazil's
1994 World Cup champions. Bebeto started in Brazil's 3-0 win over
Andorra this week, and Zagallo confirmed he would also start in the
Cup opener against Scotland.
	   The coach insisted his reasons for choosing Bebeto were purely
technical.
	   ``He can score, he moves well, he's more of an attacker than
Edmundo,'' Zagallo said. ``And he played in the (1996) Olympics
with Ronaldo, so they are better meshed.''
	   But Zagallo puts a high premium on experience. On his original
22-player roster, nine were World Cup veterans, although injuries
removed Romario and fullback Marcio Santos. Bebeto is playing in
his third World Cup _ Edmundo in his first.
	   Bebeto also was something of a surprise on the Cup roster. At
34, he has lost the mercurial quickness of four years ago. On his
Botafogo club, he has failed to produce the goals fans expected.
	   Neither Bebeto nor Edmundo can fill the role of Romario, who was
cut this week after reinjuring his calf. Brazil's offense pivoted
around Romario, the team's point of reference in the penalty area.
No one on the team now has his style or presence.
	   Many fans want to see 20-year-old sensation Denilson join
Ronaldo, 21, in what promises to be the Brazilian attack of the
future.
	   Denilson won a starting berth at the 1997 America Cup and held
it until last month, when Zagallo opted to start Rivaldo and
Giovanni, teammates on Spain's FC Barcelona.
	   But Zagallo is an unabashed admirer of Denilson, whose wizardly
ball-handling skills and brash, in-your-face dribbles have earned
him comparisons with the legendary Garrincha.
	   Zagallo guaranteed Denilson will see playing time in the Cup _
and possibly on the front line, his true position. If Bebeto and
Edmundo don't measure up, the anticipated Denilson-Ronaldo dynasty
could start now.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan has completed a feasibility study on
a 650-mile (1,000-kilometer) oil pipeline between the Iraqi and
Jordanian capitals.
	   Abdul-Wahab Zobbi, director general of the state Jordan
Petroleum Refinery, said Saturday the proposed pipeline would cost
about dlrs 250 million.
	   ``The study shows that the pipeline is feasible,'' he told The
Associated Press.
	   The study will be presented to the governments of Iraq and
Jordan for approval, he said. Both countries have long advocated
such a pipeline.
	   Jordan imports all of its daily consumption of 85,000 barrels of
oil from Iraq, under special dispensation from the U.N. sanctions
imposed on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
	   The fuel is carried by tanker trucks. But this form of transport
is costly and there have been several accidents, resulting in
fires, on the desert highway between the Jordanian capital, Amman,
and the Iraqi capital, Baghdad.
	   Zobbi declined to reveal a possible source of financing, but
officials say the kingdom is approaching France, Italy, Germany and
Japan for contributions.
	   Zobbi said the pipeline's capacity would be 100,000 barrels of
oil per day. It would run from Jordan's lone refinery in Zarqa, 17
miles (27 kilometers) southeast of Amman, to Haditha, a terminal on
the northwestern outskirts of Baghdad.

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian customs officials detained a
cargo plane Saturday after finding more than 40 tons of metal drums
emitting radioactivity, a news agency said.
	   It was not immediately clear whether the drums were filled with
a radioactive substance or if only the containers were
contaminated. There have been cases of contaminated containers
being illegally reused.
	   The plane, from Kazakstan, was seized when it made a refueling
stop in the western Ukrainian town of Rivne. It had been en route
to Russia from Germany.

Pope names new envoy for Israel 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul II on Saturday named an
Italian prelate to be his new envoy to Israel. The diplomatic
posting to Jerusalem comes as a possible papal visit there is
explored.
	   Monsignor Piero Sambi, 50, who has been serving in Indonesia,
will replace Monsignor Andrea Cordero di Montezemolo, who was named
in March to be the Vatican's envoy to Italy.
	   Sambi would likely be involved in any paving of the way for a
papal visit to Jerusalem.
	   John Paul has expressed a keen desire to journey there as part
of Holy Year and millennium celebrations in 2000. But the pope's
presence there would be sensitive because the Vatican state and
Israel differ over the future of the city, which is special to
Jews, Christians and Muslims.
	   Only last month, the pontiff said he hoped for international
guarantees for the ``unique'' and ``sacred'' nature of Jerusalem.
But Israel considers the entire city its eternal capital.

<TEXT>
	   AVIGNON, France (AP) _ Scotland, upset over a FIFA dicate which
prohibits treatment of players on the field, is threatening take
referees to court and sue them for negligence should the rule
result in players' injuries being aggravated.
	   ``You could have a case when a player with a severe head injury
could be carried off,'' manager Craig Brown said. ``We will take it
back to our medical men and we could see a circumstance where
litigation could be involved there.''
	   Brown is sensitive to the issue because he has two players,
Darren Jackson and Gordon Durie, who suffered head injuries earlier
this season. Jackson underwent brain surgery in August, while Durie
missed several weeks with a concussion.
	   Scotland's team doctor, Stewart Hillis, was once ordered off the
field when he attempted to treat Rob McKinnon during a Kirin Cup
match in Japan in 1995. Hillis said he will ignore the no-treatment
rule during the World Cup, if necessary.
	   ``Our priority is looking after the players,'' Hillis said. ``We
are not looking for confrontation.''

	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Paramilitary forces will guard
Bangladeshi power stations during the World Cup to guard against
possible attacks by angry soccer fans in the event of power
outages, a senior official said Saturday.
	   Soldiers and police will take positions around all major power
stations 12 hours before the opening match June 10 in France,
Nuruddin Mohammad Kamal, chairman of the state-owned Power
Development Board, told reporters.
	   The nation's major cities, including Dhaka, Chittagong, Khulna
and Rajshahi, face regular power outages and citizens have often
staged violent demonstrations at power stations in response.
	   Bangladesh needs more than 2,100 megawatts of electricity each
year, but regularly generates only 1,700 megawatts.
	   Bangladesh did not qualify for the World Cup.

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ A groin injury has South
African striker Brendan Augustine questionable for the team's World
Cup opener.
	   ``I'm getting worried,'' said coach Philippe Troussier, who told
the South African newspaper Saturday Star that Augustine hasn't
practiced in six days.
	   Troussier said a specialist would look at the injury when the
team arrives in France on Sunday from its training camp in
Germany's Black Forest. A final decision on Augustine's status will
be made Monday.
	   South Africa is already without midfielder John Moeti, who broke
his ankle in a league match before the team left South Africa in
May.
	   South Africa plays France on June 12 in the first-round World
Cup match in Marseilles. The team played Iceland in an exhibition
match Saturday in Obertal, Germany.

World Cup: Boyd sees Brazil game as chance for Scottish redemption 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   AVIGNON, France (AP) _ Scotland, which hasn't made a splash on
the international scene in decades, is looking for a little
redemption at the World Cup.
	   It could come in a hurry. The Scots play defending champion
Brazil in the tournament's opening match on Wednesday.
	   ``We probably wanted to avoid Brazil, but since they came out of
the hat, we have been up for it,'' defender Tom Boyd said at
Saturday's training session. ``To be honest, I think we've got a
good chance and if we play at our best, we can certainly take
something.''
	   Scotland is one of the oldest soccer-playing nations in the
world, but it has never made it past the first round in seven
previous appearances at the World Cup, and its storied club teams
such as Rangers and Celtic have met with little success in recent
European competitions.
	   ``In recent years, it has been nothing short of deplorable,''
Boyd said. ``There is a gulf between international and club level,
that is without question. You just have to look at the results we
have had in Europe.''
	   Boyd expects this team, which won seven of 10 games in
qualifying, will be different. Even if Scotland loses to Brazil, it
can advance from Group A with victories over Norway and Morocco.
	   ``As a nation getting all the best players together, we have
performed,'' Boyd said. ``We're leading the way, and hopefully the
clubs can follow _ we can spark them to improve by doing well
here.''

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan has completed a feasibility study on
a 650-mile (1,000-kilometer) oil pipeline between the Iraqi and
Jordanian capitals.
	   Abdul-Wahab Zobbi, director general of the state Jordan
Petroleum Refinery, said Saturday the proposed pipeline would cost
about dlrs 250 million.
	   ``The study shows that the pipeline is feasible,'' he told The
Associated Press.
	   The study will be presented to the governments of Iraq and
Jordan for approval, he said. Both countries have long advocated
such a pipeline.
	   Jordan imports all of its daily consumption of 85,000 barrels of
oil from Iraq, under special dispensation from the U.N. sanctions
imposed on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
	   The fuel is carried by tanker trucks. But this form of transport
is costly and there have been several accidents, resulting in
fires, on the desert highway between the Jordanian capital, Amman,
and the Iraqi capital, Baghdad.
	   Zobbi declined to reveal a possible source of financing, but
officials say the kingdom is approaching France, Italy, Germany and
Japan for contributions.
	   Zobbi said the pipeline's capacity would be 100,000 barrels of
oil per day. It would run from Jordan's lone refinery in Zarqa, 17
miles (27 kilometers) southeast of Amman, to Haditha, a terminal on
the northwestern outskirts of Baghdad.

World Cup: Loud, costly campaign for soccer's boss nears an end With Sports-Soccer-Havelange AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By LARRY SIDDONS
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The spending and shouting are just about over. Now
comes the vote to decide who will lead soccer into the 21st
century.
	   The race between Lennart Johansson, head of Europe's soccer
union UEFA, and Sepp Blatter, general secretary of the
international federation FIFA, has been expensive and nasty, with
the two campaigns costing more than dlrs 1 million and slinging
more mud than a motocross rally.
	   A close outcome is expected Monday, when 192 members of FIFA
vote for a successor to Joao Havelange, the Brazilian industrialist
who has held the presidency like a personal fiefdom for 24 years.
	   The job is traditionally part-time and unpaid, but it is one of
the two most powerful positions in international sports, perhaps
even more so than the presidency of the International Olympic
Committee.
	   It carries the flag of soccer, the game that elicits passion and
attracts sponsor dollars like no other. That attraction has led
critics to question how the FIFA presidency might have added to
Havelange's personal wealth; a recent article in the German
newspaper Frankfurter Rundschau said the outgoing president rang up
dlrs 2.7 million in travel, hotel and other expenses in the past
four years, about 4 percent of FIFA's budget.
	   Although he supports Blatter and urged him to run, Havelange
said Saturday he had no idea who would take over once he departs at
the end of the World Cup next month.
	   ``The outcome will be known when the vote is held, not before,''
he said. ``It's like when a child is born _ you have to give it
time.''
	   Johansson was supposed to attend the same news conference where
Havelange appeared but pulled out at the last minute. Officials
said he wanted to have lunch with his home-country Swedish soccer
federation instead.
	   For more than a year, Johansson was the only candidate in the
race. But after much waffling, Blatter announced his candidacy 2
1/2 months ago and since then has waged a globe-girdling campaign
seeking votes.
	   He predicted Friday that he would win, even saying that he was
sure of almost half the votes from Europe, where Johansson has been
seen as unchallengeable. Soon after his prediction, Blatter won an
important endorsement from the English Football Association, which
sent Johansson into a rage.
	   The UEFA head accused Keith Wiseman, chairman of the English FA,
of breaking his word of support and called it a ``very personal
decision'' aimed at securing a seat for Wiseman on the FIFA
executive committee. Johansson also said he remained confident of
victory.
	   Name-calling and backstabbing has been prominent in this
campaign. Johansson has accused Blatter of stealing his platform
and acting as a straw man for Havelange; Blatter, in turn, has said
that Johansson was a puppet of the German soccer federation and
Antonio Matarese, the powerful head of the Italian soccer
federation who probably would take over at UEFA if the Swede is
elected FIFA president.
	   There even has been a dispute over the voting itself, normally
just a mundane procession of dark-suited officials to a voting
booth. UEFA said last month that it would keep a close watch on how
FIFA handled the balloting, lest it favor Blatter.
	   And not only has the campaign been nasty, it's been expensive.
Blatter said he has spent $300,000, and estimates put Johansson's
campaign costs at up to $800,000, much of it financed by UEFA.
	   Havelange said he was not dismayed at the conflicts that have
arisen.
	   ``I have said before that FIFA is not a dictatorship, and to
have an election you need two candidates. I wish we had four or
five,'' he said. ``To have free competition is very good for
football. I would hope that my successor would carry on our good
results.''
	   Whoever succeeds Havelange won't have to worry about money. The
outgoing president said FIFA had a cash reserve of dlrs 4 million,
with dlrs 800 million in sponsorships and uncounted millions more
in TV rights fees. ``Enough to stage two World Cups,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   HYDERABAD, India (AP) _ Police fired gunshots to disperse Hindus
and Muslims who clashed in at least half a dozen places in the
southern Indian city of Hyderabad for a second day Saturday,
killing at least four people and injuring 40 others, police said.
	   Two people were killed by police fire and another two died of
stab wounds, said Ram Pratap Singh, the city police chief. The
rioters attacked each other with swords, knives and stones in the
capital of Andhra Pradesh state.
	   Those killed included a police officer whose home was attacked,
Singh said.
	   Police imposed a curfew as nearly 1,500 Hindus and Muslims,
split into at least six groups, rampaged through the southern parts
of the city, 1,300 kilometers (about 800 miles) south of New Delhi.
	   Nearly 5,000 policemen fanned out and controlled the rioting
after nearly four hours. ``The situation is quite tense in the
city,'' Singh said.
	   Singh said the military was asked to stand by in case rioting
broke out again.
	   Hyderabad's 5 million population is equally divided between
Hindus and Muslims.
	   Trouble erupted on Friday when Muslims, angered by pamphlets
denigrating their religion, attacked the Hindus after noon prayers.
At least 25 people were injured. They targeted homes, buses and
cars.
	   No one claimed responsibility for distributing the offensive
pamphlets.
	   Fresh rioting started Saturday after rumors spread that Hindus
had burned down a city mosque, Singh said. Six of the 40 injured
were hospitalized in serious condition.

Yeltsin urges India to sign non-proliferation pact remarks

Eds: INSERTS 3 grafs after 4th graf to UPDATE with Gorbachev
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin spoke with India's
prime minister on Saturday and urged India to sign the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty, the Kremlin said.
	   In a telephone conversation with Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee, Yeltsin expressed concern over the recent spate of
nuclear testing by India and Pakistan, according to Yeltsin's
presidential press service.
	   ``It was stressed that the Indian-Pakistani nuclear competition
has spread far beyond the region. It undermines the nuclear
non-proliferation regime and sets a dangerous precedent of nuclear
weapons spread,'' the press service said.
	   The Kremlin also said Yeltsin and Vajpayee discussed how Russia
might play a role in encouraging a dialog between India and
Pakistan.
	   Also Saturday, a Russian newspaper published an article by
former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in which he argued that the
five nuclear superpowers _ especially the United States and Russia
_ had inadvertently encouraged the Indian and Pakistani tests.
	   The superpowers have failed to take nuclear disarmament
seriously, Gorbachev argued in Nezavisimaya Gazeta. He said that
created the climate in which India and Pakistan felt justified in
carrying out the tests.
	   For the non-proliferation treaty to be successful, he said, the
superpowers need to take ``concrete steps toward nuclear
disarmament.'' Instead, he said, Moscow and Washington have ``been
making it increasingly clear that they link their defense
capability to nuclear weapons.''
	   India set off five underground nuclear tests last month,
prompting Pakistan to retaliate with a series of tests two weeks
later.
	   Under the 1970 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the five
members of the United Nations Security Council are the only nations
allowed to maintain nuclear arsenals. India and Pakistan have
refused to sign the treaty.
	   The Security Council has tentatively agreed on a resolution
urging India and Pakistan to stop their nuclear testing and denying
them status as nuclear states.

Pantani wins time trial, virtually clinching Giro 
</HEADLINE>
EDs: UPDATES with more quotes, details; minor editing
<TEXT>
	   LUGANO, Switzerland (AP) _ Marco Pantani virtually clinched the
1998 Tour of Italy Saturday after surprising even his biggest
supporters by finishing ahead of Russian Pavel Tonkov in the
individual time trial.
	   Tonkov trailed Pantani by 1-minute, 28-seconds going into this
cycling classic's penultimate stage. But, Tonkov, a time trial
specialist, was expected to easily defeat Pantani and make up the
time.
	   In last week's time trial Tonkov beat Pantani by more than
2-minutes.
	   Instead, charged up by the prospect of winning his first Giro,
Pantani burst out of the start and rode powerfully throughout the
34-kilometer (21-mile) race, gaining another 5-seconds on Tonkov.
The Italian now holds a 1-minute, 33-second advantage.
	   ``Incredible,'' said an exuberant Pantani. ``I really think the
fear of losing this (leader's pink) jersey gave me a surge of extra
energy.''
	   It is virtually impossible for Tonkov, the 1996 Giro winner, to
catch Pantani in Sunday's final stage, a mostly flat 173-kilometer
(107-mile) ride from Lugano, Switzerland to Milan, Italy.
	   ``I was extremely concentrated from the start,'' said Pantani.
``I warmed up well -- better than in other occasions -- and then I
gave everything I had.''
	   Pantani, 28, has had a series of accidents, and was sidelined
for the entire 1996 season with a broken leg.
	   A climbing specialist, Pantani took over the leader's pink
jersey for the first time in his career five days ago during a
roller coaster ride through the Italian Alps.
	   Switzerland's Alex Zuelle, who was considered the race favorite
after dominating the initial stages, lost more than 30 minutes
during the Tour's toughest stage Thursday -- 239 kilometers (148
miles) up steep mountain roads in scorching heat.
	   When riders cross the finishline Sunday they will have covered a
total of 3,868 kilometers (2,398 miles).
	   Victory in Saturday's time trial went to Serguei Gontchar of the
Ukraine. He finished in 39-minutes, 54-seconds, posting an average
speed of over 50 kph (30 mph).
	   Pantani finished third, 30.60 seconds behind.
	   ``I knew that if i had lost time on Tonkov today, all the hard
work I have put in the past 21 days would have disappeared,''
Pantani said.
	   Italians Nicola Miceli, who was in fifth overall going into
Saturday's stage, and Riccardo Forconi were disqualified after
failing routine blood tests administered before the start of the
time trial.

Sanchez Vicario wins French Open 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with more Seles quotes; background
By JOCELYN NOVECK
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Arantxa Sanchez Vicario won the French Open for the
third time Saturday, defeating Monica Seles 7-6 (7-5), 0-6, 6-2.
	   The victory spoiled what would have been a fairy-tale ending for
Seles, who was playing just three weeks after the death of her
father, coach and mentor, Karolj Seles.
	   It was the first Grand Slam title for the Spaniard since the
1994 U.S. Open.
	   ``I can't express what I feel right now,'' Sanchez Vicario said.
It was a very difficult match, filled with emotion.''
	   The emotional favorite was clearly Seles, who had recaptured her
old form so soon after her father's death. Sanchez Vicario
mentioned the death while accepting her trophy, saying, ``I'm so
sorry I beat you. I don't think you are the one who deserved to
lose.''
	   Seles said she'd simply made too many mistakes.
	   ``In the end, she just made less errors than I did,'' she said.
``But I'm just really happy that I got this far.''
	   Seles, the No. 6 seed, had come to Roland Garros this year
because she said her father would have wanted her to play. And, she
said, the memories at home were just too painful.
	   Sanchez Vicario, the No. 4 seed, depended on her ability to run
down almost any shot, and it served her well. But she also took
advantage of errors by Seles in the first and third sets.
	   The players fought through an extremely tight first set, and
Sanchez Vicario won it by the tightest of margins: 7-5 in the
tiebreaker.
	   But Seles came back with a vengeance in the second set, storming
to a 5-0 lead in 18 minutes. Losing badly, Sanchez Vicario elected
to take a bathroom break, but it didn't help; Seles closed out the
set with a love game, ending with an ace.
	   But in the third set, the errors started creeping back into
Seles' game. She let Sanchez Vicario come back from 15-40 on her
serve to win the first game and stop Seles' streak.
	   Seles had eight unforced errors in that set's first three games;
she had only five in the entire second set.
	   Sanchez Vicario was in trouble in almost every service game in
the third set, but managed to hold on to win them, helped by Seles'
errors. She ended the match at 6-2 with another long backhand from
Seles.
	   Sanchez Vicario's victory assured a Spanish sweep this year, the
first since 1994. Both men's finalists are from Spain.
	   Carlos Moya went out with buddy Felix Mantilla for ice cream
before clobbering him in the semifinals. Now Moya is making dinner
plans with another close friend, Alex Corretja, whom he'll face on
Sunday.
	   ``Maybe we can have dinner together. That's the most important
thing, we're going to be friends even if I win or if he wins,''
Corretja said. ``We have to find our game on the court, and then
just enjoy the party.''
	   On a muggy center court Friday, Corretja defeated local hero
Cedric Pioline of France 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 to join Moya in the final.
Moya won 5-7, 6-2, 6-4, 6-2 over Mantilla, yet another Spaniard.
	   It will be the second all-Spanish men's final in five years at
the French Open. Sergi Bruguera defeated Alberto Berasategui for
the 1994 title.
	   ``Alex is a close friend of mine,'' Moya said. ``But when you
get on the court, you fight like crazy, you run, you do everything,
you try to step on him if necessary.''
	   Pioline, hoping to become the first Frenchman to win at Roland
Garros since Yannick Noah in 1983, played three five-setters in
reaching the semifinals and appeared drained.
	   ``I felt I did everything a bit slowly. On top of that, you're
not as focused when you're tired. You don't make the right
decisions,'' he said.

Waiting game now for Holyfield AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By TIM DAHLBERG
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Evander Holyfield just can't seem to keep his
career plans on track.
	   Just when the heavyweight was about to dispose of Henry
Akinwande and move on to the real business of fighting the likes of
Lennox Lewis or even Mike Tyson, Holyfield finds himself all
trained but with nowhere to go.
	   With Akinwande out with hepatitis B, Holyfield must now wait
while he and his advisers put together another title defense,
perhaps against lightly regarded Vaughn Bean, the IBF's No. 1
contender.
	   But, with the clock ticking on his boxing career, Holyfield will
waste valuable months while a new fight is made, promoted and
finally held.
	   ``Evander fights title fights, and title fights need time to
promote,'' said Holyfield's attorney Jim Thomas. ``There's no
option to putting something together quickly.''
	   Holyfield hadn't wanted to fight Akinwande in the first place.
But the challenger was the WBA's No. 1-ranked contender, and
Holyfield took the fight to avoid the risk of being stripped of the
belt he won from Tyson.
	   He doesn't much want to fight Bean either, but that may be his
next option as negotiations with WBC champion Lewis for a title
unification fight have gone nowhere.
	   ``The problem is Lewis is making himself unavailable,'' Thomas
said.
	   Before Akinwande was forced out of the fight Friday after the
positive test to hepatitis B came out, Thomas had talked of
Holyfield fighting Bean in November, possibly in his hometown of
Atlanta, with a Lewis title unification fight in the spring.
	   ``Nothing can derail the plan (to unify the title before
retiring),'' the 35-year-old Holyfield said. ``It can only prolong
it.''
	   There still remains the slight possibility _ and experts say it
is very remote _ that a second set of tests done on Akinwande on
Friday will prove the first tests wrong. If that happens, promoters
say they could scramble to hold the fight again within several
weeks.
	   Assuming that doesn't happen, however, Holyfield figures to lose
his 13 weeks of training for the fight and will have to go back
through the cycle again if a new fight is made.
	   That happened to Holyfield before, when he resumed training
after Tyson pulled out of a 1991 bout with an injury, only to
nearly get stopped by Bert Cooper in a hastily pulled together
fight.
	   ``I'm already in shape,'' said Holyfield, who was to earn dlrs
10 million to fight Akinwande.
	   Holyfield, though, seemed relatively unfazed about the latest
turn in events in a career that has seen its share of bizarre
happenings.
	   He lost a chance at the gold medal in the 1984 Olympics when he
was disqualified for knocking the silver medalist out with a late
punch and had a fight interrupted when a paraglider came sailing
into the ring ropes when he was fighting Riddick Bowe in Las Vegas.
	   And, of course, he will always be remembered for losing part of
his ear when Tyson bit him during their title rematch last year.
	   ``I guess I'm the guy that things happen to,'' Holyfield said.
``You just have to roll with the punches.''

U.S. envoy steps up diplomacy, African ministers urge truce 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) _ U.S. Assistant Secretary of
State Susan Rice stepped up a campaign of shuttle diplomacy
Saturday in an effort to broker dialogue between Ethiopia and
Eritrea.
	   Rice left the West African capital of Ouagadougou for Ethiopia
and Eritrea where she hopes to meet with government
representatives.
	   Her latest peace efforts came on the same Ethiopian warplanes
bombed targets in Eritrea in another escalation of fighting over
their contested border.
	   Among the world's poorest countries, Eritrea and Ethiopia
contest ownership of six areas along their common frontier.
	   Before leaving, Rice met with foreign ministers from members
states of the Organization of African Unity. The ministers are
gathered in Burkina Faso for preliminary talks before a heads of
state summit next week.
	   Rice is promoting a peace plan for the two feuding Horn of
Africa countries. The plan was drafted by the United States and
Rwanda.
	   ``The peace recommendations by the United States and Rwanda
constitute a reasonable basis for a peaceful resolution for the
conflict,'' Rice told journalists in Ouagadougou.
	   She urged both sides to accept the peace plan before fresh
rounds of fighting blow up into full scale war.
	   The plan calls for the withdrawal of troops, the deployment of
observers in the disputed border regions, the return of civilian
administrations to the region and an inquiry into the cause of the
dispute.
	   ``We are very concerned about the escalation and fighting
between Ethiopia and Eritrea and we request both sides to respect
an immediate cease-fire,'' she said.
	   The African foreign ministers issued an urgent appeal Saturday
for Ethiopia and Eritrea to adopt the U.S.-Rwandan peace plan and
curb their mounting use of violence.
	   ``The Council of Ministers appeals to the two parties to put an
end to all hostilities,'' a joint statement said.
	   The growing conflict will likely dominate talks between OAU
heads of state who begin meetings Monday.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Dozens of houses were aflame and
Serb gunners kept shelling villages in Kosovo, where another four
people were killed in fighting, ethnic Albanian and Serb sources
said Saturday.
	   The Kosovo Information Center close to the Albanian leadership
said fighting continued Saturday in the Decani area, some 70
kilometers (45 miles) west of provincial capital Pristina. The
villages of Shaptej, Gramocel and Babaloc were targeted by the
Serbs' heavy artillery.
	   One three-year old child, identified as Leutrim Aga, was killed
sleeping in his bed in Gramocel and three more ethnic Albanians
were wounded in that village. Another ethnic Albanian was found
dead in nearby Babaloc.
	   The Center later claimed three more were wounded in another
Decani village, Prilep, in a Serb attack involving military planes.
None of the reports could be independently confirmed.
	   The Center also issued a list of 202 names of people missing
after the latest clashes in the Decani region.
	   It said Serbian forces were shelling a border strip west of
Djakovica, 75 kilometers (47 miles) southwest of Pristina.
	   Serbian sources said two men were killed in a border clash
between Serb-led Yugoslav army troops and an armed group attempting
to illegally enter the province from Macedonia Saturday. They were
the first dead at the Macedonian border.
	   A Serb policemen was also reported to have died in the Belgrade
military hospital of injuries sustained in previous fighting in
Kosovo.
	   Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million people
and demand independence from Serbia, the larger of two republics
remaining in Yugoslavia.
	   A group of 16 central European and Balkan countries meeting
Saturday on Brioni island, Croatia, condemned violence and all
forms of terrorism in embattled Kosovo.
	   Speaking to reporters on Brioni, Ilir Meta, Albania's state
secretary for European integration, repeated his government's calls
for outside assistance to cope with the continuing influx of Kosovo
refugees.
	   Meanwhile, German foreign ministry official Wolfgang Ischinger,
touring the Balkans, met with ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova
in the provincial capital Pristina.
	   Ischinger told reporters his visit was part of an international
effort to help ``de-escalate the present crisis, to end military
action... and help refugees return.''
	   He spoke of ``ethnic cleansing'' _ the policy of forcefully
driving out ethnic Albanians from Kosovo, saying that was ``a
complete disaster, totally unacceptable.''
	   Ischinger was later scheduled to travel to Belgrade for meetings
with top government officials.
	   Rugova pleaded for ``urgent international intervention to stop
the Serb forces' aggression,'' insisting peaceful means were ``the
best way for achieving Kosovo's independence.''
	   However, Serbia is totally opposed to Kosovo's independence and
so are foreign powers, while the Kosovo Liberation Army rejects a
peaceful solution and is fighting toward secession from Serbia.
	   On Friday, the United Nations, in an unusually strong statement,
accused Serbian forces of atrocities in Kosovo where more than 250
people have died since March 1, in escalating clashes between
government forces and the KLA, the armed wing of the Albanian
independence movement.
	   In the Decani offensive this week, ethnic Albanian sources
earlier reported 50 dead, 200 missing and several villages
destroyed. There were also unconfirmed reports of a mass grave
containing 300 bodies.
	   Most of western Kosovo remained sealed-off Saturday, and it was
impossible to verify the conflicting reports.
	   More than 10,000 Kosovo Albanian refugees fled to northern
Albania this week.

	   ESCHEDE, Germany (AP) _ Federal rail officials on Saturday
ordered a second round of inspections of Germany's original fleet
of high-speed trains, showing their strengthening belief that a
wheel problem caused the nation's deadliest postwar train crash.
	   The death toll rose to 102 Saturday after rescuers digging by
hand through a sandbank found four more victims. Five of the
victims died in hospitals after Wednesday's crash in the town of
Eschede, 50 kilometers (30 miles) north of Hanover.
	   Investigators said a broken wheel on the first passenger car
appears to have caused InterCity Express 884 to derail and slam
into a motorway bridge.
	   Inspectors will check the wheels with ultrasound equipment,
searching for defects, and measure the thickness of the outer steel
rim _ the part that broke off the wheel of the crashed train. The
first inspections were done by eye, looking for visible defects.
	   ``Safety is always more important than cost effectiveness,''
Transport Minister Matthias Wissmann said in Eschede.
	   Officials estimate it will take two weeks to inspect all of the
59 trains that launched Germany's premier high-speed rail system,
inaugurated in 1991. A second generation of trains, introduced
since 1996, has a different wheel system.
	   Rail officials had already started general inspections of the
early InterCity Express trains. The new order means that a dozen
trains already checked will undergo a more thorough look.
	   Trains that pass inspection will be allowed to resume the normal
maximum speed _ 280 kilometers (175 miles) an hour. Top speed on
the trains was reduced to 160 kilometers (100 miles) an hour after
the accident.
	   Wissmann was quoted by the Neue Osnabruecke Zeitung as ruling
out a permanent speed reduction. However, he remained open to a
possible new safety system that would warn of wheel breaks and
derailments.
	   Meanwhile, a rescue effort that began with heavy cranes and
metal saws wound down Saturday with searchers sifting through sand
by hand to avoid any further damage to bodies mangled in the wreck.
	   The last bodies found were in a sandbank where the 200-ton
concrete bridge crumbled on the tracks after the train smashed into
its supports.
	   All recovered bodies were taken to a hospital morgue in Hanover,
where doctors catalog distinguishing features _ teeth, scars,
moles, facial hair, jewelry. Then they match their records with
information from relatives.
	   The process has been slow, with some bodies so mutilated that
dental records fail to help, and by Saturday only 29 victims had
been identified.

	   ASMARA, Eritrea _ Ethiopian jet fighters bombed a combined
military-civilian airport in Eritrea for the second day Saturday as
hundreds of foreigners scrambled to leave the country.
	   There was no information available on casualties.
	   President Isaias Afwerki said he held out little hope for a
rapid solution to the worsening border conflict between the two
impoverished nations in the Horn of Africa.
	   Eritrea said it shot down one of the Ethiopian MiG 23
fighter-bombers Saturday and captured pilot Col. Bezabeh Petros.
	   Ethiopia denied it had lost any planes Friday during a raid on
Asmara airport.
	   A reliable source in the Ethiopian Foreign Ministry said
Ethiopia had shot down an Eritrean MiG over northeastern Ethiopia
Friday and captured the pilot.
	   ``At the moment, I'm not seeing any light at the end of the
tunnel,'' President Isaias Afwerki told reporters. ``But when I see
it, I want peace.''
	   A source familiar with the Eritrean Air Force, who asked not to
be further identified, said it was clear Ethiopia was trying to
wipe out Eritrea's small air force consisting of half a dozen aging
Soviet-era MiG fighter-bombers.
	   Isaias, however, said he didn't think the air raids represented
``a great escalation'' in hostilities because the Ethiopians ``have
already taken much more significant actions.''
	   He did not elaborate.
	   Ethiopia's army is about three times the size of Eritrea's
estimated 40,000-strong force.
	   Meanwhile in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa, diplomats from
Italy, Germany, Britain and the United States met Saturday with
Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, who told them Ethiopia would provide a
security ``window'' between 5 p.m. (1400gmt) Saturday and 6 a.m.
(0300gmt) Sunday to allow airplanes to land in Asmara to evacuate
their citizens, according to Italian Ambassador Marcello Ricoveri.
	   A U.S.-charter aircraft carrying 194 people, including 129
Americans, arrived in Frankfurt, Germany, early Saturday after
leaving Asmara Friday night.
	   Ethiopia said the Friday attack on the airport was in
retaliation an Eritrean attack on Mekele, 200 kilometers (125
miles) north of Addis. At least 44 Ethiopians civilians were killed
and 135 wounded in the Mekele attack, according to Radio Fana of
the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front.
	   There was no explanation for Saturday's attack.
	   Eritrea and Ethiopia are at odds over at least six areas along
their common border which was traced by Italy after it conquered
Eritrea in 1885.
	   The Friday air strikes came a day after Meles agreed to a U.S.
and Rwandan proposal to end the border conflict peacefully.
	   But he warned that his country's patience was wearing thin
because of Eritrea's refusal to withdraw from territory Ethiopia
claims it occupied a month ago.
	   One of the recommendations of the proposal was that Eritrea
withdraw to positions held before May 6.
	   But Eritrea says it has not violated the international border
traced by Italian colonizers in 1885.
	   Across the continent in Ouagadougu, capital of Burkina Faso,
foreign ministers from the Organization of African Unity Saturday
urged Ethiopia and Eritrea to refrain from the use of violence.
	   ``The Council of Ministers appeals to the two parties to put an
end to all hostilities,'' their statement said.
	   The growing conflict will likely dominate talks between OAU
heads of state who begin meetings Monday.
	   Eritrea gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993. Eritrean
rebels were instrumental in helping the EPRDF overthrow a 17-year
military regime in July 1991.

Welsh rugby team defeats Zimbabwe, 49-11 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Wales fielded three international
debutants against Zimbabwe Saturday, with Richard Rees scoring two
tries to set up a victory in the last 15 minutes.
	   The Welsh scored eight tries, five of them in a final blitz that
confounded Zimbabwe.
	   The others came from Byron Haywood (3), Arwell Thomas (2) and
Wayne Proctor.
	   A penalty and three conversions by Thomas completed the scoring.
Thomas replaced Neil Jenkins as kicker, falling short of Jenkins'
usual performance record so that some points went begging.
	   In the early part of the match Zimbabwe kept the Welshmen on the
back foot for lengthy periods, scoring first with a penalty by
Kenny Tsimba from 35 meters (38 yards) out.
	   Rees opened his account five minutes later, bursting through the
Zimbabwe line and brushing aside home full-back Victor Olonga.
	   Zimbabwe regained the lead 6-5 with another penalty by Tsimba,
Wales being guilty of off-side.
	   An easy Thomas try right on half-time, which he converted, gave
Wales a lead of 12-6. Just before the break, Wales lost Mark Taylor
with a facial injury and David Wheatherley with an injured right
knee from a tackle.
	   Tries from Thomas and Haywood, who benefited from six swift
passes down the line, gave Wales the comfortable margin of 20-6.
	   First time front row forward Darren Morris performed well
against an unusually aggressive Zimbabwe pack.
	   At the 63rd minute Zimbabwe kept the possibility of an upset
alive with a try by scrum-half Ryan Bekker, who nipped through an
embarrassed Wales defense after a tap penalty. That brought the
score back to 20-11.
	   But then came the final five Welsh tries.
	   Zimbabwe rugby has been troubled lately by allegations of white
favoritism and the resignation of team manager Fred Jocks. But
morale was high throughout.

	   WARE, England (AP) _ Lee Westwood finished with three birdies on
the final four holes to take a one-stroke lead Saturday over
Australian Greg Chalmers after three rounds of the English Open.
	   A 24-year-old lefthander, Chalmers shot an 11-under,
course-record 61 and had a chance for a 59 _ which would have been
a record for the European Tour.
	   Billed as Europe's best young player, Westwood finished with a
5-under 67 as he attempts to win his second straight European Tour
event. He won last week's TPC of Europe championship in Hamburg,
Germany.
	   Westwood was in at 13-under 203 with Chalmers on 204 on the
par-72 Marriott Hanbury Manor course.
	   Colin Montgomerie fired a 69 to fall two shots off the pace
joined by Stephen Leaney of Australia (70) and Patrik Sjoland of
Sweden (70).
	   The 61 still found a place in the European Tour record books.
	   His 28 on the front nine was one short of tying the European
Tour record of 27 for nine holes, which is held by several players.
	   Chalmers' 61 was technically the third-best round ever shot on
the the European Tour. There have been eight rounds of 60, but only
two of them _ by Jamie Spence in Switzerland in 1992 and Bernhard
Langer in Germany last year _ were on par-72 courses.
	   ``I thought about a 59 from the moment I chipped in for eagle on
the ninth,'' said Chalmers, had had four birdies and two eagles on
the front nine.
	   ``But I'll take 61. It's fantastic.''
	   ``It felt like I could do nothing wrong. It's frightening in a
way, but great as well. Things just happen, and it's weird because
you feel totally relaxed, yet your heart is racing. It doesn't
happen often enough.''
	   Chalmers, after making the turn in 28, birdied the 10th, 12th
and 14th and needed two more birdies on the final four holes to
reach 59.
	   He had pars on 15 and 16. On the par-5 17th, he hit missed a
four-foot birdie putt. On the 18th his only hope of 59 was dropping
a 100-yard wedge shot for eagle. The shot was well wide and he
settled for par.

	   But members also warned the nuclear weapons states _ the United

responsibility to renew efforts to curb nculear weapons, including
those in their own arsenals.
	   ``The rest of us expect you to seriously take your
responsibility of finally removing the threat of nuclear weapons
which even with the end of the Second World War continues to hang
over our heads,'' Kenyan Ambassador Njunguna Moses Mahugu said.
	   Swedish Ambassador Hans Dahlgren said it was not enough to
``stem the flow'' of nuclear weapons.
	   ``We must also turn the tide,'' Dahlgren said. ``And the
ultimate goal is to eliminate all weapons of mass destruction. The
five nuclear weapons states bore the particular responsibility to
make that possible.''

	   AIX-LES-BAINS, France (AP) _ The Japanese team is struggling to
adjust to the more humid, warmer weather at this southeastern
resort that will serve as its World Cup base training camp.
	   Coach Takeshi Okada moved up Saturday's afternoon practice to
the middle of the afternoon to allow his players to get used to the
heat. But showers that came pouring right as session began kept
temperatures cool.
	   The morning practice had some players sweating.
	   ``I'm not used to this yet,'' said midfielder Hiroshi Nanami,
25, after a light jog. ``I'll be OK in about three days. It's

King Hussein says Arab divisions are blocking proposed summit 
</HEADLINE>
By JAMAL HALABY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Divisions stemming from the 1990-91 Gulf
Crisis are blocking a bid to hold an Arab summit, Jordan's King
Hussein said Saturday.
	   Arab governments have been unable to agree on a date, an agenda,
and the participants for a summit on the stalled Middle East peace
process, the king told some 150 journalists in his hilltop palace
in Amman.
	   ``The summit is hampered by some obstacles related to the period
of 1990-91, which must be vanquished,'' Hussein said, referring
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, which divided Arabs into a pro-Iraqi
camp and an anti-Iraqi one.
	   Arab diplomats say several Gulf Arab states are opposed to
inviting Iraq to the summit. At the same time, Syria is opposed to
the presence of Jordan and the Palestinians as it condemns their
separate peace treaties with Israel.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has called for the summit to
rally support for his position in the peace process, which has
foundered on Israel's rejection of a U.S. proposal for an Israeli
troop withdrawal from 13.1 percent of the West Bank.
	   The Palestinians accept the proposal, but Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu has offered no more than a 9 percent pull back.
	   The king said there were forces within Israeli society that were
pushing the country toward ``going back to the fortress and hiding
behind its walls, giving the impression that this will ensure their
safety and security.''
	   ``We have to resist this policy and this inclination,'' he said
in what was seen as an implicit criticism of Netanyahu.
	   He called on Netanyahu to implement the Israeli-Palestinian
accords, which call for a withdrawal from the West Bank, ``to the
spirit and the letter.''
	   Failure to do so ``will have negative results,'' he warned.
	   Hussein repeatedly pledged his support to Arafat and his
administration in what appeared to be a reply to suggestions that
the king favors the radical Palestinian movement Hamas.
	   ``Our support to the Palestinian Authority is a sacred duty,''
said Hussein. The authority ``is the only side responsible for the
Palestinian people and we do not advocate any alternatives and will
not allow that.''
	   Turning to Jordanian affairs, Hussein defended a controversial
press bill, saying it would increase press freedom and was not a
step back from the liberalization process introduced in 1989.
	   The draft law, which parliament is expected to debate soon,
increases 30 fold the amount a journalist can be fined for
infringing a vague definition of state security. It also obliges
reporters to divulge their sources in court.

	   The resolution, submitted by Japan, Costa Rica, Slovenia and

capable of carrying nuclear warheads and to sign nuclear arms
control treaties.
	   It also asked India and Pakistan to exercise restraint and to
find ``mutually acceptable solutions'' to the ``root causes of
those tensions, including Kashmir.''
	   The resolution also states that although India and Pakistan have
exploded nuclear devices, they would not be accorded status as
nuclear states.
	   Under the 1970 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the five
nuclear powers are the only nations allowed to maintain nuclear
arsenals. India and Pakistan have refused to sign the treaty.
	   The resolution also welcomed an offer by U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan to encourage India and Pakistan to resume a high-level
dialogue that broke down last year because of differences over
Kashmir.

World Cup: Passarella warns players to be careful with Japan 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   L'ETRAT, France (AP) _ Coach Daniel Passarella says Argentina
will take no chances when playing huge underdog Japan in their
World Cup opener June 14 in Toulouse.
	   ``Japan has a team that knows what it is doing, and works very
well in defense,'' Passarella said.
	   Passarella, who spoke to reporters late Friday, said he watched
Japan's 1-0 loss to Yugoslavia in a warmup match in Switzerland
last week and left the game with ``very much respect'' for the
Asians.
	   ``The Japanese in no way deserved that defeat,'' Passarella
said. ``They played to get more.''
	   Passarella noted that Japan has a strong defense which can
smoothly switch from man-to-man to zone marking. He has thus
ordered his defenders to simulate that change when marking Gabriel
Batistuta and Claudio Lopez, expected to be Argentina's starting
strikers.
	   There's little room to compare soccer history between two-time
world champion Argentina and Japan, which is making its World Cup
finals debut.
	   But, Argentines often remember what they felt was a humiliating
3-2 defeat to Japan in the 1964 Olympics in Tokyo.
	   Argentina and Japan will play in Group H, with Jamaica and
Croatia.

	   The resolution also ``encourages'' member states to prevent the
export of materials, equipment and technology ``that could in any
way assist programs in India or Pakistan for nuclear weapons.''
	   ``Nuclear tests conducted by India and Pakistan in recent weeks
represent a profound blow not only to the stability and security of
their region but also to the international non-proliferation regime
on which we all depend,'' U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson said.
	   Despite sanctions that Washington imposed on the two countries,
Richardson said U.S. policy is not to make India and Pakistan
``pariah states'' but to ``engage and to convince them that it is
in their own national security interests to do what the
international community is urging them to do.''
	   Before the vote, India slammed the council action, saying it
overstepped the council's authority. India also renewed accusations
there was a double-standard that allows the five longstanding
nuclear states _ which are also permanent council members _ to
retain their arsenals.
	   In a letter to council President Antonio Monteiro, India's U.N.
ambassador, Kamalesh Sharma, said the resolution involved
``sovereign decisions taken by member states, not matters in which
the council has any role.''
	   Sharma asked whether the Security Council can ``continue to
ignore the overwhelming demand'' of the rest of the world ``for
elimination of nuclear weapons'' when the most important council
members refuse to dismantle their own arsenals.
	   India and Pakistan have fought three wars since 1947 _ two of
them over Kashmir, which is divided between them.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Dozens of houses were aflame and
Serb gunners kept shelling villages in Kosovo, where another four
people were killed in fighting, ethnic Albanian and Serb sources
said Saturday.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, which is close to the ethnic
Albanian leadership in the Serbian province, said fighting
continued Saturday in the Decani area, about 70 kilometers (45
miles) west of the provincial capital, Pristina. The villages of
Shaptej, Gramocel and Babaloc were targeted by the Serbs' heavy
artillery, it said.
	   Meanwhile, German foreign ministry official Wolfgang Ischinger,
touring the Balkans, met with ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova
in Pristina.
	   Ischinger said his visit was part of an international effort to
help ``de-escalate the present crisis, to end military action ...
and help refugees return.''
	   He spoke of ``ethnic cleansing'' _ the policy of forcefully
driving out ethnic Albanians from Kosovo, saying it was ``a
complete disaster, totally unacceptable.''
	   Ischinger was scheduled to travel on to Belgrade for meetings
with top government officials.
	   Rugova pleaded for ``urgent international intervention to stop
the Serb forces' aggression,'' insisting that peaceful means were
``the best way for achieving Kosovo's independence.''
	   Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million people
and demand independence from Serbia, the larger of two republics
remaining in Yugoslavia. Serbia is totally opposed to Kosovo's
independence and so are foreign powers, while the Kosovo Liberation
Army rejects a peaceful solution and is fighting for secession.
	   More than 250 people have died since March 1 in escalating
clashes between government forces and the KLA, the armed wing of
the Albanian independence movement. More than 10,000 Kosovo
Albanian refugees fled to northern Albania this week.
	   The United Nations, in an unusually strong statement Friday,
accused Serbian forces of atrocities in Kosovo
	   Most of western Kosovo remained sealed off Saturday, and it was
impossible to verify conflicting casualty reports.
	   A 3-year-old child, identified as Leutrim Aga, was killed as he
slept in his bed in Gramocel and three more ethnic Albanians were
wounded in that village. Another ethnic Albanian was found dead in
nearby Babaloc, the Kosovo Information Center said.
	   The Center also said that three more people were wounded in
another Decani village, Prilep, in a Serb attack involving military
planes. None of the reports could be independently confirmed.
	   The Center also issued a list of 202 names of people missing
after the latest clashes in the Decani region.
	   Ethnic Albanian sources earlier reported 50 dead, 200 missing
and several villages destroyed in the Decani region. There were
also unconfirmed reports of a mass grave containing 300 bodies.
	   The Center said Serbian forces were shelling a border strip west
of Djakovica, 75 kilometers (47 miles) southwest of Pristina.
	   Serbian sources said two men were killed in a border clash
between Serb-led Yugoslav army troops and an armed group attempting
to illegally enter the province from Macedonia on Saturday. They
were the first dead at the Macedonian border.
	   A Serb policemen was also reported to have died in the Belgrade
military hospital of injuries sustained in earlier fighting in
Kosovo.
	   A group of 16 central European and Balkan countries meeting
Saturday in Brioni, Croatia, condemned the violence and all forms
of terrorism in Kosovo.
	   Speaking to reporters in Brioni, Ilir Meta, Albania's state
secretary for European integration, repeated his government's call
for outside assistance to cope with the continuing influx of Kosovo
refugees.

Spain's Sergio Garcia wins British Amateur Championship 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS quotes
<TEXT>
	   GULLANE, Scotland (AP) _ Sergio Garcia, expected to be Spain's
next great golfer, won the British Amateur Championship Saturday,
beating Craig Williams of Wales 7 and 6.
	   The 18-year-old Spaniard becomes the first player to hold both
the British Boys and British Amateur titles since countryman Jose
Maria Olazabal in 1984.
	   Garcia advanced to the final after winning a sudden-death
semifinal playoff Friday on the 23rd hole to beat Mark Hilton of
England.
	   He took a four-hole lead after the opening 18 Saturday and was
eight up after 26 holes on a day of on-and-off rain at Muirfield.
	   Garcia fell back to a six-hole advantage after losing the 27th
hole (No. 9), but won the 30th and halved the next two holes to
close out the Welshman.
	   Williams won his Friday semifinal 3 and 2 over Ben Mason of
England.
	   With the win, Garcia has qualified for July's British Open and
the U.S. Amateur in August. He's also qualified for next year's
Masters.
	   ``Now I've done it my next dream is to win the (British) Open,''
he said. ``This year? Well, I'll give it a try,''

Cuba says no special system for U.S. visa lottery applications 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Cuba said Saturday that it won't set up any
special mechanisms to help its citizens apply for a new U.S. visa
lottery, in which hundreds of thousands of Cubans are expected to
participate.
	   In a statement reported by the government's Prensa Latina news
agency and monitored in Mexico City, Cuba's post office said it
would not set up a special system.
	   It reminded Cubans that no post offices send mail directly to
diplomatic offices of the United States, but said people can send
applications through the normal mail.
	   The lottery, the third of its kind, was announced Friday in
Washington. It opens June 15, and winners are granted an interview
by U.S. consular officers.
	   Applicants must answer questions about their education, work
experience and relatives in the United States.
	   In the last lottery, in 1996, more than 436,000 applications
were received. In the first, in 1994, 190,000 people applied.
	   The visa lotteries were set up to end the ``boat people''
crisis, in which hundreds of thousands of Cubans set off for the
United States on often dangerous rafts.
	   The United States agreed to give out at least 20,000 visas a
year and to return any Cubans intercepted on the high seas. The
boat exodus diminished significantly after the decision.

Striking Aeromexico flight attendants reach accord 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Striking flight attendants for Mexico's
largest airline have reached an accord with the company, the
union's secretary-general said Saturday.
	   The Aeromexico flight attendants called a meeting Saturday to
vote on the accord, Secretary-General Alejandra Barrales told The
Associated Press. She expected approval of the accord.
	   The 1,033 unionized flight attendants went on strike a week ago
over salaries, work hours, benefits and the size of flight crews,
but since the government took over right away they never actually
walked off the job.
	   Mexico's constitution gives the government the right to
temporarily seize companies vital to the nation's economy or
security.
	   Barrales said the airline agreed to all their main concerns _ an
18.3 percent raise, one additional flight attendant on each flight,
extra pay for night work and the beginnings of a retirement plan.
	   If the flight attendants declare an end to their strike, the
government will hand operations back over to Aeromexico.

Security Council passes resolution against South Asia nuclear programs 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: COMBINES previous. RESTORES byline, overline
By ROBERT H. REID
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Hoping to curb a dangerous arms race in
South Asia, the U.N. Security Council voted unanimously Saturday to
urge India and Pakistan to halt their nuclear weapons programs and
to deny them status as nuclear states.
	   But members also warned the nuclear weapons states _ the United
States, Russia, China, France and Britain _ that they have a
responsibility to renew efforts to curb nuclear weapons, including
those in their own arsenals.
	   ``The rest of us expect you to seriously take your
responsibility of finally removing the threat of nuclear weapons,
which, even with the end of the Second World War, continues to hang
over our heads,'' Kenyan Ambassador Njunguna Moses Mahugu said.
	   Swedish Ambassador Hans Dahlgren said it was not enough to
``stem the flow'' of nuclear weapons.
	   ``We must also turn the tide,'' Dahlgren said. ``And the
ultimate goal is to eliminate all weapons of mass destruction. The
five nuclear weapons states bore the particular responsibility to
make that possible.''
	   The resolution, submitted by Japan, Costa Rica, Slovenia and
Sweden, urged India and Pakistan to halt deployment of missiles
capable of carrying nuclear warheads and to sign nuclear arms
control treaties.
	   It also asked India and Pakistan to exercise restraint and to
find ``mutually acceptable solutions'' to the ``root causes of
those tensions, including Kashmir.''
	   The resolution also states that although India and Pakistan have
exploded nuclear devices, they would not be accorded status as
nuclear states.
	   Under the 1970 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the five
nuclear powers are the only nations allowed to maintain nuclear
arsenals. India and Pakistan have refused to sign the treaty.
	   The resolution also welcomed an offer by U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan to encourage India and Pakistan to resume a high-level
dialogue that broke down last year because of differences over
Kashmir.
	   The resolution also ``encourages'' member states to prevent the
export of materials, equipment and technology ``that could in any
way assist programs in India or Pakistan for nuclear weapons.''
	   ``Nuclear tests conducted by India and Pakistan in recent weeks
represent a profound blow not only to the stability and security of
their region but also to the international non-proliferation regime
on which we all depend,'' U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson said.
	   Despite sanctions that Washington imposed on the two countries,
Richardson said U.S. policy is not to make India and Pakistan
``pariah states'' but to ``engage and to convince them that it is
in their own national security interests to do what the
international community is urging them to do.''
	   Before the vote, India slammed the council action, saying it
overstepped the council's authority. India also renewed accusations
there was a double-standard that allows the five longstanding
nuclear states _ which are also permanent council members _ to
retain their arsenals.
	   In a letter to council President Antonio Monteiro, India's U.N.
ambassador, Kamalesh Sharma, said the resolution involved
``sovereign decisions taken by member states, not matters in which
the council has any role.''
	   Sharma asked whether the Security Council can ``continue to
ignore the overwhelming demand'' of the rest of the world ``for
elimination of nuclear weapons'' when the most important council
members refuse to dismantle their own arsenals.
	   India and Pakistan have fought three wars since 1947 _ two of
them over Kashmir, which is divided between them.

World's largest cruise ship ends maiden voyage 
</HEADLINE>
AP Photo BAR101
By RICHARD SCHWEID
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BARCELONA, Spain (AP) _ It might seem like a 12-day
Mediterranean cruise on the inaugural voyage of the world's largest
cruise ship would be pretty relaxing, considering the ship has five
swimming pools, a spa, a miniature nine-hole golf course, tennis
courts, a casino, three grand dining salons, seven less informal
restaurants, a theater and 12 bars.
	   The Grand Princess, 15 floors high (201 feet or 61.26 meters)
and 951 feet (289.86 meters) wide, towered over the harbor as it
docked Saturday in this northern Spain port, the last call on its
maiden voyage. It is twice as big as the Titanic.
	   Passenger Steve Epstein of Philadelphia said the voyage wasn't
all lounge chair laziness.
	   ``You start the day at 6 a.m. when you want to tour a city like
we did in Venice,'' he said. ``There's something to keep you busy
from the minute you wake up to a delicious breakfast, right through
the evening with entertainment like Alan King and Red Buttons.
There's not much time for just relaxing.''
	   Not that passengers couldn't relax if they wanted to: after all,
each of the ship's 1,296 cabins has its own little balcony where
passengers can sit and watch the sea. And, with a crew of over a
thousand, the 2,600 passengers on this trip had plenty of people
eager to make their journey a pleasant one.
	   ``I've taken numerous cruises, and this is the best in terms of
service and attention from the crew,'' said Helene Goss, from
Aventura, FL. ``They did a tremendous job.''
	   Helene, and her husband, Morton Goss, each paid about dlrs 3,000
for the cruise, not including air fare. They considered it a fair
price when compared with other cruise lines.
	   The ship, which belongs to Princess Cruises, cost about dlrs 450
million to build. Most passengers seemed satisfied with its maiden
voyage, but there were some dissenters on arrival in Barcelona.
	   One man, who wouldn't give his name, said he paid for a suite,
but had to wait a day and a half for the butler that came with it.
He said he wasn't happy with the food or the service, but expected
other passengers wouldn't complain because they were happy to be
part of a prestigious maiden voyage.
	   And most of the passengers, leaving the ship to board tour buses
that would take them around the city, expressed satisfaction with
the voyage that began on May 26 in Istanbul with stops in Athens
and Venice.
	   ``It has been an excellent voyage,'' said Linda Senado, from
Mexico City. ``My cabin was a little small, but overall I would
give it high ratings. The ship is almost too big, though. It's so
big, I didn't even discover the nine-hole miniature golf course
until yesterday.''

Kolzig on a roll as finals draw near AP Sports Writer

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Olaf Kolzig usually plays better when he faces
a barrage of shots. That's a good thing for the Washington
Capitals, because Olie the Goalie can expect to be a busy man in
the Stanley Cup finals.
	   Kolzig is the main reason why the Capitals are in the finals for
the first time in their 24-year existence. A backup just a year
ago, Kolzig has allowed only 31 goals in 17 playoff games thus far
_ an impressive average of just 1.82 goals per game.
	   But now he must face the Detroit Red Wings, who have the top
four point-scorers in the playoffs _ sharpshooters Steve Yzerman,
Nicklas Lidstrom, Sergei Fedorov and Tomas Holmstrom.
	   Halfway through Game 6 of the Capitals-Buffalo series, the
Sabres were outshooting Washington 20-10. Capitals coach Ron Wilson
wasn't worried; in fact, he sort of liked the way things were
going.
	   ``I thought, `We're kind of comfortable playing these types of
games where we're struggling a little bit.' Olie's into it, he's
seeing a lot of pucks so he's comfortable,'' Wilson said. ``The
more action, the more he's into it and he gets sharp.''
	   Kolzig allowed only two goals in 66-plus minutes in Game 6, and
Washington won in overtime. Game 1 of the finals will be held
Tuesday night in Detroit.
	   The Capitals on many occasions in the past were victimized in
the playoffs by a hot goaltender, but this time Washington seems to
have one on its side. Kolzig, however, refused to accept the label.
	   ``I never really believed I was the hot goaltender,'' he said.
``I was a confident goaltender. I thought the way I played in
regular season carried over into the postseason. People are going
to call you what they want, but my teammates believe in me and I
believe in them, and that's all that really matters.''
	   Kolzig won't be able to beat the Red Wings by himself, although
the Capitals give him credit for lifting him past the Boston Bruins
in the opening round when Washington was badly outshot in virtually
every game.
	   ``We have to be ready,'' forward Joe Juneau said. ``We just have
to keep playing better and better. Against Boston we weren't
playing our best hockey, and Olaf Kolzig kept us in the series.
Against Ottawa we played better, and against Buffalo we turned it
up a notch.''
	   Having worked so hard to advance to the finals for the first
time, the Capitals are in perfect position to suffer a huge
letdown. But the players know that winning the Stanley Cup is the
only way this season can be considered a complete success.
	   ``We won our (conference) and now we have a chance to win the
Stanley Cup. We have to remember that we have a lot of work to
do,'' forward Chris Simon said. ``We're not satisfied with being
second. We want to be No. 1, and we know we have to keep playing
the same way.''

Cuba's cigar chief says quality is not dropping 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Responding to criticism that the quality of
Cuban cigars is dropping as production booms, the head of Cuba's
government cigar producers says the stogies are as good as ever.
	   In an article by the government news agency Prensa Latina,
monitored in Mexico City, the head of Cuba's Union of Tabacco
Companies said Cuban cigars are works of art and that there are
enough quality checks to ensure their flavor.
	   Production grew 40 percent last year, and is expected to grow
another 60 percent this year, Francisco Linares Calvo said Friday.
	   That means the industry will make 160 million cigars for export,
which will net the companies dlrs 280 million _ a profit of dlrs
180 million, Prensa Latina said.
	   The world market for Cuban cigars has been growing strongly over
the past few years. Some aficionados have complained that quality
has been dropping as production increases.

Cuba says no special system for U.S. visa lottery applications 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Cuba said Saturday that it won't set up any
special mechanisms to help its citizens apply for a new U.S. visa
lottery, in which hundreds of thousands of Cubans are expected to
participate.
	   In a statement reported by the government's Prensa Latina news
agency and monitored in Mexico City, Cuba's post office said it
would not set up a special system.
	   It reminded Cubans that no post offices send mail directly to
diplomatic offices of the United States, but said people can send
applications through the normal mail.
	   The lottery, the third of its kind, was announced Friday in
Washington. It opens June 15, and winners are granted an interview
by U.S. consular officers.
	   Applicants must answer questions about their education, work
experience and relatives in the United States.
	   In the last lottery, in 1996, more than 436,000 applications
were received. In the first, in 1994, 190,000 people applied.
	   The visa lotteries were set up to end the ``boat people''
crisis, in which hundreds of thousands of Cubans set off for the
United States on often dangerous rafts.
	   The United States agreed to give out at least 20,000 visas a
year and to return any Cubans intercepted on the high seas. The
boat exodus diminished significantly after the decision.

One village mourns 1,200 people dead in earthquake 
</HEADLINE>
By ZAHEERUDDIN ABDULLAH
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   DASHTAK, Afghanistan (AP) _ Standing in a line at the edge of
the sheared-off mountainside, a mullah and his congregation intoned
a final prayer for the more than 1,200 people of Dashtak who
perished in last week's devastating earthquake.
	   Many of the dead, including 140 children who were attending
school, were swept to their death in a powerful landslide that
poured down the mountain.
	   ''If you want to go into this place and get your wood, do it
now,'' the mullah said. ''After this, people cannot walk in this
area. It is a big cemetery now.''
	   The mountain village of Dashtak was the hardest hit by the May
29 quake. More than one-fifth of its people were killed and 600 of
its houses destroyed when the side of the mountain fell away.
	   Now it is a sea of gray rock and dust that cakes the skin.
	   The scale of the disaster at Dashtak, so remote that
international aid workers did not find it for days after it was
leveled by nature's wrath, gives credence to estimates that as many
as 5,000 people died in the catastrophe.
	   An Associated Press reporter accompanied the first aid flight
into Dashtak and spent two days on the mountain with the
traumatized villagers before trekking back down and hitching a ride
to Rostaq, the nearest town, 20 kilometers (12 miles) away.
	   Struggling to alleviate a vast human disaster spread over 100
villages in 700 square miles (1,815 square kilometers), the United
Nations and a half-dozen other charity agencies have just three
tiny helicopters to deliver supplies and evacuate the seriously
wounded.
	   In Dashtak, the schoolhouse, its pupils and six teachers are the
symbol of a community's suffering, compounded by the survivors'
inability to give their dead a proper burial.
	   Beside their memories of the fateful morning, villagers are
haunted by the stomach-churning aftershocks that shake the mountain
daily and deepen the cracks in the earth.
	   They beg for the most rudimentary things to survive: food, tents
and water. The quake struck the remote region in the morning, when
many men were working the fields.
	   ''I saw the earth boiling and then it was like a big explosion.
All the dust came up from the village, I thought everything had
been swallowed by the earth,'' said Abdul Mahmood, who watched from
a distance. By the time he reached his home, nothing was left. His
wife and five children were buried under the rubble.
	   In the neighboring village of Bekha, Saeed Omar was plowing a
hillside with his two cows when the tremor hit, throwing him and
the animals into the air and depositing them hundreds of meters
(yards) away.
	   ''All the area was covered with dust. I left my animals, rushed
toward the village, and dug out two people,'' Omar said.
	   Not a single family in Dashtak escaped the disaster. Villagers
pointed in every direction and recited their grim lists: 40 dead
here, 15 there, young shepherds and their flocks buried on the
slope across the way.
	   Sarwar, 33, who like many Afghans uses just one name, said he
lost his whole family.
	   ''They are all here, '' he said pointing over the side of the
mountain. ''My mother, my father, my children, my wife. All of them
are here under deep rubble. I have three children. I am working to
try to find them, but there is no way.''
	   People came from neighboring villages to try to dig out the
dead, especially the school children. They used shovels, bare
hands, anything they could, usually without result.
	   People have a few potatoes and some bread to eat, but most of
their animals have died and they have nothing other than
international aid to fortify them.
	   Their water supply from three rivers has been contaminated by
the landslides and survivors are succumbing to disease. Ruhullah,
an Afghan doctor working for a Swedish charity, said he was seeing
pneumonia, skin diseases, tuberculosis, malnutrition and malaria
among survivors.
	   Even the youngest have no faith that the future won't bring more
death, more destruction, more misery.
	   ''I lost my whole family. I am now wondering about my future,''
said 10-year-old Zibi Sah, hunched over with grief after the quake
carried away her father and three little brothers.
	   Many said they didn't want to stay in Dashtak any longer and
were waiting for the authorities to help them move.
	   Saif-ur Rehman, 55, said he was worried about his wife and
children since all the family's arable land had been washed away in
the landslide.
	   ''The earth is very hard and the sky is too far. We cannot go
anywhere.''

Security Council considers resolution against nuclear programs EDITS 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Iranian calls for Israel to sign treaties. TRIMS,
By ROBERT H. REID
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Hoping to curb a dangerous arms race in
South Asia, the U.N. Security Council voted unanimously Saturday to
urge India and Pakistan to halt their nuclear weapons programs and
to deny them status as nuclear states.
	   But members also warned the nuclear weapons states _ the United
States, Russia, China, France and Britain _ that they have a
responsibility to renew efforts to curb nuclear weapons, including
those in their own arsenals.
	   ``The rest of us expect you to seriously take your
responsibility of finally removing the threat of nuclear weapons,
which, even with the end of the Second World War, continue to hang
over our heads,'' Kenyan Ambassador Njunguna Moses Mahugu said.
	   Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi said that Israel has also
refused to sign the 1970 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty or to
accept safeguards of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
	   He said ``Israeli intransigence'' on accepting nuclear controls
``has endangered the entire'' Middle East. Israel has never
admitted having nuclear weapons but is widely assumed to have the
necessary technology to build a bomb quickly.
	   In a letter to Council President Antonio Monteiro, India's U.N.
ambassador, Kamalesh Sharma, said the resolution involved
``sovereign decisions taken by member states, not matters in which
the council has any role.''
	   Sharma asked whether the Security Council can ``continue to
ignore the overwhelming demand'' of the rest of the world ``for
elimination of nuclear weapons'' when the most important council
members refuse to dismantle their own arsenals.
	   The resolution, cosponsored by Japan, Costa Rica, Slovenia and
Sweden, urged India and Pakistan to halt deployment of missiles
capable of carrying nuclear warheads and to sign nuclear arms
control treaties.
	   It also asked India and Pakistan to exercise restraint and to
find ``mutually acceptable solutions'' to the ``root causes of
those tensions, including Kashmir.''
	   The resolution also stated that although India and Pakistan have
exploded nuclear devices, they would not be accorded status as
nuclear states.
	   Under the non-proliferation treaty, the five nuclear powers are
the only nations allowed to maintain nuclear arsenals. India and
Pakistan have refused to sign the treaty.
	   It also welcomed an offer by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
to encourage India and Pakistan to resume a high-level dialogue
that broke down last year because of differences over Kashmir.
	   India and Pakistan have fought three wars since 1947 _ two of
them over Kashmir, which is divided between them.

Coast guard seizes Turkish ship poaching prized fish eggs 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ After several warning shots, the coast
guard seized Saturday a Turkish ship after it crossed illegally
into Romanian waters to poach fish, an official said Saturday.
	   The fishermen aboard the Addoglu 2 had approached the Black Sea
port of Constanta to catch plaice, which lay their eggs near the
shore, said Coast Guard Commander Ion Dinea by telephone.
	   The poachers catch fish and then take out the roe which is
considered a delicacy.
	   Constanta is some 200 kilometers (125 miles) southeast of
Bucharest.
	   Dinea said the Turkish fishermen threw the plaice into the sea
in order to avoid being caught with the evidence. They surrendered
only after a second coast-guard ship joined in the pursuit and
fired warning shots.
	   Dinea said this was the 30th ship that crossed illegally into
Romanian waters this year.
	   Under Romanian law, the fishermen are liable to pay a fine of 10
million lei (almost dlrs 1,200). Their ship and fishing equipment
could be confiscated.

Whatever happens, it's a Spanish sweep this year at French Open 
</HEADLINE>
By SALVATORE ZANCA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ It's 1994 all over again for Spain: two Spanish men
in the French Open finals, Arantxa Sanchez Vicario already the
women's champion.
	   This time, buddies Carlos Moya and Alex Corretja are battling to
join Sanchez Vicario as the champion. In 1994, Sergi Bruguera beat
Alberto Berasategui for the trophy.
	   Spanish men have won the French Open five times already, but
have taken only three other Grand Slam titles. So it isn't too
surprising that again, there will be a battle of clay-court
specialists.
	   The two have met three times, not surprisingly, all on clay.
Corretja has a 2-1 edge.
	   But Moya has gone farther in Grand Slams. He reached the 1997
Australian Open final, where he lost to Pete Sampras.
	   And he beat Corretja at Monte Carlo this year on his way to the
title.
	   Moya, seeded 12th, is 28-12 this year. Corretja, seeded 14th,
takes a 27-8 record into the final.
	   In the 1997 Australian final, Moya was hammered by Sampras,
winning just eight games in three sets.
	   Yet Moya feels he is making a name for himself on all surfaces.
	   ``Maybe one time to play the final of a Grand Slam is a
coincidence, but I don't think two times is a coincidence. If that
means I am a good player, I am a good player. I have improved my
game, and that's why I'm here right now.''
	   He says he learned from that defeat against Sampras.
	   ``Everything was new for me at that moment. I was 20. Now I am a
year older. It's not much, but it's something.''
	   Corretja knows about playing Sampras. He pushed him to a
dramatic fifth-set tiebreaker in the 1996 U.S. Open quarterfinal,
double-faulting on match point to let a sickened Sampras win.
	   He had an easier time against another weary player, Cedric
Pioline, in the French Open semifinals this year, winning in
straight sets.
	   Corretja also knows about being tired. Winning four three-set
matches in three days because of rainouts in Hamburg, he had to
retire in the final.
	   ``It's important to be in good shape because we have to play 15
days on clay. Tough matches. Tough conditions. It's obvious you've
got to be in good shape.''
	   But however tired he gets on Sunday, adrenaline should pull him
through.
	   ``I've been working my whole life to find a place in the final
of a Grand Slam,'' he said. ``Let's see if I can win it.
	   ``I know I am going to play a friend,'' Corretja said. ``I think
we already won, both of us, and that's the most important thing. No
matter who the champion is, I think we've already won the
tournament.''

World Cup: Baggio is a happy man, likely to start against Chile 
</HEADLINE>
By PIERO VALSECCHI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SENLIS, France (AP) _ Roberto Baggio is a happy man these days.
	   Richer with a newly signed prestigious contract with Inter
Milan, the imaginative Italian soccer veteran is expected to start
in Italy's World Cup opener against Chile.
	   ``Life can begin anew at 31 of age. I'm happy to be here and
ready to help the team to go as far as possible in the
tournament,'' Baggio said.
	   ``I'm ready to play. It's up to coach (Cesare) Maldini to take
decisions,'' he added.
	   Baggio, who earned a last-minute berth on Italy's World Cup team
thanks to the 22 goals scored with low-ranked Bologna, is likely to
be in the starting 11 at Bordeaux next Thursday as a substitute of
Alessandro Del Piero.
	   Baggio is starting in his third World Cup. In the two previous
editions he helped Italy to earn a third place in 1990 and a second
spot in 1994.
	   Del Piero, the young star-forward who replaced Baggio at
Juventus and on the national team, is recovering from a right this.
	   Baggio, who signed a two-year contract with Inter before flying
to France Friday, said he was looking forward to playing with
Brazilian star Ronaldo next season.
	   ``We look like a dangerous, powerful duo,'' Baggio said. ``But
it will be tough, because everybody will be expecting great things
from us. For the time being we must think of the World Cup, on
rival sides,'' Baggio said.
	   Baggio, who will get about dlrs 2.5 million a year from Inter,
said he considered Brazil the best World Cup team and the favorite
to win the title.
	   From the Brazilian training center Ronaldo made it known that he
considered Baggio's transfer to Inter a boost to the Milan club and
chances of winning the league title and the Champions Cup next
season.
	   On different teams, Ronaldo and Baggio combined for 47 goals in
the just concluded Italian Serie A.
	   Coach Maldini said the Italian team was not yet at 100 percent
but added it was improving day after day.
	   ``We are getting quicker and have great motivations for the
match with Chile. The first match is crucial for qualification to
the next round,'' the Italian coach said.
	   He disclosed that he planned to have Fabio Cannavaro and
Alessandro Nesta marking closely Chile's strikers Marcelo Salas and
Ivan Zamorano.
	   The defensive duo will be tested in Sunday's friendly against a
French regional selection along with Inter's offensive midfielder
Francesco Moriero.
	   Baggio will team in front with Christian Vieri, the Italian
striker of Atletico Madrid who has recovered from stomach problems.
	   The regional selection was picked by Italian officials to
replace the original opponent, the local amateur team.

Sudanese students enrol for controversial military service 
</HEADLINE>
By MOHAMED OSMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ With their mothers wailing, hundreds of
Sudanese students climbed into trucks in Khartoum's main square
Saturday to start their military service.
	   In what is the first intake of 1998, some 90,000 high school
students are expected to report for training in the next few days.
	   Their enlistment comes days after President Omar el-Bashir
ordered a general mobilization following a rebel victory in
southeast Sudan.
	   The Sudan Peoples' Liberation Army announced Tuesday that it had
taken the garrison town of Ulu, 455 kilometers (280 miles)
southeast of Khartoum.
	   On Saturday, the head of Sudan's only legal political party,
Mutasim Abdul-Rahim, issued a statement urging ``all those who are
able to carry a gun to join the (military training) camps and move
to the operational zones to defend the gains of the homeland.''
	   ``Jihad (holy war) has now become an obligation that comes
before any other duty,'' Abdul-Rahim said.
	   The training program, which can include deploying the students
in the war zones of southern and eastern Sudan, has been highly
controversial.
	   In April, 52 conscripts drowned in the Blue Nile when their boat
capsized as they fled a camp southeast of Khartoum. Opposition
groups said the death toll was was much higher _ at least 129 _ and
the incident generated widespread criticism of the conscription of
students.
	   But the government has decreed that students have to fufill
their national service in order to obtain the certificates required
for entrance to university.
	   In April, el-Bashir said his government plans to recruit 655,000
students over three years for the war against rebels.
	   The SPLA is fighting for more autonomy for the predominantly
Christian and animist southerners from the Islamic north. More than
1.3 million people have died in the war and consequent famines.

opening match of Group B.
	   ``The lesion has disappeared but we can't give a certain date

injuries,'' doctor Andrea Ferretti said.
	   Del Piero, considered a key to Italy's success in the World Cup,
trained on his own Saturday as the other ``Azzurri'' kicked and
tackled in a brief game in Italy's first session on French soil at
the sports center of Senlis, north of Paris.

World Cup: Colombia thinks only of Romania as World Cup approaches 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LA TUR DU PIN, France (AP) - For Colombia, the whole World Cup
experience comes down to one game _ its inaugural match against
Romania.
	   A victory over Romania not only would put Colombia en route to
the second round in a group that includes England and Tunisia, but
would also avenge its defeat in the inaugural game of USA '94
against the Romanians.
	   ``We have to win or win,'' Colombian coach Hernan Dario Gomez
said. ``We dream with avenging our failure of 1994, and to achieve
that, we have to beat Romania.''
	   ``It will be tough, but not impossible,'' said captain Carlos
Valderrama. ``We are anxious to bury the ghost'' of the last World
Cup.
	   England is a strong favorite to take the first place in the
group, and Colombia hopes a win over Romania would lift it to
second and allow it to advance the next round, something it could
not manage four years ago.
	   The Colombian team arrived in the United States as a candidate
to win that tournament, but lost to Romania and the home team and
didn't survive the first round.
	   ``Our goal is to beat Romania,'' midfielder Harold Lozano said.
	   ``If we beat the Romanians, we will face England and Tunisia
with a more positive attitude and good chances of making it to the
second round,'' goalkeeper Farid Mondragon added.

	   PLOIESTI, Romania (AP) _ Dominating throughout the match,
Romania beat hapless Moldova 5-1 Saturday in their last warm-up
game before the World Cup final in France.
	   Romania launched attacks from the very beginning, but their
first scoring chance came only in the second part of the first
half.
	   After missing a penalty kick, Gheorghe Popescu of Galatasaray
recovered quickly the ball and scored in the 34th minute.
	   Two minutes later, teammate Gheorge Hagi served Chelsea's Dan
Petrescu in the penalty area, who made it 2-0.
	   After change of sides, Ilie Dumitrescu of Atlanta, after
outdribbling spectacularly several Moldovan defenders, scored in
the 49th minute, shoving in the ball through Moldova goalkeeper
Dinov's legs.
	   Goal number four was a header by Viorel Moldovan in the 74th
minute.
	   The hosts kept attacking, and in the 83rd minute Radu Nicolescu,
positioned in the left corner of the penalty box, lifted the ball
over Moldova's keeper for a 5-0 lead.
	   Moldova's lone goal came from Iuri Tabanov in the 88th who
connected on a rebound.
	   The Romanians will leave Sunday for the French city of Albi,
where they will be accommodated during the tournament.
	   Romania plays in Group G together with England, Colombia and
Tunisia.
	   Lineups
	   Romania: Dumitru Stangaciu, Constantin Galca, Gheorghe Popescu,
Iulian Filipescu, Dan Petrescu, Gheorghe Hagi, Liviu Ciobotariu,

	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Davor Suker scored three goals Saturday
as Croatia trounced Australia 7-0 in its last warmup match before
the World Cup.
	   The victory prompted outbursts of delight throughout the capital
of Zagreb as people sounded horns and screamed joyfully.
	   Although Australia did not qualify for the World Cup, the result
_ the best in Croatia's eight-year history _ certainly boosts its
confidence. Its previous biggest margin of victory came in a 7-1
rout of Estonia.
	   The first goal came already in the 14th minute, when Suker hit a
penalty kick after Australia's goalkeeper Zeljko Kalac earned a
yellow card for a foul on Mario Stanic.
	   Suker scored again in the 37th minute, and only three minutes
later, Robert Prosinecki made it 3-0. Team captain Zvonimir Boban
netted in the 47th minute.
	   In the 63rd, Suker scored his third goal of the match and then
left the game. His substitute, Ardian Kozniku, wasted no time in
scoring goal No. 6 in the 72nd minute. Boban finished the rout with
his second goal in the closing minutes.
	   The victory gives Croatia some momentum after a 2-1 loss to
Slovakia last week.
	   The team is also playing without Alen Boksic, one of its top
strikers, who has been ruled out of the World Cup with a knee
injury. Another striker, Igor Cvitanovic, was sent home by the
coach Miroslav Ciro Blazevic for refusing to run laps in practice.
	   Blazevic subsequently listed only four strikers on his final
roster, putting his highest hopes in Suker.
	   The team departs for France on Monday.

Sudanese students enroll for controversial military service 
</HEADLINE>
By MOHAMED OSMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ With their mothers wailing, hundreds of
Sudanese students climbed into trucks in Khartoum's main square
Saturday to start their military service.
	   In the first intake of 1998, about 90,000 high school students
are expected to report for training in the next few days.
	   Their enlistment comes days after President Omar el-Bashir
ordered a general mobilization following a rebel victory in
southeast Sudan.
	   The Sudan Peoples' Liberation Army announced Tuesday that it had
taken the garrison town of Ulu, 455 kilometers (280 miles)
southeast of Khartoum.
	   The SPLA is fighting for more autonomy for the predominantly
Christian and animist southerners from the Islamic north. More than
1.3 million people have died in the war and consequent famines.
	   On Saturday, the head of Sudan's only legal political party,
Mutasim Abdul-Rahim, issued a statement urging ``all those who are
able to carry a gun to join the (military training) camps and move
to the operational zones to defend the gains of the homeland.''
	   ``Jihad (holy war) has now become an obligation that comes
before any other duty,'' Abdul-Rahim said.
	   The training program, which can include sending students into
the war zones of southern and eastern Sudan, is controversial.
	   In April, 52 conscripts drowned in the Blue Nile when their boat
capsized as they fled a camp southeast of Khartoum. Opposition
groups said the death toll was was much higher _ at least 129 _ and
the incident generated widespread criticism of the conscription of
students.
	   But the government has decreed that students have to fulfill
their national service in order to obtain the certificate required
for entrance to university.
	   In April, el-Bashir said his government plans to recruit 655,000
students over three years for the war against the rebels.

Italian president appeals for halt; negotiation offer 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Eritrea-Ethiopia
By FRANCES D'EMILIO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's president on Saturday, appealing for an
immediate halt to what he called the ``absurd'' conflict between
Eritrea and Ethiopia, offered to help mediate the dispute.
	   The African nations, which were one until Eritrea gained
independence in 1993, are at odds over at least six areas along
their border which was traced by Italy after it conquered Eritrea
in 1895.
	   President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro added that Rome had furnished
maps and documents describing the border.
	   In a message to the presidents of both African countries,
Italy's head of state noted that during his visit to the Ethiopian
and Eritrean capitals last fall, both sides seemed to be
cooperating for progress.
	   ``It's thus with surprise and dismay that we are witnessing
today border battles, air strikes that hit innocent civilians
victims, the language of war and retaliation,'' Scalfaro wrote.
	   ``The indications of both sides are that the border is commonly
recognized and that there are no claims to change it,'' Scalfaro
said, adding ``all that is happening is thus absurd under every
aspect.''
	   Saying continued conflict risks ``compromising for decades to
come'' the prospects for development in the countries, among the
world's poorest, Scalfaro called for immediate halt to the
hostilities.
	   An Italian envoy, headed for Monday's meeting of the
Organization of African Unity in Burkina Faso, was willing to help
start talks, Scalfaro added.
	   ``Italy is ready to help you ... so that you can start
negotiations on all aspects upon which you must resume the path of
understanding and collaboration,'' Scalfaro said.
	   Italy has strong ties with its former colony. Many Italians run
businesses there and scores of Italian priests and nuns are
missionaries there.
	   Earlier, the Italian foreign ministry indicated two Italian
military C-130s would start flying out some 150 Italians late
Saturday night from Asmara to Djibouti.
	   The evacuation was arranged after Italian and other Western
diplomats arranged for an 13-hour safety ``window'' for Asmara
airport, with Ethiopian guaranteeing it would not target the
aircraft.

World's largest cruise ship ends maiden voyage

<TEXT>
	   BARCELONA, Spain (AP) _ It might seem like a 12-day
Mediterranean cruise on the inaugural voyage of the world's largest
cruise ship would be pretty relaxing, considering the ship has five
swimming pools, a spa, a miniature nine-hole golf course, tennis
courts, a casino, three grand dining salons, seven less informal
restaurants, a theater and 12 bars.
	   The Grand Princess, 15 floors high (201 feet or 61.26 meters)
and 951 feet (289.86 meters) long, towered over the harbor as it
docked Saturday in this northern Spain port, the last call on its
maiden voyage. It is twice as big as the Titanic.
	   Passenger Steve Epstein of Philadelphia said the voyage wasn't
all lounge chair laziness.
	   ``You start the day at 6 a.m. when you want to tour a city like
we did in Venice,'' he said. ``There's something to keep you busy
from the minute you wake up to a delicious breakfast, right through
the evening with entertainment like Alan King and Red Buttons.
There's not much time for just relaxing.''
	   Not that passengers couldn't relax if they wanted to: after all,
each of the ship's 1,296 cabins has its own little balcony where
passengers can sit and watch the sea. And, with a crew of over a
thousand, the 2,600 passengers on this trip had plenty of people
eager to make their journey a pleasant one.
	   ``I've taken numerous cruises, and this is the best in terms of
service and attention from the crew,'' said Helene Goss, from
Aventura, FL. ``They did a tremendous job.''
	   Helene, and her husband, Morton Goss, each paid about dlrs 3,000
for the cruise, not including air fare. They considered it a fair
price when compared with other cruise lines.
	   The ship, which belongs to Princess Cruises, cost about dlrs 450
million to build. Most passengers seemed satisfied with its maiden
voyage, but there were some dissenters on arrival in Barcelona.
	   One man, who wouldn't give his name, said he paid for a suite,
but had to wait a day and a half for the butler that came with it.
He said he wasn't happy with the food or the service, but expected
other passengers wouldn't complain because they were happy to be
part of a prestigious maiden voyage.
	   And most of the passengers, leaving the ship to board tour buses
that would take them around the city, expressed satisfaction with
the voyage that began on May 26 in Istanbul with stops in Athens
and Venice.
	   ``It has been an excellent voyage,'' said Linda Senado, from
Mexico City. ``My cabin was a little small, but overall I would
give it high ratings. The ship is almost too big, though. It's so
big, I didn't even discover the nine-hole miniature golf course
until yesterday.''

World Cup: Salas and Zamorano ready to face Italy 
</HEADLINE>
By SERGIO CARRASCO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MARIGNAC, France (AP) - The 23 goals that Marcelo Salas and Ivan
Zamorano scored in qualifying games are ancient history. ``What
counts now it the ones we will score in the World Cup,'' beginning
with Italy, Salas declared.
	   Salas, bought recently by Italy's Lazio for dlrs 20 million,
scored 11 goals and Zamorano, from Internazionale of Milan, added
12. Together, they scored as many goals as Argentina, the winner of
the South American qualifying tournament.
	   ``We both have the goal in our blood,'' Zamorano said.
	   Both strikers spoke in the first press conference offered by the
Chilean team since its arrival in Bordeaux.
	   ``It's good for Chile that we can play together,'' Salas said.
	   Chilean coach Nelson Acosta knows those two players are crucial
to his team's success.
	   ``We have a balanced team. If one player gets injured, we have
another. But I would worry a lot if something happened to Zamorano
or Salas,'' Acosta stated.
	   When reminded of the shower of goals scored in the qualifying
round, Salas said that ``they don't count now. What counts is the
goals that we will score against Italy, Austria and Cameroon,''
Chile's opponents in the first round.
	   ``We want to reach the second round, that is our aim. Whatever
comes after that, it will be a windfall,'' Salas said.
	   Teammate Fabian Estay said that Chile ``wants to make history in
this World Cup, after an absence of 16 years.''
	   Estay seems to have assumed the key position of playmaker,
relegating Jose Luis Sierra to the bench.
	   ``Zamorano and I know each other by heart. And with Salas is
very easy to play. To be honest, it's a real luxury to count with
such good strikers. It makes my job as playmaker much easier,''
Estay said.
	   Zamorano, who is 31, said that although he hopes ``to be in
another World Cup, I will play this one as if it were the last
one.''
	   Salas future is more open. He is only 23 and will join Lazio
once the World Cup is over, after becoming an international star
with Argentina's River Plate.

Mexican banker returned from Spain arrested, freed 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A flashy banker recently extradited to Mexico
for allegedly swindling banks out of millions of dollars was
arrested for eight hours, then freed.
	   Angel Rodriguez Saez _ known as ``El Divino,'' or ``The Divine
One'' _ is charged with fiscal fraud and violating banking laws for
allegedly swindling banks out of an amount that reports put
anywhere from dlrs 4 million to dlrs 400 million.
	   He fled to Spain in 1994 after banking scandals rocked Mexico.
Spanish police arrested him in July 1996 after he dove off his
yacht into the Mediterranean trying to elude them. He was
extradited to Mexico on June 1 and was due in court again Monday.
No trial date has been set
	   His lawyers obtained court papers preventing him from being
arrested, but authorities detained him Friday after he appeared at
a hearing.
	   They held him for eight hours, saying he had failed to appear
before a judge on Tuesday, as he is required to do every week,
local news media reported.
	   Finally, a judge ruled that the attorney general's office had
misinterpreted the ruling and Rodriguez Saez had not been required
to check in Tuesday.
	   He was freed later Friday, saying he had been mistreated during
his detention, suffering injuries to his knee and testicles.
	   Rodriguez Saez built a financial empire during Mexico's banking
privatization in the early 1990s. Shortly after he left Mexico,
regulatory authorities seized his bank, Banpais, after discovering
capital shortfalls and bookkeeping irregularities.
	   Spanish authorities agreed to his extradition in February and
Rodriguez Saez dropped his objections two months later.
	   Rodriguez Saez was the first major player in Mexico's 1994
banking and political scandals to be returned home.
	   Mexican officials have failed to win extradition of former
Assistant Attorney General Mario Ruiz Massieu from the United
States, while financier Carlos Cabal Peniche _ the most important
figure in the 1994 banking scandals _ is still at large.

Panama throws out law regulating opinion polls 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) _ Panama's Election Tribunal has thrown
out a new law regulating opinion polls that news media called a
violation of freedom of the press, a newspaper reported Saturday.
	   The law, which took effect May 20, forced news media to register
any opinion polls with the Election Tribunal, and banned them from
publishing them unless the tribunal gave them authorization,
according to El Panama America.
	   El Panama America filed a complaint before the Supreme Court on
May 28 calling the law unconstitutional. The Interamerican Press
Society sent a letter to the tribunal calling the law restrictive.
	   The tribunal said news media still have to file their polls with
the tribunal within three days of their publication.

Monument unveiled for victims of helicopter crash 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PROKOSKO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ International officials
unveiled a monument on Saturday at the site of a helicopter crash
that killed twelve of their colleagues traveling in a peace mission
last September.
	   Senior German diplomat Gerd Wagner, a deputy to top peace
mediator Carlos Westendorp of Spain, was killed in the crash. Also
killed were five Americans, four Germans, a Briton and a Pole.
	   Wagner's successor, Hanns Schumacher, unveiled the stone pyramid
along with the head of the United Nations mission to Bosnia,
Elisabeth Rehn. The ceremony was attended by the victims' families.
	   The names of all twelve victims were carved in the stone of the
monument near this picturesque village in central Bosnia.
	   The Ukrainian four-member crew survived but all passengers were
killed in the accident on Sept. 17, 1997.
	   The delegation led by Wagner was en route to Muslim-controlled
Bugojno, about 90 kilometers (55 miles) northwest of Sarajevo, to
encourage the continued return of ethnic Croat refugees.
	   The helicopter ran into thick fog about 20 minutes after takeoff
and smashed into a mountainside. The crew managed to escape through
the shattered glass nose of the craft but was hindered from helping
passengers because of fire and thick smoke.
	   Westendorp's other deputy, U.S. Ambassador Jacques Klein, said
in a speech on Saturday the death of his colleagues was an
obligation to ``finish the work they began.
	   ``They have given their lives for the noblest of causes _ for
peace,'' he added.

Romario signs to do World Cup commentary for TV Globo 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) - Romario, Brazil's injured all-star
forward, has been signed by the nation's largest television station
to do World Cup commentary.
	   ``We don't have all the details, but he will work out of Rio de
Janeiro,'' Dario Leite, a sports reporter for TV Globo told the
Associated Press.
	   Leite said Romario will not travel to France because he is
undergoing therapy for his injured right calf. The MVP of the 1994
World Cup was dropped from the national team last Tuesday after it
became apparent that his injury would not recover in time for
Brazil's opener against Scotland on June 10.
	   Back in Rio, Romario's calf has improved much faster than

Arantxa's dog is a Roland Garros regular 
</HEADLINE>
By STEPHANIE VAN DEN BERG
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ After her win over Monica Seles in the women's
final Saturday, Sanchez Vicario climbed up to the players' box to
hug her family, her coaches and her Yorkshire terrier.
	   The dog, named Roland, after Roland Garros, has his own stadium
pass and goes to all of his owner's matches, accompanied by
Arantxa's mother.
	   By now, he's a veteran of the French Open. He's been here 10
years. That's 70 in dog years.
	   ``He knows all the spots, he knows all the places. He's friendly
with all the people,'' said Sanchez Vicario. ``I mean, obviously he
enjoys it here a lot too.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   NAMES TO NOTE:
	   Remember these names: Juan Carlos Ferrero and Fernado Gonzalez.
The Spaniard and the Chilean are playing the boy's singles final at
the French Open on Sunday.
	   It's always a good idea to keep track of the junior winners,
because they often come back with a vengeance in the men's
tournament.
	   This year, 1995 junior French Open champion Mariano Zabaleta of
Argentina caused a stir when he beat No. 2 seed Petr Korda in the
first round.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   SOCCER FAN: Brazilian soccer star Ronaldo has turned a few heads
at the French Open. Teen star Anna Kournikova went out to the
stands to meet him at a fourth-round match between Cedric Pioline
and Marat Safin.
	   On Wednesday night, Ronaldo got another visit from a tennis
star. Arantxa Sanchez Vicario went to the Red Star stadium at
Saint-Ouen to see a friendly match between Brazil and Andorra.
Sanchez Vicario lives in the principality of Andorra.
	   Despite the loss of the Andorrans, Arantxa showed her sense of
fair play, and went to the locker rooms to say hello.
	   Ronaldo was so charmed, he gave her his soccer jersey.

Eds: UPDATES with four grafs on team meeting with Edmundo; minor
By PETER MUELLO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   OZOIR LA FERRIERE, France (AP) _ Romario is gone, and the battle
is on for his place in Brazil's starting lineup.
	   For now, Bebeto is the No. 2 striker, alongside Ronaldo. But
Edmundo openly says he deserves the job, and Denilson could upstage
them both once the Cup starts next Wednesday.
	   The rivalry is a problem for coach Mario Zagallo. While he
encourages healthy competition among his players, the dispute has
created rifts that veterans say could weaken the group.
	   The disharmony was Edmundo's doing. In an interview Friday with
a Rio de Janeiro radio station, Edmundo said he deserved to start
because he was ``in better physical and technical shape, and
overall I'm better than Bebeto.''
	   The comment created turmoil at training camp and drew a sharp
reply from the high command. Team coordinator Zico said no one
would be allowed to disrupt the group, and Zagallo added that if
there were disciplinary problems among his 22 players, Brazil could
easily ``finish the Cup with 21.''
	   Defender Roberto Carlos said on Saturday that the players had
rebuked Edmundo for the interview.
	   ``We made it clear to him that nobody has the right to make
trouble for the team,'' Roberto Carlos said. The proper channel for
complaints is to air them personally with Zagallo, he said.
	   Edmundo excused himself before the group. ``He told us he meant
to say he was ready to play,'' Roberto Carlos said.
	   The problem is, Edmundo may be entirely right.

	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ Two men were sentenced to 25 years in
prison each for the 1994 assassination of the president of
Guatemala's highest constitutional court, the judge announced
Saturday.
	   Marlon Oliver Salazar Lopez and Roberto Antonio Trabanino Vargas
were sentenced in 1996 to 12 years each, but an appeals court
overturned the sentence and ordered a new trial.
	   Judge Ruben Anibal Delgado Paz didn't say when he issued the new
sentences.

then-president Jorge Serrano Elias to suspend the constitution.

Once disgraced leader finds opportunity in Kosovo crisis

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ A flurry of arms looting last year began
former Albanian President Sali Berisha's tumble from power. The
weapons _ and the fighting in Kosovo, where many of them are being
used _ could now figure in his strategy for a political comeback.
	   Berisha's power base in northern Albania is the conduit for
automatic rifles, mortars and other guerrilla-type weapons reaching
ethnic Albanian separatists in the neighboring Serbian province of
Kosovo. The arms are lugged across the rugged border by hand and by
mule.
	   Some diplomats are drawing a clearer link between the convoys
and Berisha's own battles against Prime Minister Fatos Nano, though
they have yet to accuse Berisha of orchestrating the illicit arms
trade.
	   The arms traffic puts needed money in the pockets of Berisha's
hard-core political backers while making Nano's government appear
unable to control the northeastern frontier, diplomats said. At the
same time, Berisha can portray himself as a champion of Albanian
nationalism and the outgunned Kosovo Liberation Army, militants
seeking independence for the province.
	   Internal unrest in Albania, touched off by the fighting in
Kosovo, could offer Berisha and his allies an opening to climb back
into power, diplomats speculated. This is an alarming prospect for
many European leaders, who have repeatedly urged Berisha to end
anti-government ``agitation'' since his election defeat in June
1997.
	   At a meeting of opposition parties on Friday, Berisha called
Nano's government an ``enemy of the Albanian nation,'' referring to
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and elsewhere in the Balkans. He called
the Serb forces _ against whom Albanian separatists are waging war
in Kosovo _ ``barbarians'' and the rebels ``blessed.''
	   Such rhetoric further alienates Berisha from the West, where
political and military leaders have expressed resolve not to allow
the Kosovo conflict to escalate. About 10,000 refugees have fled to
Albania to escape the latest Serb offensive, which began last week.
	   Fighting in Kosovo since March has claimed at least 250 lives.
But refugees have given unconfirmed reports of a mass grave with
300 bodies, according to the Belgrade-based Beta news agency.
	   A Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
there are indications the arms trafficking is becoming more
consolidated and is moving away from a ``bazaar of freelancers.''
Also, the amount of weapons crossing the border appears to have
increased significantly as support for the rebels has grown, he
said.
	   Some Kosovo separatist bands are now outfitted with looted
Albanian army uniforms, giving at least the appearance of greater
unity among the ragtag units.
	   Hundreds of thousands of guns and other military equipment were
taken in the anarchy in early 1997 following the collapse of shady
investment schemes that cost many Albanians their entire savings.
Berisha's government was widely blamed for permitting the financial
meltdown.

EDS: UPDATES with prime minister meeting head of Air France, train

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said Saturday
the government was prepared to intervene in the Air France strike,
which is now in its sixth day and could tarnish the World Cup.
	   Air France President Jean-Cyril Spinetta said talks that lasted
all night without reaching agreement had been ``suspended.''
	   The pilots appeared divided, with the head of the main pilots'
union indicating new talks could take place Monday and a spokesman
saying they could go back to the table over the weekend.
	   The strike has embarrassed France ahead of the World Cup, which
opens Wednesday.
	   ``It's not the World Cup that concerns me, it's the recovery
underway of the company and its future,'' Jospin told reporters
before a meeting of the national council of the Socialist Party.
	   Air France is currently restructuring and needs to make pay cuts
to free up capital to modernize the company and its fleet of
planes.
	   The World Cup will take place ``normally,'' Jospin said.
``French people don't need to take a plane to attend the World Cup.
Nor do Europeans, and we are going to find a lot of airline
companies to transport the rest at the expense of Air France.''
	   Air France is the official World Cup carrier and is committed to
transporting the teams from one venue to another.
	   Jospin said the French government was ready to intervene to help
end the the strike and would play a role ``in the hours to come.''
	   There have been suggestions the government may name a mediator,
but by early evening no proposals were forthcoming.
	   During the day, Jospin met with the head of Air France, as well
as his finance and transport ministers.
	   Talks between Air France management and the the striking pilots
broke off Saturday about 8 a.m. (0600 GMT) after all night
negotiations.
	   The stumbling blocks remained planned salary cuts and an Air
France proposal to give pilots stock in exchange for the pay
reductions, as well as a two-tier pay scale in which younger pilots
earn less.
	   Spinetta, the Air France president, said there had been ``very
positive advances'' in the talks.
	   The pilots appeared more pessimistic.
	   ``It's so serious I prefer not to talk to you about it,'' said
Christian Paris, the spokesman for the SNPL, the main pilots'
union.
	   However, SNPL President Jean-Charles Corbet indicated new talks
could eventually take place Monday. However, another SNPL official,
Christian Roger, said talks could be resumed over the weekend.
	   Etienne Lichtenberger, president of the SPAC, one of the smaller
unions, said Air France's proposals were ``insufficient'' and that
it was ``out of the question'' to sign an agreement this weekend.
	   Only about 25 percent of Air France's flights were expected to
take off Saturday. Meanwhile, a train strike disrupted provincial
service. Reduced service was expected Sunday in some areas.
	   Once the air strike ends, Air France says it will take three
days for service to be retored fully to normal.

BMW and Mercedes out of Le Mans race within five hours 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LE MANS, France (AP) - BMW and Mercedes, two of the top
challengers at the Le Mans 24 Hours race, each lost both of their
cars early in the endurance race Saturday afternoon.
	   After five hours, the Toyota GT One driven by Belgian Thierry
Boutsen, German Ralf Kelleners and Geoff Lees of Britain was in the
lead with 76 laps of the 13.6-kilometer (8.5-mile) circuit.
	   The Mercedes of German Bernd Schneider, which was fastest in
practice, fell out of the race with motor failure after just 90
minutes.
	   Though it started in pole position, Mercedes had cautioned
against over optimism before the race because the CLK-LM, related
to the successful CLK-GTR, is making it Le Mans debut.
	   Mercedes only began 24-hour tests of the car at a track in
Homestead, Florida three weeks ago.
	   In sweltering conditions, two Porsche GT1s were in second and
third close behind the leading Toyota.
	   In second place was the car driven by Jorg Muller and in third
the vehicle driven by Alan McNish of Britain.
	   Nissan R390 GT1s were in fourth and fifth.
	   But the early hours of the race were dominated by problems at
Mercedes and BMW.
	   After four hours, the other Mercedes, driven by Jean Marc
Gounon, suffered another engine failure.
	   Both BMW V12s were put out of the race in the fourth hour
because of vibrations to the front and back of the car.
	   The cars' lead drivers were Tom Kristensen and Pierluigi
Martini.
	   The early leader, the Toyota GT One headed by Martin Brundle,
lost 15 minutes in the fourth hour after it span out of control
with brake problems when driven by Eric Helary.
	   ''Eric had a spin that was brake-problem enduced. The car was
running easily so it was a surprise, but it is always a suprise
when a car brakes down,'' said a disappointed Brundle.
	   After five hours the car was back in 24th place, eight laps
behind the leader.
	   ``It doesn't look like we can win it now as we are so many laps
behind. It's out of our hands. But we can learn for next year.''
	   The leading prototype was the Porsche LMP198 in sixth place.

Princess' mother vows to carry out Diana's wishes in will 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Princess Diana's mother, responding obliquely to
Mohamed Al Fayed's criticism of her relationship with her daughter,
vowed Saturday to carry out Diana's wish that she help with the
uprbringing of Prince William and Prince Harry.
	   Al Fayed, whose son Dodi died in the car crash that killed Diana
nine months ago, said Friday that Frances Shand Kydd was a bad
mother, accused her of snobbery and said Diana ``did not give a
damn about her.''
	   Most of Saturday's newspapers attacked Al Fayed for the remarks
he made after a Paris meeting of witnesses and the judge handling
the French investigation of the Aug. 31 crash.
	   Al Fayed has angered Diana's family with his allegations that
she intended to marry his son and that the two were victims of a
murder plot. He made clear Friday that Mrs. Shand Kydd had not
spoken to him at all during the day-long meeting.
	   In a statement issued to the national news agency Press
Association on Saturday, Mrs. Shand Kydd said, ``I have nothing to
say about yesterday in Paris, except many thanks to many people who
were kind and helpful to me.
	   ``Diana's will, which has been made public, stated her wishes to
me.
	   ``I shall try my utmost, all my days, to carry out her wishes
and what she asked of me.''
	   Diana's will, which was made public in March, requested that her
mother be consulted over the ``upbringing, education and welfare''
of Princes William and Harry.

Referees hope they won't be the stars of the World Cup AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By ROBERT MILLWARD
<TEXT>
	   GRESSY, France (AP) _ Now they know the first round games they
are handling, the 34 World Cup referees fear they may become the
biggest stars.
	   ``I hope not. I hope that the World Cup will be remembered for
the football and the goals scored, rather than for the red cards
and for the actions of referees against the players,'' said
England's Paul Durkin.
	   ``The World Cup should be remembered for the skill factor not
the ill-discipline of players.''
	   FIFA's decision to punish foul tackles from behind with a red
card has put the officials in the spotlight because this is the
first competition the mandate applies to.
	   Referees have always had the power to expel a player for a
tackle from behind if they believe it could have led to serious
injury. For the sake of consistency and to protect the most
skillful players from dangerous tackling, soccer's International
Board, meeting three months ago, made it mandatory.
	   ``The new decision that referees have been given is to stop
forwards and particularly skillful players getting seriously
hurt,'' said Durkin, who takes charge of Italy vs. Austria at
Saint-Denis June 23.
	   ``If referees are consistent in their approach and support the
law then the standard of the game will be better.''
	   Durkin and the other 33 referees have been housed at a plush
hotel secluded in a small town 30 kilometers (20 miles) outside of
Paris. The media news were allowed their only access to the
officials on Saturday and most of the questions were about the
tackle from behind mandate.
	   ``Since the International Board announced it was demanding red
cards for such tackles, I have noted several which would apply,''
Durkin said. ``Watching the Premier League games I have often
thought `that's a red card in the World Cup.'
	   ``People have got to realize it's not just for the World Cup,''
the English official said. ``The ruling also applies in leagues
across the world from next season so that a lot of players, coaches
will be watching what happens here.''

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italians and tourists sought cool relief splashing
in the sea and in city fountains Saturday as the country sizzled
through a late-spring heat wave with temperatures as high as 37
degrees (99 F).
	   Among those suffering from the heat was anti-corruption hero
Antonio Di Pietro. The former Milan prosecutor-turned-politician
was recovering in a hospital in the southern city of Matera after
fainting during a rally a day earlier for political reform.
	   Other Italians suffering from the heat included some of the
hundreds left homeless by earthquakes last fall in central,
Apennine hilltowns. Many of the homeless are living in cramped,
flat-roofed trailers provided by the government.
	   The highest temperatures were recorded near Foggia, a city in
Puglia, the region on the Adriatic forming the ``heel'' of the
Italian peninsula.
	   Hot blasts of air, known as the scirocco wind, from northern
Africa, added to the misery.
	   Weather forecasters said the heat wave, which built up over
several days, would start fading Sunday. But while temperatures
were predicted to fall, stifling humidity was expected to increase.

At least 88 dead in week-long fighting over Baidoa 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ At least 25 people were killed
Saturday in factional fighting for control of the strategic
northwestern town of Baidoa, residents and faction spokesmen said
Saturday.
	   Control of the town 150 kilometers (93 miles) northwest of
Mogadishu changed hands several times during the day, residents
contacted by high frequency radio said.
	   At least 88 people have been killed since fighting between
forces loyal to faction leader Hussein Mohamed Aidid, who retained
control of Baidoa, and the Rahanwein Resistance Army broke out at
the beginning of the week.
	   Residents said fighting raged for several hours in Baidoa, and
bodies of the dead lay in the streets.
	   Baidoa is one of a few Somali towns with a functioning airport
and economy.
	   Earlier Saturday, Baidoa residents and a spokesman for the
Rahanwein Resistance Army in Mogadishu said the RRA had captured
control of the town from Aidid's forces, who were then trapped at
the airport.
	   Following the report, Aidid travelled from Mogadishu to Baidoa
in a convoy of 200 heavily armed men and 15 trucks armed with heavy
machine guns.
	   Sources close to Aidid, who controls southern Mogadishu, said
his forces overwhelmed the RRA forces south of the town and later
took back control.
	   Last December, Aidid and 23 faction leaders agreed to hold a
national reconciliation conference in Baidoa. The RRA and others
said they would not attend unless Aidid withdrew his militia, which
he has not done.
	   The conference, first scheduled for Feb. 15, has been postponed
three times, the last time indefinitely.
	   Somalia has had no central government since clan-based faction
leaders combined to oust dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in January
1991, then turned on each other as the country disintegrated into
fiefdoms protected by private militias.

Security Council urges India, Pakistan to halt nuclear tests 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with India comment
By ROBERT H. REID
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ By a unanimous vote, the Security Council
demanded Saturday that India and Pakistan refrain from further
nuclear tests, halt weapons programs and sign nuclear arms control
agreements unconditionally.
	   The Indian foreign ministry denounced the resolution as
``coercive and unhelpful'' and said ``we find it grotesque that an
organ of the United Nations should seek to address India in this
manner.''
	   The resolution, co-sponored by Japan, Slovenia, Sweden and Costa
Rica, denied India and Pakistan legal status as ``nuclear powers.''
Formal status would enable them to keep their nuclear arms under
the 1970 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
	   Japanese Ambassador Hishashi Owada said the Indian and Pakistani
tests last month threaten the entire global system of nuclear
controls and could plunge the international community ``into an
uncontrollable world of nuclear proliferation.''
	   U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson said the tests ``represent a
profound blow'' to efforts to control nuclear weapons and called on
the two countries to heed the council's call ``because it is in
their own best interest.''
	   But non-nuclear states also sent a strong message to the United
States and the four other nuclear powers to fulfill commitments to
reduce their own nuclear arsenals.
	   ``India and Pakistan have returned the world to the dark years
of the nuclear terror,'' Canadian Ambassador Robert Fowler said
after the vote. But Fowler called on the nuclear states to
``fulfill your commitments to reduce your nuclear weapons stocks.''
	   That indicates the challenge facing the United States and the
other self-declared nuclear powers _ Russia, China, France and
Britain _ in marshaling international pressure to curb the nuclear
arms race in South Asia.
	   Iran, Egypt and Bahrain also accused the Security Council of a
double-standard by ignoring Israel's suspected nuclear weapons
program.
	   Israel, which has never confirmed holding nuclear weapons, has
refused to sign the non-proliferation treaty and accept
international safeguards on its nuclear program.
	   Iran's foreign minister, Kamal Kharrazi, said ``Israeli
intransigence'' on accepting nuclear controls ``has endangered the
entire'' Middle East.
	   Israel has never admitted having nuclear weapons but is widely
assumed to have the necessary technology to build a bomb quickly.
	   Nuclear states agreed to take steps to reduce their arsenals as
part of a compromise agreement to convince other nations to accept
an indefinite extension of the non-proliferation treaty three years
ago.
	   Addressing the nuclear powers, Kenyan Ambassador Njunguna Mahugu
said ``the rest of us expect you to seriously take your
responsibility of finally removing the threat of nuclear weapons.''
	   The resolution condemned the South Asian tests and urged India
and Pakistan to halt deployment of missiles capable of carrying
nuclear warheads and to sign nuclear arms control treaties.
	   It also called on India and Pakistan to exercise restraint and
to find ``mutually acceptable solutions'' to the ``root causes of
those tensions, including Kashmir,'' the Himalayan territory
divided between the two.
	   The resolution welcomed an offer by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan to encourage India and Pakistan to resume a high-level
dialogue that broke down last year because of differences over
Kashmir.

By ISMET HAJDARI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Dozens of houses were aflame and
Serb gunners kept shelling villages in Kosovo, where another four
people were killed in fighting, ethnic Albanian and Serb sources
said Saturday.
	   The Kosovo Information Center close to the Albanian leadership
said fighting continued Saturday in the Decani area, some 70
kilometers (45 miles) west of provincial capital Pristina. The
villages of Shaptej, Gramocel and Babaloc were targeted by the
Serbs' heavy artillery.
	   One three-year old child, identified as Leutrim Aga, was killed
sleeping in his bed in Gramocel and three more ethnic Albanians
were wounded in that village. Another ethnic Albanian was found
dead in nearby Babaloc.
	   The Center later claimed three more were wounded in another
Decani village, Prilep, in a Serb attack involving military planes.
None of the reports could be independently confirmed.
	   The Center also issued a list of 202 names of people missing
after the latest clashes in the Decani region.
	   It said Serbian forces were shelling a border strip west of
Djakovica, 75 kilometers (47 miles) southwest of Pristina.
	   Serbian sources said two men were killed in a border clash
between Serb-led Yugoslav army troops and an armed group attempting
to illegally enter the province from Macedonia Saturday. They were
the first dead at the Macedonian border.
	   A Serb policemen was also reported to have died in the Belgrade
military hospital of injuries sustained in previous fighting in
Kosovo.
	   The Serbian Media Center in Pristina later quoted the Yugoslav
army chief-off-staff as saying Saturday in a statement that illegal
channels for smuggling arms and militants from Albania into the
troubled province had been severed.
	   The announcement stressed the army would continue ``energetic
prevention of all terrorist attempts at illegal entry.''
	   Despite more than 10,000 refugees fleeing into neighboring
Albania and thousands of others seeking refuge elsewhere, the
chief-of-staff claimed that ``reports of a high number of refugees
are groundless ... speculations ... aimed at attracting the
international community's attention.''

Pope assails efforts to regularize new forms of couples 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul II on Saturday assailed
lawmakers attempts in some countries to legalize forms of families
outside traditional husband-wife marriages.
	   John Paul did not single out any countries while talking about
the value of family life to a group of U.S. bishops who were
meeting with the pontiff as part of periodic visits to the Vatican.
	   The Vatican opposes moves in some societies to give non-married
couples the same legal rights as married couples, such as housing
benefits, and also disapproves of legalization of unions between
homosexualss.
	   John Paul praised family life, when it is ``strong and
healthy,'' as he put it, as the bedrock of community life.
	   ``But where the family is weak, all human relationships are
exposed to instability and fragmentation,'' the pope told the
bishops.
	   ``At a time when the very definitions of marriage and family
life are endangered by attempts to enshrine in legislation
alternative and distorted notions of these basic human communities,
your ministry must include the clear proclamation of the truth of
God's original design,'' John Paul said.

American student cope with trauma of survival 
</HEADLINE>
By TONY CZUCZKA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   CELLE, Germany (AP) _ After nearly two months of riding the
rails through Africa, Greece and Switzerland, Jaime Hawk had one
more stop: She wanted to see Hamburg, Germany before she headed
home to find a summer job.
	   What started out as the last hurrah of her junior-year abroad
ended in tragedy.
	   ``It was supposed to be the last punch on her Eurail pass,''
Hawk's cousin, U.S. Army Maj. Rob Strope, 38, said Saturday.
	   The high-speed train she boarded early Wednesday derailed and
smashed into the side of a bridge near the town of Celle, 140
kilometers (85 miles) south of Hamburg. The impact hurled Hawk
through a window.
	   By Saturday, the crash's death toll had reached 102. Rescuers
continued the search for bodies by hand, while a team of experts
investigated what might have caused a broken wheel on the first
passenger car to break, causing the train to derail.
	   Hawk, a 20-year-old native of Boise, Idaho, suffered injuries to
her neck, but doctors at Celle General Hospital expected her to
fully recover.
	   She had been staying with her cousins in Wurzburg since mid-May,
after finishing her studies in Florence, Italy. On Wednesday
morning, Strope dropped her off at the station to catch the 8:30
a.m. train.
	   On the way home that afternoon, the major heard a radio report
of a high-speed train crash but didn't say which train. He drove
straight to the radio station where his fears were confirmed.
Jaime's train had crashed.
	   Strope said Hawk remembers little of the accident. Just reading
a book when the accident happened, and then flying out of her seat.
``Then she remembers being in the hospital,'' he said.
	   When they arrived _ first, before her mother could make it from
Idaho _ Hawk was disoriented. She asked them if they were OK. And
she didn't seem to grasp how badly she was hurt.
	   ``One of the things she said is that she was going to miss her
flight, and by the time she got home all the good summer jobs would
be gone,'' Strope said.
	   Doctors said it would be several weeks before she can leave the
hospital. And it's not clear when she'll be able to resume her
studies at Gonzaga University in Spokane, Washington.
	   ``She's doing super. But she's a little frustrated she can't
move,'' said Strope. ``She fells very lucky. We're trying to keep
her mind off the crash.''

World Cup: Passarella angrily denies doping rumors 
</HEADLINE>
By VICENTE LEONARDO PANETTA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   L'ETRAT, France (AP) _ The Argentinian World Cup delegation
Saturday angrily denied rumors that internal doping tests had
proved positive for one of its players.
	   ``I'm tired of denying rumors. Lets talk about soccer, please. I
don't know where this silly story comes from,'' the team's coach,
Daniel Passarella, said at a news conference.
	   The rumor was spread by a radio station in Argentina. It
suggested that the player involved was Juan Veron, from Italy's
Sampdoria.
	   Veron said he felt ``mad and sad, as I have a family behind me.
They (the radio station reporters) even made up comments attributed
to me. I never said anything. This is the first time I speak'' on
this issue,'' he told reporters.
	   In spite of the denials, rumors persisted that the controls
showed the presence of some kind of dubious substance.
	   ``It's possible that some substance might have showed up, but it
is well known that most players had the flu,'' the team's
physician, Luis Seveso, said at the same news conference.
	   ``People are talking a lot of nonsense,'' Seveso said, though he
added fuel to the controveray by saying he would make some
inquiries. ``Tonight I will visit each room and tell the players
not to take any medicine without my consent,'' he said.
	   Argentina's Soccer Association president Julio Grondona had said
early today that he knew nothing about the alleged doping. ``In any
case, that's what the controls are for. We don't want a repeat of
what happened in 1994.''
	   He referred to a positive test by Diego Maradona after the
second game of the 1994 World Cup in the United States. Argentina
dropped Maradona from the rest of the tournament and he was latter
banned by FIFA for 15 months for his second positive test.
	   After that World Cup, in which Argentina was eliminated in the
second round, coach Alfio Basile was replaced by Passarella, who
took over with the mission of imposing a strict discipline in the
team and preventing new episodes of this kind.
	   One of the first measures he took was ordering regular doping
tests.

U.S. senator suspects quid pro quo in Clinton-China technology dealings 
</HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign
Relations Committee said Saturday he suspects a link between
political contributions to Democrats and decisions by President
Bill Clinton's administration on missile technology exports to
China.
	   ``Don't know whether it's my head or my heart talking, but I
think we're going to find something,'' Republican Sen. Jesse Helms
said on CNN's ``Evans and Novak.''
	   Helms' committee is among several in the Senate looking into
allegations of favor-trading in the administration's treatment of a
major Democratic Party donor with satellite dealings in China. A
frequent Clinton critic, Helms said his committee will hold five or
six hearings on the matter.
	   Congress and the Justice Department are asking whether Clinton
waived restrictions on a satellite export to China in February as a
favor to major Democratic donor Bernard L. Schwartz, chief
executive officer of Loral Space and Communications Co. The White
House and Schwartz deny any such motivation.
	   As part of the investigation, the senators have asked for
documents relating to the president's decision to let Loral launch
a satellite atop a Chinese missile after an earlier one exploded.
	   The dispute centers on what happened after the explosion two
years earlier, in February 1996. Loral headed a defense industry
team that examined what went wrong and shared the information with
the Chinese.
	   Critics contend the report may have helped China improve its
long-range ballistic missiles, but Loral executives say they turned
over no sensitive material.
	   Top intelligence and security officials are divided over whether
Loral and another firm, Hughes Electronics, illegally gave
technology to China, The New York Times reported Saturday.
	   A classified CIA report concluded the companies revealed no
sensitive information, the newspaper reported. But, citing
government and congressional sources it did not identify, the Times
said the intelligence arm of the State Department found just the
opposite.
	   Republican Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott met with Helms and
other committee chairmen this week in what he said was the first of
weekly sessions on the China matter.
	   Afterward, Lott said the controversy could make it harder for
the administration to win most-favored-nation trading status for
China this year.
	   But in the CNN interview, Helms expressed resignation that
Clinton will win the trade designation despite the satellite debate
and criticism of the president's visit this month to Beijing.
Tiananmen Square in Beijing was the center of student protests nine
years ago in which scores were killed in an Army crackdown.
	   The designation merely confers normal trade status on China.
Clinton announced his decision to grant MFN to China on Wednesday,
30 days before last year's designation expires, and Congress has 60
days after the expiration to vote it down.
	   Helms has long opposed MFN for China. He calls the trade status
a sellout of human rights.
	   ``I hope it won't (go through), but I suspect it will,'' Helms
said. ``They've got the votes for it in the Senate, I think, the
way I count.''

	   PARIS (AP) _ As Arantxa Sanchez Vicario climbed into the stands
to get kisses from her family and a congratulatory nuzzle from her
Yorkshire terrier, the crowd began chanting.
	   ``Mon-ee-ka. MON-ee-ka. MON-EE-KA!''
	   Then the fans began clapping for Monica Seles, who sat solemnly
on center court, her inspiring run through the French Open having
ended in defeat.
	   Sanchez Vicario won her third French Open title Saturday,
defeating Seles 7-6 (7-5), 0-6, 6-2 in a soggy final that was
delayed 31 minutes at the start by rain.
	   Seles, playing three weeks after the death of her father, wore
his ring on a necklace.
	   ``I'm so sorry that I beat you. I don't think you are the one
who deserved to lose,'' Sanchez Vicario told Seles while accepting
the silver championship trophy. ``I have a lot of respect for you,
especially with all that happened, and all the players feel sorry
because your father passed away.''
	   Seles stared ahead as drops of rain began falling again. Then
she gathered herself and thanked the fans.
	   ``It's been so special coming back this year,'' she said.
	   Sanchez Vicario's victory assured a Spanish sweep of the singles
titles. Spanish compatriots and close friends Carlos Moya and Alex
Corretja play in the men's final Sunday.
	   It will be the second all-Spanish men's final in five years at
the French Open. Sergi Bruguera defeated Alberto Berasategui for
the 1994 title.
	   Seles has played in only five tournaments this year while
shuttling between the tennis circuit and her family's home in
Florida. She was at her dad's side when he died May 14 after a
five-year battle with cancer.
	   Seles, who won the French Open three straight times in 1990-92,
came to Roland Garros this year having not played in 10 days. But
she twice rallied from a set down to advance to the semifinals,
where she beat top-seeded Martina Hingis in straight sets.
	   ``It's been really surprising where I've gotten these past two
weeks,'' she said. ``It's been obviously a very different two
weeks, just because I was able to concentrate on tennis, which was
a very nice feeling. I haven't had it for a long time.''
	   Sanchez Vicario, who earned 3.6 million French francs (about
dlrs 608,000) for the victory, was playing in her sixth French Open
final in 10 years.
	   Seles had a pair of service breaks in the first set, which
included dramatic rallies that featured acrobatic saves by both
players, but each time Sanchez Vicario immediately answered with a
break of her own.
	   In the tiebreaker, Sanchez Vicario took a 5-1 lead as Seles
seemed to be distracted by sounds off the court. She netted a
service return when a rustling sound went through the stands, then
hit a forehand wide as an ambulance's siren blared nearby.
	   Seles rallied to even the tiebreaker at 5-5, but then hit two
forehands into the net _ giving Spanish fans a chance to wave their
huge flags and break into soccer songs.
	   But Sanchez Vicario won only six points in the second set, which
Seles closed out with the only ace of the match.
	   In the third set, a tiring Seles began making more unforced
errors. She let Sanchez Vicario rally from 15-40 on her serve to
win the first game and stop Seles' streak, then lost her own serve.
	   Seles whiffed on a drop shot in the second game, hitting the
ball halfway to the net. It was one of several unsuccessful drop
shots by Seles in the match.
	   Sanchez Vicario got to match point by making another of her
remarkable running saves, lofting a sky-high lob that landed softly
a foot (0.3 meters) inside the baseline. Seles hit it into the net.
	   ``She's the best at that. That's always been the strength of
Arantxa,'' Seles said of her opponent's ability to return balls
others cannot reach. ``It puts a lot of pressure against a person
who is a hitter, like myself, to sometimes go for too much.''
	   Seles then hit a backhand long, her 48th unforced error, to send
Sanchez Vicario on her climb into the players' box. She kissed her
father, coach, mother, sister and boyfriend before getting nuzzled
by her dog, Roland, who has watched all three of her championships
here.
	   Sanchez Vicario, who had won only one title in the past two
years and was bothered by leg and wrist injuries this winter, was
given her trophy by former men's player Ilie Nastase _ who jokingly
called her ``vieja'' (old lady).
	   Though most of the attention in women's tennis has focused on
teenagers such as Hingis, Venus and Serena Williams and Anna
Kournikova, the final featured 26-year-old Sanchez Vicario and
24-year-old Seles.
	   ``As the veterans, as everyone is calling us at the moment, we
still have a long ways to go,'' Sanchez Vicario said.
	   Added Seles: ``At any age we're still very young.''

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb gunners shelled villages in
Kosovo with heavy artillery on Saturday and fighting flared along
the province's southern border with Macedonia. Four people were
killed in the clashes, ethnic Albanian and Serb sources said.
	   The artillery attack targeted three villages in the Decani area,
45 miles (70 kilometers) west of Pristina, said the Kosovo
Information Center, which is close to Albanian leaders in the
province.
	   Three-year-old Leutrim Aga was killed while sleeping in his bed
in Gramocel, the center said. Another ethnic Albanian was found
dead in nearby Babaloc.
	   Serb attacks also injured three people in Gramocel and three
others in Prilip, the center said. None of the reports could be
independently confirmed.
	   Serb police and army forces have recently stepped up their
campaign to crush the Kosovo Liberation Army, the armed wing of the
Albanian independence movement.
	   The militants have been gaining in popularity and numbers after
years of heavy-handed rule by Serbian authorities in Kosovo, the
secessionist southern province where ethnic Albanians represent 90
percent of the population of 2.2 million.
	   In fighting elsewhere, Serbian sources said two men were killed
in a border clash Saturday between Serb-led Yugoslav army troops
and an armed group attempting to illegally enter the province from
Macedonia. They were the first reported dead along the
Yugoslav-Macedonia frontier.
	   The Serbian Media Center in Pristina later quoted the Yugoslav
army chief-of-staff as saying that routes for smuggling arms and
militants into Kosovo from Albania had been severed.
	   A Serb policemen also was reported to have died in the Belgrade
military hospital of injuries sustained in previous fighting in
Kosovo.
	   A group of 16 central European and Balkan countries meeting
Saturday on Brioni island, Croatia, condemned violence and all
forms of terrorism in embattled Kosovo.
	   Speaking to reporters on Brioni, Ilir Meta, Albania's state
secretary for European integration, repeated his government's calls
for outside assistance to cope with the continuing influx of Kosovo
refugees.
	   More than 10,000 Kosovo Albanian refugees fled to northern
Albania this week.
	   On Friday, the United Nations, in an unusually strong statement,
accused Serbian forces of atrocities in Kosovo, where more than 250
people have died since March 1.

Belgium defeats Paraguay in World Cup warmup 1-0 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Belgium handed Paraguay its fourth
World Cup warmup defeat in a row Saturday, beating the South
Americans 1-0 on a humid night punctuated by a fierce thunderstorm.
	   Veteran Enzo Scifo got Belgium ahead in the 56th minute with a
lucky goal: his high pass into the penalty area was deflected by a
defender and sailed past goalie Ruben Ruiz Diaz.
	   The loss was Paraguay's fourth World Cup warmup loss. Since May
21, it has lost also to the Czech Republic, the Netherlands and
Romania and drew against Japan.
	   The Belgians have won seven World Cup warmups. They lost one: a
0-2 defeat at the hands of France.
	   Paraguay began cautiously, closing ranks in the back, ceding the
midfield and mounting no serious offense.
	   One notable exception: a hard and low free kick in the 19th
minute by Francisco Arce that flew just past the Belgian goal post.
	   The Belgians created scoring chances but finished off none.
	   The best came in the 40th minute when Luis Oliveira drove the
ball into the goal mouth, faked a movement to the right but passed
to the left to Luc Nilis whose low shot was brilliantly reflected
by Paraguay goal Ruben Ruiz Diaz for a corner shot.
	   Belgium began without play maker Scifo.
	   Coach Georges Leekens put him into the team in the second half.
That was what the Belgians needed. They _ and the match _ came
alive.
	   In the 54th minute a razor-sharp pass by Vital Borkelmans found
Emile Mpenza who outran Catalino Rivarola but his shot went high.
	   In the 55th minute, Scifo made it 1-0 and Belgium came close 2-0
in the 56th. A high pass by Borkelmans sent Mpenza into the air,
but his header bounced hard and high, missing the cross bar by an
inch.
	   Late in the second half, a fierce thunderstorm made for a
slippery and dangerous field in the King Baudouin Stadium where
22,000 people watched the match.
	   In the 85th minute, after some messy soccer in front of the
Belgian goal the ball popped in front of Arce who tried a hard
shot, but missed a viurtually open goal.

Plane to pick up Britons in Eritrea Tightens With Eritrea-Ethiopia 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Updates with British plane to pick up Britons from Eritrea.
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A British air force plane flew to Eritrea on
Saturday to pick up the estimated 60 Britons still in the East
African nation where fighting with Ethiopia has escalated over
their disputed border.
	   Both sides in the conflict arranged safe passage for the plane,
which set from Britain in the morning and landed in Crete en route
to the Horn of Africa.
	   The Foreign Office said the Royal Air Force plane could
accommodate all the British people who wish to leave. The flight is
expected to take them to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, where the British
consul was arranging accommodation.
	   The Foreign Office on Friday advised about 120 British citizens
in Eritrea to leave as soon as possible because of the worsening
conflict.
	   Forty-eight Britons left Eritrea that night on a U.S. aircraft
which landed in Frankfurt early Saturday. The Foreign Office said
the Britons, mainly working for the non-governmental organization
Voluntary Service Overseas, then flew to London.
	   Ethiopian warplanes bombed airports outside the Eritrean capital
on Saturday . The civilian airport was struck by several bombs,
setting off bursts of fire as foreigners were trying to leave the
country. The military airport was also bombed.
	   ``We had seen tanks driving through the streets and we saw the
MiGs bombing the airport which was frightening,'' said Jenny
Tinker, 26, from Reading, England, who has been teaching in Eritrea
for two years and was among the 48 Britons who returned to London
on Saturday.
	   ``The Eritreans are used to it,'' said Debbie McGrath, who also
worked in the education field in Eritrea. ``They have had 30 years
of fighting. People stood out and watched for the MiGs as they went
over and clapped when one was shot down.''
	   Britain is supporting U.S. and Rwandan efforts to broker a peace
deal between the warring countries, Foreign Office minister Tony
Lloyd told BBC radio on Saturday.
	   ``If we can get a cease-fire, then of course it is possible to
begin the process of negotiation and arbitration to resolve the
issue. We have pushed for both sides to recognize there cannot be a
military solution to this problem. We will support the Americans
and Rwanda to broker a regional solution to this problem,'' he
said.
	   Eritrea, which gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993, has
always claimed it remains inside its own territory as determined by
Italian colonial boundaries.

Security Council urges India, Pakistan to halt nuclear tests Pakistan's U.N. ambassador.

Eds: LEADS with four grafs to UPDATE with another quote from
By ROBERT H. REID
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ By a unanimous vote, the Security Council
demanded Saturday that India and Pakistan refrain from further
nuclear tests, halt weapons programs and sign nuclear arms control
agreements unconditionally.
	   The Indian foreign ministry denounced the resolution as
``coercive and unhelpful'' and said ``we find it grotesque that an
organ of the United Nations should seek to address India in this
manner.''
	   Pakistan's U.N. ambassador, Ahmad Kamal, accused the major
powers of using nuclear treaties ``to legitimize their own
possession of huge nuclear arsenals ... in perpetuity and as a
blunt instrument'' to deny them to others.
	   ``Non-proliferation is no longer an issue in South Asia,'' Kamal
told the council after the vote. ``There is a real danger of
nuclear conflict'' and ``no amount of sermonizing and lamentations
can rectify or reverse this unfortunate development.''

Further clashes in south Yemen: four more killed, 14 wounded 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Four people were killed and 14 wounded as
riots continued in southern Yemen for a second day Saturday, a
security official said.
	   The casualties brought the toll for the two days to eight dead
and 18 wounded in the villages around Ad-Dali, a town 250
kilometers (156 miles) southeast of the capital, San`a, the
official added.
	   The clashes began Friday after soldiers at a checkpoint near
Ad-Dali opened fire on a car, killing one person and wounding
another. In a statement Saturday, Yemeni security officials said
the car's driver refused to stop at the checkpoint.
	   Armed civilians opened fire on the checkpoint later Friday, the
officials said. Weapons are not difficult to buy in Yemen, owing to
the recent war and the government's weak authority.
	   For a second day Saturday, the government deployed tanks and
armored personnel carriers to try to restore order in the villages.
	   Civilians were leaving the area, officials said.
	   The political bureau of the Socialist Party, which ruled south
Yemen when it was an independent state, called Saturday for an end
to the military presence in the area, compensation for the families
of the victims and the release of all detainees.
	   The party said the clashes were caused by popular indignation
against widespread corruption and ``arbitrary practices'' against
civilians.
	   Ad-Dali lies in Lahij province, south Yemen, which was a
separate country until it united with north Yemen in 1990. The
south tried to secede in 1994, provoking a brief civil war. The
northern-based armed forces then took control of the south, but
continue to be widely resented.

Guyana president asks for direct talks with rival 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ With an election recount completed,
Guyana President Janet Jagan has called on her chief rival to sit
down for one-on-one talks.
	   Jagan and the president of the opposition People's National
Congress, Desmond Hoyte, have not met in person since the December
election in which Jagan defeated Hoyte.
	   In the aftermath of the vote, Hoyte's party claimed fraud and
demonstrations turned violent. On Tuesday, an international panel
announced that its recount of the votes found no serious
irregularities.
	   ``I think it would be very good if the leaders of the two major
parties of Guyana have a frank and honest discussion,'' Jagan said
Saturday in her regular television and radio program, ``This Week
with the President.''
	   Hoyte has not said if he will meet with Jagan, but has indicated
that he would agree only if a specific agenda is set. Jagan, the
U.S.-born widow of popular former president Cheddi Jagan, said she
would agree to Hoyte's request.
	   Race is at the root of most conflicts in Guyana, a former
British colony. Jagan's party is backed by the majority population
of East Indian descent, while Hoyte's draws support from the 40
percent of people of African descent.
	   In her address, Jagan indirectly criticized those in Hoyte's
party who want to boycott the sessions of Parliament. Jagan said
the minority politicians have an obligation to take their seats in
Parliament and represent their constituents.
	   ``Otherwise, what was the point of the people voting for them?''
she asked.

Yugoslavia held to 1-1 draw by Swiss substitute's first goal 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Substitute Patrick Mueller's first
goal for Switzerland earned his side a 1-1 draw Saturday against a
Yugoslavia team playing its last warm-up match before the World Cup
finals.
	   Mueller's spectacular 83rd minute strike, five minutes after he
came on, canceled out an early goal by Yugoslav midfielder Branko
Brnovic.
	   Yugoslavia had sat back on its lead after going ahead in the
sixth minute and was given a further scare in the 88th minute when
a Patrick Haas free kick was tipped over the bar by keeper Ivica
Kralj at full stretch.
	   Yugoslav coach Slobodan Santrac said his team was tired after
its World Cup preparations.
	   ``It was difficult to get so many players from so many European
leagues playing together,'' he added. ``The Swiss succeeded in
stopping us from playing our own game.''
	   The Yugoslavs open their World Cup campaign next Sunday, when
the team takes on Iran in Saint-Etienne.
	   It is one of the favorites to qualify from first-round Group F,
which also includes the United States and three-times champion
Germany.
	   On Wednesday Yugoslavia beat fellow qualifier Japan 1-0 courtesy
of a goal by defender Sinisa Mihajlovic.
	   A cautious Yugoslavia side was given an energetic workout by the
depleted Swiss, who missed out on a place in France after a
disastrous qualifying campaign.
	   After starting brightly, Switzerland was caught by surprise as
Savo Milosevic's cross from the right was met by Espanyol player
Brnovic, who steered a powerful shot past advancing Swiss keeper
Pascal Zuberbuehler.
	   Yugoslavia was content to break out from defense after that,
with no serious chances of taking a two-goal lead until a
Mihajlovic corner rattled the Swiss in the 34th minute.
	   A spell of Swiss pressure, in which the team won six corners,
ended with a 44th minute goal by Alexandre Comisetti being
disallowed for handball.
	   Milosevic was involved in most of Yugoslavia's most promising
moves until he was replaced in the second half. Star striker
Predrag Mijatovic was substituted at half time and Mihajlovic,
known for his powerful long-range free kicks, had only limited
chances.
	   The Swiss pressure mounted in the second half, but when the
equalizer came it was from an unexpected source.
	   Mueller, of Geneva club Servette and playing in only his second
match for the national team, curled a right-footed shot into the
top right corner of the goal.
	   Lineups:
	   Switzerland _ Pascal Zuberbuehler, Murat Yakin, Stephane
Henchoz, Marco Zwyssig, Johann Vogel, David Sesa (Fabio Celestini
87th minute), Johann Lonfat (Bernt Haas 46th), Sebastien Fournier,
Frederic Chassot (Patrick de Napoli 61st), Stephane Chapuisat,
Alexandre Comisetti (Patrick Mueller 78th).
	   Yugoslavia _ Ivica Kralj, Zoran Mirkovic, Miroslav Djukic
(Slobodan Komljenovic 46th), Sinisa Mihajlovic, Goran Djorovic,
Dragan Stojkovic (Dejan Govedarica 46th) , Slavisa Jokanovic,
Branko Brnovic (Zeljko Petrovic 46th), Vladimir Jugovic, Predrag
Mijatovic (Darko Kovacevic 46th), Savo Milosevic (Dejan Stankovic
78th).
	   Referee: Juan Manuel Brito Arceo. Attendance: 24,000.

Chicago comes home tied 1-1, just like Bulls wanted AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR
<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ The Chicago Bulls were washed-up, over-the-hill,
self-destructing champs who'd better get used to the idea of
someone else holding that gleaming, gold trophy. But that was two
days ago.
	   Now, with the NBA Finals tied 1-1, the giddiness of Chicago's
previous championship runs is back. Get downtown's Grant Park
ready, there's even some talk about a Chicago sweep of the Utah
Jazz in its three games at home.
	   Game 3 is Sunday at the United Center.
	   ``A lot of people have said things about our physical tiredness
or whatever, but our mental toughness is there,'' Michael Jordan
said after scoring 37 points in Chicago's 93-88 victory Friday.
``We are mentally strong to be where we are, and certainly mentally
strong to defend what we have.
	   ``Physically, we may not. They may be a much more physical,
gifted team, but mentally, that counts for something. And I don't
think that should ever be overlooked.''
	   If that sounds like a warning, it is. After the Bulls lost Game
1 at the Delta Center, people were questioning if Chicago's time
had passed. Jordan was looking, well, human, missing shots and
bickering with sidekick Scottie Pippen.
	   After a physically draining series with Indiana, maybe the aging
Bulls just didn't have anything left to compete with the
well-rested Jazz. Maybe Dennis Rodman's shenanigans were finally
taking a toll. Maybe Jerry Reinsdorf and Jerry Krause had the right
idea in breaking up the team.
	   Jordan and his teammates heard all this and just smiled. Let
everyone else plan Utah's victory party and Chicago's funeral. The
Bulls knew what was really going on.
	   So they lost a game. Big deal. In case anyone's forgotten, they
also lost Game 1 to the Lakers in 1991 and still went on to win
their first title.
	   ``We didn't think at all that we were going to come here and
lose both games,'' Pippen said afterward. ``We went into this game
very positive, knowing that we had some adjustments to make from
Game 1, and we felt very good about our chances coming to the game
tonight.''
	   They feel even better about their chances going into Game 3. The
Bulls have dropped just one game at home in the playoffs _ Game 2
of the Eastern Conference semifinals to the Charlotte Hornets _ and
their winning percentage at home in the playoffs (77 percent) is
the best of any existing team.
	   Not to mention that Utah is struggling. Jeff Hornacek is ailing,
though he did come through with 20 points Friday. Karl Malone has
averaged 27 points a game in the playoffs in his career, but he was
a non-factor in Games 1 and 2. He was a miserable 5-for-16 from the
field Friday _ 0-for-4 in the second half _ finishing with 16
points.
	   Even Rodman, who has more hair colors than offense, had more
baskets than Malone in the second half Friday. And if that's not
bad enough, Rodman's one field goal was a jumper over Malone.
	   ``We will not win this series if I don't play better,'' Malone
said. ``That's just the way it is. We have other guys that step up,
but if I don't play well _ if Karl Malone doesn't play well, we
don't win this series.''
	   It's not just Malone that coach Jerry Sloan is worried about.
It's his whole team. The Jazz looked in Game 2 like the awestruck
team it was last year, not a squad that's already been through a
Finals with the Bulls.
	   Chicago drove to the basket whenever it wanted, and its defense
was smooth, crisp and totally disruptive. The Jazz couldn't get
anything going, not even its trademark pick-and-roll. The Bulls
outrebounded the Jazz 18-9 on the offensive glass, and turned those
second chances into 19 points.
	   ``We never destroyed their rhythm, except for a couple of times,
and we have to do that to compete against them,'' Sloan said. ``I
told the guys, I don't mind losing. I don't like to, but I hate to
see guys not compete. We came out very soft, and they were the
aggressors.''
	   But before anyone starts burying the Jazz, just remember what
was being said about the Bulls a few days ago.
	   ``Any disregard for either team in a situation like this, it's
going to be very difficult to stand by,'' Chicago coach Phil
Jackson said. ``I can see it in the making, it's going to be one of
those playoffs that are going to be very difficult. ... This is
going to be some series.''

President Cardoso losing support among poor 
</HEADLINE>
By JACK EPSTEIN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ For the first time since he became
president, Fernando Henrique Cardoso is losing support among the
nation's poor majority, a pollster said Saturday.
	   As a result, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, a perennial socialist
candidate for president, appears to be gaining on Cardoso, who
assumed power on New Year's Day in 1995 and is running for
re-election in October.
	   ``The poor population is pushing Fernando Henrique down,'' Helio
Gastalde, director for the IBOPE polling firm, told reporters. ``We
can easily infer that there is great dissatisfaction with the
economic situation, with the fear of unemployment.''
	   Three separate polls released Saturday show da Silva as having
gained support over the past month _ with the poor as his biggest
booster. In the past, low income voters had been ardent Cardoso
supporters since his anti-inflationary economic program had allowed
them to spend more income on consumer items.
	   At campaign stops, da Silva has hammered home the theme that
Cardoso has ignored the needy in his efforts to curb inflation and
stabilize the economy and has failed to initiate sweeping social
programs that the poor so badly need.
	   Da Silva, who lost a close race in 1989 to Fernando Collor de
Mello and was easily beaten by Cardoso in 1994, is also changing
his radical image. He no longer criticizes the stabilization
program, which brought inflation from 50 percent a month to 5
percent annually.
	   Instead, he has focused on such social issues as rising
unemployment _ officially 8 percent but critics say its twice that
_ and lack of political will to significantly change the nation's
skewed distribution of wealth, one of the world's worst.
	   Cardoso hasn't helped his own cause.
	   Last month, he offended many here by calling anyone who retires
at 50 a ``bum.'' Cardoso, who has been campaigning to reform
Brazil's social security system, surprised many by the sharp
attack.
	   Moreover, previous polls have described him as out of touch with
Brazilian reality, preferring to travel abroad than to his own
nation's hinterlands.
	   Last month, Cardoso led a 35-member business delegation to
Spain. On Saturday, he flew to the United States to attend the
signing of an education agreement between Brazil and the World
Bank, speak at the U.N and visit with President Bill Clinton at
Camp David.
	   ``With all these trips, the voters see him as more worried about
his and the country's image than internal problems,'' said
Gastalde.
	   Most political analysts agree that there will likely be no clear
winner in the first round of elections in October, causing a runoff
election a month later, an unlikely political scenario just several
months ago.

Eds: Leads throughout to UPDATE with flight attendants voting to
<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Flight attendants for Mexico's largest
airline ended a strike Saturday after six days. They had never
stopped working, however, because the government took over the
airline's operations when the strike began.
	   Union negotiators reached an accord with Aeromexico on Friday,
and put the proposed settlement to their members Saturday
afternoon.
	   About 300 union members present voted unanimously to approve the
accord, according to the union's secretary-general, Alejandra
Barrales.
	   The 1,033 unionized flight attendants went on strike a week ago
over salaries, work hours, benefits and the size of flight crews.
	   But they continued to work after the government took over
operations of Aeromexico. Mexico's constitution gives the
government the right to temporarily seize companies vital to the
nation's economy or security.
	   Barrales said the airline agreed to all the union's main
concerns _ an 18.3 percent raise, one additional flight attendant
on each flight, extra pay for night work and the beginnings of a
retirement plan.
	   The government has said it would hand operations back over to
Aeromexico when the strike ended.

Annan repeats offer to help India and Pakistan resume dialogue With UN-India-Pakistan 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ After the Security Council condemned South
Asian nuclear tests, Secretary-General Kofi Annan renewed his offer
Saturday to help India and Pakistan resume a high-level dialogue to
resolve longstanding differences.
	   Annan attended Saturday's session in which the 15 council
members voted unanimously on a resolution to demand that India and
Pakistan refrain from further nuclear tests, halt weapons programs
and sign nuclear control agreements unconditionally.
	   The resolution also urges the two South Asian rivals to resume
negotiations on issues, including Kashmir, the Himalayan area over
which they have fought two wars since gaining independence from
Britain in 1947.
	   ``I would like in particular to welcome the call to India and
Pakistan to resume their bilateral talks on the issues that have
sadly divided them,'' Annan told the council. ``I will continue my
own efforts to encourage this dialogue in the hope that it will
reduce tensions and the danger of an escalation in the nuclear arms
race.''
	   The dialogue broke down last year because of differences over
Kashmir.
	   During his remarks, Annan said last month's nuclear tests on the
subcontinent ``are unquestionably disturbing developments with
far-reaching consequences for the region and for the international
community.''
	   Echoing remarks of council members, Annan said the tests also
``seriously impact on the ongoing process of nuclear
nonproliferation and nuclear disarmament and its future and our
common security.''

	   It was the second heartbreaking Belmont loss for trainer Bob
Baffert. His Silver Charm missed the Triple Crown last year when he
was beaten by Touch Gold by three-quarters of a length.
	   Silver Charm was ridden by Gary Stevens, who on Saturday was on
Victory Gallop.
	   Thomas Jo finished third, and Parade Ground was fourth in a
field of 11 3-year-olds.
	   Instead of becoming the 12th Triple Crown winner and first since
Affirmed in 1978, Real Quiet, ridden by Kent Desormeaux, became the
14th Derby and Preakness winner to fall short in the Belmont.
	   The margin was a nose, the smallest official margin racing. Real
Quiet was six lengths ahead of Thomas Jo, who was 1 1/4 lengths
ahead of Parade Ground. Completing the order of finish were
Raffie's Majesty, Chilito, Grand Slam, Classic Cat, Limit Out,
Yarrow Brae and Basic Trainee.

Princess' mother vows to carry out Diana's wishes in will reply on plot allegations 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: Updates at end with report Al Fayed will ask government to
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Princess Diana's mother, responding obliquely to
Mohamed Al Fayed's criticism of her relationship with her daughter,
vowed Saturday to carry out Diana's wish that she help with the
uprbringing of Prince William and Prince Harry.
	   Al Fayed, whose son Dodi died in the car crash that killed Diana
nine months ago, said Friday that Frances Shand Kydd was a bad
mother, accused her of snobbery and said Diana ``did not give a
damn about her.''
	   Most of Saturday's newspapers attacked Al Fayed for the remarks
he made after a Paris meeting of witnesses and the judge handling
the French investigation of the Aug. 31 crash.
	   Al Fayed has angered Diana's family with his allegations that
she intended to marry his son and that the two were victims of a
murder plot. He made clear Friday that Mrs. Shand Kydd had not
spoken to him at all during the day-long meeting.
	   In a statement issued to the national news agency Press
Association on Saturday, Mrs. Shand Kydd said, ``I have nothing to
say about yesterday in Paris, except many thanks to many people who
were kind and helpful to me.
	   ``Diana's will, which has been made public, stated her wishes to
me.
	   ``I shall try my utmost, all my days, to carry out her wishes
and what she asked of me.''
	   Diana's will, which was made public in March, requested that her
mother be consulted over the ``upbringing, education and welfare''
of Princes William and Harry.
	   Al Fayed was quoted as telling the Sunday Mirror newspaper, `` I
do not regret anything that I said. I do not feel I have anything
to apologize for.''
	   He also reportedly told the tabloid that he will try to find a
member of Parliament to force the government to give an assurance
in the House of Commons that the intelligence agencies had nothing
to do with the two deaths.
	   He said he wanted to challenge the government to deny a cover-up
of the circumstances surrounding the crash and that he was writing
to more than 200 legislators, the tabloid said.

Vasco wins semifinals birth in Libertadores Cup tournament 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) - Vasco beat Gremio 1-0 to win a
semifinals berth for the continent-wide Libertadores Cup tournament
Saturday.
	   Vasco, Brazil's 1997 national championship team beat Gremio, a
two-time Libertadores Cup winner at Rio's Sao Januario stadium
before a capacity crowd of 35,000 fans.
	   It was the first time Vasco had ever reached the semifinals.
	   Vasco's Pedrinho scored the game's only goal in the 40th minute
after he converted a perfect pass from Luizao in front of the goal
and tapped it in with his left foot.
	   In the second half, Gremio strikers Guilhereme, Palhinha and
Silvinha kept up a relentless attack on Vasco goalie Caetano, who
made several spectacular saves. Vasco's veteran defender Mauro
Galvao also starred.
	   This was the second game for the coveted semifinals berth
between the two teams. Last Wednesday, they played to a 1-1 tie in
Porto Alegre.
	   In the next round, Vasco will face Argentina's River Plate after
the World Cup in mid-July.
	   The finals for the Libertadores Cup championship won't begin
until Aug. 12

Real Quiet falls by a nose; Victory Gallop wins Belmont AP Racing Writer

By ED SCHUYLER Jr.
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Victory Gallop gained revenge for his losses in
the Kentucky Derby and Preakness by denying Real Quiet the Triple
Crown by the shortest of noses Saturday in the Belmont Stakes.
	   At the eighth pole, Real Quiet appeared to have the Triple Crown
in his grasp, but Victory Gallop, who started his drive at the top
of the stretch, came on and nipped Real Quiet at the wire.
	   Real Quiet bore out in the stretch and there was an inquiry, but
the order of finish was allowed to stand.
	   It was the second heartbreaking Belmont loss for trainer Bob
Baffert. His Silver Charm missed the Triple Crown last year when he
was beaten by Touch Gold by three-quarters of a length.
	   Silver Charm was ridden by Gary Stevens, who on Saturday was on
Victory Gallop.
	   Thomas Jo finished third, and Parade Ground was fourth in a
field of 11 3-year-olds.
	   Instead of becoming the 12th Triple Crown winner and first since
Affirmed in 1978, Real Quiet, ridden by Kent Desormeaux, became the
14th Derby and Preakness winner to fall short in the Belmont.
	   The margin was a nose, the smallest official margin in racing.
Real Quiet was six lengths ahead of Thomas Jo, who was 1 1/4
lengths ahead of Parade Ground. Completing the order of finish were
Raffie's Majesty, Chilito, Grand Slam, Classic Cat, Limit Out,
Yarrow Brae and Basic Trainee.
	   Scratched were Hanuman Highway and Hot Wells.
	   ``I guess we're going to have to do it again,'' Baffert said
about taking a shot at the Triple Crown.
	   ``It's a letdown. ... I could just see the headlines, `The Fish
does it''' Baffert said, using the nickname he gave to Real Quiet.
	   On this clear, sunny day before a roaring crowd, it certainly
looked as if Real Quiet was going to get the job done.
	   He took the lead from Chilito with three-eighths of a mile (0.60

	   But suddenly his certain victory seemed tenuous as Victory
Gallop came storming down the middle. It was too close to call and
it took several minutes before Victory Gallop's number was put on
the board.
	   ``I think my horse didn't see the horse coming,'' Desormeaux

	   There was no doubt, however, that Real Quiet was struggling in

	   ``It hurts a lot to come so far and not get there,'' Desormeaux

Porsches storm to leadership; spectators injured after crash 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: Race update at 9 hours, next update at 12 hours.
By ANDREAS EVAGORA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LE MANS, France (AP) - Two Porsches grabbed the lead in the
ninth hour of the Le Mans 24 Hour race Saturday, after a Toyota was
unable to maintain its early lead in the endurance race.
	   At the same time a prototype, the Courage C51, was challenging
GT cars for the first time by moving into fourth place.
	   Nine hours after the start of the race, the lead was held by the
Porsche GT1 driven by Jorg Muller and Uwe Alzen of Germany and
France's Bob Wolleck.
	   The car had completed 137 laps.
	   Also on 137 laps, and in second place, was another Porsche GT1,
driven by Alan McNish of Britain and France's Laurent Aiello and
Stephane Ortelli.
	   The Toyota GT One driven by Thierry Boutsen lost a lead it had
held for more than four hours, when it went into the pits for a
scheduled pit stop.
	   After the scheduled pit stop, the Toyota One lost further ground
at when it was in the pits for 15 minutes with gearbox problems.
	   As nightfall descended, the two Porsches took full advantage to
move into the lead.
	   The Toyota continued to slip down the field and was in seventh
place after nine hours.
	   In the race between prototypes, the Courage C51 driven by Didier
Cottaz, Marc Goosens and Jean Philippe had improved to fourth
place.
	   Porsche's leading prototype, the LMP1, was in fifth but was
losing ground on the Courage C51 with lighting problems.
	   Some drivers of cars that were already out of the race said that
they have nevertheless learned valuable experience.
	   ``We are really disappointed as the car was going faster than
expected,'' said Steve Soper, driver of one of BMW's V12, which
pulled out after four hours.
	   ``Suddenly we had a wheel-bearing problem and the race was
finished. But we only started developing the car last October with
serious driving in April, and there is nothing like Le Mans for
testing a car.''
	   ``In 25 years of driving I have never been able to overtake so
easily on the straight, so I'm already looking forward to next
year,'' Soper said.
	   Race organizers said that several spectators were slightly
injured by flying gravel and pieces of spoiler from a Porsche 911
GT2 that rolled out of control.
	   The car was driven by Briton Nick Ham, who was also lightly
injured in the accident, which took place when the car rolled off
the track at Mulsanne Corner.

World Cup: Sheringham apologizes for late-night drinking 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with new quotes from Sheringham, Hoddle
<TEXT>
	   BISHAM ABBEY, England (AP) _ England striker Teddy Sheringham
apologized Saturday for a late-night drinking spree at a Portuguese
nightclub, which openly defied instructions of coach Glenn Hoddle.
	   Hoddle, under some pressure to drop Sheringham, said there was
no similarity between this case and that of Paul Gascoigne. Hoddle
cut Gascoigne last weekend, distressed by his late-night habits and
lack of fitness.
	   Sheringham's photo was splashed across papers Friday, showing
him with a cigarette in the mouth and his arm draped a young woman
in a bar on Portugal's Algarve coast. Accompanying stories said he
had been partying and drinking until dawn.
	   ``If people read that I was out until 6 a.m. it sounds
disgraceful, and I admit that,'' said a sheepish Sheringham at
England's training headquarters in southern England.
	   ``I know it's come across that I've been a fool and when I got
back and read the papers, it crossed my mind that what had happened
to Paul (Gascoigne) could happen to me.''
	   Sheringham said he posed for the photographs and insisted he
wasn't smoking or drunk.
	   ``I'm genuinely sorry for how this has come across, although I
wasn't drunk, I wasn't stumbling about, and I definitely wasn't
smoking either,'' he said.
	   After breaking training camp in Spain last weekend, Hoddle
reminded players they were ``on England duty'' and ask them to
return home for a quiet few days before training resumed.
	   The incident put Hoddle on the spot, particularly since
Sheringham is regarded as a much less-talented player than
Gascoigne.
	   ``This is unlike the Paul Gascoigne case,'' Hoddle said. ``I'm
sure people will say they are being treated differently but with
Paul it wasn't a case of a drinking situation but about his
fitness.''
	   ``Teddy knows how disappointed I was, that there wasn't any gray
area and that he let down his teammates, but the situation between
him and Paul is totally different.''
	   On Friday, Sir Bobby Charlton _ a member of England's 1966 World
Cup-winning side _ lambasted Sheringham for his lack of discipline
and suggested he had made England the laughingstock of world
soccer.
	   ``You are the focus of the whole country and if the players
don't have the common sense to behave themselves and act in a
reasonable manner it is absolutely nonsensical to think we have a
chance of winning it,'' Charlton said.
	   Just as the Sheringham and Gascoigne cases were clearing up,
England was rocked Saturday by the antics of a third England
player.
	   News reports said Darren Anderton was involved Wednesday in a
nightclub brawl in the southern town of Bournemouth. Anderton
denied he took part in the fight, although the tabloid Sun reported
a friend was punched in the face.

Galaxy reach World Bowl on Kleinmann's overtime FG 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   DUESSELDORF, Germany (AP) _ Ralf Kleinmann hit a 46-yard field
goal with 41 seconds left in overtime Saturday to carry the
Frankfurt Galaxy into the NFL Europe's World Bowl.
	   Behind the German national's kick, the Galaxy edged the
Duesseldorf Rhein Fire 20-17 in front of a record football crowd at
Rhein Stadium of 41,212.
	   Kleinmann also sent the game into overtime, tying the game at
17-17 by connecting for a 36-yarder with 46 seconds to play.
	   Rhein Fire (7-3) had already clinched a berth in the World Bowl
to be held June 14 in Frankfurt, Germany, but the Galaxy (7-3)
needed to win to hold off the Amsterdam Admirals.
	   Chris Dittoe rallied the Galaxy in the second half, hitting
receiver Mario Bailey for 5 yards with 2:32 to play that cut the
Rhein Fire lead to 17-14.
	   Dittoe, who replaced the injured Damon Huard to start the second
half, also dived over from the 1-yard line for the team's first
score.
	   The Rhein Fire dominated until the third quarter with Mike
Quinn, playing for the Pittsburgh Steelers next season, throwing
two touchdown passes.
	   Quinn, the league's leading passer, hit Kevin Lee for 29 yards
with 7:44 remaining in the half. His 9-yard toss to Dialleo Burks
early in the third quarter put Rhein Fire ahead 14-0.
	   But the game turned when Quinn's handoff on the Rhein Fire
1-yard line was fumbled and Dittoe carried it in on the next play.
	   The Amsterdam Admirals could also finish 7-3 by winning Sunday,
but have the worst record when the three teams have faced each
other head-to-head.

US beats Brazil, Russia shocks Australia 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Lisa Leslie and Natalie Williams combined for 32
points and 27 rebounds as the U.S. National Team defeated Brazil
93-79 on Saturday, advancing to the Women's World Championship
game.
	   There the Americans will meet Russia, which shocked previously
unbeaten Australia 82-76. The U.S. team defeated Russia 96-60 in
group play earlier in the week.
	   Ruthie Bolton added 16 points for the Americans, 13 of them in
the second half when the United States took control of the game.
	   The win avenged a bitter 110-107 defeat in the semifinals of the
1994 World Championships, a game in which the U.S. was also
favored. Brazil went on to win the world title, and Bolton, who
played in the '94 game, was determined not to let it happen again.
	   ``It brought back some bad feelings,'' Bolton said of the
matchup. ``I did not want to go through those feelings again.''
	   Brazil seemed poised early on to upset the Americans. Paula da
Silva controlled much of the first half, scoring 16 of her
game-high 25 points to help Brazil build a 10-point lead, 47-37,
with 4:43 left.
	   But the Americans crawled slowly back into the game, helped by
the Brazilians' inability to take full advantage of their free
throws. Brazil was making 71 percent of free throws coming into the
game but made just nine of 16 in the first half.
	   The U.S. had cut the margin to 45-44 at the break, and the
American team's depth began to take its toll five minutes into the
second half.
	   ``The Americans have 12 players they can use,'' said Brazilian
coach Antonio Carlos Barbosa. By contrast, all but seven of
Brazil's points came from just four players.
	   Leslie and Williams scored 16 points each, and Leslie led the
Americans with 14 rebounds.
	   In the day's other game, heavily favored Australia struggled
offensively as the Russians blocked nine shots and took away the
inside game of Carla Porter and Jenny Whittle. Power forward
Michelle Griffiths led the Australians in scoring with 17 points,
but she was just six of 17 from the field.
	   The Australians trailed for most of the game. They last led with
4:21 left in the first half, and Russia steadily pulled away after
that.
	   Mounting a ferocious press, Australia cut Russia's 75-62 lead
with 3:02 left to just 76-74 with 1:41 remaining. But Irina
Routkovskaya, who was making just 56 percent of her free throws
coming into the game, hit four pressure free throws in the last 53
seconds to seal the win.
	   Elena Baranova was the Russians' real hero, finishing with 25
points, 14 rebounds, four assists and three blocked shots.
Baranova, who plays for the Utah Starzz, dominated the boards in
the last two and a half minutes, when the Australians made three
straight steals in the backcourt.
	   Elena Pshikova added 22 points and made five of seven
three-pointers, while Elena Khudacova had 16 points and 14
rebounds.

Four reported hurt in airline flight turbulence 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ An Olympic Airways flight from Athens to Montreal
hit severe turbulence that left four people hurt, including a woman
whose legs were broken, according to the hospital where the injured
were taken after an unscheduled landing in London.
	   No airline spokesman was immediaterly available and few details
were known, but Montreal's Dorval Airport said Olympic flight 423,
which had been scheduled to arrive at 3:15 p.m. local time (2015
GMT), was not expected to reach Montreal until 10 p.m. (0300 GMT
Sunday).
	   London's Heathrow Airport said the Boeing 747 made an
unscheduled landing at 3 p.m. (1400 GMT) so the injured could be
treated.
	   Five Greek women were taken off the plane and moved by ambulance
to Hillingdon Hospital in Uxbridge, about 5 miles (8 km) north of
the airport, said hospital spokesman Mark Purcell.
	   One, who is pregnant, underwent checks at the hospital's
maternity clinic but was given the all clear, he said.
	   The injured were the woman whose legs were broken, two air
hostesses, and a fourth woman kept overnight for observation.
	   ``The two air crew are being treated for head and neck injuries.
The lady with the broken legs is stable and comfortable,'' Purcell
said. No further details were available.

Plane picks up Britons in Eritrea With Eritrea-Ethiopia 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Updates with British plane to picks up Britons, others 
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A British air force plane flew into Eritrea on
Saturday night and picked up about 100 foreign nationals who had
been stranded in the East African nation where fighting with
Ethiopia has escalated over their disputed border.
	   An RAF C-130 Hercules picked up the remaining 40 Britons and
about 60 Australian, Canadian and South African nationals, and took
off at around 2200GMT for Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, the Ministry of
Defense said.
	   The aircraft was on the ground for an hour, during which time
the Royal Marines, carrying light weapons, helped to marshal
evacuees and provide protection, the government said.
	   The Foreign Office on Friday advised British citizens in Eritrea
to leave as soon as possible because of the worsening conflict.
	   Forty-eight Britons left Eritrea that night on a U.S. aircraft
which landed in Frankfurt early Saturday. The Foreign Office said
the Britons, mainly working for the non-governmental organization
Voluntary Service Overseas, then flew to London.

A Package of Caribbean News Briefs CUBA: Cubans on their own in applying for U.S. visas 
</HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Cuba said Saturday that it won't set up any
special mechanisms to help its citizens apply for a new U.S. visa
lottery, in which hundreds of thousands of Cubans are expected to
participate.
	   In a statement reported by the government's Prensa Latina news
agency and monitored in Mexico City, Cuba's post office said it
would not set up a special system.
	   The lottery, the third of its kind, was announced Friday in
Washington. It opens June 15, and winners are granted an interview
by U.S. consular officers.
	   In the last lottery, in 1996, more than 436,000 applications
were received. In the first, in 1994, 190,000 people applied.
 &UR; GUYANA: President asks for talks with chief rival
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ With an election recount completed,
Guyana President Janet Jagan has called on her chief rival to sit
down for one-on-one talks.
	   Jagan and the president of the opposition People's National
Congress, Desmond Hoyte, have not met in person since the December
election in which Jagan defeated Hoyte.
	   In the aftermath of the vote, Hoyte's party claimed fraud and
demonstrations turned violent. On Tuesday, an international panel
announced that its recount of the votes found no serious
irregularities.
	   Hoyte has not said if he will meet with Jagan, but has indicated
that he would agree only if a specific agenda is set. Jagan, the
U.S.-born widow of popular former president Cheddi Jagan, said she
would agree to Hoyte's request.
 &UR; CUBA: Cigar chief says quality is not declining
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Responding to criticism that the quality of
Cuban cigars is dropping as production booms, the head of Cuba's
government cigar producers says the stogies are as good as ever.
	   In an article by the government news agency Prensa Latina,
monitored in Mexico City, the head of Cuba's Union of Tabacco
Companies said Cuban cigars are works of art and that there are
enough quality checks to ensure their flavor.
	   Production grew 40 percent last year, and is expected to grow
another 60 percent this year, Francisco Linares Calvo said Friday.
	   That means the industry will make 160 million cigars for export,
which will net the companies dlrs 280 million _ a profit of dlrs
180 million, Prensa Latina said.
	   The world market for Cuban cigars has been growing strongly over
the past few years. Some aficionados have complained that quality
has been dropping as production increases.

South Korean president meets U.N. chief 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ South Korean President Kim Dae-jung
visited Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Saturday before attending a
reception in conjunction with a Korean exhibit at the Metropolitan
Museum of Art.
	   The United Nations released no statement after the half-hour
meeting between Annan and Kim at U.N. headquarters.
	   The South Korean president, who was elected last December, is to
meet with Korean-Americans on Sunday, then receive an award from
the International League for Human Rights for his contribution to
civil liberties.
	   Before winning the presidency, Kim spent 40 years as an
opposition politician, including 7 1/2 years in prison or house
arrest and four years in exile under a succession of military
dictators.
	   He has been abducted by government agents, sentenced to death
and, by his account, targeted for assassination four times by those
who saw him as a threat to ruling regimes.
	   On Monday, he will address the Council on Foreign Relations
before traveling to Washington for an address to Congress and a
meeting with President Bill Clinton.

Australians feel vindicated by test thrashing 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Australian rugby bosses John O'Neill
and Dick McGruther said their attacks on England's touring rugby
team were vindicated by Saturday's record 76-0 Wallaby win.
	   The pair were strongly critical of the English Rugby Union for
allowing an under strength team Down Under and were proved right in
an 11-try romp which was England's worst defeat.
	   ``What can you do, pretend it didn't happen?'' ARU chief
executive O'Neill said.
	   ``They sent a squad out here with 20 uncapped players and
they've turned out a test team tonight and been beaten 76-0.''
	   He described the feeling as ``sweet and sour.''
	   ``You win a Test match 76-0 against England and you don't
celebrate,'' O'Neill said. ``For a country that has figured in the
top four in the world to be beaten 76-0 by Australia is a crying
shame. If ever there was a message to the English RFU this is the
message. This is not what international rugby is about, it's not a
contest.''
	   O'Neill said he felt sorry for the English players who were sent
out for the slaughter.
	   ``The (English) have painted us as some sort of madmen from the
southern hemisphere telling them how to run their business,''
O'Neill said. ``How would you feel if you were an English player
walking off the paddock tonight? And now they've got five games in
New Zealand which are horrific.
	   ``Those poor players, as determined and proud as they are, are
not test players.''
	   O'Neill and McGruther were lampooned in Britain for their
comments when England's touring party was announced.
	   McGruther had described the squad as the worst prepared English
to visit Australia since the First Fleet, and said the RFU was
responsible for the biggest sell out since Gallipoli.
	   ``I would just hope the England officials now realize that if
you want primacy in Test rugby you've got to be proactive and do
something positive about it,'' McGruther said Saturday.
	   England coach Clive Woodward believed the loss was a ``freak
result.''
	   ``It wasn't a a case of an embarrassment or humiliation. We just
had a bit of a bad day,'' said Woodward. ``The scoreline was a
freak result. The game got away from us and it turned into a bit of
an exhibition which was disappointing.''
	   Tony Diprose, who captained England for the first time, said his
side could not believe the result.
	   ``Everyone is a little bit shell-shocked,'' Diprose said. ``But
we think we can lift ourselves up and play well through to the end
of the tour.''

Wilma the greyhound comes home 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Wilma the greyhound, who sprinted off the track
after her last race and kept on going, has finally returned to her
trainer after three days on the lam.
	   Wilma came last in her race at a greyhound track in Poole,
southwest England, Tuesday night. But when the other dogs eased up
after the race, Wilma sprinted off through the stadium gates, still
wearing her muzzle and an orange running jacket bearing a number 5.
	   One baffled motorist telephoned police to say he had been
overtaken by a greyhound on a road five miles (8 kilometers) from
Poole.
	   On Friday night, trainer Jo Burridge received a phone call to
say Wilma had been spotted in an industrial park about 3 1/2 miles
(6 km) from the stadium. Mrs. Burridge drove quickly to the spot
and Wilma's wanderings were over.
	   Tail wagging furiously, Wilma was put in the car and driven back
to the kennels, where she tucked into a meaty dinner before bedding
down for the night.
	   ``She's fine and resting and she doesn't seem to have lost any
weight,'' Mrs. Burridge said. ``I'm just pleased to have her back
and she doesn't seem the worst for wear.''

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ With a border dispute escalating into
bombing raids, hundreds of foreigners scrambled out of Eritrea on
Saturday, fearing it will be engulfed in war with Ethiopia. One of
their main escape routes came under attack for a second straight
day. Ethiopian jets again bombed a military-civilian airport not
far from Asmara, forcing embassies to step up their exit plans.
Late Saturday, foreign diplomats met with Ethiopian Prime Minister
Meles Zenawi in Addis Ababa and received a pledge that Ethiopian
warplanes would suspend their bombing of the airport from Saturday
evening until Sunday morning so evacuations could take place,
Italian Ambassador Marcello Ricoveri said. (ERITREA-ETHIOPIA)
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The 15 members of the Security Council
have demanded in a unanimous vote that India and Pakistan refrain
from further nuclear tests, halt weapons programs and sign nuclear
control agreements unconditionally. After Saturday's vote,
non-nuclear states, including New Zealand and Canada, also sent a
strong message to the United States and the other four nuclear
powers, telling them to fulfill commitments to reduce their own
nuclear arsenals. Islamic countries also complained the council has
ignored Israel's refusal to sign arms control treaties or accept
international controls on its nuclear program. Israel has never
acknowledged having nuclear weapons but is believed to have the
technology to build them. (UN-INDIA-PAKISTAN)
	   PARIS (AP) _ French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said Saturday
the government was prepared to intervene in the weeklong Air France
strike which has embarrassed the country ahead of the World Cup,
which opens Wednesday. Air France President Jean-Cyril Spinetta
said talks that lasted all night without reaching agreement had
been ``suspended.'' The pilots appeared divided, with the head of
the main pilots' union indicating new talks could take place Monday
and a spokesman saying they could go back to the table over the
weekend. Air France is the official World Cup carrier and is
committed to transporting the teams from one venue to another.
Jospin said the French government was ready to intervene to help
end the the strike and would play a role ``in the hours to come.''

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb gunners shelled villages in
Kosovo with heavy artillery on Saturday and fighting flared along
the province's southern border with Macedonia. Four people were
killed in the clashes, ethnic Albanian and Serb sources said. The
artillery attack targeted three villages in the Decani area, 45
miles (70 kilometers) west of Pristina, said the Kosovo Information
Center, which is close to Albanian leaders in the province. Serb
police and army forces have recently stepped up their campaign to
crush the Kosovo Liberation Army, the armed wing of the Albanian
independence movement. The militants have been gaining in
popularity and numbers after years of heavy-handed rule by Serbian
authorities in Kosovo, the secessionist southern province where
ethnic Albanians represent 90 percent of the population of 2.2
million. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The danger of losing this capital city's
sectarian balance was at stake in Sunday's municipal elections.
Prime Minister Rafik Hariri has appealed to voters not to ignore
candidates from the Christian minority when they elect a new city
council for this city of Sunni Muslim majority. ``Let's maintain
the national balance and give mutual coexistence top consideration
when voting,'' said Hariri, a Sunni Muslim who has endorsed a slate
of candidates that includes Christians, Sunnis and Shiite Muslims.
Beirut, the city where the civil war of 1975-90 began, elected a
half-Muslim, half-Christian council in its last local elections 35
years ago. But the demography has since changed in favor of the
Muslims. (LEBANON-ELECTIONS)

<TEXT>
	   ALPAHRETTA, Georgia (AP) _ Gil Morgan, locked in a seasonlong
battle with Hale Irwin for dominance of the Senior PGA Tour, shot a
3-under-par 69 to share the lead with Bob Eastwood after the second
round of the Nationwide Championship.
	   Morgan, who has three victories, three other Top 10 finishes and
dlrs 853,818 in earnings this year, moved to the top of the
leaderboard by blasting out of a sand trap at No. 18 within two
feet (less than a meter) of the hole. He tapped in for a birdie
that left him with an 8-under 136 after two rounds.
	   ``I was very fortunate to finish like I did,'' Morgan said.
	   Eastwood breezed through the first 13 holes on a cloudy, breezy
day at five under before hitting a shot into Lake Windward at No.
14, resulting in a double-bogey. He bounced back to birdie the
final hole, finishing with a 4-under 68 for the round and tied with
Morgan.
	   Sixty-two-year-old Gary Player, seeking to become the
second-oldest player to win on the seniors tour, struggled with his
putter but was still in contention at 139, three shots off the
pace.
	   Player began the day tied with Morgan for the lead at five under
but settled for a second-round 72 after missing four birdie putts
inside of 10 feet (3 meters) on the back nine.
	   ``I played so well,'' Player said. ``I guess that's what makes
golf such a fascinating, humbling game.''
	   Jose Maria Canizares was alone in third with a 7-under 137,
while Player was one of four players at five under.
	   Heading into the final round, Morgan clearly had his eyes on
Irwin, who also has three victories this year (despite playing only
eight senior tournaments) and leads the money list with dlrs
1,051,850.
	   Irwin shot his second straight 70 and was just four shots off
the lead, part of a group at four-under.
	   ``He's still out there,'' Morgan said. ``He can catch up pretty
quick because he's such a good player. When I was standing there at
18, I looked at the scoreboard and wondered where Hale was.''
	   Player had three birdies on the front nine and stretched his
streak of bogey-free holes to 26 before running into trouble after
the turn. He had bogeys at 10 and 11 and scrambled for pars on the
next two holes, including a testy 4-footer (one-meter) at the par-3
13th after his tee shot barely cleared the water in front of the
green.
	   ``Wait till you get to 63 and see how tough it is,'' Player
quipped to the large gallery that followed him around the Golf Club
of Georgia.
	   Player, who actually turns 63 on Nov. 1, pulled his game
together and gave himself one birdie chance after another all the
way to the clubhouse.
	   But he couldn't convert any of them, missing from 5 feet (1.5
meters) at 14, 9 feet (3 meters) at 15, 5 feet (1.5 meters) at 17
and 8 feet (2.5 meters) on the final hole. The last two putts
lipped out of the hole.
	   ``Those putts were right in the hole and they came out,'' Player
moaned, shrugging his shoulders. ``What can you do?''

Four reported hurt in airline flight turbulence 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ An Olympic Airways flight from Athens to Montreal
hit severe turbulence that left four people hurt, including a woman
whose legs were broken, according to the hospital where the injured
were taken after an unscheduled landing in London.
	   No airline spokesman was immediaterly available and few details
were known, but Montreal's Dorval Airport said Olympic flight 423,
which had been scheduled to arrive at 3:15 p.m. local time (2015
GMT), was not expected to reach Montreal until 10 p.m. (0300 GMT
Sunday).
	   London's Heathrow Airport said the Boeing 747 made an
unscheduled landing at 3 p.m. (1400 GMT) so the injured could be
treated.
	   Five Greek women were taken off the plane and moved by ambulance
to Hillingdon Hospital in Uxbridge, about 5 miles (8 km) north of
the airport, said hospital spokesman Mark Purcell.
	   One, who is pregnant, underwent checks at the hospital's
maternity clinic but was given the all clear, he said.
	   The injured were the woman whose legs were broken, two air
hostesses, and a fourth woman kept overnight for observation.
	   ``The two air crew are being treated for head and neck injuries.
The lady with the broken legs is stable and comfortable,'' Purcell
said. No further details were available.

Funk leads Appleby by one in Kemper Open AP Golf Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By RON SIRAK
<TEXT>
	   POTOMAC, Maryland (AP) _ If Fred Funk glances in his rearview
mirror with those new eyes he'll see Stuart Appleby bearing down on
him at the Kemper Open.
	   Coasting along with a lead as large as five strokes, Funk barely
held on down the stretch at TPC at Avenel on Saturday and shot a 71
to be at 12-under-par 201 after three rounds, just one stroke ahead
of Appleby.
	   A lead that once was as large as five strokes was down to the
barest of margins going into the final round.
	   ``I had a chance to separate myself a little bit there when I
got to 14 under,'' said Funk, who made two bogeys over the final
five holes. ``Now it's going to be a shootout.''
	   Funk's even-par round after being two under for the day through
11 holes also let a lot of other people back into the tournament.
	   Chris DiMarco made a bogey on the last hole at was at 203.
	   Tommy Tolles, the sweet swinger whose game has suddenly gone
sour this year, was three strokes back at 204. Clark Dennis made
bogeys on two of the last three holes and was at 205, along with
Scott Hoch and Brad Fabel.
	   Starting the day with a three-stroke lead over Craig Parry,
Appleby and DiMarco, Funk was just trying to make pars, avoid
mistakes and challenge the field to come after him on a day when a
fickle wind made the course play with much more difficulty.
	   The strategy worked for most of the day. Funk held his ground _
making birdies on Nos. 3 and 11 _ and no one made a major move,
except for Tolles, who shot a 66, and Hoch, who had a 68.
	   Funk managed to avoid mistakes until No. 14, the relatively easy
301-yard (275-meter) par-4. He drove into the right rough and
played a good shot to the green but could get no spin on it out of
the high grass and it rolled into the back fringe.
	   From there he chipped poorly, leaving it 10 feet (3 meters) from
the hole, and missed the par-saving putt for his first bogey of the
day.
	   At that time his lead over Appleby, who was playing in the group
in front of Funk and followed an opening bogey with nine
consecutive pars before making birdies on Nos. 11 and 14, was back
to three strokes.
	   Appleby got it to two strokes with an 8-foot (2.5-meter) birdie
putt on No. 17, just moments after DiMarco, his playing partner,
rolled in a 9-footer (3-meter) to also get to 11 under.
	   DiMarco, who slipped to five back with a bogey on No. 5, closed
strong with birdies on Nos. 13, 16 and 17 before making a bogey on
No. 18.
	   Funk, meanwhile, barely curled in a 4-footer (one-meter) to save
par on No. 16 and missed a 5-footer for par on No. 17.
	   ``I started second-guessing myself on the back nine with the
wind,'' Funk said.
	   The 41-year-old Funk, playing just days after laser eye surgery
to improve his vision, has led after each round, following an
opening 64 with a 66.
	   Chasing him is one of the talented under-30 crowd on the PGA
Tour.
	   Appleby, a 27-year-old Australian who won over dlrs 1 million
last year, displayed remarkable poise in his round on a blustery
Saturday.
	   ``In today's weather you more save your round than create your
round,'' he said. ``I think it's going to to be better for me if
it's like this tomorrow.''
	   Also in the hunt is another of the young talents on tour.
Tolles, 31, has yet to win on the PGA Tour but has appeared on the
verge of a breakthrough for the last two years, saving his best
play for the tournaments with the best fields.
	   In 1996, he finished second in the Players Championship and
third in the PGA Championship. Last year, he was third in the
Masters, fourth in the Memorial, fifth in the U.S. Open, seventh in
the Players Championship and 13th in the PGA Championship.
	   But Tolles has not done much against any kind of competition
this year.
	   ``I've got these little demons running through my head,'' he
said.
	   Tolles had missed the cut in his last five tournaments and has
not qualified for weekend play in eight of his 13 events prior to
the Kemper Open. His best finish was ninth at the Tucson Open.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Turks and Caicos, the island nation in the
Caribbean, will likely become the 200th member of FIFA,
international soccer's governing body.
	   The organization currently lists 197 member associations, and
the Palestinians _ who have provisional status _ are almost certain
to gain full membership at a FIFA congress on Monday. The official
agenda then calls for votes on Eritrea and, finally, Turks and
Caicos.
	   The archipelago, with a population of only 15,000 people, ``has
a sports infrastructure which leaves a great deal to be desired,''
said a FIFA statement. ``The association, however, is keen to
benefit from the islanders' enthusiasm for football, and promote
official structures.''
	   ____ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ Legal action may be taken against travel agents
selling non-existent game tickets, the World Cup organizing
committee warned.
	   ``Certain unscrupulous agents have undertaken to sell tickets
for World Cup matches, in sometimes unbelievable quantities, which
they are now unable to hand over to their buyers,'' the French
Organizing Committee (CFO) said Saturday.
	   The CFO singled out Great Portland Entertainments of England,
which reportedly sold 2.4 million pounds (dlrs 3.9 million) worth
of 40,000 tickets it could not supply.
	   In another case, a travel agent claimed to have purchased from
the Cameroon Federation tickets representing 15 percent of the
capacity of a stadium _ for a game in which Cameroon wasn't even
playing.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ David Trezeguet, the 20-year Monaco
striker, laid his claim for a starting place in France's World Cup
team scoring twice Saturday in a 3-1 win against Finnish champion
club HJK Helsinki.
	   Trezeguet scored the only goal Friday as France's probable team
for the World Cup game against South Africa next Wednesday downed
Finland 1-0.
	   France took on HJK on a sunny day in Kauniainen, outside
Helsinki in a training session consisting of three 30-minute
periods, refereed by France head coach Aime Jacquet. France fielded
a team of substitutes and non-playing reserves from Friday's match
against Finland.
	   ____ &QC; 
	   SENLIS, France (AP) _ Italy's World Cup star Alessandro Del
Piero said Tuesday he felt healed from a right thigh strain and
increasingly confident to regain his place on the team.
	   ``I believe it still can be Del Piero's World Cup,'' said the
young striker of Juventus of Turin, whose presence at France '98
had been put at risk by the injury suffered during the Champions
Cup final against Real Madrid last month.
	   However Del Piero looked tense and cautious as he kicked the
ball and joggled by his own during Italy's first training in
France, at the sports center of Senlis.
	   Team doctor Andrea Ferretti and coach Cesare Maldini both
confirmed that Del Piero's thigh lesion had disappeared.
	   ``He will begin tougher exercises with the teammates by Monday
to test his complete recovery under stress,'' said Maldini.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SENLIS, France (AP) _ Fans were kept away, and parking of cars
was forbidden close to the walls of the sport center of Senlis
where Italy's World Cup team is preparing for the upcoming matches.
	   Tight security was common at all places hosting World Cup teams.
	   Policemen with dogs patrolled the center and put to flight two
intruders trying to reach Italy's training field through one of two
cemeteries adjacent to the sports center.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SENLIS, France (AP) _ Italian veteran soccer star Roberto Baggio
was full of praise for cyclist Marco Pantani, who virtually
clinched the Tour of Italy on Saturday.
	   ``We both experienced a lot of sufferings and unexpected
comebacks. We proved you must never give up,'' said Baggio, who is
starting in his third World Cup after overcoming a streak of
injuries and controversy.
	   Pantani's career was nearly ended by two bad spills and a broken
leg in 1995.

Security Council urges India, Pakistan to halt nuclear tests 
</HEADLINE>

By ROBERT H. REID
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The 15 members of the Security Council
have demanded in a unanimous vote that India and Pakistan refrain
from further nuclear tests, halt weapons programs and sign nuclear
control agreements unconditionally.
	   After Saturday's vote, non-nuclear states also sent a strong
message to the five major nuclear powers _ the United States,
Russia, China, France and Britain _ telling them to fulfill
commitments to reduce their own arsenals.
	   Islamic countries complained the council has ignored Israel's
refusal to sign arms control treaties or accept international
controls on its nuclear program. Israel has never acknowledged
having nuclear weapons but is believed to have the technology to
build them.
	   The Indian Foreign Ministry denounced the U.N. resolution as
``coercive and unhelpful'' and said ``we find it grotesque that an
organ of the United Nations should seek to address India in this
manner.''
	   Pakistan's ambassador, Ahmad Kamal, also spoke out against the
resolution.
	   ``Nonproliferation is no longer an issue in South Asia,'' he
said after the vote. ``There is a real danger of nuclear conflict''
and ``no amount of sermonizing and lamentations can rectify or
reverse this unfortunate development.''
	   He said Pakistan ``reserves the right... to deter aggression by
conventional weapons or non-conventional means.''
	   The resolution, co-sponsored by Japan, Slovenia, Sweden and
Costa Rica, denied India and Pakistan legal status as ``nuclear
powers.'' Formal status would enable them to keep their nuclear
arms under the 1970 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
	   The resolution condemned the South Asian tests and urged India
and Pakistan to halt deployment of missiles capable of carrying
nuclear warheads and to sign nuclear arms control treaties.
	   It also called on India and Pakistan to exercise restraint and
find ``mutually acceptable solutions'' to the ``root causes of
those tensions, including Kashmir,'' the Himalayan territory
disputed by them.
	   Japanese Ambassador Hishashi Owada said the Indian and Pakistani
tests last month could plunge the international community ``into an
uncontrollable world of nuclear proliferation.''
	   U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson echoed that remark, saying the
tests ``represent a profound blow'' to efforts to control nuclear
weapons.
	   South Korean Ambassador Lee See-Young said the council must act
decisively to avoid sending ``wrong messages to other parts of the
world,'' presumably North Korea.
	   But it was clear from the debate that while many nations oppose
the tests by India and Pakistan, they object to the way the
Security Council handled the issue.
	   Iran, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain accused it of
following a double-standard by ignoring Israel's suspected nuclear
weapons program.
	   ``We expect the Security Council to ... single out Israel to
adhere to this treaty,'' Egyptian Ambassador Nabil Elaraby said.
	   New Zealand's U.N. ambassador, Michael Powles, said nuclear arms
have ``no legitimate place in the world'' and that all states are
obliged to eliminate them. Australian envoy Penelope Anne Wensley
also encouraged nuclear states to do their part to promote
disarmanent.
	   The message underscored the challenge facing the major nuclear
powers in marshaling international pressure to curb the nuclear
arms race in South Asia.
	   Nuclear states agreed to take steps to reduce their arsenals as
part of a compromise to convince other nations to accept an
indefinite extension of the nonproliferation treaty three years
ago.
	   Also Saturday, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan renewed his
offer to encourage India and Pakistan to resume a high-level
dialogue that broke down last year because of differences over
Kashmir.
	   ``I will continue my own efforts to encourage this dialogue in
the hope that it will reduce tensions and the danger of an
escalation in the nuclear arms race,'' Annan told the conference.
His offer was welcomed in the resolution.
	   India and Pakistan have fought three wars since they gained
independence from Britain in 1947 _ two of them over Kashmir, which
is physically divided between the two countries.

	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ With a border dispute escalating into
bombing raids, hundreds of foreigners were trying to scramble out
of Eritrea on Sunday, fearing it will be engulfed in war with
Ethiopia. One of their main escape routes came under attack for a
second straight day.
	   Ethiopian jets again bombed a military-civilian airport not far
from Asmara on Saturday, forcing embassies to step up their exit
plans.
	   American, Italian, German and British planes ferried foreigners
out of harm's way late Saturday after Ethiopia agreed to
temporarily halt bombing.
	   Weary expatriates crowded the airport parking lot, waiting for
evacuation flights. Angered and confused by the sudden violence in
this capital of broad boulevards and modern buildings, no one
wanted to talk about his decision to go.
	   ``In principle, this is the last of the evacuations, but in
practice, if someone wants to leave we'll try to help,'' said
French Ambassador Louis Le Vert.
	   Eritrea gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993, and Eritrean
rebels later were instrumental in helping the Ethiopian People's
Revolutionary Democratic Front overthrow a 17-year military regime
in July 1991.
	   But the two countries dispute at least six areas along their
common border, which was drawn by Italy after it conquered Eritrea
in 1885.
	   Relations between the one-time allies soured when Eritrea
introduced its own currency in November in an effort to reassert
its independence, triggering a trade war. Eritreans began streaming
to the common border to take up the fight.
	   Late Saturday, foreign diplomats met with Ethiopian Prime
Minister Meles Zenawi in Addis Ababa and received a pledge that
Ethiopian warplanes would suspend their bombing of the airport from
Saturday evening until Sunday morning so evacuations could take
place, Italian Ambassador Marcello Ricoveri said.
	   Afterward, German military aircraft carrying 210 Europeans took
off for Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, the German Defense Ministry said. And
a British air force plane picked up the remaining 40 Britons and
about 60 Australian, Canadian and South African nationals and took
off for Jeddah, the British Defense Ministry said.
	   Le Vert said two U.S. and two Italian planes also carried
foreigners from Asmara to neighboring Djibouti, but he didn't know
how many people were aboard.
	   When the U.S. planes arrived, Marines jumped out and deployed
into combat position, startling Eritreans working at the airport,
which was under a cease-fire.
	   Earlier Saturday, a plane with 194 people aboard arrived in
Frankfurt, Germany.
	   The number of foreigners still waiting to be evacuated from
Eritrea, wedged between northern Ethiopia and the Red Sea, was not
known.
	   With the attacks on Asmara's airport, a quick resolution to the
crisis appeared unlikely.
	   ``At the moment, I'm not seeing any light at the end of the
tunnel,'' Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki told reporters.
	   There was no word on casualties from Saturday's bombing, but
Eritrea claimed to have shot down one of the Ethiopian MiG 23
fighter-bombers and to have captured its pilot; Ethiopia confirmed
the downing.
	   A source in the Ethiopian Foreign Ministry said his forces had
shot down an Eritrean MiG over northeastern Ethiopia on Friday and
troops had taken the pilot into captivity. At the same time, he
denied that Eritrea had downed any of its planes Friday.
	   A source familiar with the Eritrean Air Force, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said Ethiopia clearly was trying to wipe
out Eritrea's small force, which consists of a half-dozen aging
Soviet-era MiG fighter-bombers.
	   Ethiopia's army also outnumbers Eritrea's 40,000-strong force by
about three to one.
	   Ethiopia said its Friday bombing raid on the same airport was in
retaliation for an Eritrean air attack on Mekele, 125 miles (200
kilometers) north of Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital. At least
44 Ethiopian civilians were killed and 135 wounded in Mekele,
according to government-run Radio Fana.
	   Also Saturday, across the continent in Ouagadougu, the capital
of Burkina Faso, foreign ministers from the Organization of African
Unity urged Ethiopia and Eritrea to refrain from the use of
violence. The growing conflict will likely dominate talks between
OAU heads of state during meetings that begin Monday.

South Korean president meets U,N. chief RECAPS previous for some points to UPDATE with more details.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Arriving on his first trip to the United
States since taking office, South Korean President Kim Dae-jung
briefed U.N. officials Saturday on plans for improving links to
communist North Korea.
	   The two countries have remained technically at war for a half
century.
	   Following a 45-minute meeting with Secretary-General Kofi Annan
and other U.N. officials, a U.N. statement said Kim ``focused on
relations between the two Koreas and on the new policy (of South
Korea) aimed at the development of peaceful relations between the
two states.''
	   The statement said Kim ``explained at length the steps being
taken with that objective in mind and the plans which he has for
facilitating this process.''
	   U.N. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Kim and
Annan also reviewed the situation in South Asia in the wake of last
month's nuclear tests by India and Pakistan.
	   Before Kim arrived, the Security Council condemned the tests and
called on both countries to cease further testing and weapons
development. U.N. officials also have expressed concern that South
Asian testing might encourage North Korea to roll back on pledges
not to develop nuclear weapons.
	   The U.N. statement gave no details about Kim's plans for
improving ties with the North. A state of war remains in effect
since a 1953 armistice ended fighting in the Korean War.
	   Before leaving Seoul, however, Kim said South Korea would
support any moves by the United States to promote political and
economic detente with North Korea.
	   ``As was shown in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe,
the engagement policy of the United States and the sunshine policy
of the new South Korean government will be more effective for North
Korea,'' he said Friday.
	   He was expected to elaborate on that theme in Washington next
week when he meets with President Bill Clinton and addresses a
joint session of Congress. Under the Trading With the Enemy Act,
U.S. companies are prohibited from doing business with North Korea.
	   Kim, who took office last February, was a longtime opposition
figure who spent 7 1/2 years in prison or house arrest and four
years in exile under a succession of military dictators.
	   Those credentials could help encourage a reduction in mutual
hostility between the rival states.
	   After meeting with Annan, Kim attended a reception at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art, which opens an exhibition of Korean art
next week.
	   He was to meet Sunday with Korean-Americans and receive an award
from the International League for Human Rights for his contribution
to civil liberties.
	   On Monday, he will address the Council on Foreign Relations
before traveling to Washington.

Porsches in control at halfway stage of Le Mans race 
</HEADLINE>
By ANDREAS EVAGORA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LE MANS, France (AP) - Porsche was closing in on its third
consecutive Le Mans triumph at the halfway point of the famed
endurance race Sunday morning, with two of its factory models well
ahead of the field.
	   After 12 hours of the race, a Porsche GT1 driven by Alan McNish
of Britain and France's Laurent Aiello and Stephane Ortelli was in
the lead, with 181 laps.
	   The car was less than one lap ahead of another Porsche, driven
by Jorg Muller and Uwe Alzen of Germany and France's Bob Wolleck.
	   In third place, on 178 laps, was the Nissan R390 driven by John
Nielsen, Franck Lagorce and Michael Krumm.
	   Less than a lap behind, in fourth, was the first prototype, the
Courage C51 driven by Didier Cottaz, Marc Goosens and Jean Philippe
Belloc.
	   But at the halfway stage it was Porsche, which dominated Le Mans
in the 1980s with seven straight wins, that seemed set for its 16th
overall race win and third victory in succession.
	   During the day, the race was contested in hot, dry conditions.
	   But thirty minutes before the halfway stage, rain started to
pour over the Le Mans course.
	   With the race being contested in darkness, teams were forced to
make a tough decision between using full wet or intermediate tires.
	   As the rains came, McNish completed a lap on slick tires before
the car changed to full wet tires and colleague Aiello took over.
	   ``It was a difficult decision to make between the two types of
tire,'' McNish said as he left his car. ``Whatever we do is a risk
because we can't see the clouds and so can't predict how long this
rain will last.''
	   A Toyota GT1 driven by Martin Brundle posted the fastest lap at
the halfway point.
	   Brundle's time of 3:41.809 in lap three was the fastest since
the course was slightly redesigned before last year's race.
	   But it was a Nissan R390 GT1 that was the closest challenger to
Porsche.
	   Nissan's good run included a triple stint from Franck Lagorce
through the late afternoon during which he completed 38 laps.
	   ``I was only scheduled to drive for two stints but I was
enjoying myself so much that I didn't want to get out of the car,''
Lagorce said. ``The car was exactly as we wanted.''
	   By midrace Sunday morning, 11 of the 47 starters had pulled out
of the race, including two cars each fielded by Mercedes and BMW.
	   After a good start, Mercedes driver Bernd Schneider, the fastest
driver in practice, was forced to withdraw within an hour, after a
steering pump led to an engine failure.
	   ``I thought we had a good chance to finish after all our good
testing results, where we didn't have any problems,'' Schneider
said. ``To retire after one hour is really disappointing.''
	   Mercedes was shaken by a second withdrawal when Jean Marc Gounon
had to pull out of the race with steering problems.
	   BMW also leaves this year's Le Mans disappointed.
	   Both its cars were pulled out within four hours because of a
loss of grease on wheelbearings.
	   ``This loss of lubrication would have eventually led to a wheel
bearing seizing up and this was too high a risk to take,'' said
Gabriele Rafanelli, BMW's race director.

Andrews take second-round lead 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Donna Andrews is threatening to rain on Annika
Sorenstam's parade.
	   Andrews, who began the day at even par, shot a 6-under-par 66
Saturday to take a two-stroke lead over Sorenstam, the first-round
leader and defending champion in the rain-shortened LPGA Michelob
Light Classic.
	   After an opening 67, Sorenstam said the 6,337-yard (5,792-meter)
Forest Hills Country Club is like her home course. She is looking
to win the event for the third time in four years and she entered
the second round with a one-shot lead, but finished with a 73.
	   Andrews took advantage by making birdies from No. 11 through 14,
then making a 6-foot putt for birdie on No. 18 for a back nine of
31.
	   ``I really didn't hit the ball that great,'' Andrews said. ``I
mean, I hit 17 greens, so when I missed a shot, I still kept it on
the green. But I just got hot with my putter on the back side. I
was hitting my putts really solid and hitting them right where I
wanted to. As long as I had the speed right, they seemed to be
going in.''
	   Caroline McMillan and Cindy Figg-Currier were tied for third at
3-under 141. Amateur Marisa Baena, Sara Hallock and Lori West were
four strokes back.
	   Despite finishing over par on Saturday, Sorenstam feels she is
still playing well enough to win for the first time this year.
	   ``Yesterday was probably the best I've played in a long time,''
she said. ``Today, I was really happy with the way I was striking
the ball. I had one bad swing on No. 1, but other than that, I was
putting for par on every single hole.''
	   Andrews, a six-time winner, won the Longs Drugs Challenge in
April. She was not thinking about winning this event until she hit
the back nine Saturday.
	   ``I didn't really look at the leaderboard until I made the turn.
I made the turn at one under and was actually surprised to see that
one under was on the leaderboard,'' she said. ``I thought, `If I
could go out and shoot a couple under on the back side, I'd be
right in this thing.'''
	   But Sorenstam will not be easy to beat.
	   ``I know I can do it on this course. I've done it before,'' she
said. ``Today could have been a good round if I would have made
some putts. Hopefully, tomorrow I'll hit the ball the same and I
will make the putts. I think that will be difference.''
	   The 21-year-old Baena, who just finished her junior year at
Arizona, is attempting to become the first amateur to win an LPGA
tour event since JoAnne Carner won the Burdines Invitational in
1969.
	   ``Tomorrow is going to be really interesting because today, I
putted so good, and yesterday, I didn't,'' said Baena, who followed
Friday's round of 69 with a 73. ``I'm kind of excited to see (what
happens) tomorrow. My putting is so much better and I think that
gives you confidence.''
	   Sorenstam said that the fact that Baena is an amateur is
irrelevant.
	   ``Obviously, she's playing well and that's what I look at. I
want to beat the players that are playing the best this particular
week. Whether she's an amateur or not doesn't mean anything.''

Stevens spoils Real Quiet's Triple Crown bid AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By RICHARD ROSENBLATT
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Gary Stevens finally won his Belmont Stakes _ a
year late for Real Quiet's trainer Bob Baffert.
	   Stevens came up three-quarters of a length short of winning the
Triple Crown aboard Baffert's Silver Charm last year. On Saturday,
Stevens spoiled his buddy's second bid for a triple when he rode
Victory Gallop to a narrow nose victory over Real Quiet in the
1.5-mile (2.4-kilometer) Belmont.
	   ``My heart goes out to the connections of Real Quiet,'' Stevens,
who took over the mount on Victory Gallop for the Preakness, said.
``I know what it's like to come up short like that.''
	   Indeed he does.
	   After winning the Kentucky Derby and Preakness aboard Silver
Charm in '97, Stevens thought he had racing's first Triple Crown
since Affirmed in 1978. But Touch Gold caught Silver Charm in the
deep stretch for the upset. This time, it was Stevens and Victory
Gallop who caught a tiring Real Quiet at the wire.
	   ``We said we'd let Real Quiet make his move, and he opened up
and was winning with authority at the eighth pole,'' Stevens said.
``We just got wound up, split horses and saw daylight, and he threw
me back in the saddle.''
	   But Stevens still wasn't sure if his second ride aboard Victory
Gallop would end in victory.
	   ``I felt confident we could pick him up in the closing
strides,'' Stevens said. ``I didn't know I had him until we hit the
finish line, but I had no idea. I knew it was very, very close.''
	   In the stretch, Real Quiet drifted out and bumped Victory
Gallop. Stevens told the outriders he wanted to put a ``hold'' on
the race and the stewards' inquiry sign flashed on the toteboard.
	   After a five-minute, 41-second delay, Victory Gallop was
declared the winner and trainer Elliott Walden, walking on crutches
because of a fractured right ankle sustained in a basketball game
last week, finally celebrated.
	   In the Derby, Victory Gallop ran second to Real Quiet with Alex
Solis aboard, and Walden insisted his colt could have won if he
didn't have to go five wide on the turn.
	   Stevens, meanwhile, was aboard Baffert's Derby favorite, Indian
Charlie, who finished third. When Baffert declared Indian Charlie
out of the Preakness, Walden quickly hired Stevens.
	   ``When you have a jockey like that, you go for him,'' Walden
said at the time.
	   Baffert's response was, ``It's not jockey racing, it's horse
racing.''
	   But Stevens, who won his first Belmont in 1995 aboard Thunder
Gulch, has to get a lot of credit for outdueling Real Quiet's
jockey Kent Desormeaux down the stretch.
	   ``I don't feel I'm the spoiler,'' said Stevens, who returns to
ride Silver Charm next week in the Stephen Foster Handicap at
Churchill Downs. ``I had one interest, and that was to win the
Belmont. I had no interest in the Triple Crown.''
	   That was last year.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Both sides in a strike by Air France pilots on
Sunday showed a willingness to begin new talks aimed at ending the
walkout ahead of the World Cup.
	   Airline officials said Saturday evening that they were in
contact with the pilots about resuming negotiations but that no new
talks had yet been set. Prime Minister Lionel Jospin also said
Saturday the government was prepared to intervene but no concrete
proposals have yet emerged.
	   Talks between Air France and the pilots were suspended Saturday
after the pilots walked out of negotiations.
	   The pilots appeared divided about new talks, with the head of
the main pilots' union indicating a new round could take place
Monday and a spokesman saying they could resume over the weekend.
	   Both sides were under pressure to end the strike from the
government, worried about France's image and embarrassed by the
strike, which has threatened to tarnish the world soccer
championship that opens Wednesday.
	   Air France is the official World Cup carrier and is committed to
transporting the teams from one venue to another.
	   The pilots were protesting pay cuts planned by Air France, which
is currently restructuring and needs to free up capital to
modernize the company and its planes.
	   Talks between Air France management and the striking pilots
broke off Saturday after all night negotiations.
	   The stumbling blocks remained planned salary cuts and an Air
France proposal to give pilots stock in exchange for the pay
reductions, as well as a two-tier pay scale in which younger pilots
earn less.
	   During the day, Jospin met with the head of Air France, as well
as his finance and transport ministers. He said the French
government was ready to help end the strike, and there have been
suggestions the government may name a mediator.
	   The World Cup will take place ``normally,'' Jospin said.
``French people don't need to take a plane to attend the World Cup.
Nor do Europeans, and we are going to find a lot of airline
companies to transport the rest at the expense of Air France.''
	   Jean-Cyril Spinetta, the Air France president, said there had
been ``very positive advances'' in the talks.
	   The pilots appeared more pessimistic, with a leader of one of
the smaller unions saying Air France's proposals were unacceptable.
	   Only about 25 percent of Air France's flights were expected to
take off Sunday. Meanwhile, a train strike disrupted provincial
service and service was expected Sunday in some areas.
	   Once the air strike ends, Air France says it will take three
days for service to be restored fully to normal.

Tale of grateful goldfish turns true for Bosnian family

<TEXT>
	   JEZERO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Every Bosnian child knows the
story of a poor woman who caught a golden fish, released it and in
return gained wealth and happiness. It's a Balkan fairy tale _ but
it turned into reality for one poor family.
	   ``What happened here is beyond good luck, it really is a
fable,'' said Admir Malkoc, reflecting on how his fleeing relatives
freed two goldfish and were repaid hundredfold.
	   The 150 Muslim families in Jezero, a northwestern village
surrounding a lake, lived a quiet life before the Bosnian war _
except for holidays, when the men returned from jobs in western
Europe loaded with presents.
	   In 1990, Smajo Malkoc came back from Austria with an unusual
gift for his teen-age sons, Dzevad and Catib: an aquarium with two
goldfish.
	   Two years passed, and war arrived. As Bosnian Serb forces
advanced on Jezero, the women and children fled and the men tried
to resist.
	   Malkoc was killed. When his wife, Fehima, sneaked back into the
destroyed village to bury her husband and take what remained of
their belongings, she spotted the fish in the aquarium.
	   She let them out into the nearby lake. ``This way they might be
more fortunate than us,'' she recalls thinking.
	   Fast forward to 1995. Ms. Malkoc returned with her sons to
Jezero to find ruins, nothing left from the idyllic past except
memories.
	   Eyes misting over, she turned toward the lake and glimpsed
something strange. She came closer _ and caught her breath.
	   ``The whole lake was shining from the myriad golden fish in
it,'' she said. ``I had to think of my husband, it was something he
left me that I never hoped for.''
	   During the years of killing all around the lake, life underwater
had flourished. After their return, Ms. Malkoc and her sons started
feeding the fish and then selling them.
	   Now, homes, bars and coffee shops in the region are replete with
aquariums containing fish from Jezero _ some pure gold, others with
black and white spots like the original pair Malkoc brought.
	   The two boys are grown and Ms. Malkoc is the proud grandmother
of a 10-month-old daughter. The Malkoc house, rebuilt from ruins,
is one of the biggest in the village. Two new cars are parked in
front, and the family says it has enough money not to worry about
the future.
	   ``It was a special kind of gift from our father,'' Dzevad Malkoc
said.
	   Even in winter, when the ice is thick enough to skate on the
lake, the fish survive, although ``earlier it was impossible to
keep them even in a home aquarium without a heater,'' Malkoc said.
	   Some grow as big as 2 kilos (4.5 pounds) and some have two tails
_ more proof for the villagers of something magical.
	   Other residents are welcome to catch and sell the fish. But most
defer to the Malkocs.
	   ``They threw the fish into the lake,'' said a villager who
identified himself only by his last name, Veladzic. ``It's their
miracle.''

Beirut fears losing its sectarian balance in municipal polls 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Polls open at 0400 GMT
By HUSSEIN DAKROUB
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The danger of losing this capital city's
sectarian balance was at stake in Sunday's municipal elections.
	   Prime Minister Rafik Hariri has appealed to voters not to ignore
candidates from the Christian minority when they elect a new city
council for this city of Sunni Muslim majority.
	   ``Let's maintain the national balance and give mutual
coexistence top consideration when voting,'' said Hariri, a Sunni
Muslim who has endorsed a slate of candidates that includes
Christians, Sunnis and Shiite Muslims.
	   Beirut, the city where the civil war of 1975-90 began, elected a
half-Muslim, half-Christian council in its last local elections 35
years ago. But the city's demography has since changed in favor of
the Muslims.
	   A similar shift has occurred in the northern city of Tripoli,
which on May 31, in the second stage of the four-stage polls,
reduced its Christian minority to a mere one member on its council.
	   Christian politicians have voiced fears that their sect will
similarly become marginalized in Beirut's elections.
	   With the memories of the civil war in mind, Muslim clerics
joined Hariri in urging their followers not to be too partisan in
their voting in Beirut.
	   In the other part of the country voting on Sunday, the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah and the pro-Syrian Amal parties are vying
for the votes of southern Lebanon.
	   All attempts to get the two Shiite groups to agree on a joint
ticket failed.
	   Hezbollah, whose guerrillas are the most active opponents of the
Israeli occupation of part of southern Lebanon, hopes the polls
will consolidate its claim to lead the 1.2 million Shiites, the
country's largest single sect.
	   No elections will be held in the zone which Israeli troops and
their Lebanese militia allies have controlled since 1985 to try to
prevent guerrilla attacks on northern Israel.
	   The municipal polls, widely seen as extending democracy after
the civil war, began in Mount Lebanon province on May 24. They are
scheduled to end in the eastern Bekaa Valley on June 14.

Mexican senators threaten to call off meeting with U.S. counterparts 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexican senators are threatening to cancel a
meeting with their U.S. counterparts this month unless the U.S.
Senate majority leader apologizes for criticizing Mexico's
president.
	   The conflict is over a U.S. money-laundering sting dubbed
``Operation Casablanca'' in which U.S. agents made dozens of
arrests and seized millions of dollars in drug profits.
	   After first praising the operation, Mexican officials _
including President Ernesto Zedillo _ have condemned it, saying
U.S. undercover agents appear to have operated in Mexico without
the government's knowledge. Sting operations are illegal in Mexico.
	   Mexico has lodged a formal protest with the United States.
	   In a letter made public Friday, American Sen. Trent Lott told
Zedillo the criticism contrasted with the pledges the president had
made about how he intended to crack down on drug kingpins.
	   ``It should be welcomed by all governments interested in
combating those who profit from trafficking in illegal narcotics,''
Lott wrote.
	   Mexican senators from all three major parties condemned the
letter as insulting, Mexican news media reported.
	   Mexican senators will vote Tuesday on whether to cancel the
Interparliamentary Meeting with U.S. lawmakers.

Japan seen extending new aid loan to Malaysia: report 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan will likely agree to a request from Malaysia
to resume economic assistance, four years after the Southeast Asian
nation accepted what was to be its last Japanese aid loan package,
a local newspaper said Sunday.
	   Malaysia has requested the aid, which is expected to total
several billion yen (dlrs several tens of million) in loans,
because his country has been hit hard by a region-wide economic
crisis, the Yomiuri newspaper reported, citing unnamed government
sources.
	   On Friday, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who
visited Tokyo earlier in the week, said he expected to get dlrs 1-2
billion worth of loans in Japanese yen.
	   During his stay in Japan, Mahathir criticized Western-based
financial aid institutions such as the International Monetary Fund
for being insensitive to Asian people.
	   Japan has long been an important donor to Malaysia, but in 1994
the Malaysian government indicated it would no longer require
Japanese aid loans, citing difficulties in repaying borrowed yen
due to the rapid appreciation of Japan's currency.
	   In recent months the yen has weakened dramatically, falling to
six-year lows against the U.S. dollar.

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ The alternative rock group Filter grinds out
a gritty version of Three Dog Night's ``One'' on ``The X-Files''
movie soundtrack. But for this sci-fi hit, the magic number is
really four.
	   That's how many albums have been produced by the film and TV
versions of ``The X-Files,'' including two movie soundtracks
released last week _ one with songs, the other with Mark Snow's
creepy score, fleshed out for the movie with an 85-piece orchestra.
	   It's testimony not only to the success of ``The X-Files,'' which
hits theaters June 19, but to the explosive popularity of movie
music, led in recent times by the ``Titanic'' album, a huge success
with 25 million discs sold worldwide.
	   ``We are in the longest continuous cycle of successful
soundtrack releases we've ever had since the modern era dawned with
'Saturday Night Fever' (in 1977),'' said Glen Brunman, who heads
the industry leader, Sony Music Soundtrax. It has the soundtracks
for the summer event movies: ``Godzilla'' and ``Armageddon.''
	   Movie soundtracks have always been popular, especially musicals
like ``The Sound of Music'' and ``South Pacific,'' and many have
produced hit singles: ``Moon River,'' ``Theme From a Summer
Place,'' ``All the Way,'' among them. Some of the biggest selling
soundtrack albums have included ``Purple Rain,'' ``The Lion King,''
``The Bodyguard'' and ``Saturday Night Fever.''
	   Theories abound as to why soundtracks are selling so well today,
be it better music, bigger movies or just momentum. Even more
puzzling is the reason behind the popularity of orchestral scores.
	   Composer agent Richard Kraft suggested that audiences are
cooling to the cynicism and grunge of pop and are looking for an
old-fashioned emotional rush.
	   ``I think people are increasingly becoming tired of (musicians)
who are too cool for the room,'' said Kraft. ``'Titanic' really
tapped into people's desire for emotional connection. People are
craving emotional, instrumental music.''
	   The question is when will it all cool down. For the moment,
nobody seems to know; they're too busy selling records.
	   The ``Titanic'' album followed the 20 million-selling ``The
Bodyguard'' soundtrack. Other recent multimillion sellers include
the soundtracks for ``City of Angels,'' ``Forrest Gump,'' ``Men in
Black'' and ``Sleepless in Seattle.'' And television has cashed in
on the wave; the ``Ally McBeal'' album debuted at No. 7 on the
charts.
	   ``The X-Files'' isn't the only movie with multiple soundtracks.
DreamWorks' Christmas release, the animated feature ``Prince of
Egypt,'' will have three soundtracks, including the traditional
disc with music from the movie and two soundtracks ``inspired by''
the film _ one with country music, the other rhythm and blues.
	   The huge sales have both padded the wallets of already
successful recording artists who contribute songs, and sent the
salaries of movie score composers soaring. The best can now command
dlrs 1 million per film or more.
	   James Horner, who did the ``Titanic'' score, could make as much
as dlrs 30 million, industry sources estimated, with additional
money rolling in from his movie score albums for ``Deep Impact''
and the upcoming ``The Mask of Zorro.''
	   Indeed, the fact that movie composers can even get their own
albums, as opposed to a couple of throwaway tracks on a songs disc,
speaks to the public's appetite for film music, observers say.
	   ``Film composers who sort of toiled in the background in their
dark little rooms have gotten the recognition they are due,'' said
Kraft, whose Kraft-Benjamin Agency clients include Danny Elfman
(``Batman,'' ``Men in Black'') and Elmer Bernstein (``The Ten
Commandments,'' ``Devil in a Blue Dress'').
	   But the success has brought complaints, particularly from some
studio executives in this semi-cost-conscious era in Hollywood,
whose worries about dlrs 10 million to dlrs 20 million actors are
suddenly compounded by dlrs 1 million composers. Record companies,
too, are facing increased costs for production, rights and
promotion.
	   But all this, explained Sony's Brunman, is just basic economics.
	   ``There is no doubt in the world of soundtracks, like all other
worlds, the law of supply and demand rules,'' he said. ``There is a
tremendous demand now for soundtracks, a tremendous demand for
artists to do those soundtracks and tremendous demand for great
composers with great scores. So the prices go up.''
	   Another problem is that the increasingly expensive soundtracks
can be riskier than regular recordings since they're often one-shot
deals instead of record franchises by artists with fan bases.
	   And as the number of soundtracks increases _ 36 expected this
summer _ the talent supply is running thin, said David Was, who
shares executive producer credits on the ``X-Files'' albums with
the show's creator, Chris Carter.
	   Was can rattle off stories of big-name groups trying to unload
B-side material onto movie soundtracks, and laments it's getting
increasingly harder to find new artists or established groups that
haven't already committed to other soundtracks.
	   ``There's no fresh kill around to put in your knapsack,'' he
said.
	   Not that this problem has slowed things down _ yet.
	   ``The record companies are in a fever now with soundtracks,''
said Was, ``and they'll continue to be until the one hit doesn't
pay for the eight misses. And maybe that may never happen. It'll
(continue) until you somehow run out of bands to put on these
things.''
	   For composers like Snow, the 51-year-old veteran of the TV music
trade with credits that include ``Hart to Hart'' and ``Crazy Like a
Fox,'' the current climate couldn't be better, for he knows there's
no formula and the success may not last.
	   ``The first thing you have to think about is the movie, and how
it works,'' he said. ``You have to serve the movie first, and if
you're lucky enough _ and it's really luck when the thing takes off
as a record _ it's beautiful.''

Olivia Newton-John turns to Nashville for music comeback 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NASHVILLE, Tennessee (AP) _ Olivia Newton-John sits at a table
at MCA Records, scanning the sales chart of a music industry trade
magazine.
	   ``I'm looking for hopeful signs,'' she says with a smile.
	   Newton-John, now 49, is riding a wave of publicity from the
re-release of the movie ``Grease'' and she is promoting her first
new album in five years. She's hoping the Nashville-recorded songs
on ``Back With a Heart'' will reconnect her with the country
audience that embraced her earliest hits.
	   Newton-John continues her search of the charts, and she is up
front about being a little out of the loop when it comes to the
current music scene. Things have changed since the days of ``Have
You Never Been Mellow?'' or ``Please Mr. Please.'' Her last run of
hits, including ``Physical,'' came in the 1980s.
	   Looking at the top-selling 200 albums in the country, she admits
she doesn't recognize some of the artists.
	   ``The Dave Matthews Band? Don't know them,'' she says. K-Ci and
Jojo and Savage Garden draw blank stares, but she highly recommends
Italian singer Andrea Bocelli.
	   Then she smiles. ``It's nice to see all these girls doing well,
and country singers, too.'' She names them _ Shania Twain, Faith
Hill, LeAnn Rimes, Trisha Yearwood, Martina McBride. All are
selling briskly.
	   ``Back With a Heart'' straddles the fence between modern country
and diva ballads that wouldn't be out of place on a Celine Dion or
Whitney Houston album. It showcases Newton-John's own songwriting,
which she has been cultivating the past few years.
	   She wrote all the songs on her last album, ``Gaia: One Women's
Journey,'' about her 1992 bout with breast cancer.
	   Most of the songs on ``Back With a Heart'' were co-written with
Nashville songwriters, including Victoria Shaw, Chris Farren and
Gary Burr. There's one ringer on the record _ a remake of her 1974
hit, ``I Honestly Love You,'' with backup vocals by Babyface. It's
the first single from the album.
	   ``With all these remakes going around, I was scared to death
someone would get to it before me,'' Newton-John said. ``It's just
a great song.''
	   The highlight on the new album is ``Fight for Our Love,'' a
dramatic ballad that is a worthy successor to ``Hopelessly Devoted
to You'' from ``Grease.''
	   Though better known for her movie career and pop hits,
Newton-John does have a track record in country music. Many of her
soft-rock hits in the 1970s crossed over to country and she was
voted female vocalist of the year by the Country Music Association
in 1974.
	   At the time, some in Nashville resented that an outsider from
the pop world could invade the country charts. Newton-John says she
was barely aware of the criticism at the time.
	   ``I've since heard about it like it was all that was going on at
the time, but what I remember is Dolly (Parton) and Loretta (Lynn)
and others being so open and welcoming,'' Newton-John said.
	   In fact, Newton-John and John Denver foreshadowed country
music's rise to prominence in the 1990s. Their country-tinged hits
of the 1970s are suspiciously close to the suburban country sound
that Nashville used to quadruple its sales two decades later.
	   ``When I wanted to make an album, I wondered where I might fit
in,'' Newton-John said. ``Country seemed the obvious choice.''

Atlanta breezes past Baltimore in interleague play 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: will be updated
<TEXT>
	   BALTIMORE (AP) _ Bobby Cox didn't have to sweat out his 1,000th
victory as manager of the Atlanta Braves.
	   Javy Lopez homered in a four-run first inning against Mike
Mussina and the Braves breezed past Baltimore 10-5 Saturday, their
first win against the Orioles in five interleague games over two
years.
	   Cox became the 19th manager in major-league history to win 1,000
games with the same team. He also moved within five victories of
becoming the winningest manager in franchise history _ Frank Selee
won 1,004 with the Boston Braves from 1890-1901.
	   Lopez went 4-for-5 with four RBIs and Kevin Millwood (8-2)
allowed four runs and five hits in 6 2-3 innings for the Braves.
	   Mussina (4-3), activated from the disabled list before the game,
struck out 10 but gave up eight runs and eight hits in 4 2-3
innings.
	   It was Mussina's first appearance since May 14, when he had his
nose broken by a line drive off the bat of Cleveland's Sandy
Alomar.
 &UR; Mets 1, Red Sox 0 &QC; 
	   At Boston, Tim Wakefield allowed one hit in eight innings, but a
disputed balk call cost him the game.
	   Bobby Jones (5-3) and John Franco combined on a four-hitter for
the Mets, who after hitting four homers in a 9-2 win on Friday, got
just two but handed the Red Sox their second shutout in four days.
	   Wakefield gave up just one walk, to Brian McRae starting the
sixth. That began the chain of events that led to New York's second
straight win after a three-game losing streak.
	   Bernard Gilkey followed the walk by striking out, but McRae
stole second and took third on Olerud's groundout.
	   With Butch Huskey at the plate, McRae took several steps toward
home plate, drawing the attention of Wakefield, who apparently had
started his windup and then stopped.
	   Jones struck out four and walked three in eight innings. Franco
put the tying run in the ninth before striking out O'Leary for his
13th save.
 &UR; Cubs 7, White Sox 6 &QC; 
	   At Chicago, pinch-hitter Derrick White hit his first homer in
five years and Sammy Sosa hit his ninth in eight games for the
Cubs.
	   The Cubs went in front 6-5 on White's two-run homer in the sixth
inning, a 410-foot (125-meter) shot that was his first homer since
1993 when he played for Montreal.
	   Sosa hit his 18th homer, a solo shot, into the center-field
bleachers in the seventh to make it 7-5.
	   Kevin Tapani (8-3) gave up five runs and eight hits in six
innings. Rod Beck allowed an RBI single to Frank Thomas in the
ninth before getting Albert Belle to ground into a double play for
his 16th save.
	   Scott Eyre (1-6) gave up six runs _ four earned _ and six hits
in six innings. He walked two and struck out six.
 &UR; Yankees 4, Marlins 2 &QC; 
	   In New York, Ramiro Mendoza limited Florida to three hits in 7
1-3 innings and Bernie Williams hit a three-run homer, leading New
York to its sixth straight victory. The Marlins have lost 10
straight.
	   Mendoza (4-1) took a two-hitter into the eighth before Ryan
Jackson led off with a single and Gregg Zaun walked with one out.
Graeme Lloyd relieved and gave up an RBI double to pinch-hitter
Dave Berg.
	   Lloyd then struck out Dunwoody and Jeff Nelson came on and
retired Edgar Renteria on a comebacker. Mariano Rivera pitched the
ninth for his 12th save.
	   Paul O'Neill extended his hitting streak to 14 games for the
Yankees, who improved to 24-5 at home. Jesus Sanchez (3-2) took the
loss.
 &UR; Phillies 10, Blue Jays 6 &QC; 
	   At Toronto, Doug Glanville hit two home runs and Rico Brogna
homered to snap a seventh-inning tie, leading Philadelphia past
Toronto.
	   Glanville, who leads the NL with 27 multi-hit games, hit a solo
homer in the third and added a two-run shot in the seventh for his
first career multi-homer game. Brogna's 10th homer broke a 5-5 tie
as the Phillies scored five runs in the seventh to win their fifth
straight road game.
	   Wayne Gomes (5-2) relieved Phillies starter Mark Portugal and
picked up the victory with 2 2-3 innings of relief. Juan Guzman
(3-7) took the loss.
	   Tony Fernandez and Carlos Delgado homered for the Blue Jays.
 &UR; Dodgers 10, Mariners 6 &QC; 
	   At Seattle, rookie Paul Konerko's first major league homer
snapped a sixth-inning tie as Los Angeles beat Seattle.
	   Ken Griffey Jr. hit his AL-leading 23rd homer for the Mariners.
	   Konerko, who had four RBIs, gave the Dodgers their first win in
four games in Seattle since interleague play began last season when
he lead off the sixth with a 431-foot shot off Bobby Wells (0-1) to
break a 6-6 tie.
	   Jim Bruske (3-0) pitched three scoreless innings of relief for
the victory, and Antonio Osuna worked the last two innings for his
second save.
 &UR; Athletics 10, Diamondbacks 5 &QC; 
	   In Oakland, California Kevin Mitchell went 3-for-4 with two RBIs
and Oakland scored five runs in the fifth inning off Arizona's Andy
Benes to win its third straight game.
	   Mike Oquist (3-3) won his third straight start, allowing three
runs and six hits in seven innings. Jason Giambi went 2-for-3 and
drove in two runs when Oakland pulled away with a four-run seventh
inning.
	   Benes dropped to 4-6.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ This music takes you places ...
	   To a corner of the rain forest, where a hummingbird hovers
beside a droplet-laden petal. To an immense sea, where rhythm is
measured by the lapping of waves on blushing sand. To a lofty
mountain, where a whispering wind wakes the pines.
	   A force in the guitar world at 30, Assad (pronounced Ah-SAHj)
has won prizes and critical acclaim in Europe and the United States
for her impressive fingerstyle, snappy lines and harmonically and
texturally complex material.
	   Now, with the release of her fourth album, ``Chameleon,'' which
industry insiders are touting as one of the freshest musical
offerings in years, more than just guitar buffs are listening to
Assad's mood-compelling music.
	   ``As far as most of the world is concerned, Brazilian music got
stuck in the 1960s _ bossa nova, Gilberto Gil, Caetano Veloso,''
Assad says in her native language, Portuguese. ``Well, it didn't
get stuck. There's a whole new generation of Brazilian musicians
out there, and I'm part of it.''
	   The first Brazilian to record with a major American label _
Polygram _ since the end of the 1964-1985 military dictatorship,
Assad creates her revolutionary sound by cross-pollinating pop,
classical, jazz, flamenco, African and Brazilian styles.
	   On ``Chameleon,'' she adds an earthy texture by using gold and
wood flutes, the Australian didgeridoo, a string quartet, acoustic
bass and a battery of percussion devices, from Peruvian llama
hooves to deer-skinned ``Taos'' drums. What emerges is a style so
original that classifying it seems pointless _ though listeners
sometimes try.
	   ``I don't want to be confined to some marketing category like
world music, pop, jazz, or whatever,'' Assad says in a speaking
voice much like her clear and honeyed singing voice. ``My music
tries to break down walls between man, music, nature and
spirituality. It doesn't fit inside any one box. It fits into many
boxes.''
	   The root of Assad's music is a classical fingerstyle, a
technique so mastered that, even during her most intense
crescendos, her fingers seem to flutter over the nylon strings like
butterflies.
	   She may, at any time, turn the guitar into a percussion
ensemble, tapping or knuckling the body with one hand while playing
a bass line with the other. She also generates rhythmic sounds by
slapping, whacking and striking her nose, throat and cheeks.
	   ``People say, 'Why is this woman beating her face?''' Assad
says. And then she giggles. ``But many people make sounds using
their faces. I've just put them together into music. The human
voice is the richest instrument. We haven't begun to explore all it
can do musically. I never feel ashamed when I'm exploring.''
	   The ``sonic journey,'' as she calls it, began for Maria Angela
Assad at age 13 in Rio de Janeiro. Her father, Jorge, a clock
repairman who made extra money playing ``bandolim'' _ a Brazilian
mandolin _ had enlisted Assad's older brothers, Sergio and Odair,
to accompany him on guitar at parties and restaurants.
	   ``'You can't do this, you're a girl,' my father told me,'' Assad
recalls. ``He was used to having the boys play with him. So I
taught myself the guitar, because I thought my brothers got his
attention because they played. I thought, this is how I will touch
my father.''
	   Her mother soon nicknamed the slight teen-ager with the full
mane of bouncy, black curls ``Badi'' (pronounced BAH-Jee) _ magical
lion. Says Assad: ``There's some of that in my personality _
fighting for the right to follow what's inside you, not being
afraid to show who you are.''
	   Months later, Assad moved with her parents to Sao Joao da Boa
Vista, an outback in the farming belt around Sao Paulo. Her
brothers stayed in Rio to study classical music _ they've become a
world-class concert duo _ so Assad took up the duty of playing
alongside her father.
	   The rugged country around Sao Joao da Boa Vista, with its
waterfalls, ravines and forest-draped hills, had an impact on the
slight, shy teen-ager. Today, she derives the energy to compose
from ``the soul of nature, be it the wings of a butterfly, the
surge of the tide, the force of the wind.''
	   Assad shuns electronic instruments in her recordings. ``The idea
is to make the connection that must exist between humans and Earth.
The acoustic instruments give you the vibration, the depth, the
soul of the Earth.''
	   At 17, Assad returned to Rio to study classical music. Soon she
was performing alongside Pat Metheny, Dori Caymmi, Hermeto and
Milton Nascimento and winning awards, including best Brazilian
guitar player at the International Villa-Lobos Festival. ``I wanted
to be like my brothers, so I spent 15 hours a day playing guitar.
But I studied the technical aspects of guitar too much. I lost the
heart of the instrument.''

NEW YORK: the instrument.''

	   That realization struck her during a bus ride to Chile, where
she was to represent Brazil in a competition. Actually, she did the
striking. ``I don't know why, but all of a sudden I just smashed my
hand, mechanically, against the side of the bus and it swelled up
into a knot. At that precise moment, I knew that I had been given a
warning from a greater force.''
	   She played at the contest, then dropped out of college, took
private acting and voice lessons and married a Sao Paulo
businessman who was almost 30 years her senior. In 1989, her
husband asked her to make a record so he could give copies to his
employees as Christmas gifts. From this sprang ``Danca dos Tons''
(``Dance of Sounds''), her first album.
	   Assad divorced several years later, but the records kept coming:
She released ``Solo'' in 1994, ``Rhythms'' in 1995, and ``Echoes of
Brazil'' in 1996. Along the way she developed mouth percussive
techniques and African ``polyrhythms.''
	   ``Somewhere inside of me I've got Africa,'' she says. ``The
songs, the rhythm, the smells, the soul. I listen to so much
African music _ Lokua Kanza from the Congo, for one _ that it has
to come out of me somehow.''
	   Sony liked the new sound and offered her a multimillion-dollar
contract _ with a catch: The company wanted to market her as a pop
singer. She refused. ``It was like asking me to sell my soul,'' she
says.
	   Assad says maintaining the integrity of her music is the goal,
not fame.
	   ``Artists are not here to get famous,'' she says. ``You are at
the service of something greater, a greater meaning. When you are
on stage you are a reflection of the light in the audience. You are
not THE light.''

The who, what, when, Weir, and why of `The Truman Show' 
</HEADLINE>

By DOUGLAS J. ROWE
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Peter Weir talked to his agent and anyone else
who would listen about coming up with a solid screenplay.
	   ``Let's look under the carpet, get people to open their bottom
drawers, send me things that are really in poor shape, rather than
something green-lit with an actor attached, because they're often
bland, because they've gone through all the processes,'' the
53-year-old Australian director told his agent.
	   ``I said `Tell the studios and producers that they don't need to
offer me something that's ready to go. I'm happy to look at things
that might need a year's work on them.' At least I might find
something interesting.''
	   One person who listened to Weir was Scott Rudin. The producer of
such films as ``In and Out,'' ``Ransom'' and ``The First Wives
Club'' sent him ``The Truman Show,'' written by Andrew Niccol
(``Gattaca''). Weir was impressed with the originality of the story
about a man whose entire life is telecast as a hugely popular
24-hour-a-day TV show _ unbeknownst to its 30-year-old star, Truman
Burbank.
	   Weir says the only way he could begin thinking about the movie
was to imagine ``Who could be Truman?''
	   ``You just can't even begin without having that face in your
mind,'' he said. ``And I thought it had to be a star, because that
was part of the logic why they watched the show all this time.''
	   Only three actors came to mind in 1995 when he first started
casting about: Tom Cruise, Tom Hanks and Brad Pitt. Then Rudin
suggested Jim Carrey, who rose to stardom with the ``Ace Ventura''
movies, ``The Mask'' and ``Dumb and Dumber'' but came a cropper in
``The Cable Guy.''
	   Weir was intrigued by the idea of the pet detective becoming the
True Man of his Kafkaesque concoction because he considers Carrey
``a brilliant comic, up there with Chaplin and Keaton.''
	   ``I always thought of him as a sort of silent star, because he
would have been a star in that era. It wasn't dependent on verbal
dexterity, dialogue.''
	   But Weir wondered what success had done to Carrey, whose films
have exceeded dlrs 1 billion at the box office worldwide.
	   ``Is he the same guy? I sensed this recklessness about his work.
Is that something that he just used to catapult him into the arena?
And now he's had success, he may be conservative in his approach.
And I needed someone who's absolutely fearless.''
	   Carrey allayed Weir's fears once they met.
	   And Weir says he never thought twice about how Carrey's track
record mainly consisted of comedy.
	   ``I know my film history,'' Weir says, noting that Charlie
Chaplin moved from being the Little Tramp into drama. ``Who would
ever have wished that he stayed in one-reel comedies?''
	   He came across a film titled ``Doing Time on Maple Drive,'' in
which he felt Carrey did a fine job in a serious role. And he says
he didn't fret about casting Carrey because it was not a
conventional film.
	   ``This man was meant to be unknowing,'' Weir said. ``He didn't
know he was being photographed, didn't know he was performing. So
there were no rules. We could just make the rules up. So any
limitation in his ability I could handle by doing it another way.''
	   If Weir succeeds, this would be the fourth time he has directed
a transformational role for an actor who previously was seen as
limited.
	   Mel Gibson became more than the road warrior Mad Max in the 1981
war movie ``Gallipoli''; Harrison Ford showed he could be more than
a ``Star Wars'' warrior in ``Witness,'' the 1985 cop thriller/love
story, and, as Weir himself notes, Robin Williams soared from his
stand-up persona as the teacher in 1989 in ``Dead Poets Society.''
	   ``They were looking for change,'' Weir says about all three
actors. ``It's quite exciting when someone's looking to break out
of their mold, their safe area. If they're willing to take a risk,
it's a form of energy really. To generalize, you can find that it's
like they're making their first movie. And I love that. I love that
feeling of double or nothing.''
	   Now Carrey is getting raves and magazine covers _ as if he now
has the heft of a Hanks.
	   Weir, whose two children are grown now and who still lives in
Sydney with his wife, realized the marketing department might have
a big job on their hands, selling an offbeat movie with Carrey, but
that was their job.
	   ``My job was to make a film that people want to see,'' he says.
``Then you think if it's a good movie, people will go. `If you
build it, they will come.'''
	   Still, Weir concedes that two factions have to be sold on this
movie: Carrey fans who might not want to see him in a dramatic role
and serious moviegoers who might not want to see Carrey, period.
	   ``I hope we haven't fallen between the bar stools.''

Ethiopian jets bomb airport, outskirts of Eritrean capital

	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ With a border dispute escalating into
bombing raids, hundreds of foreigners were trying to scramble out
of Eritrea on Sunday, fearing it will be engulfed in war with
Ethiopia. One of their main escape routes came under attack for a
second straight day.
	   Ethiopian jets again bombed a military-civilian airport not far
from Asmara on Saturday, forcing embassies to step up their exit
plans.
	   American, Italian, German and British planes ferried foreigners
out of harm's way late Saturday after Ethiopia agreed to
temporarily halt bombing.
	   Weary expatriates crowded the airport parking lot, waiting for
evacuation flights. Angered and confused by the sudden violence in
this capital of broad boulevards and modern buildings, no one
wanted to talk about his decision to go.
	   ``In principle, this is the last of the evacuations, but in
practice, if someone wants to leave we'll try to help,'' said
French Ambassador Louis Le Vert.
	   Eritrean rebels were instrumental in helping the Ethiopian
People's Revolutionary Democratic Front overthrow a 17-year
military regime in July 1991, and Eritrea gained independence from
Ethiopia in 1993.
	   But the two countries dispute at least six areas along their
common border, which was drawn by Italy after it conquered Eritrea
in 1885.
	   Relations between the one-time allies soured when Eritrea
introduced its own currency in November in an effort to reassert
its independence, triggering a trade war. Eritreans began streaming
to the common border to take up the fight.
	   Late Saturday, foreign diplomats met with Ethiopian Prime
Minister Meles Zenawi in Addis Ababa and received a pledge that
Ethiopian warplanes would suspend their bombing of the airport from
Saturday evening until Sunday morning so evacuations could take
place, Italian Ambassador Marcello Ricoveri said.
	   Afterward, German military aircraft carrying 210 Europeans took
off for Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, the German Defense Ministry said. And
a British air force plane picked up the remaining 40 Britons and
about 60 Australian, Canadian and South African nationals and took
off for Jeddah, the British Defense Ministry said.
	   Le Vert said two U.S. and two Italian planes also carried
foreigners from Asmara to neighboring Djibouti, but he didn't know
how many people were aboard.
	   When the U.S. planes arrived, Marines jumped out and deployed
into combat position, startling Eritreans working at the airport,
which was under a cease-fire.
	   Earlier Saturday, a plane with 194 people aboard arrived in
Frankfurt, Germany.
	   The number of foreigners still waiting to be evacuated from
Eritrea, wedged between northern Ethiopia and the Red Sea, was not
known.
	   With the attacks on Asmara's airport, a quick resolution to the
crisis appeared unlikely.
	   ``At the moment, I'm not seeing any light at the end of the
tunnel,'' Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki told reporters.
	   There was no word on casualties from Saturday's bombing, but
Eritrea claimed to have shot down one of the Ethiopian MiG 23
fighter-bombers and to have captured its pilot; Ethiopia confirmed
the downing.
	   A source in the Ethiopian Foreign Ministry said his forces had
shot down an Eritrean MiG over northeastern Ethiopia on Friday and
troops had taken the pilot into captivity. At the same time, he
denied that Eritrea had downed any of its planes Friday.
	   A source familiar with the Eritrean Air Force, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said Ethiopia clearly was trying to wipe
out Eritrea's small force, which consists of a half-dozen aging
Soviet-era MiG fighter-bombers.
	   Ethiopia's army also outnumbers Eritrea's 40,000-strong force by
about three to one.
	   Ethiopia said its Friday bombing raid on the same airport was in
retaliation for an Eritrean air attack on Mekele, 125 miles (200
kilometers) north of Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital. At least
44 Ethiopian civilians were killed and 135 wounded in Mekele,
according to government-run Radio Fana.
	   Also Saturday, across the continent in Ouagadougu, the capital
of Burkina Faso, foreign ministers from the Organization of African
Unity urged Ethiopia and Eritrea to refrain from the use of
violence. The growing conflict will likely dominate talks between
OAU heads of state during meetings that begin Monday.

Painters looking at Beijing's restless urbanites 
</HEADLINE>

By RENEE SCHOOF
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Like any gritty metropolis, Beijing gives its
citizens plenty to fret about. Job security, low rents and the
city's historic elegance are vanishing, while traffic, pollution
and consumerism intensify.
	   Liu Qinghe and Chen Shuxia, husband and wife, are painters in
their 30s who are taking a fresh look at chaotic urban life in
China.
	   Liu, one of the country's leading young artists, uses
traditional Chinese ink and wash _ the centuries-old medium in
scroll paintings of mountains and villages _ to paint pictures of
city people.
	   The original use of an old form makes Liu unusual among
contemporary Chinese painters.
	   Chinese artists today take for granted the freedom they have had
for more than a decade in choosing styles and subjects.
	   Until the late 1970s, socialist realism in support of the
government's political aims was the rule. Today, only pornography
and works that overtly call for the downfall of China's communist
leaders are off-limits.
	   Once Chinese painters got the freedom to experiment, many began
to imitate well-known modern Western painters.
	   Liu started out rejecting the Chinese painting he learned as a
child because its traditional subjects seemed irrelevant. He
studied Western oil painting in art school in the 1980s, but
decided he wasn't any good at it.
	   ``After I graduated, I realized that Chinese things suited me
better,'' he said in an interview in his office at the Central
Academy of Fine Arts, a room just big enough for a bed, books, a
desk and an easel.
	   Liu's style of painting modern urban themes in bold ink lines
and soft ink washes has proved a success. He spent a one-year
residency at the Royal Academy of Fine Art in Madrid in 1992. Since
then, his paintings have sold to collectors around the world.
	   In ``Evening Breeze,'' recently shown at the respected Red Gate
Gallery in Beijing, where Liu is represented, two young women _ one
in shorts and a tight knit top, the other in a chemise and floral
skirt _ sit on the thick cement posts of a chain barricade, staring
out to sea. Pale orange undertones tint the sky, the reflection of
the water, the stone slabs on the ground.
	   As in many of Liu's works, the poses and expressions suggest
unease. In the background, a man with wide, wild eyes stares away
from the women, toward the viewer.
	   One critic, Li Shaowen, described Liu's works as telling
``ordinary stories happening in the metropolitan city, in a tone as
calm as the writing of Chekhov, as if he is leading the viewers
away from the steamy downtown into a small area of shade...''
	   Liu said his work is intended to examine the struggles of urban
people.
	   ``They have a feeling of urgency pressing on them,'' he said.
``They're more educated and worldly than Chinese in the
countryside, but that doesn't make them more relaxed. It just
leaves them overworked and rundown.''
	   ``Hardly anyone in Beijing these days is at peace,'' adds Liu's
wife, Chen Shuxia, who is somewhat more serious and quiet than her
fast-talking, jovial husband.
	   In Chen's ``Bright Sunshine,'' a man and a woman sit at a small
outdoor cafe table under a white umbrella, each looking solemnly in
different directions, each _ much like Liu and Chen themselves _
wearing simple, modern clothes that would fit in anywhere.
	   Liu said he and his wife are careful to avoid critiquing each
other's paintings because as a couple they have so much emotional
influence over each other. They share many basic likes and dislikes
about painting, including a distaste for political art.
	   Liu says politically inclined art, even when it is meant to
tweak the government, still seems akin to the rigidly
propagandistic works of the ultra-leftist 1966-76 Cultural
Revolution.
	   ``I don't think there's any need to paint political works,'' Liu
said. ``I'm not interested in it. My paintings, and Chen Shuxia's
too, are peaceful.''
	   Both Liu and Chen lament Beijing's worsening air pollution and
the loss of its traditional architecture, which has been replaced
with a jumble of boxy high-rises.
	   They live with their 7-year-old daughter on the edge of the
city, still in the pollution and sprawl but far enough from the
center that, Liu says, ``you can hear the pigs snorting if the
night is quiet.''
	   ``We both like tranquility. We don't get involved in politics,
and we don't think about the business end of painting very much,''
Chen said.
	   ``We put a lot of energy into protecting a tranquil state of
mind. That way, when I'm finished with a painting, if I can't sell
it today, I'm still willing to paint tomorrow.''

Lyle Waggoner, trailer baron _ lives to spoil Hollywood's stars 
</HEADLINE>

By JEFF WILSON
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Lyle Waggoner always knew he was a better
businessman than an actor.
	   The former regular on ``The Carol Burnett Show'' would seem the
poster child for a dashing Hollywood leading man. He's tall, tan
and lean with a thick head of gray hair.
	   Instead, the 63-year-old Waggoner works behind the scenes
pampering today's hot stars with elite Star Waggons, an outfit he
founded in 1980 that is now Hollywood's leader in temporary housing
for celebrities.
	   ``Our job is to spoil the actors,'' Waggoner said from his
4-acre (1.6-hectare) operation in the Sylmar area of the San
Fernando Valley in California. Waggoner uses a computer to design
the trailers. He picks out all the interior fabrics and
furnishings.
	   Star Waggons' trailers are dispatched to studio lots and
location shoots to keep ever-finicky celebrities pleased. John
Travolta had three of them shipped to Paris for a movie. NBC's
``ER'' series keeps Star Waggons for entire seasons. In fact, there
are 40 to 45 of the trailers at the Warner Bros. studio lot in
Burbank year-round.
	   ``We do everything we can to make them happy,'' Waggoner said,
noting there are sometimes custom orders. ``Everyone knows it's my
company, and they know they can count on this equipment. It's
clean, everything works and we have the quantity.''
	   Star Waggons provided a swivel TV stand for Travolta, switched a
trailer Jaclyn Smith got ``bad vibes'' in, covered mirrors at
Steven Spielberg's request and raised a toilet so 7-foot (2-meter)
basketball sensation Shaquille O'Neal's knees wouldn't hit his
chin.
	   ``Teri Hatcher on 'Lois and Clark' wanted a dinette area removed
and a makeup area and desk put in instead. We made all those
changes for her and she was happy,'' Waggoner said.
	   When the trailers are returned to Sylmar, they are changed back
to the way they were. Those trailers usually come back in good
shape ``since they don't sleep in them or cook in them,'' Waggoner
said.
	   ``Oh, sometimes you get an actor who has a fit and puts his fist
through a door or something. But that's it,'' he added.
	   Despite the boxy, bland exteriors, these luxurious trailers
provide creature comforts unseen in most homes: satellite
television, surround sound, VCRs, microwaves, hydraulic makeup
chairs, blackout drapes, three-way full-length mirrors, electric
organs and exercise equipment.
	   ``Heather Locklear walked into the Mega Star and said, `This is
nicer than my living room,''' Waggoner said. ``They are just
totally comfortable.''
	   He has 200 trailers in 17 models ranging from a basic two-room
at dlrs 600 a week to the Diamond, Super Star and ultradeluxe
40-foot (12-meter) Mega Star at dlrs 1,200 a week. Each model is
exactly the same _ for a specific reason.
	   ``This is an ego-based business,'' Waggoner said. ``This way,
none of the actors can feel less important than anyone else. They
are upholstered with the same fabrics, things that would appeal to
almost everybody.
	   ``If they are the same, the stars don't have anything to
complain about. ... But if the microwave goes out, they are
screaming.''
	   Still, little things can mean a lot to a star in the insecure
environs of Hollywood.
	   ``We once sent out what we thought were equal motor homes for
two lead actors and there was a complaint: one had hubcaps and one
had painted wheels. The actress said she wanted hubcaps like her
co-star or she wouldn't work.''
	   Who was that?
	   ``I could tell you, but I won't,'' Waggoner said.
	   Waggoner has even had some stars show up at his Sylmar
headquarters to examine the trailers where many of them will spend
up to 15 hours a day.
	   ``We'll even drag them to a (star's) house for show and tell,''
he said. ``We just took one to Pamela Anderson, who has a series
coming up, to look at one. It's all a game.''
	   Waggoner takes pride in having a hand in the evolution of
celebrity pampering.
	   ``Spoiled? Are they ever,'' Waggoner said. ``A lot of the credit
goes to us, though.''
	   ``I used to go on location and sit outside in a canvas chair
with a fold-down counter as a makeup station,'' said Waggoner, who
has abandoned acting (``Well, I still have an agent''), except for
an occasional cameo role. ``Now we have these 40-foot (12-meter),
eight-station electronic slide-out rooms with surround sound and CD
players.''

Old Algonquin hotel is new again 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ ``Look at him, a rhinestone in the rough.''
	   Immortal words? Maybe. Cruel, certainly. And for those with a
literary bent, unmistakably from the golden age of the Algonquin
hotel, a time when the country's brightest literary lights gathered
for drinks and never-ending turns of phrase.
	   With a dlrs 5.5 million makeover, the new owners of the
venerable 96-year-old hotel hope to recapture the flavor of those
long hours spent at the famed Round Table and market them to
customers seeking a taste of times past.
	   ``Every successful hotel tries to find and identify a niche that
separates it from the competition,'' said Ian Lloyd-Jones, a Briton
and president of the Atlanta-based Camberly Hotel Company, which
bought the Algonquin last year.
	   ``Most hotels try to do it with the fine dining room or the
spa,'' he said. ``Here, the engine that drives the hotel is
intelligent entertainment.''
	   In its heyday in 1920s and '30s, Dorothy Parker, Robert
Benchley, James Thurber and their cleverer-than-thou crowd of
writers, artists and journalists spent lunches and evenings besting
one another's witticisms, nursing drinks and collecting anecdotes
that often ended up in print.
	   But those years were over before the end of World War II. With
several recent movies and books celebrating those days, the owners
sought to recapture a sense of the group's style.
	   The Round Table _ where Parker (responsible for the ``rhinestone
in the rough'' toss-off) and pals like Alexander Woollcott, George
S. Kaufman and Harold Ross gathered nightly to trade gibes and
jokes in the 1920s and '30s _ has become the centerpiece of the
dark and cozy lobby.
	   But like much in the hotel, the dark wooden table is a replica,
not the original.
	   ``We've tried to stay true to the traditions,'' Lloyd-Jones
said. ``This does look like it's back in the '30s. It doesn't look
like it was just renovated.''
	   Designers pored through turn-of-the-century photos of the hotel,
refurbished antique chairs and put together wallpaper patterned
with cartoons from The New Yorker magazine, several of them poking
fun at famous Algonquin characters.
	   While they saved a version of the Round Table, the new owners
eliminated the old Rose Room, the hotel restaurant where the
literary crowd ate, drank and talked.
	   Still, the hotel on West 44th Street, between Times Square and
Grand Central station, remains devoted to the written word and the
art of talking.
	   Once, when the hotel hired musicians to play a cocktail party, a
guest complained, Lloyd Jones recalled. When the music stopped, the
guest said, ```Listen. What do you hear?'
	   ``I said, `A lot of conversation.' He said, `That's the music of
the Algonquin.' And a light bulb went off.''
	   Camberly, which bought the Algonquin from the Aoki Corp., hopes
to capitalize on the hotel's history by inviting authors for public
readings and holding classical music performances.
	   Richard Hubert of Atlanta has been coming to the hotel with his
wife, Linda, since the 1960s precisely because it reminds him of an
era gone by.
	   ``Hotels are big commercial things these days, and they whisk
you in and out of the lobby,'' he said. ``You come in here and sit
down and have a drink, and they treat you in a civilized manner.''

Five questions with Scott Bairstow: a young hunk and old soul AP Television Writer 
</HEADLINE>
AP Photo NY457
By LYNN ELBER
<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ If Scott Bairstow, at 28, seems to have a
touch of the old soul about him, consider this: He's been a working
actor since childhood, has been married four years and has a young
son.
	   That knowing quality was most recently on display in
``Significant Others,'' the short-lived Fox series that apparently
went a little too heavy on youthful angst for TV viewers.
	   Bairstow, however, was appealing as ever. His talent and hunky
blond looks have won him roles in the films ``White Fang 2: Myth of
the White Wolf,'' ``The Postman'' and ``Wild America,'' and on
television in ``Lonesome Dove: The Series'' and the movie, ``Two
for Texas.''
	   He also had a memorable guest role on an early episode of ``The
X-Files'' as an ill-fated faith healer.
	   The Canadian native grew up on a farm _ ``more of a hobby farm,
a big garden,'' he says _ in Steinbach, Manitoba. There was a
family tradition of artistic creativity: father Doug is the
longtime principal oboist with the Winnipeg Symphony, and mother,
Diane, was a cellist until arthritis forced a career switch to
family counseling.
	   ``They really raised me to be a free spirit, which I think
facilitated my choices,'' said Bairstow. He started his career on
the Canadian children's show, ``Let's Go.'' He first gained notice
here in the 1993 TV movie, ``There Was a Little Boy.''
	   He and his wife, Marty, are raising 3-year-old Casey in suburban
Seattle, away from the smog and congestion of Los Angeles. And away
from the heart of the entertainment industry, a fact that doesn't
worry Bairstow.
	   ``I've been doing it (acting) since I was 10 and doing it
professionally in the States since I was about 20,'' said Bairstow.
The soft-spoken actor seems confident _ but not cocky _ that he can
keep his hand in.
	   1. On ``Significant Others'' you played Henry, a talented writer
who's made a living writing racy stories for the Internet. Are you
an online junkie?
	   Bairstow: I have a 3-year-old son who's smarter than me. I want
to wait until there's a little more control on the Internet or I
have a little more knowledge of how to control it so my son's not
open to seeing things I wouldn't want him to at this age.
	   2. The ``Significant Others'' character was unsettled and unsure
of what he wanted. Is it fair to say you're someone who isn't
reluctant to make decisions?
	   Bairstow: I haven't shied away from commitments. It's just sort
of life for me. I guess God puts things on your plate and you've
got to choose whether or not you're gonna eat them. I haven't spit
anything out yet.
	   3. Why did you decide so young to become an actor?
	   Bairstow: I can't even remember deciding. It's like it's always
what I've done, starting early, being in plays in grade four or
even before then. ... I think a true actor is just an actor. I
mean, I haven't gone to school for it, it's just inside of me, I
think. An undeniable thing. I just thank God I realized it at a
young age.
	   4. What's it like being a dad?
	   Bairstow: Awesome. People ask me, 'Did you ever think you were
going to be a dad?' And I'd say, 'Yeah, I did.' Because I see
myself as a parent. But I didn't know what I was talking about. I
really love it. It's like if you cut off your arm and had it walk
around; it's the same kind of thing.
	   5. Given your dedication to your family and career, it seems
that when people talk about Gen X, they're not talking about you.
	   Bairstow: Well, I'd like to think they are. I'd like to think
the face they painted on Gen X isn't as true as they like to think
it is. That's just a bunch of people in suits saying, 'Here's this
generation that doesn't care about anything and thinks society owes
them.' I just don't think that's correct.

	   In Cincinnati, the Cleveland Indians evened their intrastate
series in front of a rare Cincinnati sellout crowd as Jaret Wright
held the Reds to two hits over eight innings and Sandy Alomar drove
in three runs.
	   The gate of 51,796 represented the Reds' first non-opening day
sellout since Aug. 6, 1994. Tens of thousands of Indians fans
turned Cinergy Field into Jacobs Field South as Cleveland got a
milestone win for Mike Hargrove.
	   Cleveland's ninth victory in 12 games improved Hargrove's
managing record to 571-477, moving him ahead of Al Lopez for third
place on the Indians' career wins list. He trails Lou Boudreau
(728) and Tris Speaker (616).
	   Wright (5-3) won his fourth straight start. Chris Stynes had the
only two hits off the right-hander _ a single in the fourth and an
inside-the-park homer in the sixth. Cleveland piled up six runs on
nine hits in only 4 2-3 innings off Mike Remlinger (3-7).
 &UR; Expos 7, Devil Rays 5 &QC; 
	   In St. Petersburg, Florida, Rolando Arrojo was set to become the
majors' first nine-game winner Saturday night when Montreal scored
three runs in the eighth inning for a comeback victory over Tampa
Bay.
	   Brad Fullmer and Rondell White had RBI singles, and Mark
Grudzielanek hit a run-scoring groundout in the eighth as the Expos
won their fourth straight. Reliever Matt Ruebel (0-2) gave up
Fullmer's hit before closer Roberto Hernandez came in and allowed
the RBIs to White and Grudzielanek.
	   Vladimir Guerrero hit a three-run homer and Chris Widger homered
in the ninth for Montreal. Anthony Telford (3-2) pitched 1 2-3
scoreless innings and Ugueth Urbina worked the ninth for his 14th
save.
 &UR; Astros 6, Royals 0 &QC; 
	   In Houston, Jose Lima pitched a five-hitter for his first career
shutout and Craig Biggio hit a two-run homer, leading Houston past
Kansas City.
	   Lima (7-2) walked one, struck out seven and got his first career
complete game in his 134th start. The right-hander didn't allow a
runner to reach third until the fifth inning when Jermaine Dye
reached on an infield hit and went to third on Lima's wild pickoff
off throw to first.
	   Biggio hit his eighth homer off Jose Rosado (1-5) in the third
and had a two-out RBI single in the fifth. Carl Everett highlighted
a three-run Houston sixth with a two-run single.
 &UR; Tigers 9, Brewers 3 &QC; 
	   In Milwaukee, Bryce Florie pitched seven strong innings against
his former team as Detroit beat Milwaukee to snap a six-game losing
streak.
	   Florie (4-1), making his first start against the team that
traded him at the end of last year, allowed eight hits and two
runs.
	   Tony Clark had a homer and two doubles and Billy Ripken drove in
three runs for Detroit. Bob Hamelin also homered for the Brewers.
	   Scott Karl (5-3), gave up 11 hits and five runs in 4 2-3

America: One big TV show, and all the extras you'll ever need 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ``When I look at the television, I want to see me starin' right
back at me.''
	   _Counting Crows
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; By TED ANTHONY &QC; 
 &UR; AP National Writer &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Truman Burbank of ``The Truman Show'' might be
considered one lucky man. His ``life'' is unequivocal,
choreographed _ and utterly safe. Television birthed him, nurtured
him and watches over him. Television, quite literally, makes his
sun rise.
	   Now here's the rub: While Truman (Jim Carrey) strives to escape
TV-land and reach the real world outside, we in the ``real world''
are busy struggling to escape to television's fantasy world.
	   ``The Truman Show'' and real life, in diametrically opposite
ways, both demonstrate that the lines between television and
reality are blurring. Like the new Peter Weir movie, the whole
world's becoming a soundstage.
	   Everywhere in real life, there is a video camera. Not just the
security cameras trained perpetually on office elevators, automated
teller machines, the aisles of discount stores and elsewhere,
recording and preserving countless disposable moments. Not just
JenniCam, in which anyone wanting a voyeuristic glimpse into a
narcissistic twentysomething's boudoir simply needs to type in an
Internet address.
	   It goes far deeper. In the 1990s, neighbor films neighbor,
parent films child, child films pet, all for entertainment _ and
perhaps for that chance at the nationwide candid camera that Allen
Funt conceived and ``America's Funniest Home Videos'' anointed.
	   Live TV only augmented that. It showed Oswald taking Ruby's
bullet, Bobby Kennedy taking Sirhan Sirhan's bullet, demonstrators
being beaten by Chicago police and Neil Armstrong moonwalking. The
Challenger exploded in real time; O.J. led a slo-mo police chase
and the choppers filmed from above.
	   Camcorders hit the shelves and reality became king _ Rodney King
_ as would-be filmmakers caught everyday activities and horrors on
film. Now Dave Letterman's best comedy involves a camera and the
unexpected reactions of random people on the street. Fox serves up
``When Animals Attack,'' ``America's Deadliest Police Chases'' and,
yes, ``America's Deadliest Swarms.'' And of course we have Jerry
Springer _ faux verite, let's call it. All are symptoms of the same
syndrome: Americans want to be on television, and ``real''
Americans want to watch other ``real'' Americans on TV.
	   ``We've become bored with watching actors give us phony
emotions,'' says the megalomaniacal director Christof (Ed Harris)
in ``The Truman Show.'' And he's right on target. The addiction to
fiction has been replaced by a zeal for the real.
	   When Truman finally does communicate with Christof, he asks the
understandable question: ``Was nothing real?''
	   ``You were real,'' the director replies. ``That's what made you
so good to watch.''
	   Americans want not only to consume their narratives, but to
participate. So we blur. People tape their party, then have another
party to watch the video. Tourists roam Manhattan's streets with
camcorders, shooting moving pictures of motionless buildings.
Princess Diana, one of the nearest things the world has ever had to
a Truman, was, publicly, the star of a show _ her life. When she
died, Weir says, ``the show really was over.''
	   That's not all. MSNBC _ a legitimate news organization _ appears
as a fictional doppelganger of itself in the movie ``Deep Impact,''
dutifully chronicling Armageddon. Sundry senators guest-star on
``Murphy Brown.'' Geraldo mimics his own show on the ``Seinfeld''
finale. The real becomes the fictional. And the reverse. ``Gopher''
from ``Love Boat'' and ``Cooter'' from ``The Dukes of Hazzard''
emerge from show business to become congressmen. Ronald Reagan
serves two terms as president. ``This Is Spinal Tap,'' made as a
movie parody, leads to a Spinal Tap tour _ and more than one album.
The fictional becomes the real.
	   Dizzying.
	   In the end, Christof smites Truman but also loves him _ like a
god. Truman's deity is literally TV. He is Job, enduring anything
and everything for the God of Give the People What They Want. He's
the opposite of Chauncey Gardener in ``Being There.'' Gardener was
perfect for the 1970s: Reality was too much, so he became
television. For Truman in 1998, television is now the standard _
the default _ and reality is the goal.
	   But Truman (``True Man'') Burbank (the city in California where
many TV shows are taped), trying to escape a patterned existence,
neglects the ultimate solution: simply sitting around and doing
utterly nothing. No audience would stand for that.
	   Consider two final thoughts. The first is, once again, from
Christof. ``I have given Truman the chance to lead a normal life.
The world _ the place YOU live in _ is the sick place,'' he says in
the film. ``Ultimately, Truman prefers his cell.''
	   Now listen to Debbie Zanbrano, a Pennsylvania resident whose
town was struck by a particularly violent storm a few days ago. She
was watching CBS-TV's ``Touched by an Angel'' when the town's fire
whistle blew.
	   ``I thought, `This is like TV,''' she said. ``Then the winds
woke me up and got me to move.''
	   So maybe that ``Truman Show'' world isn't so far away.
Television is our frame of reference to reality, and now reality is
becoming our programming staple. We're filming our lives, raw and
self-aware, and we're putting them on television. We like our cell,
and we're decorating it to fit our needs.
	   But in the end, in many ways, it's still a locked room.

	   In the spotlight: Keenen Ivory Wayans, living colorfully.
	   Buff, sleek and shaved like a cue ball, Keenen Ivory Wayans is
the trailblazer for one of the funniest clans in show business _
described half-jokingly as the black Osmond family.
	   Wayans' parents were strict disciplinarians and the Wayans kids
soon learned to provide their own entertainment.
	   ``Everything was a joke,'' he recalled. ``If you got a whippin',
when you got back to the table, you heard nine other people doing
impressions of your screaming.''
	   Wayans studied engineering at Alabama's Tuskegee University and
dabbled in stand-up comedy before collaborating with filmmaker
Robert Townsend and comedian Eddie Murphy.
	   Together with brothers Leon, Damon and Marlon, the family teamed
up in 1990 to create the groundbreaking Fox TV hip-hop variety
show, ``In Living Color.''
	   By 1992, Wayans, who turns 40 June 8, feuded with Fox over
creative and financial issues. He quit the Emmy-winning show. He
next concentrated on films, with roles in ``I'm Gonna Git You
Sucka,'' ``The Glimmer Man'' and ``Low Down Dirty Shame.''
Audiences hooted at his spoofs of racial and sexual stereotypes.
	   In August 1997, Wayans tried to win over mainstream audiences as
host of a syndicated late-night series for Disney's Buena Vista
Television. But the show didn't last.
	   ``When you're on the outside looking in, these talk shows don't
appear to be the monsters that they are,'' Wayans said. ``I've
gained much greater respect for the guys that have been doing it
for 10, 15 years.''
	   Last year, he starred in, wrote and produced ``Most Wanted,''
the story of a Marine sniper forced to serve on a team of macho
thugs and professional maulers out to kill the first lady.

	   ``Twistin' in the Wind'' (MCA) _ Joe Ely
	   ``Twistin' in the Wind'' opens with a great dramatic flourish,
``Up on the Ridge,'' a tremendous song of epic scope and epic
guitar playing. Flamenco guitarist Teye gives it a sense of
melodrama, Jesse Taylor contributes stinging leads and Lloyd Maines
adds knifelike steel guitar. Ely is a Texan with a gift for story
songs and a flair for adding the flavors of the border to his
music, and like many other musicians from his state, he mixes
country with rock and Mexican influences into a rich, rootsy blend.
	   All those strains are apparent on ``Twistin' in the Wind,'' from
the Spanish-tinged ``Queen of Heaven'' to the rollicking ``Nacho
Mama.'' The guitars that mark ``Up on the Ridge'' keep up the
joyful noise throughout, with Mitch Watkins and David Grissom also
getting in on the fun. Ely is making some noise this summer with
the reunion of the Flatlanders, his old band with Butch Hancock and
Jimmie Dale Gilmore, but this terrific album shows just how
powerful he is on his own.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``Far From Perfect'' (Watermelon) _ Duane Jarvis
	   This unassuming little disc has enough grit and soul to restore
your faith in rock 'n' roll. Duane Jarvis drapes a pop veneer atop
a rootsy, twangy core on ``Far From Perfect,'' ending up with the
kind of album the Rolling Stones might have made before they
started to stink.
	   Jarvis, who has played guitar with such luminaries as John Prine
and Lucinda Williams, shows himself an able songwriter as well as a
deft guitarist, creating a dozen fine, rockin' tunes for ``Far From
Perfect.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``Flores'' (Xenophile/Green Linnet) _ Conjunto Cespedes
	   Propulsive rhythms, stirring horns, churning percusson and the
glorious vocals of Bobi Cespedes make ``Flores'' a dazzling album
of Afro-Cuban music. If you can sit still during this, consult a
physician. Sensual and funky, earthy and exotic, ``Flores'' is a
find.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``One Shoe Left'' (Snake River) _ Ben Winship
	   About the only thing separating Ben Winship from the rest of
acoustic music's royalty is geography. He's in Idaho, which is
pretty far off the Austin-Nashville axis. But Winship's deft
mandolin playing and solid songwriting make him an
off-the-beaten-track sparkler. ``One Shoe Left'' is a relaxed
album, the kind of music a bunch of talented friends sitting around
the porch might make. Luckily for us, they had the tape rolling.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``The Ex-Husbands'' (Tar Hut) _ The Ex-Husbands
	   Some alternate-country bands seem to be longing for a bucolic
time that never was. The Ex-Husbands seem to be longing for the
honky tonk of their dreams. There's ``I Have a Ball,'' about
falling off the wagon, ``Tequila, Salt and Lime'' and ``Country
Speed,'' which would be a hit on radio if radio played good music.
	   The Ex-Husbands rock like cowpunks, but seem a little more
country-oriented than some of their alternative country colleagues.
Anders Thomsen shows he can write about more than just booze, too,
making this debut, which just snagged national distribution, worth
seeking out.

At the Movies: `Truman Show' AP Television Writer

By FRAZIER MOORE
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ ``The Truman Show'' is one magnificent show.
Inventive and riveting, it shows us more than the adventures of an
unlikely champion. It shows us ourselves _ what we viewers have
become in the TV age.
	   The film could have been a dreary mess. It might have been a
heavy-handed allegory too smart for its own good as it railed
against the blight of television. Just note that its hero is named
Truman (true man) Burbank (the city most identified with television
production).
	   Besides, there was always the danger that Jim Carrey could run
amok.
	   No problem. A carefully non-comedic Carrey plays Truman right in
tune with the film's air of anxious ordinariness.
	   And thanks to director Peter Weir and Andrew Niccol, who wrote
the screenplay, ``The Truman Show'' turns out to be more than the
satire it might have settled for. It is also a bracing blend of
``Love Story,'' ``The Great Escape'' and ``Invasion of the Body
Snatchers.''
	   Even so, Truman Burbank earns a place alongside Howard Beale,
the anchorman-mad prophet of the 1976 broadside ``Network.''
Meanwhile, a number of lines from ``The Truman Show'' prove the
equal of Beale's ``I'm as mad as hell and I'm not gonna take it
anymore'' rant against TV:
	   ```The Truman Show' is a lifestyle.''
	   ``I think I'm mixed up in something.''
	   ``Everything on the show is for sale.''
	   And, of course, ``Cue the sun!''
	   Besides the title of the film, ``The Truman Show'' refers to the
round-the-clock TV show Truman has unwittingly spent the entire 30
seasons _ er, years _ of his life headlining. He's a world-class
celebrity, yet doesn't have a clue that out there watching him are
millions of viewers hooked on his saga of reassuring blandness.
	   Truman's life unfolds in what appears to be the pristine,
sun-kissed Florida community of Seahaven. He shares a charming home
with lovely, radiant Meryl (Laura Linney), a nurse at the local
hospital. And he heads off every morning for his job selling
insurance to protect his fellow townspeople against life's
uncertainties that, unbeknownst to him, don't exist.
	   That's because, in truth, Seahaven is a huge studio set on a
colossal sound stage, with 5,000 hidden cameras (Lawn Cam, Curb
Cam, Wedding Ring Cam) poised to capture Truman's every move.
Everyone Truman knows is an actor playing a supporting role to him,
each taking direction from the executive producer Christof (a
superb Ed Harris), who monitors Truman's behavior from a vast
control center.
	   In short, what Truman considers normal, and what his viewers
embrace as their ideal for normality, is actually a magnificent
contrivance. It's ``Candid Camera'' from womb to tomb. A 24-seven
soap opera.
	   The audience members couldn't be happier. Recurrently we see
them watching ``The Truman Show'' from bathtubs, couches, bar
stools. Whereas 22 years ago, Howard Beale's disciples were furious
over television's impact, these viewers are placid spectators
looking on while Truman lives life as their surrogate. They sure
aren't mad, and they're gonna take it and keep taking it.
	   But here's the hitch: Truman finally begins to get suspicious.
He begins to get the weird feeling that he's being watched. He
catches a behind-the-scenes glimpse of stagehands in what's
supposed to be an office building. He observes that passers-by do
the same things over and over, like extras in a TV scene.
	   All this adds urgency to Truman's underlying dissatisfaction.
Even after 30 years of being conditioned to look no further than
the shores of Seahaven, he can't still his longing to break out.
	   ``I want to see some of the world, be an explorer,'' says
Truman, proposing a holiday to his wife.
	   ``This will pass,'' she coos.
	   But what if it doesn't? Truman is the driving force of a vastly
profitable enterprise, not only from its huge viewership, but from
product placements and other ancillary income (Truman is an
inadvertent product spokesman). So how will he ever gain release?
	   Now comes the Truman Showdown. In a rousing sequence, he sets
off in a sailboat that happens to be named the Santa Maria. He is
after freedom and a long-dreamed-of romance. And like Christopher
Columbus, he believes the world is round.
	   But whether the world is round on TV's ``Truman Show'' is
another matter, as its slogan teases viewers with the question,
``How Is It Going to End?''
	   The answer, like the rest of this extraordinary film, is a
fascinating surprise. Just don't be surprised by the film's
message: Today the majority of viewers are so benumbed by TV that
they don't care how it ends _ as long as it never does.
	   A Paramount Pictures release, ``The Truman Show'' was produced
by Niccol, Scott Rudin, Edward S. Feldman, and Adam Schroeder.

At the Movies: `A Perfect Murder'

By BOB THOMAS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ In their classic book of conversations,
Alfred Hitchcock told Francois Truffaut that he accepted the
assignment to film the hit play ``Dial M for Murder'' because
``that was coasting, playing it safe.'' That meant there was a
ready-made plot instead of his usual development of an original.
	   The movie, starring Grace Kelly and Ray Milland, was shot in 36
days in 3-D. Instead of ``opening up'' the play with outdoor
scenes, Hitchcock filmed most of it in a living room, digging holes
in the stage for floor-level views. Not one of his classics, ``Dial
M for Murder'' was nevertheless a success.
	   Now the Frederick Knott play emerges from a new generation of
filmmakers under the title ``A Perfect Murder'' (the Hitchcock film
is not credited as a source). Andrew Davis (``The Fugitive'')
directed newcomer Patrick Smith Kelly's screenplay.
	   Michael Douglas, who seems to specialize in domestic calamities,
portrays Steven Taylor, a high-powered commodities trader with a
beautiful young wife Emily (Gwyneth Paltrow). She is a U.N.
translator and aide to the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.
She also is conducting a highly charged affair with a painter,
David Shaw (Viggo Mortensen).
	   When Taylor learns of the affair, he is shaken to the core of
his male ego. Emily has been one of his prize possessions, along
with the art collection and his investment portfolio. Besides, he
loved her.
	   But he loved money more. He has been playing the commodities on
margin, and a market shift threatens to wipe him out. Now, if his
wife were dead, his problems would be solved. She is worth dlrs 200
million through her wealthy family.
	   Taylor devises an ingenious plan _ perfect, he believes. But he
encounters some problems along the way.
	   Davis knows how to build suspense, and he punctuates the shocks
with blasts of sound effects and music (James Newton Howard's score
supplements the mood from the beginning). Kelly's script provides
clever twists that weren't in the play or Hitchcock's film.
	   Despite the gloss of upper-class Manhattan and superior acting,
the film seems formulaic and uninvolving. Like most suspense movies
nowadays, it relies too strongly on cell phones and answering
machines to further the plot.
	   Also disappointing is the role given the fine English actor
David Suchet. As the investigating detective, he becomes a minor
figure. It would have been fascinating to see TV's Hercule Poirot
solve a present-day American murder.
	   Douglas, in his ``Wall Street'' mode, is ideal as the scheming
husband, and Miss Paltrow brings intelligence and beauty to her
role as his intended victim. Mortensen, the artist with a
questionable past, brings underlying power to the other side of the
triangle.
	   The Warner Bros. release was produced by Arnold and Anne
Kopelson, Christopher Mankiewicz and Peter Macgregor-Scott. Running
time: 104 minutes.
