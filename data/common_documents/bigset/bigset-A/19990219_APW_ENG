<HEADLINE> No Fed Charges in Gammage's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The Justice Department said Friday it will not  
file civil rights charges against white police officers accused of 
suffocating a black motorist during a 1995 fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Lann Lee, acting assistant attorney general for civil  
rights, said there was not enough evidence to support a charge that 
officers used unreasonable force to subdue Jonny Gammage. 
</P>
<P>
	But, Lee said, ``We are not suggesting that Mr. Gammage's death  
was justified.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gammage, 31, was pulled over for tapping his brakes late at  
night while driving a Jaguar. Police said he refused to cooperate 
and then lunged at them. They wrestled him to the ground face down, 
and he suffocated on the pavement. 
</P>
<P>
	The car Gammage was driving was owned by his cousin, former  
Pittsburgh Steelers defensive lineman Ray Seals. Gammage ran the 
football player's sportswear business. 
</P>
<P>
	Three officers were tried on charges of involuntary  
manslaughter. One was acquitted, while the trials of the other two 
ended in mistrials. A third trial was ruled out when a judge who 
said it would violate the officers' right against double jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	Esther Bush, president of the Urban League in Pittsburgh,  
disagreed with the decision not to file civil rights charges and 
questioned why Gammage was pulled over in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's driving while black,'' she said. ``Pittsburgh's problem  
is the country's problem, and unfortunately we can repeatedly use 
Pittsburgh as an example of the country's problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gammage's parents settled a civil lawsuit against the three  
communities that employed the officers for $1.5 million.

<HEADLINE> AmWest Shares Soar on Bid Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Shares in America West Airlines surged Friday on  
a report that the parent of United Airlines has made a cash offer 
for the low-cost carrier and on expectations that will lead to a 
bidding war. 
</P>
<P>
	America West shares rose $2.75, or by 13.8 percent, at $22.75 a  
share Friday on the New York Stock Exchange. The gain came after 
The Wall Street Journal reported UAL Corp., which controls the 
nation's largest airline, had moved beyond talking in its bid to 
acquire the ninth-largest airline. UAL climbed 25 cents to $59.50 
on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
	The Journal, citing people familiar with the situation, said  
America West's board has two weeks to respond to UAL. The report 
did not specify the amount of the bid. 
</P>
<P>
	United spokesman Andy Pews said Friday the airline would have no  
comment on the matter, while an America West spokesman did not 
return calls seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	America West's market value is about $1 billion, and its  
chairman said recently that an investment firm with controlling 
interest in the low-fare carrier would agree to a buyout only if 
all the company's shares are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Pacific Group Inc. holds a 49 percent stake in America  
West. Continental, the nation's fifth-largest airline, owns 8.3 
percent and has first rights to purchase TPG's shares for an 
America West acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
	Continental contends it could take control of America West by  
acquiring only TPG's Class A shares, at an estimated cost of just 
$50 million. 
</P>
<P>
	A Continental spokesman said the company was considering its  
options and declined further comment. Continental's Class B shares 
rose 12 1/2 cents to $31.68 3/4 on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for David Bonderman, who owns TPG, said he had no  
information on a potential UAL offer. 
</P>
<P>
	A merger between United and America West would surely face  
regulatory hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
	In October, the Justice Department filed a lawsuit over the  
planned purchase by Northwest -- the nation's fourth-largest airline 
-- of a controlling stake in Continental, saying it would reduce 
competition, raise prices for travelers and lower the quality of 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of any United-America West deal also are expected to  
argue that pairing the dominant West Coast carrier with the No. 3 
carrier in the region also would pose antitrust concerns. The 
biggest losers would be American Airlines, which has been seeking 
to bolster its Western operations, Southwest Airlines and Delta Air 
Lines. 
</P>
<P>
	America West, founded in 1983, has 12,000 employees and hubs at  
its base in Phoenix as well as Las Vegas and Columbus, Ohio. It 
flies to more than 60 cities in the United States, Mexico and 
Canada and has agreements to book passengers on other airlines for 
more than 30 other U.S. destinations. 
</P>
<P>
	United Airlines, based in Elk Grove Village, Ill., serves more  
than 150 destinations in the United States and an additional 29 
worldwide. Along with Chicago, it has hubs in Denver, London, San 
Francisco, Tokyo, and Washington.

<HEADLINE> Animal-Sex Beer Ads Removed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A brewing company on Friday withdrew a national  
ad campaign that featured animals mating after community leaders 
complained about the crude humor. 
</P>
<P>
	The poster ads for Steel Reserve High Gravity Lager, a malt  
liquor, drew criticism from civil rights leaders when it was hung 
up in store windows and pasted on buildings in Harlem. 
</P>
<P>
	It featured giant turtles and rhinos mating next to the caption  
``Research Says Sex Sells Beer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The advertising campaign was designed to be a broad scale  
campaign with the intent of presenting a satire on traditional beer 
company advertising. ... The company never intended to offend any 
person or group,'' the company said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The ads had come under fire in New York from City Councilman  
Bill Perkins. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have no regard for the values and sensitivity for our  
community,'' City Councilman Bill Perkins said Friday. ``I called 
the advertising people and they said, `It's a satire. It's a 
joke.''' 
</P>
<P>
	He added: ``It's not funny.''  
</P>
<P>
	Community leaders called for a boycott of the beer even though  
more than 30 stores in Harlem had removed the advertisement by 
Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, the Steel Brewing Co. of San Francisco said  
that it told its New York distributors to remove the posters but 
that the campaign would continue elsewhere. The ads also had 
appeared in New Jersey, Maryland and the Midwest and West. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, the beer company said that it did not mean to  
offend and that the ads ``are posted everywhere the beer is sold.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But community leaders said the ads were targeted at blacks. They  
said the company apparently believed blacks would find the posters 
funny. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't see this in store windows on Park Avenue or in the  
community of Scarsdale,'' said the Rev. Calvin Butts. ``You see 
them in poor neighborhoods.''

<HEADLINE> Butler Reaches Out to Galarraga </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- If Andres Galarraga wants to talk, Brett Butler  
is only a phone call away. 
</P>
<P>
	Butler began his own battle with cancer in 1996, when a tumor  
was discovered in his tonsils. Now retired, he is healthy and 
counseling others who have been stricken with the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has become a ministry for me,'' Butler said Friday. ``I  
want to encourage and give people some insight on the positive side 
of what they're going through, because initially I was scared to 
death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Galarraga, first baseman and cleanup hitter for the Atlanta  
Braves, has a tumor in his lower back and will miss the season. 
Doctors are hopeful he will make a full recovery and resume his 
career in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Galarraga was released from Piedmont Hospital on Friday night  
and will begin treatment at his home in West Palm Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he wants to talk to someone in the cancer family, I'll be  
more than happy to share with him and spend some time with him,'' 
said Butler, who lives in suburban Duluth. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first thing you think about is, `I'm going to die.' Then  
the ol' mind monster starts, and you don't know how bad it is or 
what you're going to go through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Galarraga has a tumor lodged on a bone at the base of his spinal  
column, according to Dr. Charles Henderson, an oncologist at 
Piedmont Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson said the tumor is stage 2 -- stage 4 being the most  
advanced -- and will be treated with five months of chemotherapy and 
one month of radiation. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is in the best physical shape of all the patients I have  
seen,'' Henderson said, referring to Galarraga's devout offseason 
training regimen. ``That will definitely help in his recovery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Butler, who relied on both conventional and alternative  
treatments after his diagnosis, encouraged Galarraga to keep a 
positive attitude and gather as much information as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ultimately, he has to make the final choice'' about possible  
treatments, Butler said. ``My advice to him is to listen to 
everything, then make the best decision that he is comfortable 
with, not what somebody told him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 37-year-old Galarraga, who hit .305 with 44 homers and 121  
RBIs last season, underwent an MRI and then a biopsy because of 
persistent pain in his back, initially injured near the end of 
season. The cancer was discovered Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your back is not the best place, obviously, to have  
lymphoma,'' Henderson. ``But with it being in his back, it helped 
with the detection because it caused irritation. If it had been any 
lower down, he may not have noticed it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves, going through their second day of spring training  
workouts in Kissimmee, Fla., were slowly coming to grips with the 
prospect of not having their best hitter and unifying presence in 
the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Galarraga, a native of Venezuela, was one of the leaders of the  
team's large Latin contingent, a gentle, cheery man who bridged the 
cultural barrier with the American-born players. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I heard about it, I felt like it was me who had cancer,''  
catcher Javy Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves, seeking their eighth straight postseason appearance,  
will dedicate their season to Galarraga. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is going to be a great motivation for the team,'' Lopez  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Baylor was Galarraga's manager for five years in Colorado.  
Now the Braves' hitting coach, Baylor was shaken by the news, 
having lost his mother to cancer when she was 59. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time you hear about the `Big C,' everybody thinks the  
worse,'' Baylor said. ``It's happened at a time of spring training 
where guys can deal with it early.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though no one is likely to replace Galarraga's offensive numbers  
-- he has eclipsed 40 homers in three straight seasons and 100 RBIs 
the last four years -- the Braves are one of the few teams that 
seems equipped to deal with such a blow. 
</P>
<P>
	Left fielder Ryan Klesko, who seemed expendable when Atlanta  
signed Otis Nixon, now moves to first base, the position he played 
in the minor leagues. While Klesko struggled last season (.274, 18 
homers, 70 RBIs), he is only 27 and hit a career-high 34 homers in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Nixon, who batted .297 with 37 stolen bases for Minnesota,  
provides speed at the top of the order, a key element that was 
missing for the 1998 Braves. Two other offseason acquisitions, 
outfielder Brian Jordan (.316, 25 homers, 91 RBIs) and Bret Boone 
(.266, 24, 95), will help compensate for Galarraga's power numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	The projected everyday starters combined for 167 homers last  
season, which seems a good starting point to at least approach the 
franchise record of 215 homers with Galarraga in the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	No hitter should try to replace Galarraga's numbers all by  
himself, Baylor said. 
</P>
<P>
	``So many times when you lose a valuable player like Andres,  
everyone says, `Now, I have to do more,''' the hitting coach said. 
``Let's not pressure ourselves to where we get off to a bad 
start.''

<HEADLINE> Coca-Cola Unveils Bottled Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Some 113 years after Coca-Cola began selling the  
sweetened, carbonated brown water that became the world's most 
popular soft drink, it's going to market its own brand of the real 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke announced Friday that it will sell its first bottled water  
in the United States, and Dasani is it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Suffice it to say, we think this is the right time for us to  
get into this market and that Dasani is the right brand,'' said 
Coke spokesman Scott Jacobson. 
</P>
<P>
	The water, to be sold in a light blue plastic bottle, is  
expected to be available nationwide and in Canada before this 
summer. The name, developed over months, doesn't derive from any 
specific origin but is meant to convey ``a clean, fresh taste,'' 
Jacobson said. (It is pronounced duh-SAW'-nee.) 
</P>
<P>
	An advertising campaign will back the rollout as Coke plunges  
into a hot market. Bottled water has outpaced the growth of soft 
drinks, particularly in convenience stores, where water sales have 
increased as much as 30 percent in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We sell a lot of bottled water, especially in the  
summertime,'' said Steve Tessereau, who manages a busy Texaco 
station near the Town Center Mall in suburban Cobb County. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's a Coke brand, it's going to sell,'' Tessereau said of  
Dasani. ``Why they waited five or six years to get into it, I don't 
know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coke has a water brand, BonAqua, overseas, but the company has  
been reluctant to add water to its U.S. line, preferring to 
encourage daily consumption of Coke, Sprite and its other flavored 
soft drinks. It just launched a new advertising campaign and 
promotions for Diet Coke. 
</P>
<P>
	But to meet increased demand for alternatives among health- and  
weight-conscious Americans, Coke in recent years has broadened its 
offerings to include sports and fruit drinks and juices. 
</P>
<P>
	As recently as last month, M. Douglas Ivester, the company's  
chairman and chief executive, said Coke remained leery about water. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's an awful lot of water sold in the world ... there's  
not an awful lot of money made selling water,'' Ivester told a 
Rotary Club luncheon. ``We're in this business for profitable 
growth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bottled water sales have jumped from $2.65 billion in 1990 to  
$4.3 billion last year, when sales grew nearly 10 percent over 
1997. The $56.3 billion carbonated soft drink market grew by only 3 
percent last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Soft-drink rival Pepsi-Cola Co. has done well in the five years  
since introducing its Aquafina, which has become the leading water 
brand in convenience stores. 
</P>
<P>
	John Sicher, publisher of the trade journal Beverage Digest,  
expects Coke's water venture will take off quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would anticipate that within one or two years, Dasani will  
be one of the leaders in bottled waters,'' Sicher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier reports about Coke's water project indicated the water  
will come from wells or taps, then be purified, with minerals such 
as potassium or magnesium added. 
</P>
<P>
	True to the Coke secret-formula tradition, Jacobson wouldn't  
give details of Dasani's composition, other than to say it will be 
purified, non-carbonated water enhanced with minerals for taste.

<HEADLINE> Dolphins Sign LB Robert Jones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- The Miami Dolphins kept one of their starting  
linebackers in the fold for the second time in a week when they 
signed Robert Jones to a five-year contract Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial terms were not disclosed, but reports in South Florida  
said it would average between $3 million and $3.5 million. Jones 
made $378,000 last year when he joined the Dolphins after his 
release by the St. Louis Rams. 
</P>
<P>
	A week ago, the Dolphins signed All-Pro middle linebacker Zach  
Thomas to a five-year contract worth $22.5 million. Together, 
Thomas and Jones helped lead a defense that gave up an NFL-low 265 
points this past season. 
</P>
<P>
	Bucky Woy, Jones' agent, indicated his client took less money to  
stay with the Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he wanted to go elsewhere or wait, he could have made  
bigger dollars out in the marketplace,'' Woy said. ``Robert felt it 
was important to stay with the Dolphins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones recorded 100 tackles last season, third on the team, after  
switching from his natural middle linebacker spot to the strong 
side. He also had a career-high five sacks and two interceptions, 
returning one for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones made only one free-agent visit, traveling to Minnesota on  
Sunday. The expansion Cleveland Browns also reportedly were 
interested. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it came down to the fact that Robert and Jimmy  
(Johnson, Dolphins coach) have gotten such a good relationship 
going,'' Woy said. ``This is a stable team that he sees as being a 
real contender.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Jones signed a four-year, $10 million deal with St.  
Louis but played two seasons with the Rams. He was cut after the 
team replaced coach Rich Brooks with Dick Vermeil. Jones was the 
team's leading tackler, but Vermeil still wanted to make a change.

<HEADLINE> Yanks Await Clemens Arrival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- There aren't many people who can teach David  
Cone about pitching. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why Cone, the 35-year-old former Cy Young Award winner,  
was anxiously awaiting today's arrival at Yankees camp of the only 
five-time winner of the award: Roger Clemens. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm anxious to see that legendary game-day preparation. It's  
very intense,'' Cone said Friday, a day after the Yankees acquired 
Clemens for David Wells, Graeme Lloyd and Homer Bush. ``I'd like to 
talk with him and compare notes on American League hitters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees owner George Steinbrenner is also looking forward to  
seeing Clemens in a Yankees uniform, two years after he failed to 
sign him as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll fit in the with group ... he's a Yankee now,''  
Steinbrenner said. ``He's bigger than life almost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cone spent Thursday with Wells, one of his closest friends on  
last year's team. So after pacing around his Palm Harbor, Fla. 
home, Wells traveled to Miami for a weekend of golf. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never seen him so down ... beyond depressed,'' Cone said.  
``I've never seen anybody so stunned by a trade ... confused and 
stunned. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's (normally) so upbeat. He was pacing around and couldn't  
sit down,'' Cone said. ``He was at a loss for words. He just had to 
get away. I don't think it has sunken in yet. He probably feels 
rejected and needs somebody to want him. He was very disappointed. 
He truly loved playing for the Yankees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wells became the toast of New York after pitching a perfect game  
against Minnesota last May. Fans loved him for his biker and beer 
image. Yankees owner George Steinbrenner became fond of Wells, even 
tolerating the pitcher's love of heavy metal music. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think our friendship will continue,'' Steinbrenner said.  
``It was tough yesterday. I think David knows how I feel about 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrenner wasn't upset that some Yankees fans didn't like the  
trade. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fan reaction is important, but it's not the final grade,'' he  
said. ``I learned a long time ago from (former Yankees general 
manager) Gabe Paul, who was one of the smartest men I ever met in 
baseball, you can not make a move and have it judged by the fan 
reaction. You let the results speak for themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York sports radio was abuzz with negative reaction.  
</P>
<P>
	``People love him just because of the way he is,'' Yankees  
manager Joe Torre said of Wells. ``Boomer is a character. The whole 
thing on and off the field, I think endeared him to the New York 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some in baseball said the trade was just another example of how  
baseball's rich get richer. The arrival of Clemens boosted the 
Yankees' payroll to $86.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really resent people making this a fiscal deal. I'm tired of  
hearing people saying, `Oh, the Yankees can do this, the Yankees 
can do that,''' Steinbrenner said. ``This was a trade ... people 
have seem to forgotten that. If our guys made a better trade than 
somebody else, so be it. Don't let them start saying we're doing 
all this because we've got the money. That didn't come to bear 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Yankees closer Mariano Rivera is ready to move on after  
winning a $4.25 million arbitration ruling on Thursday. ``We went 
through the process, we fought and we won,'' Rivera said. ... With 
the departure of Graeme Lloyd, the Yankees have just one 
left-hander, Mike Stanton in the bullpen. ``Having two lefties was 
a luxury,'' Torre said. ``Still, you always keep your eyes open for 
a left-hander. I would like to find out what we have in camp.'' 
Non-roster invitees David Carroll and Ed Yarnall are only two 
left-handed bullpen candidates in camp. ... Darryl Strawberry, 
still recovering from colon cancer surgery, intends to call Atlanta 
first baseman Andres Galarraga, who will miss this season because 
of a cancerous tumor in a bone in his back. ``I want to try to 
encourage him,'' Strawberry said. ``I want to try and let him know 
about the road ahead.'' Strawberry said prior to his surgery, he 
benefited from talking with Baltimore outfielder Eric Davis, who 
had also had colon cancer. ``It's a tough situation,'' Strawberry 
said. ``People that have been through it know more about it than 
anybody.''

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler Mulls Nissan Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler AG will take its time analyzing  
whether acquiring a stake in Japan's financially troubled Nissan 
Motor Co. makes sense, co-Chairman Juergen Schrempp said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking before an Executives' Club of Chicago luncheon,  
Schrempp said he is weighing whether a desire to increase 
DaimlerChrysler's market share in Japan is feasible in a short 
period, given that management is still dealing with last fall's 
merger of Daimler-Benz AG and Chrysler Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a chess player, and I will not tell you my next move,''  
Schrempp said. ``The question for us is careful analysis. Let's 
never forget there is something like conflict of interest, 
overstretching management's capabilities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schrempp repeated that no decision will be made for at least  
three months. 
</P>
<P>
	Daimler and Nissan officials had been in talks since before the  
DaimlerChrysler merger about a possible deal involving Nissan's 
commercial truck unit, Nissan Diesel Motor Co. Reports that 
DaimlerChrysler was considering a larger investment in Nissan 
itself surfaced last month. 
</P>
<P>
	In theory, a DaimlerChrysler-Nissan alliance could position the  
German-American automaker to better compete against Ford Motor Co., 
General Motors Corp., Toyota Motor Corp. and Volkswagen AG, which 
have more extensive investments in China and other Asian developing 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	But it also would saddle DaimlerChrysler with a share of  
Nissan's staggering debt, which is estimated at between $22 billion 
and $37 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler and Nissan have a great deal of product overlap  
-- Nissan's cars and light trucks compete against Chrysler, Dodge, 
Plymouth and Jeep products. Nissan's Infiniti unit is a direct 
competitor with Mercedes-Benz. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan's board is scheduled to meet March 2 and discussion of  
possible acquisition offers is expected. France's Renault SA also 
is reported to be negotiating with Nissan. 
</P>
<P>
	Schrempp also said he expected the combined DaimlerChrysler to  
report earnings of $148 billion for 1998, with 80 percent of all 
revenues generated from products introduced by the two companies in 
the past five years.

<P>
	PEORIA, Ariz. (AP) -- Reliever Mark Leiter, slowed by an  
inner-ear infection prevented him from flying, reported Friday to 
the Seattle Mariners, two days behind schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``The doctors wanted to be cautious about it, and I took their  
advice because I didn't want to come into this spring training with 
any lingering problems,'' said Leiter, who left his Ormand Beach, 
Fla., home Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Leiter, a 35-year-old right-hander who had 23 saves with  
Philadelphia last year, was sign to bolster a bullpen that was 
among the worst in baseball. Seattle also signed Jose Mesa, 
expected to close this year after a season as a setup man for 
Cleveland and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	``That would be great if I can get 40 saves or more, but I don't  
have goals like that,'' said Mesa, who had 46 saves in 1995 and 39 
in 1996. ``You don't want to say you're going to do this or that, 
and then not do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle manager Lou Piniella said his pitching staff, including  
his often criticized bullpen, is deeper and stronger than years 
past. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can afford to stretch out about 10 pitchers at the start of  
camp and decide what roles they will have halfway through,'' 
Piniella said. `Guys like Jose and Mark add a lot of credibility. 
Jose pitched on American League championship teams and is a very 
dominant closer. We think he can come in here and do a good job for 
us in a closer role.''

<HEADLINE> Orioles Add Flock of New Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The Baltimore Orioles might consider wearing  
name tags in the clubhouse during spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	Introductions, after all, are in order for a team that has  
undergone radical changes since last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Newcomers include outfielder Albert Belle, first baseman Will  
Clark, second baseman Delino DeShields, utility man Rich Amaral and 
new starting catcher, Charles Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Rafael Palmeiro, Roberto Alomar and Eric Davis, meanwhile, are  
among those who exited via free agency. Pitchers Jimmy Key, Armando 
Benitez and Doug Drabek are gone, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Ray Miller hopes the new blend of Orioles will band  
together to erase memories of last year's horrid 79-83 season. 
Baltimore had more than a dozen potential free agents in training 
camp last season, and now Miller has a more stable mixture with 
which to create a little positive chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel a little better about the makeup of this team than I  
did last year,'' Miller said. ``I knew that if those 14 free agents 
didn't get signed during the season that there would be a problem, 
and I think that's what happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller got his first look at some of the members of the new team  
Friday, when pitchers and catchers reported to camp in Fort 
Lauderdale, Fla. to begin a six-week stay. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the changes on the field, a revamped bullpen will  
be working with a new pitching coach, Bruce Kison. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles will miss Palmeiro's bat, Alomar's defense and  
Davis' presence in the clubhouse. But Belle and Clark bring two 
items sorely lacking last year: offense and leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before we knew who we were going to lose, I told (general  
manager) Frank Wren and (owner) Peter Angelos that I wanted guys 
who came to the ballpark with fire and intensity,'' Miller said. 
``The people we got all fit into that category.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Belle and Clark are not scheduled to show up until next week,  
but their reputations precede them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the veterans we brought in are well recognized and  
have a lot of respect from the players on this team, so they should 
fit right in,'' shortstop Mike Bordick said. ``We know what they 
can do. Now it's a matter of getting guys on the same page right 
out of the shoot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bordick and third baseman Cal Ripken will again cover the right  
side of the infield, but the double-play combination will now 
include DeShields and Clark. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken longs for the days when the Orioles' roster varied only  
slightly from one year to the next. Instead, he's grown accustomed 
to meeting a variety of new teammates every February. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would prefer the stability of having the same team back, but  
at this level talent dominates,'' Ripken said. ``We do have a 
fairly big changeover in talent, but the common thread each year is 
that it's good talent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Veteran talent, too. Potential major leaguers Calvin Pickering,  
Chris Fussell, Ryan Minor and Jerry Hairston Jr. will see plenty of 
action in exhibition games, but the focus of this spring training 
is for the over-30 crowd to get to know one another while building 
a winning attitude. 
</P>
<P>
	``From what I've heard, the guys we got are anxious to win and  
want to be part of a winner,'' Bordick said. ``The guys who were 
already here remember how frustrating last season was and want to 
prove we can be successful.''

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Navigation Signals To Stop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Civilian and military ships and planes could  
feel the effect of a Pentagon plan to disrupt its satellite 
navigation over North Carolina next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Defense Department will hold tests to prepare for potential  
loss of the Global Positioning System -- a military-run network 
which provides longitudinal and latitudinal coordinates for ships 
and planes with appropriate receivers. 
</P>
<P>
	The tests and accompanying disruptions could affect the civilian  
ships and aircraft that use the 24-hour network to help guide them. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration and the Coast Guard issued  
notices Friday, cautioning pilots and ship operators against 
relying on GPS signals during certain four-hour periods from Monday 
through Saturday next week. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a spokesman for the U.S. Atlantic Command, which is  
running the test, told The Washington Post he expected ``only 
minimal impact'' on civilian users. 
</P>
<P>
	Affected areas will vary greatly according to altitude. For  
ships, it will involve a circular region within a radius of 40 
miles centered about 120 miles east of Wilmington, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	For planes cruising at 40,000 feet, the affected area expands to  
a radius of 350 miles and reaches as far south as Vero Beach, Fla., 
and as far north as Sea Isle, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said there were no reports of civilian safety problems  
during previous tests held over North Carolina and Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	During the tests, military crews will be evaluated on their  
ability to identify that GPS systems are not working and on finding 
other means of navigation.

<HEADLINE> Cop Impersonated AP Photographer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WESTMINSTER, Calif. (AP) -- The police chief has apologized to  
The Associated Press after learning that an undercover officer used 
fake AP credentials to observe a demonstration at a video store 
that had displayed a portrait of Ho Chi Minh. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to a complaint from the AP, Chief James Cook said he  
was reviewing police policies to ensure they clearly prohibit 
officers from impersonating journalists. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's highly inappropriate for officers to impersonate  
journalists because we are impartial observers, and readers should 
be clear that we're not participants in events,'' said Sue Cross, 
chief of bureau in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Cook said Thursday that he had confirmed that the phony  
photographer spotted by media at the demonstration Monday was one 
of his officers. The chief said he didn't know of the plan 
beforehand and said the officer was rebuked. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of demonstrators have besieged the Hi Tek video since  
early January after owner Truong Van Tran posted a portrait of the 
late Vietnamese communist leader and a Vietnamese flag. 
</P>
<P>
	Tran has suggested he's advocating better relations with the  
Vietnamese government. But the display has inflamed passions in the 
community, home to thousands of people who fled the communist 
government after the fall of South Vietnam.

<HEADLINE>  Trinidad To Face Whitaker Saturday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Felix Trinidad Jr., who aspires to the  
unofficial title of best pound-for-pound boxer in the world, fights 
tonight against Pernell Whitaker, who for several years was 
considered by many to be just that. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad's IBF welterweight title defense will be the feature in  
the first of two championship shows in Madison Square Garden during 
the next three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	On March 13, Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis will fight for  
the undisputed heavyweight championship on pay-per-view (TVKO). 
</P>
<P>
	Tonight's fight will be televised on HBO. The 9:30 p.m. EST  
telecast will open with the replay of Oscar De La Hoya's split 
decision win over Ike Quartey in defense of the WBC welterweight 
title last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 26-year-old Trinidad was a 5-1 favorite over Whitaker,  
partly because of how drug and alcohol problems and a 16-month 
layoff might affect the 35-year-old Whitaker. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of the best training camps I've ever hand,'' said  
Whitaker, who declines to discuss the problems that forced him into 
rehabilitation and have kept him from fighting since he outpointed 
Andre Pestriaev on Oct. 17, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``He still a good boxer, but the drugs and alcohol have taken  
their toll,'' said Trinidad's father, also his trainer and manager. 
``But he still has pride.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whitaker also is left-handed, but Trinidad said, ``I don't think  
that will be any problem. I've fought left-handers before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trainer Tommy Brooks thinks Whitaker has a lot more left than  
pride. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'd never think he'd been out of the gym,'' Brooks said.  
``You guys (reporters) are in for a surprise. Trinidad has a 
surprise coming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad (33-0, 29 knockouts) weighed in officially Friday at  
147 pounds, but only after showing up, then running around the 
garden to lose weight before coming in 22 minutes late. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitaker (41-2-1, 17 knockouts) weighed 147 for his third Garden  
appearance and his first since he won the WBC welterweight title on 
points over James ``Buddy'' McGirt on March 6, 1993. He lost that 
title on a disputed decision to Oscar De La Hoya on April 12, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In a fight that will not be televised Vince Phillips (39-3, 28  
knockouts) will defend the IBF junior welterweight title against 
Terronn Millett (20-1-1, 15 knockouts).

<P>
	Stop Traffic will be ridden by Corey Black and carry high weight

<HEADLINE> Olivetti May Bid $58B for Rival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Italian telecommunications firm Olivetti SpA  
announced its board would meet Sunday to discuss giant rival 
Telecom Italia SpA, as a report said Olivetti was planning to 
launch a bold $58 billion takeover bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti did not disclose other details of the weekend meeting,  
and on Friday only revealed that the session would concern Telecom 
Italia because stock market regulators asked Olivetti to comment on 
rampant merger rumors. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, The Wall Street Journal Interactive Edition reported  
Friday that Olivetti was preparing to bid for Telecom Italia -- 
whose market value of about $52 billion is more than five times 
that of Olivetti. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom Italia, the former state monopoly, is the world's  
sixth-largest phone company, but has endured three management 
shakeups in the past 18 months. A takeover by Olivetti would rank 
as Europe's richest telecommunications deal ever. 
</P>
<P>
	The bid hinges on a plan for Olivetti to sell stakes in two  
Italian telecom operators to Germany's Mannesmann AG for $10 
billion to help raise money for the Telecom Italia bid, according 
to the report on the Journal's Web site from The Wall Street 
Journal Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The Journal said Olivetti's board would vote on those sales and  
the Telecom Italia bid on Sunday. Mannesmann declined to comment on 
Olivetti's board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The news pushed Olivetti stock up 8.7 percent in Milan, while  
Telecom Italia shares climbed 2.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Rumors about a possible deal have building over the past two  
months. Last month, Olivetti said a report that it was planning to 
buy Telecom Italia ``unfounded and impracticable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Italy's stock market regulator, Consob, is now evaluating  
Olivetti's denial in light of current developments, and also said 
it had opened a preliminary inquiry into insider trading of Telecom 
Italia shares after a large block changed hands Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Report: Atlanta Ignored Gift Limit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A top official on Atlanta's Olympic committees  
admitted that he and others ignored the $200 gift limit set by the 
International Olympic Committee, The Washington Post reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlie Battle, who served on the bid and organizing committees,  
said that as Atlanta pushed to secure the 1996 Summer Games, his 
panel gave IOC members $475 sets of golf clubs, free travel for 
family members and even a bulldog for a Cuban delegate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hey, that's what you do,'' Battle said. ``That's the kind of  
thing you feel maybe would have an impact. ... We were true 
believers in trying to build a relationship, a real true 
friendship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Battle repeatedly insisted that the committee did nothing wrong  
because the gift-giving rule was widely ignored and never enforced. 
He said he did not consider the gifts excessive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm proud of what we did,'' he said. ``We didn't do anything  
illegal, immoral, unethical or what I felt was improper given the 
context of lavish hospitality and entertainment that was the 
accepted route. I mean, that's what was going on. ... We felt like 
we conducted our bid in the spirit of what we felt like were the 
guidelines that were given to us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bid committee bought a $400 sports jacket and tie for the  
traveling companion of one IOC member, and it might have paid for 
some side trips by IOC delegates to Disney World, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure we gave out some things that probably cost $300 or  
$400 or $500 or maybe even more,'' said Battle, an attorney who is 
president of Central Atlanta Progress, a downtown development 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	Battle and former Atlanta committee president Billy Payne have  
publicly said in recent days they were unaware of any improprieties 
during the two-year bid process. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta's campaign for the Olympics cost $7.8 million, according  
to bid committee documents. The committee spent $376,545 on one 
trip alone, the crucial 1990 IOC meeting in Tokyo at which the 
games were awarded. 
</P>
<P>
	At least five investigations are under way into the Salt Lake  
effort that won the 2002 Winter Games. An ethics panel last week 
reported that Salt Lake bidders paid more than $1.2 million in 
cash, travel, medical care and gifts to 24 IOC members.

<HEADLINE> FTC Fights Office Supply Scams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When a box of urinal deodorants arrived at the  
Bloomfield United Methodist Church in Des Moines, Iowa, minister 
Carlos Jayne knew something was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our first clue was that our church didn't have urinals,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But instead of offering to take the supplies back when Jayne  
complained about the unordered products, the company threatened to 
send the church to a collection agency if it did not pay the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	This is just one of the scare tactics used by scam artists  
trying to dumping millions of dollars in unwanted office and 
cleaning supplies on businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission announced actions Thursday against  
a number of fraudulent operations accused of bilking companies by 
shipping them unsolicited office supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	The cases, filed in U.S. District Court in Chicago by the FTC  
and two state attorneys general, illustrate how smaller companies, 
charities and not-for-profits might be particularly vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
	But larger businesses are in danger of being duped by another  
variation of the scam: impostors who pretend to represent 
legitimate office suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are tenacious, and they are very smooth,'' said George  
Parry, Xerox Corp.'s corporate security investigator who handles 
supply fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Hired two years ago to crack down on phonies that sell  
merchandise using Xerox's name, Parry said he fields about 5,000 
complaints a year from customers who have been approached by people 
misrepresenting themselves as Xerox representatives. They promise 
to give clients a discount, but the products end up costing six 
times as much as normal Xerox supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past year alone, four or five major clients of the  
company have lost $50,000 each in such scams. 
</P>
<P>
	Parry has set up a database to track cases and passes on  
information to federal and state law enforcement officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``Toner Phoners,'' as Parry refers to them, began their ploy by  
figuring out what supplies the business uses -- sometimes by calling 
and pretending to conduct a ``survey'' of office products. The 
fraudulent companies also make a point of finding out who is in 
charge of ordering supplies for the company. 
</P>
<P>
	The telemarketers then call back offering to sell the products  
used by the company at discount prices. Or they send boxes of 
supplies with the name of the office manager on the invoice. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you see a name on the invoice, you kind of think it's on  
the up and up,'' said Joyce Stahl, county clerk in Rock County, 
Neb. Her office received a half case of unordered cleaning solution 
marked with the janitor's name, obtained by a caller a few weeks 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Bills for unwanted shipments of citrus cleaning spray and  
lightbulbs were paid at the Tri-City Eagles Bar in Tempe, Ariz., 
because the invoice bore the name of the bar manager. Only later 
did she notice and contact the company, which tried to convince her 
she was a regular customer by using her first name. 
</P>
<P>
	``They just made it sound like I dealt with them before,'' said  
Jacque Jacot. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are not sophisticated schemes,'' said Jodie Bernstein,  
director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection. She noted that 
companies don't have to pay for unordered supplies and that 
unordered merchandise can be treated as gifts. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC also recommends that companies assign designated buyers,  
check their documentation before paying bills and train staff to 
respond to telemarketers. 
</P>
<P>
	In the complaints announced Thursday, the FTC asked for a  
permanent injunction against Southern Maintenance Supplies Inc. of 
Illinois. The Illinois attorney general's office filed a case 
against Tri-State Chemicals of Oak Forest, Ill., and National 
Maintenance Supply operating in Orland Park, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indiana attorney general's office has filed a case against  
National Maintenance Products Inc. and Reliable Maintenance Inc., 
both of Hammond, Ind.

<HEADLINE> Samsung Motors Workers End Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Thousands of workers at fledgling  
Samsung Motors Inc. returned to work today, ending a 75-day strike 
over job security. 
</P>
<P>
	Samsung's 3,000 workers walked off their jobs in early December  
to protest a decision by their parent conglomerate to swap the auto 
firm for the electronics arm of the Daewoo group. 
</P>
<P>
	The swap was part of government efforts to cut overlapping  
investment, thus increasing the competitiveness of South Korea's 
largest businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The auto workers' union reached agreement with management on job  
security and financial compensation earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement calls for a five-year job guarantee and an extra  
eight months' salary for workers who choose to stay with the car 
maker after their plant is taken over by Daewoo Motors Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers who take early retirement will get an extra 16 months'  
salary. 
</P>
<P>
	Samsung Motors has been cited as a typical case of  
over-investment by South Korean conglomerates. The company, with an 
annual capacity of 240,000 cars, entered the nation's already 
saturated auto market in early 1998. It produced only 50,000 cars 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	A restructuring of South Korea's ailing conglomerates was a key  
condition of a $58 billion bailout of the country's economy by the 
International Monetary Fund in late 1997.

<HEADLINE> Founder of Carlson Companies Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Curtis Carlson, who started with a $55 loan  
during the Great Depression and built it into the giant Carlson 
Companies Inc. that included Radisson Hotels Worldwide, died 
Friday. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlson suffered a stroke Feb. 10 and had been hospitalized  
since then. He died at Methodist Hospital in St. Louis Park in 
suburban Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, with 147,000 employees, also includes Carlson  
Marketing Group, Carlson Wagonlit Travel franchises, A.T. Mays 
travel agencies, Country Inns and Suites, Radisson Seven Seas 
Cruises, and TGI Friday's and Italianni's restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlson started with the Gold Bond Stamp Co. and built it into  
Carlson Companies with $7.8 billion in annual revenue in 1998. The 
Carlson name was worth another $14.2 billion in annual revenue to 
franchises and other businesses licensed by the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Until stricken, Carlson had remained active in the company. But  
he had turned over control last year to his daughter, Marilyn 
Carlson Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlson was the third child in a family of five. His mother  
worked as a maid in her early years and his father drove a 
sprinkler wagon for the city of Minneapolis and was a grocery 
salesman before opening his own grocery store. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody, including us kids, always worked as though the wolf  
were at the door,'' Carlson recalled in his 1994 autobiography, 
``Good as Gold: The Story of the Carlson Companies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After getting a bachelor's degree in 1937, Carlson went to work  
as a salesman for Procter &AMP; Gamble, earning $110 a month. In his 
first year, Carlson earned a gold wristwatch and a $330 bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the watch that taught me something about the value of  
prizes as awards in incentive programs,'' Carlson wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	After a year with Procter &AMP; Gamble, Carlson started his trading  
stamp business on the side with the help of a $55 loan from his 
landlord. Six months later, he began working on the stamp business 
full time. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1938 to 1978, Gold Bond grew at a rate of 30 percent a  
year, never failing to meet sales goals set by the founder. During 
the post-World War II era when trading stamps were in their heyday, 
Gold Bond broke new ground by signing up such non-traditional 
accounts as rural movie theaters, feed mills, turkey hatcheries and 
mortuaries. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time he was 39 in 1953, Carlson had earned his first  
million dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlson is survived by his wife Arleen and two daughters.

<HEADLINE> Wheat, Soybeans Down; Corn Mixed / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Wheat and soybeans futures retreated Friday on  
the Chicago Board of Trade amid dim prospects for export business. 
Corn futures finished mostly unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat remained under pressure from weak demand for U.S. grain,  
which has caused inventories to jump to their highest in nearly 12 
years. Investors believe prices must go lower to make the grain 
more competitive against Australian and European supplies and more 
attractive as an animal feed. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans continue to slump on expectations Brazil will harvest a  
near-record crop, bringing competing supplies to market at a time 
when demand for vegetable oils has sunk to new lows. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures held steady against continued steady export demand.  
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for March delivery fell 3 1/4 cents to $2.54 3/4 a bushel; March  
corn was unchanged at $2.15 a bushel; March oats rose 1/4 cent to 
$1.01 3/4 a bushel; March soybeans fell 3 3/4 cents to $4.78 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef futures were mixed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,  
while pork futures finished mostly higher. 
</P>
<P>
	April live cattle rose .13 cent to 66.70 cents a pound; March  
feeder cattle fell .10 cent to 73.35 cents a pound; April lean hogs 
rose .77 cent to 45.82 cents a pound; March pork bellies rose .58 
cent to 54.30 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Butler Reaches Out to Galarraga </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- As Andres Galarraga begins the battle against  
cancer, Brett Butler knows how the Big Cat must be feeling. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first thing you think about is, `I'm going to die,'''  
Butler said Friday. ``Then the ol' mind monster starts, and you 
don't know how bad it is or what you're going to go through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Butler began his own struggle with the disease in 1996, when a  
cancerous tumor was discovered in his tonsils. He underwent 
excruciating surgery and six weeks of radiation treatments, but 
recovered to play another full season before retiring. 
</P>
<P>
	If Galarraga wants ``to talk to someone in the cancer family,''  
Butler said he is only a phone call away. Nearly three years after 
his initial diagnosis, there is no sign of a recurrence. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has become a ministry for me,'' said Butler, who lives in  
the Atlanta suburb of Duluth. ``I want to encourage and give people 
some insight on the positive side of what they're going through, 
because initially I was scared to death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Galarraga, cleanup hitter and first baseman for the Braves, has  
a tumor lodged on a bone at the base of his spinal column, 
according to Dr. Charles Henderson, an oncologist at Piedmont 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson said Friday the tumor is stage 2 -- stage 4 being the  
most advanced -- and will be treated with five months of 
chemotherapy and one month of radiation. Galarraga will miss this 
season, but doctors are optimistic of a full recovery and his 
playing career resuming in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is in the best physical shape of all the patient I have  
seen,'' Henderson said. ``That will definitely help in his 
recovery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Butler, who relied on both conventional and alternative  
treatments after his diagnosis, encouraged Galarraga to keep a 
positive attitude and gather as much information as possible about 
possible treatments. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ultimately, he has to make the final choice,'' Butler said.  
``My advice to him is to listen to everything, then make the best 
decision that he is comfortable with, not what somebody told him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 37-year-old Galarraga, who hit .305 with 44 homers and 121  
RBIs last season, underwent an MRI and then a biopsy because of 
persistent pain in his back, initially injured near the end of 
season. The cancer was discovered Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your back is not the best place, obviously, to have  
lymphoma,'' Henderson. ``But with it being in his back, it helped 
with the detection because it caused irritation. If it had been any 
lower down, he may not have noticed it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves, going through their second day of spring training  
workouts in Kissimmee, Fla., were slowly coming to grips with the 
prospect of not having their best hitter and unifying presence in 
the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a big hit to this team to lose a guy like him, but I  
think it would be a little selfish to worry about the team as 
opposed to him right now,'' pitcher Kevin Millwood said. 
</P>
<P>
	Galarraga, a native of Venezuela, was one of the leaders of the  
team's large Latin contingent, a gentle, cheery man who bridged the 
cultural barrier with the American-born players. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I heard about it, I felt like it was me who had cancer,''  
catcher Javy Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves, seeking their eighth straight postseason appearance,  
intend to dedicate their season to Galarraga, who is expected to be 
released from Piedmont Hospital on Saturday and begin treatment 
near his home in West Palm Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is going to be a great motivation for the team,'' Lopez  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Baylor was Galarraga's manager for five years in Colorado.  
Now the Braves hitting coach, Baylor was shaken by the news, having 
lost his mother to cancer when she was 59. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time you hear about the `Big C,' everybody thinks the  
worse,'' Baylor said. ``It's happened at a time of spring training 
where guys can deal with it early.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though no one is likely to replace Galarraga's offensive numbers  
-- he was eclipsed 40 homers in three straight seasons and 100 RBIs 
the last four years -- the Braves are one of the few teams that 
seems equipped to deal with such a blow. 
</P>
<P>
	Left fielder Ryan Klesko, who seemed expendable when Atlanta  
signed Otis Nixon, now moves to first base, the position he played 
in the minor leagues. While Klesko struggled last season (.274, 18 
homers, 70 RBIs), he is only 27 and hit a career-high 34 homers in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Nixon, who batted .297 with 37 stolen bases for Minnesota,  
provides speed at the top of the order, a key element that was 
missing for the 1998 Braves. Two other offseason acquisitions, 
outfielder Brian Jordan (.316, 25 homers, 91 RBIs) and Bret Boone 
(.266, 24, 95), will help compensate for Galarraga's power numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	The projected everyday starters combined for 167 homers last  
season, which seems a good starting point to at least approach the 
franchise record of 215 homers with Galarraga in the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	No hitter should try to replace Galarraga's numbers all by  
himself, Baylor said. 
</P>
<P>
	``So many times when you lose a valuable player like Andres,  
everyone says, `Now, I have to do more,''' the hitting coach said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bret Boone, just do the same things. Brian Jordan, just do the  
same thing that got you here and not that superhuman thing you want 
to take on. Let's not pressure ourselves to where we get ... off to 
a bad start.''

<HEADLINE> Hollywood Starting To Slow Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Veteran film editor Donn Cambern wrapped up  
work on Disney's ``My Favorite Martian'' and looked ahead to his 
next job. 
</P>
<P>
	Only there wasn't a next job at the moment.  
</P>
<P>
	After years of tremendous growth, Hollywood is starting to slow  
down, with the big studios cranking out fewer movies, and TV and 
film productions fleeing to Canada and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	The causes include soaring production costs, a glutted movie  
market, lower costs in producer-friendly foreign countries and 
fundamental changes -- and new choices -- in the business of 
entertaining. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists and Hollywood boosters insist it's too early to get  
too worried, but the change -- be it a correction, a blip or the 
start of something worse -- is reverberating throughout the 
industry, striking hardest at technicians, crafts people, equipment 
suppliers and other behind-the-scenes workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many times I have about two pictures in front of me. Right  
now, there's nothing in front of me,'' said Cambern, a free-lance 
editor and the new president of the board of the Motion Pictures 
Editors Guild, one of many labor groups sounding the alarm. 
``Everyone is starting to feel the slowdown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This weekend, Hollywood gets a cold hard look at what more it  
could lose -- and who will take it -- as hundreds of film 
commissioners, from Iowa to Iceland, gather in Los Angeles for 
their annual convention. Through Sunday, they'll all be making 
their best cases to move TV and film production to their areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting comes amid these unsettling signs:  
</P>
<P>
	-- The number of films in wide release, usually the bigger-budget  
motion pictures that generate a larger number of well-paid union 
jobs, last year was at its lowest level in six years; 139 movies in 
wide release, down from 151 in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The number of television and movie location production days in  
Los Angeles County, where most of the industry's filming takes 
place, dropped 4.2 percent last year to 45,653 days, compared with 
47,669 days in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	-- An estimated 11,300 acting jobs were lost because of work  
going to Canada. That's on top of the 5,500 jobs lost in the 
1996-1997 season and about 2,600 the season before that, according 
to the Screen Actors Guild. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Rentals of cameras, sound equipment and other production gear  
were down 30 percent last year after what a rental industry 
representative called ``a banner year'' in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In California, still the capital of the entertainment business,  
lawmakers are so concerned about the $27 billion industry that 
they've introduced or are about to introduce three bills to provide 
tax credits and to ease environmental rules for production 
companies that remain in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	But other states are hurting, too. For example, Washington  
state, which has a similar geography and climate as its neighbor to 
the north, has lost significant production to Canada, according to 
Kristina Erickson, project coordinator at the Washington State Film 
Office. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very difficult to compete with their economy,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Luring producers with a good monetary exchange rate and federal  
and provincial tax credits, Canada is popular for filming movies of 
the week and miniseries. And while ``The X-Files'' may have gone to 
Los Angeles in a highly publicized move from Canada, many TV series 
are still filmed there. 
</P>
<P>
	And it isn't only Canada that is attracting producers.  
``Baywatch,'' the ultimate California television show with its sexy 
starlets and beach scenes, is leaving Southern California for 
Australia, costing about 100 jobs in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, economists and Hollywood boosters are not convinced the  
industry is anywhere close to being in trouble in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know there's been a slowdown. The magnitude of the slowdown  
-- we have to wait and see,'' said Jack Kyser, chief economist for 
the Economic Development Corp. of Los Angeles County. ``Over the 
long term the prospects for Hollywood are good. '98 was definitely 
a year of transition. You'll probably see the transition continue 
into 1999.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Patti Archuletta, director of the California Film Commission,  
cautioned the signs of a production slowdown could be merely ``a 
message, a signal we need to pay attention to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She suggested the entertainment industry is in a state of flux --  
``with winners and losers'' -- as a decline in television and movie 
production may be overcome by gains in other entertainment related 
industries, including video games, on-line services and cable. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe there won't be as many people working in the same types  
of jobs in the future, but I think we're smart enough that there 
will be jobs,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In motion pictures, much of the slowdown, observers say, could  
be simply due to a glut of product. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollywood went on a movie-making binge in the 1990s, with the  
number of wide-release films soaring from 120 in 1990 to 156 in 
1996, according to ACNielsen EDI Inc., which tracks the box office. 
That means that by 1996, moviegoers had an average of three new 
movies a week from which to choose. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of wide releases declined to 139 last year, but  
that's still far above the 1990 level and doesn't include the more 
limited release films from the thriving independent scene. 
</P>
<P>
	``This year it's still going to be tremendously competitive, and  
you're still going to see two or three new releases every single 
week of the year,'' said Tom Borys, president of ACNielsen EDI. 
``Are we going into some sort of downward spiral? I don't think 
so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Certainly, the public's hunger for films has steadily increased.  
Attendance has risen from just under 1.2 billion in North America 
in 1990 to nearly 1.5 billion last year, according to another box 
office-tracker, Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	But eating into higher grosses are the even higher costs of  
making movies. The Walt Disney Co., for example, reported last 
month it had an 18 percent drop in earnings in the last quarter, 
with strong box-office results for ``The Waterboy'' and ``A Bug's 
Life'' offset, in part, by rising film production costs. 
</P>
<P>
	At Disney, which is also feeling the effects of the Asian  
financial crisis and costly new ventures, things have been so tight 
that Chairman Michael Eisner had to settle for a 1998 bonus of $5 
million, nearly half his $9.9 million bonus in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Many studios have reduced output. The number of feature film  
production starts in California declined from 637 in 1997 to 510 
last year, the state Film Commission reported. 
</P>
<P>
	In television, location production days for shows and  
commercials were both down last year in Los Angeles County, 
according to the Entertainment Industry Development Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was as if you couldn't do anything wrong in 1997,'' said Ed  
Clare, president of the Production Equipment Rental Association, 
which reported a 30 percent drop in rentals despite increased 
business by its Canadian members. ``A lot of these companies built 
their businesses up, added equipment, added employees. When the 
slowdown came, many had to pull the plug.''

<HEADLINE> Help Offered to Stiffed Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- From coast to coast, people, corporations and  
universities have donated thousands of dollars to help 51 of the 
nation's top students who were stiffed by a Houston company that 
had promised them $10,000 college scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the donations, many students might have to transfer to  
less-expensive schools unless they scrape up enough money to fill 
the void left by AdamsVision USA. The company's owner, Val Adams, a 
convicted bogus-check writer, insisted he is still trying to raise 
the money. 
</P>
<P>
	Melissa Bowlin of Palmer, Alaska, was counting on the  
AdamsVision scholarship to help pay the $30,000 annual tuition and 
board at Cornell University. This week, an Alaska woman anonymously 
donated $1,000 to help Ms. Bowlin, a biology major who hopes to 
study endangered birds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could probably stay for another year, but beyond that we're  
really worried,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, AdamsVision promised the scholarships, $10,000 a  
year, renewable for four years, to one student from every state and 
Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	The winners, many of them National Merit Scholars who had  
graduated first in their class, had to have at least a 3.0 
grade-point average and a combined SAT score of 1160 or higher. 
Some students lost out on other scholarships after winning one so 
large. 
</P>
<P>
	But in January, the company sent letters to each student saying  
it would ``not be financially capable'' of honoring the 
scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
	Adams has insisted that the scholarship effort was on the level.  
He noted that the students were not asked to pay an application fee 
or provide any money, something the students and their parents 
confirm. 
</P>
<P>
	After reading an Associated Press story about the students'  
plight, Rick Latman, president of Seattle-based Microworkz Computer 
Corp., offered computers to each of the 51 students. ``I just 
wanted to do something,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Crewman Testifies in Cable Car Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A crewman in the Marine jet that  
severed an Italian ski gondola cable in an accident that killed 20 
people last year told jurors he never thought the plane was flying 
too low. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Chandler Seagraves testified Thursday in the court-martial  
of Capt. Richard Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo, Calif., the pilot of 
the EA-6B Prowler. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby is charged with 20 counts of involuntary manslaughter and  
could spend the rest of his life in prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Seagraves said the flight was uneventful until the accident and  
that he would have protested if Ashby had done something dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
	``My life is in his hands. I don't want to die any more than  
anybody else,'' said Seagraves, the jet's electronic 
countermeasures officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors claim Ashby deliberately flew too low and too fast,  
but Seagraves disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never felt low during that flight,'' he said. ``There's not  
a pilot anywhere who can maintain altitude perfectly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby's attorneys say the Mount Cermis ski lift wasn't on his  
government-issued map, the altimeter on the jet malfunctioned and 
that he experienced an optical illusion that made him think he was 
flying higher than he really was. The cable was struck at 360 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Seagraves and another crewman, Capt. William Raney, had faced  
the same charges as Ashby and the jet's navigator, Capt. Joseph 
Schweitzer. The charges against Seagraves and Raney were dismissed, 
and each was ordered to testify under a grant of immunity from 
prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer, 31, is scheduled for trial in March.  
</P>
<P>
	When the trial opened, prosecutors said they would show Ashby  
performed a 360-degree roll during the flight against regulations. 
Seagraves, however, said Ashby performed a standard maneuver 
designed to evade enemy radar. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said a problem with the jet's altimeter before it  
entered the low-level route through the mountains had been 
corrected. However, he said he never heard an alarm that should 
have indicated the plane was flying lower than an 800-foot 
threshold set by Ashby. 
</P>
<P>
	Seagraves said he felt the plane shiver when it struck the  
cable. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt Captain Ashby maneuver the aircraft downward as if he  
was trying to miss something. I felt the impact,'' he said, 
snapping his fingers. ``There was a thud, a vibration in the 
airplane.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Immediately after the jet hit the cable, Schweitzer shouted,  
``Climb! Climb! Climb!'' Seagraves said. 
</P>
<P>
	He praised Ashby for keeping control of the damaged plane and  
landing it safely. ``Captain Ashby did a tremendous job,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> US: Compaq Gave Microsoft Secrets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. repeatedly has pointed to tiny  
Be Inc. when the software giant, during its antitrust trial, has 
needed examples of the competition it faces in selling computer 
operating systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Denying the government's claim that it is a monopoly, Microsoft  
contends it cannot rest easy because of the possible success of 
Be's computer software, which even Microsoft praised as ``designed 
with special capabilities'' for software programs ``certain to be 
major growth areas in the years ahead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So it was particularly dramatic Thursday when the government  
disclosed that the world's largest computer maker, Compaq Computer 
Corp., which is testifying in support of Microsoft, recently passed 
secret information to Microsoft that it obtained from Be under a 
confidentiality promise. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyer David Boies made the accusation as he  
tried to discredit Compaq's testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq's witness, John T. Rose, a senior vice president, said he  
was unaware that his company had passed along to Microsoft any 
confidential information. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jean-Louis Gassee, the chairman and chief executive officer  
for Be, based in Menlo Park, Calif., said in a telephone interview 
later with The Associated Press that Compaq had called him ``a 
little embarrassed'' about three months ago confessing what it 
described as an inadvertent disclosure to Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	``Microsoft is such a threat to the livelihood of PC (makers),  
there is a climate of fear,'' Gassee said. ``They will do things 
almost instinctively to propitiate Microsoft.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bois charged that ``Microsoft has such power in the industry  
that Compaq feels it is in Compaq's interest to share the details 
of confidential negotiations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for Compaq, William Coston, called the accusation a  
``cheap trial stunt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ended the matter  
after Rose denied any knowledge of a disclosure. But Jackson seemed 
content with assurances from Boies when he asked, ``You have a 
good-faith basis for that?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another Compaq lawyer, Tom Siekman, said outside the courtroom  
that the company ``takes its obligations very, very seriously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not appropriate to make an allegation of this kind in  
open court,'' said Siekman, who added that Compaq was 
investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	The government alleges that Microsoft violated antitrust laws by  
using its monopoly power to dissuade Compaq and others from doing 
business with its software rivals. Microsoft denies it possesses 
monopoly power. 
</P>
<P>
	Boies' allegation was not the only problem facing Compaq on  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge openly questioned the credibility of a key piece of  
its evidence, saying a disparity over dates in a particular 
contract with Microsoft ``makes no sense at all if this was a 
genuine agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson noted that the agreement in question was dated August  
1995 but was not signed or executed until June 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq is widely believed to enjoy among the lowest prices for  
its Windows operating system that Microsoft charges any computer 
maker, but the actual costs are among the industry's most closely 
guarded secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	The government showed e-mail Thursday disclosing that Compaq and  
Microsoft actually signed two new price contracts last spring, less 
than two months before the government filed its antitrust case. 
</P>
<P>
	One contract, with more favorable terms toward Compaq,  
immediately replaced the other. Boies did not suggest a reason for 
dual contracts, but noted: ``If you're not going to use the false 
(contract) then there's no reason to have it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The e-mail said Compaq wanted dual contracts ``given Microsoft's  
concern that our agreement be 'defendable' to other (computer 
makers) and the Department of Justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rose asserted that Compaq was trying to hide details of the  
price it negotiated from its own employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has charged that Microsoft's ability to use  
Windows prices to discriminate among computer makers illustrates 
its monopoly power. 
</P>
<P>
	A Microsoft spokesman, Jim Cullinan, called it ``outrageous'' to  
suggest that the relatively low price for Windows given to Compaq 
was at all related to the company's offer to testify on its behalf 
during the antitrust trial.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Soccer star Jorge Campos expressed hope  
Friday that his father's kidnapping ordeal would end and thanked 
those who had offered support. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope this will be resolved soon,'' Campos told reporters in  
the first meeting with the press since the abduction on Wednesday 
of his father, Alvaro. 
</P>
<P>
	The goalkeeper spoke after a practice session here with the  
Pumas of the National Autonomous University, his team in Mexico's 
top soccer league. 
</P>
<P>
	Campos had raced back to Mexico on Thursday from Hong Kong,  
where he had accompanied the national team to a soccer tournament. 
But there were contradictory accounts of what he has done since. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials and relatives in Acapulco confirmed that he had gone  
to the Pacific Coast resort city, his hometown, Thursday evening. 
But on Friday, Campos denied having gone there. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's Notimex news agency quoted Campos' brother,  
Gerardo, as saying that Campos would be in charge of negotiating 
with the kidnappers. Several local newspapers said a $1 million 
ransom had been demanded.

	OVENTIC, Mexico (AP) -- A Roman Catholic bishop who played a key  
role in seeking a peace accord between the government and the 
Zapatista rebels in Chiapas said Friday he will leave the southern 
state when he retires in November. 
</P>
<P>
	``I consider it appropriate to leave because it will be best not  
to cast a shadow over my successor in the running of the diocese,'' 
said Bishop Samuel Ruiz, who reaches the mandatory retirement age 
of 75 in November. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruiz visited Oventic, a hamlet in the Chiapas highlands, to say  
goodbye to the largely indigenous population that sympathizes with 
the Zapatista National Liberation Army, which led a brief uprising 
in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruiz played a leading negotiating role after the Jan. 1, 1994  
rebellion by the Zapatistas. A cease-fire took hold within two 
weeks after more than 200 people had died, and Ruiz mediated the 
first peace talks in February 1994.

	GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- A day after freeing a priest arrested in  
the slaying of a Roman Catholic bishop, a judge in Guatemala 
questioned a witness who said he saw a man leave the murder scene 
in a government car. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Henry Monroy questioned taxi driver Jorge Diego Mendez on  
Thursday. Mendez said that on the night of Bishop Juan Gerardi's 
slaying, he saw a shirtless man leave the murder scene -- the San 
Sebastian parish house -- and get into a white car with government 
license plates. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he saw another, brown car nearby with five armed men  
inside. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerardi, 75, was bludgeoned to death on April 26, 1998, two days  
after presenting a four-volume church report blaming the army for 
most human rights abuses committed during Guatemala's 36-year civil 
war, which ended in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The only major suspect arrested so far in the case has been the  
Rev. Mario Orantes Najera, a priest who worked with Gerardi. But 
evidence against him was thin and church and human rights groups 
complained earlier investigators had failed to consider a possible 
link to the military.

	CUERNAVACA, Mexico (AP) -- Three men were arrested and two others  
were being sought in the slaying of the husband of a 
Belgian-Italian princess, Mexican prosecutors said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Luis Reina Corbalan, 59, an Argentine-born law professor, was  
found strangled to death with a bathrobe belt in an upper-class 
neighborhood in this resort city on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Morelos state Attorney General Jose Leonardo Castillo said  
police had detained Reina Corbalan's gardener, chauffeur and a 
third man whom he did not identify. No charges had been filed. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the princess was not considered a suspect as she was out  
of the country at the time of the killing, and he said there were 
no plans to question her. She is the daughter of Princess Marie 
Jose of Belgium and former King Umberto II of Italy.

	``The accusations against Brazil are totally unfounded,'' said  
Valdemar Carneiro Leao, head the Foreign Ministry's economic

<P>
	The U.S. Commerce Department announced last week that Brazilian  
steel exports would be subject to fines and duties because of the 
alleged subsidies and dumping.

<HEADLINE> Judge OKs Microsoft Version of Java </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. can develop its own  
version of Sun Microsystems' Java programming language as long as 
it doesn't violate Sun's copyright, a federal judge ruled Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Over Sun's objection, U.S. District Judge Ronald Whyte clarified  
an injunction he issued last November that required Microsoft to 
rewrite parts of its Windows 98 operating system to conform with 
Sun's version of Java. Microsoft has also appealed that injunction 
to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	In Friday's order, Whyte said his injunction applied only to  
Microsoft software derived from a Sun program code or documentation 
licensed to Microsoft under its contract with Sun. 
</P>
<P>
	The injunction does not forbid ``independently developed Java  
tools products which infringe no Sun copyright,'' Whyte wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	He declined to rule on Sun's argument that Microsoft's shipment  
of an independently developed Java compiler would violate the 
companies' contract. That issue will be addressed at a hearing 
March 12, Sun spokeswoman Lisa Poulson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun, based in Palo Alto, Calif., has tried to promote its form  
of Java as a universal programming language that can be used with 
any form of software. The company's lawsuit contends Microsoft, 
using its licensed version of Java, designed a Windows-only form 
that was incompatible with rival software, in violation of the 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft spokesman Jim Cullinan said the company was pleased  
with Whyte's order. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that Microsoft, like every other company, has the  
freedom to innovate,'' he said. ``This ruling gives us the option 
of developing independent Java development if we so choose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Poulson, Sun's spokeswoman, stressed the language in Whyte's  
order that prohibits Microsoft from distributing any product that 
used computer program code derived from any Sun copyrighted program 
code or documentation for Java. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we've got some strong protections and we're pleased to  
have them,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Confined Lobbyist Fights Limits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Bruce Bereano is still one of Maryland's most  
prominent lobbyists, despite his fraud conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Bereano spent his days at the Statehouse this week, lobbying  
lawmakers on behalf of such clients as Comcast Cablevision and 
supermarket giant Safeway. He spent his nights serving out the 
fraud sentence in a halfway house. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his arguments that he needs to go to the Statehouse to  
do his job, officials at the halfway house ruled Friday that he 
must only work out of his Annapolis law firm, The Washington Post 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Bereano will fight the decision.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's a lobbyist. That's what he does,'' his lawyer, Joshua  
Treem, told The Associated Press on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was probation officer Renata Ramsburg who confined Bereano to  
the Volunteers of America halfway house. Last week, she said 
letting Bereano lobby as part of his work-release sent the wrong 
message to other lobbyists. 
</P>
<P>
	House officials on Friday agreed, deciding that Bereano had  
violated the terms of his work-release. 
</P>
<P>
	Treem questioned whether Ms. Ramsburg had the authority to  
impose the restriction. He said U.S. District Judge William 
Nickerson had approved Bereano's lobbying. 
</P>
<P>
	Bereano, once the highest-paid lobbyist in the state who made  
more than $1 million a year, was convicted in 1994 of mail fraud 
for sending $16,000 in phony bills to his lobbying clients. Many of 
Bereano's clients testified on his behalf, asking that he not be 
sent to prison, and stuck with him afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors also said he funneled the money through employees  
and family members to legislative candidates during the 1990 
elections, but he was never charged because the statute of 
limitations expired. 
</P>
<P>
	Nickerson originally sentenced Bereano to five years' probation.  
Bereano appealed, hoping to get the conviction overturned, but 
instead the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals ordered Nickerson to 
impose a tougher sentence, saying the judge did not follow federal 
guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, Nickerson sentenced Bereano to five months in a  
halfway house, followed by five months of home detention and three 
years probation. 
</P>
<P>
	Bereano has appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.

<HEADLINE> Teen Convicted in Rival's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LYONS, N.Y. (AP) -- A woman was convicted of manslaughter Friday  
for running her car over a romantic rival after they had tussled 
all summer for the affections of a young man. 
</P>
<P>
	Polly Smith, 18, avoided a murder conviction but could get up to  
25 years in prison at her sentencing scheduled for April 13. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith sobbed quietly as the verdict was read and she was taken  
into custody. She had been free on bail. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith struck Amanda Leoni, 18, on a street in this Erie Canal  
village in August. She then hit the brake and ran over her again, 
according to witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Several teen-agers testified that Smith made it clear she  
intended to kill Leoni, though she told police she didn't mean to 
hit Leoni, only to scare her. 
</P>
<P>
	Her defense lawyer dismissed the threats as ``trash talk,''  
pointing out that Smith had jumped out of her car after the 
collision and screamed ```Oh my God, I didn't mean to hit her, I'm 
sorry.''' 
</P>
<P>
	But prosecutor Richard Healy maintained Smith was ``in a fit of  
jealous rage.'' She had been dating Justin Smith, 20, on and off 
for over a year when Leoni, returning home from her first year in 
college, began seeing him as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith tried to scare her off, allegedly kicking and punching her  
on one occasion, then forced a showdown the night of Aug. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	The women had an argument during which Justin Smith told Leoni  
he was finished with her. As Leoni walked away, Smith hit the 
accelerator and struck her from behind.

<HEADLINE> GM Predicts Dodgers-Yankees Matchup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VERO BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Kevin Malone had a bold prediction  
Friday: the first Yankees-Dodgers World Series since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	``They'll need Roger when they play us in the Fall Classic in  
October,'' the Los Angeles general manager said. ``It'll be fun. It 
will be nice to see Kevin Brown and Roger Clemens matched up in 
October.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With much of baseball focusing on Brown and his record $105  
million, seven-year contract, the pitcher worked out at spring 
training with the Dodgers for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't made a lot of friends and I don't think people are  
going to take it easy on us,'' Malone said. ``We'll have to step it 
up a notch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Malone spent the first day of camp discussing his team's high  
hopes and responding to criticism of Brown's contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, who turns 34 next month, went 18-7 with a 2.38 ERA with  
257 strikeouts in 257 innings for San Diego last year. He is 51-26 
with a 2.33 ERA during he past three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dodgers expect Brown's work ethic and World Series  
experience to help improve the mental toughness of the team's other 
pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
	``My role hasn't changed, it's to go out and do what I can on  
the field,'' he said. ``As far as the clubhouse ... guys learn from 
each other. Everybody's got something to bring to the table.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said he's not worried about the pressure caused by the  
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always said I'm my own worst critic,'' Brown said. ``I  
don't need the press or anyone to push me. I'll do it myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As soon as Brown's signing was announced in December, executives  
throughout the sport ripped the Dodgers for becoming the first team 
ever to pay someone $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expected it, but not to that degree,'' Malone said. ``We  
didn't realize people would be so jealous and envious, and that 
they'd be so public about it. ... We were criticized for making the 
team better. Some people who criticize, they're trying to put their 
own inadequacies and shortcomings on someone else. I didn't take it 
personally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown heads a starting rotation that also will include four of  
the following five: left-hander Carlos Perez and right-handers Chan 
Ho Park, Ismael Valdes, Darren Dreifort and Dave Mlicki. 
</P>
<P>
	After watching each of those starters work briefly Friday, new  
Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said this rotation potentially could 
develop into the best he's ever managed. 
</P>
<P>
	When Johnson won a World Series with the New York Mets in 1986,  
starters Dwight Gooden, Ron Darling, Bobby Ojeda and Sid Fernandez 
combined to go 66-23. 
</P>
<P>
	Right-hander Luke Prokopec and closer Jeff Shaw were the only  
pitchers not in camp Friday. Prokopec was still in Australia 
working out some visa problems and may arrive Saturday. Shaw is 
working out in his home at Washington Court House, Ohio, while his 
wife, Julie, is expecting a baby any day.

popular soft drink, it's going to market its own brand of the real

<P>
	Coke announced Friday that it will sell its first bottled water  
in the United States, and Dasani is it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Suffice it to say, we think this is the right time for us to  
get into this market and that Dasani is the right brand,'' said 
Coke spokesman Scott Jacobson. 
</P>
<P>
	The water, to be sold in a light blue plastic bottle, is  
expected to be available nationwide and in Canada before this 
summer. The name, developed over months, doesn't derive from any 
specific origin but is meant to convey ``a clean, fresh taste,'' 
Jacobson said. (It is pronounced duh-SAW'-nee.) 
</P>
<P>
	An advertising campaign will back the rollout as Coke plunges  
into a hot market. Bottled water has outpaced the growth of soft 
drinks, particularly in convenience stores, where water sales have 
increased as much as 30 percent in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We sell a lot of bottled water, especially in the  
summertime,'' said Steve Tessereau, who manages a busy Texaco 
station near the Town Center Mall in suburban Cobb County. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's a Coke brand, it's going to sell,'' Tessereau said of  
Dasani. ``Why they waited five or six years to get into it, I don't 
know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coke has a water brand, BonAqua, overseas, but the company has  
been reluctant to add water to its U.S. line, preferring to 
encourage daily consumption of Coke, Sprite and its other flavored 
soft drinks. It just launched a new advertising campaign and 
promotions for Diet Coke. 
</P>
<P>
	But to meet increased demand for alternatives among health- and  
weight-conscious Americans, Coke in recent years has broadened its 
offerings to include sports and fruit drinks and juices. 
</P>
<P>
	As recently as last month, M. Douglas Ivester, the company's  
chairman and chief executive, said Coke remained leery about water. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's an awful lot of water sold in the world ... there's  
not an awful lot of money made selling water,'' Ivester told a 
Rotary Club luncheon. ``We're in this business for profitable 
growth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bottled water sales have jumped from $2.65 billion in 1990 to  
$4.3 billion last year, when sales grew nearly 10 percent over 
1997. The $56.3 billion carbonated soft drink market grew by only 3 
percent last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Soft-drink rival Pepsi-Cola Co. has done well in the five years  
since introducing its Aquafina, which has become the leading water 
brand in convenience stores. 
</P>
<P>
	John Sicher, publisher of the trade journal Beverage Digest,  
expects Coke's water venture will take off quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would anticipate that within one or two years, Dasani will  
be one of the leaders in bottled waters,'' Sicher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier reports about Coke's water project indicated the water  
will come from wells or taps, then be purified, with minerals such 
as potassium or magnesium added. 
</P>
<P>
	True to the Coke secret-formula tradition, Jacobson wouldn't  
give details of Dasani's composition, other than to say it will be 
purified, non-carbonated water enhanced with minerals for taste.

<HEADLINE> Hudek Loses Arbitration With Reds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARASOTA, Fla. (AP) -- John Hudek lost his salary arbitration  
case against the Cincinnati Reds on Friday and will get $800,000 
rather than his request for $1.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Hudek was 5-6 with a 3.09 ERA in 58 relief appearances for the  
New York Mets and the Reds last year and made $499,000. The 
32-year-old right-hander came to the Reds on July 3 in a trade for 
Lenny Harris. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision was made by arbitrators Stephen Goldberg, Roger  
Abrams and I.B. Hellburn, who heard the case Thursday in Tampa, 
Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Outfielder Michael Tucker was the only other Reds player who  
filed for arbitration, but he settled Feb. 9 for a $1.6 million, 
one-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners have won seven of nine cases decided this year, with  
decisions pending on the last two hearings: Baltimore catcher 
Charles Johnson and Minnesota outfielder Matt Lawton.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Higher, Tokyo Shares Lower / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Fresh comments from Japanese officials in favor of  
a weaker yen pushed the dollar higher ahead of a meeting of major 
industrialized nations over the weekend. Tokyo share prices closed 
lower. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.06 yen in late afternoon trading, up 1.38  
yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and also above its late New York 
level of 119.81 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 48.75 points,  
or 0.34 percent, closing the week at 14,098.04 points. On Thursday, 
the index slipped 11.88 points, or 0.08 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The greenback was buoyed by remarks from senior Japanese  
officials which signaled support for the U.S. currency's recent 
surge against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said today that Japan has no  
plans to discuss the dollar-yen rate a meeting this weekend of 
finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of Seven 
nations, or G-7. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't intend to bring it up,'' Miyazawa told Dow Jones  
Newswires. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Eisuke Sakakibara, vice finance minister and a chief  
currency market troubleshooter dubbed ``Mr. Yen,'' said Japan 
accepted a weaker yen and that the Bank of Japan would likely move 
to ease monetary policy further. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar moved as high as 120.75 yen in early trading, but  
profit-taking and selling by Japanese life insurance companies 
trimmed some of its initial gains, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``People aren't sure what's coming out of the G-7 meeting, so  
it's only natural that they'll want to pocket their profits now,'' 
said Hirokazu Note, chief foreign exchange dealer at Sumitomo Bank 
Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar's strength followed its rise in New York, where it  
briefly broke through 120 yen for the first time since Dec. 8. 
</P>
<P>
	The greenback has been steadily rising against the yen this week  
following various moves by Japan's financial authorities to lower 
long-term interest rates, which had soared in recent trading and 
threatened to choke off an economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. funds led a dollar-buying spree today after the Japanese  
Finance Ministry's Trust Fund Bureau purchased $831 million in 
government bonds outright, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchase had been expected. It was part of the Finance  
Ministry's package of steps unveiled Tuesday to ease pressure on 
the bond market. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar fell as low 119.42 yen and rose as high as 120.75 yen  
in today's trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 134.17 yen, up form  
133.81 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, investors were reluctant to trade  
ahead of the G-7 meeting over the weekend and prior to the book 
closing for many Japanese companies at the end of the fiscal year 
on March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated at 402 million shares changed hands on the  
exchange's first section, up from Thursday's 348 million shares. 
Decliners outnumbered advancers 719 to 401, with 171 issues closing 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section fell 0.77 points, or 0.07 percent, to 1,094.50. The 
TOPIX had shed 1.81 points, or 0.16 percent, the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.760 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.875 
percent, driving its price up to 100.32 yen from 99.40 yen.

<HEADLINE> Independent Counsel Law May Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Independent Counsel Act has problems and  
needs some changes, says Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder, who 
is supervising the Justice Department's review of the 
Watergate-inspired law. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a statute that has some problems and needs some work, I  
think at a minimum,'' Holder told a news conference Thursday. With 
the law's expiration this summer, ``we have an opportunity ... at a 
minimum, to tinker with it,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Holder would not identify either the problems he sees or the  
changes he wants. But his boss, Attorney General Janet Reno, has 
suggested several times that an amendment is needed to force 
independent counsels to live within budgets, like all other 
government officials. 
</P>
<P>
	A Justice study group that Holder heads is reviewing the  
experience with the law and will make recommendations to Reno in a 
week to 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point, I don't think I can safely say that anything  
has been ruled out'' as a possible administration position, Holder 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've considered ... everything from having the act repassed  
in its present form to simply letting it lapse, and we've 
considered everything in between,'' Holder said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration likely will agree on a formal  
recommendation either before Holder testifies about the act to a 
House subcommittee next week or before Reno appears in mid-March at 
a Senate committee hearing on it, Holder added. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., chairman of that panel, recently  
predicted the law's demise. That largely is because of Republican 
anger over Reno's refusal to have an independent counsel take over 
the Justice Department investigation of campaign financing during 
the 1996 presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno has named seven independent counsels to investigate top  
administration officials over 10 different matters -- more than any 
of her predecessors. Some Justice officials have been dismayed by 
what they consider overreaching by some of these counsels. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Democrats in Congress, angered over the conduct of counsel  
Kenneth Starr's investigation of Clinton, have urged limiting or 
even killing the act. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Bar Association, long a supporter of the law,  
recently voted to recommend its demise. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department has informed Starr that it intends to  
open an investigation of his dealings with former White House 
intern Monica Lewinsky, officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other issues, the investigation will examine allegations  
that Starr's deputies broke department rules by offering her 
immunity on condition she not discuss it with her attorney and that 
Starr and his aides may have had contacts with lawyers for Paula 
Jones, who was suing Clinton for sexual harassment, that were not 
disclosed when he obtained Reno's approval to investigate the 
Lewinsky case, officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr has defended his office's conduct and argued that any such  
inquiry should be conducted by an outsider rather than the 
department's internal watchdog agency, the Office of Professional 
Responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Holder refused to confirm any investigation of Starr.  
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't want to comment on whether or not we are doing an  
investigation, where we stand in making that decision, but we would 
leave all of our options open as to who might do such an 
investigation if one were to be done,'' Holder said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other department officials, requesting anonymity, said Reno has  
ordered Justice Inspector General Michael Browmich to investigate 
how word of the intended inquiry on Starr leaked to the news media.

<HEADLINE> FAA Program Could Save $250 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Faced with a $250 million budget shortfall,  
the Federal Aviation Administration has adopted an austerity 
program that will indefinitely delay hiring some personnel for a 
new airline inspection program. 
</P>
<P>
	FAA Administrator Jane Garvey has also banned all non-training  
travel, all hiring of outside contractors and any purchase of 
office space or furniture, effective with a Feb. 3 agency 
memorandum. Agency officials said safety programs were exempted, so 
passenger protection will not be compromised. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency, which is charged with overseeing the nation's  
aviation system, faces the shortfall because of miscalculations in 
budgeting, a court ruling that banned implementation of $90 million 
in new overflight fees, and a new contract with air controllers 
that will require $129 million in pay raises. 
</P>
<P>
	In one case, the FAA set aside $5 million for work on a new  
satellite-based air navigation system, but program managers need 
$22 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Taken together, they will produce a $250 million gap in the  
agency's $5.5 billion operations budget, which must last until the 
federal government's fiscal year ends Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're taking steps to live within the money we have available,  
not unlike the budgeting choices that people make in their daily 
lives,'' said FAA spokesman Eliot Brenner. 
</P>
<P>
	Aviation Week &AMP; Space Technology, which reported word of the  
shortfall in its Feb. 22 edition, quoted an unidentified senior 
congressional aviation aide as questioning whether the FAA was 
cutting back on airline inspectors because the United States has 
gone more than a year without a commercial aviation fatality. 
</P>
<P>
	Brenner conceded the budget shortfall would prevent the agency  
from filling about 200 vacancies anticipated this year in its 
6,300-person regulation-and-certification work force. About 100 of 
them would be airline inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
	The funding shortage will also crimp plans to hire a complete  
set of back-room data analysts anticipated under a new airline 
inspection program announced last year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Brenner said there will still be a sufficient corps of  
front-line inspectors and passenger safety won't be jeopardized. 
</P>
<P>
	``Safety is No. 1; it is first and foremost,'' he said. ``These  
are internal efficiencies and savings we are undertaking and there 
will be no impact on safety.''

<HEADLINE> Senate Candidates Raise Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The impeachment issue may haunt some  
Republican senators seeking re-election in 2000, but they will 
still benefit from incumbents' insurance: lots of campaign cash, 
raised early. 
</P>
<P>
	The 19 Republican senators whose terms expire in two years  
raised $6.5 million over the last half of 1998, giving them a 
strong head start over challengers, according to Federal Election 
Commission records. Eleven Democratic senators up for re-election 
in 2000 raised $1.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The fund-raising advantage that incumbents enjoy could help  
shield Republicans being targeted because of their votes to oust 
President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Democrats consider Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania,  
who squeaked through his last race with just 49 percent of the 
ballots cast, to be vulnerable. Santorum raised $617,761 over six 
months and started 1999 with $1.6 million in his campaign bank 
account. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've just got to be prepared,'' Santorum said. ``I wasn't a  
Boy Scout, but I subscribe to their credo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Santorum and other Republican senators who voted to convict  
Clinton, while polls indicated a majority of Americans wanted him 
acquitted, are preparing to face the issue in statewide campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll obviously be judged on it,'' said Sen. Spencer Abraham of  
Michigan, who voted to convict on both counts of perjury and 
obstruction of justice. Abraham had $1.2 million in his campaign 
bank account as this year began. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Republican considered vulnerable, Minnesota Sen. Rod  
Grams, said he would ``have to live with this vote'' and expects 
lots of questions from constituents about it. 
</P>
<P>
	Grams, who received 49 percent of the vote in winning his first  
six-year term in 1994, raised $283,435 in the last six months of 
1998 and ended the year with $139,863 in his campaign account. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're raising money early, it puts you in a better  
position against any challenger,'' said Stuart Roy, a spokesman for 
the National Republican Senatorial Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Just as important, Democratic consultant Peter Fenn said, a  
flush campaign account may scare off potential opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hope for the Republicans is they can steamroll the  
Democrats in some of these big expensive states,'' Fenn said. 
``Their hope is that they can discourage good candidates from 
running.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Robert Torricelli of New Jersey, chairman of the Democratic  
Senatorial Campaign Committee, said the party didn't plan to make 
an issue of impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he said, ``any time a United States senator votes in a  
highly visible and important issue at variance with the 
overwhelming majority of their constituents, there's obviously 
going to be political vulnerability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One liberal group, People for the American Way, is planning to  
spend $5 million through its political action committee for 
advertisements and voter drives targeting Republicans who supported 
impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	The group also hopes to encourage strong challengers to come  
forward by putting together lists of potential supporters and 
campaign contributors from its membership and those of like-minded 
organizations, said the group's president, Carole Shields. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest Federal Election Commission records show Sen. Bill  
Frist, R-Tenn., was the biggest fund-raiser among the 33 senators 
whose terms expire in 2001. He raised $1.4 million during the last 
half of 1998, ending the year with $2.4 million in the bank. 
Abraham was second in fund raising, bringing in $731,730 from July 
through December, and Santorum was third. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democrat who raised the most was Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, who  
raised $501,234. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Republican Kay Bailey Hutchison had the most money on hand  
at the end of the year: $4.7 million. The Democrat with the most 
cash was Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut: $1.2 million, sixth on 
the overall list. 
</P>
<P>
	Three moderate Republicans who face re-election next year -- John  
Chafee of Rhode Island, Olympia Snowe of Maine and James Jeffords 
of Vermont -- voted to acquit Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	In Pennsylvania, a state senator who is seeking the Democratic  
nomination to take on Santorum quickly criticized his votes of 
``guilty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Rick Santorum put partisanship ahead of Pennsylvania,'' said  
Allyson Schwartz, who had a healthy $303,910 in her own campaign 
account at the end of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Santorum said he expects voters to consider his position on  
Clinton just as they would weigh his other votes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no problems with any constituent of mine asking me  
about it, questioning me about it, and factoring that in as to 
whether they believe that I should continue to serve in the 
Senate,'' Santorum said.

<HEADLINE> Japan Advances 1999 Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's lower house of parliament passed a record  
budget Friday that includes massive spending hikes and tax cuts, 
but doubts remained about what long-term economic benefits it would 
produce. 
</P>
<P>
	The $682.5 billion budget for the fiscal year 1999 was designed  
to trigger growth in Japan's economy, which is suffering from a 
deep banking crisis and slumping domestic demand. 
</P>
<P>
	However, many experts say that the quick fix solution of tax  
cuts and public works outlays fails to address fundamental flaws in 
the economy that must be rectified in order to generate a genuine 
rebound in the world's second largest economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't address any of the structural problems in the  
economy, in fact it does exactly the opposite,'' said Ron Bevacqua, 
an economist at Merrill Lynch in Tokyo. ``It allows them to support 
the economy and avoid structural change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say that pouring public funds into the economy could  
stall the painful but necessary process of making industries more 
efficient and could dangerously inflate Japan's already staggering 
national debt load. 
</P>
<P>
	The new budget boosts government spending by 5.4 percent. It  
calls for $83.3 billion in new public works spending and is twinned 
with a plan to slash taxes by $75 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's cumulative national debt is already larger than its  
gross domestic product. The U.S. national debt, by contrast, is 
just half its GDP. 
</P>
<P>
	But the government has abandoned ambitions of fiscal austerity  
since Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi -- who has vowed to engineer 
Japan's return to economic growth in fiscal 1999 -- took office last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, the government issued a report saying Japan's  
economic prospects remain grim as workers cut back on spending amid 
falling wages and near record-high unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
	The situation has deteriorated to such an extent that Japan's  
central bank last week cut a key interest rate to close to zero 
percent in an effort to spur lending to cash-strapped corporations. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed budget calls for the government to issue $259  
billion worth of new bonds -- an amount equal to 37.9 percent of the 
budget itself -- to cover the massive spending package. 
</P>
<P>
	This isn't Japan's first attempt to spend its way out of  
recession. Last summer, Parliament added $38 billion to its 1998 
budget to pay for tax cuts and public works projects to stimulate 
the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	And last month, the government began handing out $5.8 billion  
worth of shopping vouchers to the elderly and people with young 
children in an attempt to prod tightfisted consumers to spend. 
</P>
<P>
	Military spending will slip 0.2 percent as Tokyo cancels or  
postpones purchases of new ships and aircraft. But the budget adds 
$8 million to begin study of a joint ballistic missile defense 
system with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Approval in the powerful lower house for the fiscal 1999 budget  
ensures it will be enacted in its present version on March 21, even 
if the weaker upper house rejects the package in a symbolic vote. 
The fiscal year begins on April 1.

<HEADLINE> Gene Linked to Defects Identified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Researchers at the University of Texas  
Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas have identified a gene 
thought to be responsible for a common heart and facial birth 
defect. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists report in the journal Science, published today, that  
the gene for DiGeorge syndrome has been isolated. The report is an 
important step toward finding new treatments for the serious 
disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	Babies born with DiGeorge syndrome, also known as chromosome 22  
deletion syndrome, can suffer malformations in the heart, the face 
and the thymus, a gland that is a key part of the immune system. 
</P>
<P>
	A team of UT Southwestern researchers led by Dr. Deepak  
Srivastava found that DiGeorge syndrome could be caused when a 
child lacked one of two genes called UDF1. Genes normally come in 
pairs. The researchers found that of 182 DiGeorge syndrome patients 
examined, all lacked one copy of the UDF1 gene. 
</P>
<P>
	Srivastrava said in a statement that lacking one copy of the  
gene may cause a disruption of the proteins critical for the 
formation of heart and facial structures. 
</P>
<P>
	DiGeorge syndrome affects about one in every 4,000 children. It  
is the second most common genetic cause of congenital heart 
defects.

	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Nineteen drug makers have agreed to pay  
more than $176 million to settle a class-action lawsuit alleging 
they gouged the public by overcharging for medicines sold through 
independent pharmacies. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the deal, the companies will furnish $148 million  
worth of brand-name drugs to 300 nonprofit California medical 
clinics that provide drugs to the poor. The manufacturers would pay 
$1.6 million to administer the three-year program. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the settlement, given preliminary court approval Thursday,  
the companies could pay as much as $27 million in fees to attorneys 
for the plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Merck &AMP; Co. would pay the most, more than $19 million, while  
Carter Wallace would pay the least, at $705,000. Nine companies 
named in the suit did not join in the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We view this to be an exceptional result,'' said plaintiffs'  
attorney Bill Bernstein. ``The cost of auditing claims and 
distributing money would eat up so much of the benefit that we 
thought we could do so much public good by distributing through the 
public health community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a federal case filed in Chicago, many of the same companies  
agreed three years ago to pay $700 million to settle allegations 
they conspired to charge pharmacists more than health maintenance 
organizations and other big volume buyers like mail-order drug 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
	Several companies declined to take part in the Chicago  
settlement, and when they went to trial the judge dismissed the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	Although federal law does not allow it, California law allows  
suits to be filed on behalf of so-called ``indirect purchasers'' -- 
in this case prescription drug users who bought the products from 
pharmacies and not directly from the companies themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Last December, a judge approved a $64.3 million settlement  
between 10 states and the District of Columbia and the world's 
largest drug companies in a lawsuit that charged the manufacturers 
conspired to destroy competition between retailers and health 
maintenance organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	Merck spokesman John Doorley said the company settled the  
California case ``rather than risk an inaccurate verdict. We price 
our products competitively and fairly in response to market 
pressure and we never have been involved in any price conspiracy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lowell Weiner, a spokesman for American Home Products Corp.,  
said the companies ``agreed to the settlement solely to avoid the 
burden and expense of litigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bernstein said the suit did not quantify the discrepancy in  
pricing, calling it ``a hotly contested issue.'' He said the 
alleged price gouging affected mostly people who do not belong to 
HMOs or are not covered by government insurance programs such as 
Medicaid. 
</P>
<P>
	But druggists have claimed they paid up to $28.90 for 100  
tablets of a synthetic thyroid drug, while HMOs paid as little as 
$1.43. 
</P>
<P>
	Fred Mayer, a Sausalito, Calif., pharmacist, said the agreement  
``represents a cheap settlement for the drug companies, and they'll 
go on, business as usual, ripping off the public.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bernstein said Mayer's view was not representative of most class  
members. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very substantial and important benefit they're going  
to receive,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Others companies involved in the settlement are:Glaxo Wellcome,  
Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly, Pfizer, SmithKline Beecham, 
Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn, Schering-Plough, Zeneca, Warner Lambert, 
Abbott, Rhone-Poulenc, Dupont, Boehringer Ingleheim and Knoll. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies named in the class-action lawsuit that did not join  
the settlement are: Ciba-Geigy, G.D. Searle, Hoffmann LaRoche, 
Johnson &AMP; Johnson, Marion Merrell Dow, Ortho Pharmaceutical, 
Purdue-Frederick, Forest Laboratories and Sandoz Pharmaceuticals.

<HEADLINE> Julio Franco Signs With Devil Rays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Three-time All-Star Julio Franco,  
who last played in the major leagues two years ago, agreed Friday 
to a minor league contract with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. 
</P>
<P>
	If he makes the major league roster, Franco would get a $400,000  
contract and the chance to earn $100,000 in performance bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
	A career .301 hitter with 141 homers and 981 RBIs in 14 seasons  
with Cleveland, Texas, Milwaukee and the Chicago White Sox, Franco 
played last season for the Chiba Lotte Marines, the last-place team 
in Japan's Pacific League. 
</P>
<P>
	The 37-year-old infielder the 1997 season between the Indians  
and Brewers, hitting .270 with seven homers and 44 RBIs in 120 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	In Japan, he finished 10th in the Pacific League in batting with  
a .290 average. 
</P>
<P>
	Franco, an All-Star three consecutive seasons from 1989-91, is  
scheduled to report to spring training Tuesday. If he doesn't make 
the major league roster, he likely will play for the Devil Rays' 
Mexico City Tigers affiliate.

<HEADLINE> Hoffman Wins Life Achievement Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Fellow actors called him ``a  
volcano of ideas and images,'' and described his films as ``a 
postgraduate course in acting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those were among the praises accorded Dustin Hoffman on Thursday  
night as the American Film Institute presented him with its 27th 
Life Achievement Award. 
</P>
<P>
	``Working with Dusty was like being on center court at  
Wimbledon,'' remarked Jon Voight, Hoffman's co-star in ``Midnight 
Cowboy.'' ``You always knew the ball was going to come back, but 
you never knew what spin was going to be on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the comments at the Beverly Hilton banquet touched on  
Hoffman's notorious penchant for endlessly exploring his film 
characters. He has been known for his forceful debates with 
directors as well, coming to blows with Sydney Pollack during the 
filming of ``Tootsie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In accepting the award, Hoffman, 61, spoke in front of large  
photographs of himself in his wide variety of roles, from Carl 
Bernstein in ``All the President's Men'' to Willy Loman in ``Death 
of a Salesman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been a glorious orgy to be part of this century of  
American film,'' he remarked, close to tears. ``I'm sorry if I hurt 
a few people, but I did it only in the pursuit of what I hoped 
would be real and good.''

<HEADLINE> Taxes Are Taking More Time Than Ever </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Taxpayers who itemize deductions and have even  
modest investment income will spend almost an entire day figuring 
out their tax returns. The time-consuming chore is just one 
consequence of the increasing complexity of the tax code. 
</P>
<P>
	Filling out the 1040 form, Schedule A for the deductions and  
Schedule D for capital gains or losses will take more than 22 
hours, according to the Internal Revenue Service. Those same forms 
took 19.5 hours last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. tax code now stands at more than 1.5 million words and  
climbing, thanks to 1,260 changes enacted by Congress and signed by 
President Clinton in the last two years alone. The IRS had to 
develop 11 new forms and revise 177 others just for this year. 
</P>
<P>
	For millions of taxpayers trying to do their taxes by April 15,  
the complexity is so daunting they are almost forced to seek 
professional help or a computer software program. A new ad campaign 
by H&AMP;R Block sums up the fear factor: ``We Know. Do You?'' 
</P>
<P>
	A major culprit is the trend in the Clinton administration and  
Congress to enact tax credits for various social needs and to 
tinker with such intricate areas as taxes on capital gains from 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time there's a new benefit, it requires an additional  
line to the form and additional forms to compute those credits,'' 
said Sheldon Schwartz, national tax forms and publications director 
at the IRS. ``It's never as easy as we would like.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But for politicians, the appeal of a tax break far outweighs  
such worries. 
</P>
<P>
	``People will push the complexity into the background,'' said  
Rep. Amo Houghton, R-N.Y., a senior member of the tax-writing House 
Ways and Means Committee. ``The credits are politically expedient 
and attractive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year, some taxpayers for the first time can get a $400  
credit for children under age 17 and two education credits -- the 
Hope and Lifetime Learning credits -- that provide up to $1,500 and 
$1,000 respectively for certain post-secondary education expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Sounds relatively simple. But taxpayers claiming the child  
credit must complete an 11-line worksheet, and depending on the 
answers, a second 10-line form to determine if they qualify under 
the income limits. 
</P>
<P>
	The education credits require completion of an 18-line form and  
come with their own book of instructions. 
</P>
<P>
	Another area of difficulty is IRS Schedule D, where investors  
must report their capital gains or losses from investments. Even 
small-scale investors must fill out the 54-line form and navigate 
its confusing maze of tax rates for different investments -- which 
changed dramatically in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Most forbidding of all is the alternative minimum tax. Intended  
to prevent the wealthy from escaping taxes through deductions and 
credits, it now threatens more and more middle-class taxpayers 
because its thresholds were never indexed for inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	This means millions of taxpayers could be required to calculate  
both their regular taxes and their alternative minimum taxes -- and 
pay the higher of the two. That means completing a 12-line IRS 
worksheet to determine if a taxpayer is affected by the alternative 
tax and then a 50-line form to figure out the amount. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who mistakenly believe the alternative tax does not apply  
to them could get an unwelcome surprise from the IRS if they don't 
do both calculations. 
</P>
<P>
	For accountants, tax software firms and preparers such as H&AMP;R  
Block, this uncertainty means big business. The Block ``We Know'' 
ad campaign is aimed at giving people confidence that their taxes 
are being done right, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What it really means is there are more opportunities to save  
money,'' said Linda McDougal of the Kansas City, Mo.-based firm, 
which last year did one-seventh of all individual income tax 
returns. ``To take advantage, you may need the help of a tax 
professional.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The leading tax software, TurboTax from San Diego-based Intuit  
Inc., sold 3.3 million copies last year. Buyers ``are looking to a 
trusted source for advice and to help them do their taxes,'' said 
Monica Muilenburg, director of product marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	All this has happened at a time when the same politicians voting  
for the changes are advocating tax simplification. Make the code 
simple enough that returns for most Americans would be the size of 
a postcard, say flat tax advocates. 
</P>
<P>
	That does not appear likely anytime soon. Clinton's new budget  
proposes numerous credits for such things as care for the elderly 
and disabled, stay-at-home parents and disabled workers. Some have 
Republican support.

<HEADLINE> Woman Sorry for Exposing Men to HIV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEWISBURG, Tenn. (AP) -- An HIV-infected woman who at first said  
she had one-night stands as ``revenge'' for contracting the virus 
from her boyfriend has been sentenced to 26 1/2 years in prison after 
changing her story. 
</P>
<P>
	Pamela Wiser apologized in court Friday to the men she exposed  
and testified that she just couldn't say no when they asked her for 
sex. She denied her earlier statements that she exposed them 
intentionally. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know what I was thinking. I had a lot on my mind,''  
Wiser testified in Circuit Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Wiser, 29, pleaded guilty in December to 22 counts of knowingly  
exposing partners to HIV. 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer, Wiser told reporters she contracted HIV from an  
ex-boyfriend and then had a series of one-night stands with up to 
50 men she met at bars in largely rural Bedford and Marshall 
counties in central Tennessee. She said she never told them she had 
the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
	She retracted that statement, saying she had sex with fewer  
partners and warned them all that she was HIV-positive. On Friday, 
Wiser testified she had sex with ``about 18 men -- no less, no 
more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A 1994 state law makes it a felony to knowingly expose another  
person to HIV, whether or not the victim contracts the virus. 
</P>
<P>
	Five of seven men named in the case testified she did not inform  
them of her medical condition when they had sex with her in 1997 
and 1998. One of the seven -- 30-year-old Barry Cozart -- said he has 
since tested positive for HIV.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Warns Serb Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton declared today that Serbian  
leaders will be ``held accountable'' if peace talks on Kosovo 
collapse and a NATO bombing campaign is needed. He said it would be 
a mistake to extend a Saturday deadline for an accord to be 
reached. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have ordered our aircraft to be ready to act as part of the  
NATO operation,'' Clinton said at a joint White House news 
conference with French President Jacques Chirac. The news 
conference occurred less than 14 hours before the 6 a.m. EST 
deadline that NATO imposed for talks to reach agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spoke against a bleak background, shortly after Yugoslav  
President Slobodan Milosevic refused to meet a U.S. envoy who was 
making a last-ditch attempt in Belgrade to work out a peace plan 
for Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Christopher Hill, the American diplomat mediating the peace  
talks in France, returned empty-handed to the negotiations near 
Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said that, if no accord is reached, NATO was ready to  
pursue ``a strategy that would at least reduce his capacity to take 
further aggressive military action against the Kosovar Albanians.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it would be a mistake to extend the deadline'' for  
Serbs and ethnic Albanians to reach agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton praised ethnic Albanians at the talks for having ``shown  
courage'' but he had stern words for the Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Serbian leaders now have a choice to make,'' he said. ``Or  
they can stonewall. But if they do that, they will be held 
accountable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We now call on both sides to make the tough decisions that are  
necessary, to stop the conflict immediately before more people are 
killed and the war spreads.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For his part, Chirac said that Milosevic ``holds the key'' to  
what happens next. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want our continent to be at peace,'' Chirac said.  
</P>
<P>
	In his first meeting with reporters since he was acquitted by  
the Senate last week in his impeachment trial, Clinton said he 
believed the ``Constitution has been re-ratified'' by the long 
ordeal he and the nation had been through. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course I've learned a lot of personal lessons, most of  
which I've already discussed,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``My advice to future presidents would be to decide what you  
ought to do for the benefit of the country, and work on it hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope the presidency hasn't been harmed. I don't believe it  
has been,'' Clinton said at the East Room news conference. Still, 
he added, ``I don't think I could say this has been good for the 
country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I expect to have two good years here,'' he said. His term  
expires in January 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the American people expect me and the Congress to get  
back to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On other subjects, Clinton:  
</P>
<P>
	--Said his wife, Hillary, would ``do a fabulous job'' should she  
decide to run for a Senate seat from New York in 2000. But he 
emphasized the decision is hers alone to make. He said that, 
whatever her decision, he would do all he could to help ``just as 
she has helped me for 20 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Said he hoped to avoid a trade war with Europe in a controversy  
over Europe's import restrictions on bananas grown in the Western 
Hemisphere. ``We would like a resolution consistent with 
international trade law,'' he said.

Bulls last dropped six in a row while coasting into the 1989 
playoffs during Jordan's fifth NBA season. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing without the retired Jordan, Chicago has held the  
opposition under 100 points in seven straight games this season but 
has yet to break the 100-point barrier. The Bulls last opened a 
season 1-7 when the 1978-79 team went 1-10. 
</P>
<P>
	After Chicago used an 8-0 run to pull even with 2:51 left, the  
teams traded baskets until Richmond hit a fadeaway jumper over 
Randy Brown. The Bulls' Brent Barry then launched a long jumper 
that hit the front of the rim and bounced away. 
</P>
<P>
	Richmond's shot ruined a fine comeback by the Bulls, who fell  
behind by 14 points in the first half after Washington used a 21-0 
run to seemingly take control. 
</P>
<P>
	Calbert Cheaney scored 17 points, Juwan Howard 16 and backup  
center Ben Wallace had a career-high 13 for the Wizards. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry scored 22 for the Bulls, who were playing their third game  
in four nights. Toni Kukoc added 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago led 16-7 before the Wizards scored 21 straight points  
over the final six minutes of the first quarter to go up 28-16. The 
Bulls went 7-for-15 from the floor in the period but committed nine 
turnovers and did not have an offensive rebound. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wizards got points from six players and went 8-for-9 during  
the 21-0 spree. Cheaney had three baskets, Tracy Murray hit a 
3-pointer and Wallace contributed five points. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago closed to 30-23 early in the second period, but Cheaney  
hit a 3-pointer to cap a 9-2 spurt that made it 39-25. Led by 
Barry, who connected twice from beyond the arc, the Bulls fought 
back to within six points at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
	It was 67-64 late in the third quarter before Otis Thorpe and  
Murray made successive baskets to help Washington take an 
eight-point lead into the final period. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* The Bulls reduced their roster to 12 by placing center Bill 
Wennington (sore lower back) and rookie guard Corey Benjamin 
(abdominal strain) on the injured list. ... The Wizards released 
forward Etdrick Bohannon. ... Washington improved to 2-0 at home 
and now has its first winning streak of the season (two). ... 
Murray hit four 3-pointers and has 275 with Washington, one shy of 
tying Michael Adams' franchise record.

<HEADLINE>  Byrd's DNA Found in Suspect's Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- John William King, an alleged white  
supremacist on trial in the dragging death of a black man, had a 
shirt in his apartment with the victim's blood, a DNA analyst for 
the FBI testified Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Another witness testified that the denim shirt, along with jeans  
that had four bloodstains, was worn by Shawn Berry the night James 
Byrd Jr. was killed. Berry, who is to be tried later, shared an 
apartment with King. 
</P>
<P>
	The stain was one of several DNA samples prosecutors say link  
King to the slaying of Byrd, a 49-year-old black man who was 
chained to a pickup truck and dragged three miles along an east 
Texas road last June until his body was torn to pieces. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Baechtel, an FBI forensics examiner, said Byrd's blood was  
found on the tires from the truck prosecutors say was used. 
</P>
<P>
	Altogether, 13 pieces of evidence, including a shoe, a boot and  
a sandal -- one each from King and his two white companions, Berry 
and Lawrence Russell Brewer -- were found to contain Byrd's DNA. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, cigarette butts and a beer bottle found at the  
crime scene were tied to King, Berry or Brewer. It also was 
possible, Baechtel said, that Byrd also smoked at least one of the 
cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
	Baechtel also said a 24 1/2-foot chain, which prosecutors believe  
was attached to Berry's truck and Byrd's ankles during the 
dragging, lacked any DNA evidence. ``We examined every link of that 
chain for presence of blood,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors previously said two of the defendants took it to a  
car wash to clean it. It later was found covered in a hole in the 
ground behind a friend's trailer home where the men used to play 
paintball games. 
</P>
<P>
	King, Berry and Brewer could get the death penalty if convicted.  
</P>
<P>
	In other testimony Friday, a Houston expert on gangs said his  
examination of King's writings indicated the convicted burglar 
wanted to establish a white supremacist group and needed to commit 
a crime to establish credibility. 
</P>
<P>
	William Knox said he was interested by the fact that Byrd's  
headless torso was dumped on a road between a black cemetery and 
church. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's plenty of places here to hide a body and leave it  
undiscovered for long period of time,'' Knox said. ``In this case, 
it was a public place. This was designed to strike terror in the 
community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two witnesses, including Berry's brother, Louis, testified that  
King was especially proud of a tattoo on his arm that depicted the 
silhouette of a black man hanging from a tree. King called it ``my 
little hanging nigger,'' Berry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have cited King's tattoos as evidence of a seething  
hatred of blacks. The tattoos also depict Nazi-style SS lightning 
bolts and the words ``Aryan Pride.'' 
</P>
<P>
	King also didn't like that the bass player in Berry's rock band  
was black, Berry said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It kind of upset me, the attitude,'' Berry said. ``I didn't  
understand that.''

<HEADLINE>  NEC To Cut 15,000 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- NEC Corp., Japan's biggest computer maker, will cut  
15,000 jobs, or nearly 10 percent of its work force, over three 
years as it struggles to recover from slumping sales and massive 
losses at its Packard Bell unit in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	About 6,000 of the job cuts are outside Japan; the company did  
not say how many will hit its 7,000 U.S. workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The downsizing, disclosed on Friday, was the latest corporate  
fallout from the spreading economic crisis in Asia. But NEC's woes 
also were tied to problems endemic to its U.S. unit, which has been 
hammered by price-cutting wars with U.S.-based makers of personal 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	NEC is one of the world's biggest technology companies, with  
products ranging from laptop computers to cellular phones to fiber 
optic networks. It expects to lose up to $1.25 billion this year 
amid the Asian slump, a prolonged recession in Japan and a rising 
yen, which pushes up the price of Japanese products sold abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	To cope with the losses, NEC will slash executives' salaries by  
up to 20 percent, trim capital spending by a fifth, and cut its 
research and development budget by 10 percent. NEC will also sell 
real estate to pay off debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the damage flows from red ink outside Japan. The Packard  
Bell division, based in Sacramento, Calif., lost $500 million last 
year as its share of U.S. PC sales dropped to 7.1 percent from 9.4 
percent in 1997, according to the Dataquest research firm. 
</P>
<P>
	The drop was sparked by a rush of competitors to sell  
inexpensive PCs, a category Packard Bell traditionally has 
dominated. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they were in the marketplace a few years ago they were  
the leading brand in that market and there wasn't much 
competition,'' Dataquest analyst Charles Smulders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, IBM, Compaq, Hewlett-Packard are all in that market.''  
</P>
<P>
	As part of the restructuring, NEC will separate the profitable  
European subsidiary of Packard Bell NEC from its loss-making U.S. 
division, putting the European unit under direct control of the NEC 
parent company. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, NEC president Hisashi Kaneko will step down, though  
he denied his resignation was an admission of responsibility for 
the poor performance. Koji Nishigaki, currently a managing 
director, will take over as president on March 26. 
</P>
<P>
	NEC's loss, which comes to 150 billion yen, is far more than its  
previous forecast of a net loss of 35 billion yen, or $292 million. 
NEC earned 40.51 billion yen last year. 
</P>
<P>
	NEC and its 130 subsidiaries employ 155,000 people worldwide.  
</P>
<P>
	The company said Packard Bell NEC is expected to post an $80  
million loss before taxes this fiscal year, but predicted the 
division will earn a profit in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	In other Asian fallout on Friday, Toshiba Corp. said a rising  
yen and a slump in sales hurt earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Toshiba said it expects a net loss of 20 billion yen, or $167  
million, this year for its parent company, compared to an earlier 
estimate of a profit of 12 billion yen, or $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss would be the first in 48 years for the parent company,  
which doesn't include Toshiba's subsidiaries.

<HEADLINE> Bombers Add Rocket to Arsenal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Roger Clemens always thought he'd look good  
in pinstripes. He just couldn't bring himself to wear them when he 
got his first chance. 
</P>
<P>
	Two seasons after rejecting George Steinbrenner's plea to sign  
with the New York Yankees as a free agent, Rocket is getting 
another opportunity to play for the Boss. 
</P>
<P>
	New York, trying to improve on perfection, traded for the  
five-time Cy Young Award winner and said goodbye Thursday to David 
Wells and two other players from the team that won 125 games and 
the World Series last year. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Yankees weren't eager to tinker with success, Clemens  
is considered well worth the risk after leading the AL in wins, ERA 
and strikeouts the past two seasons with the Toronto Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `I finally got you,''' the 36-year-old right-hander  
said, relating a telephone conversation he had with Steinbrenner 
after the deal was finalized. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel real fortunate that they had a championship team and  
still had an interest in me,'' Clemens said. ``I feel pretty 
fortunate to get a second chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for Wells, he left the Yankees' first day of spring training  
in tears after speaking with Steinbrenner and manager Joe Torre. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a little emotional right now,'' Wells said. ``Give me a  
couple days. It's a little tough right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York and Toronto actually completed the deal late Wednesday  
night, but delayed the announcement to tell Wells in person. 
</P>
<P>
	``He took it like a real man. He took it better than I took  
it,'' Steinbrenner said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Boomer,'' as the 35-year-old left-hander is known throughout  
the Bronx and beyond, has been the toast of New York since pitching 
a perfect game against Minnesota at Yankee Stadium on May 17. He's 
coming off the best season of his career, 18-4 with a 3.49 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	Mr. Perfection was also Mr. Personality, as far as Yankee fans  
were concerned. They loved his loud mouth and his loud music -- 
Metallica was a favorite. They loved his beer belly and the way he 
loves The Babe. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees pitcher David Cone spent four hours at Wells' house in  
Palm Harbor Thursday and said Wells left Thursday night for a 
golfing weekend in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never seen him so down ... beyond depressed,'' Cone said  
today. ``I've never seen anybody so stunned by a trade. He was 
pacing around and couldn't sit down. He just had to get away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens' resume is impressive -- more Cy Youngs than any player  
in baseball history, second on the career ERA title list with six, 
fourth on the career strikeout list with 3,153 -- but doesn't 
include the ultimate team accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good to give fellows a chance who deserve a chance for a  
World Series ring,'' Steinbrenner said. ``Hopefully we can get back 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens is owed $16.1 million during the final two years of his  
contract and has the right to demand a trade following this 
season's World Series. However, he doesn't expect that to become an 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	While stressing that he appreciates a second chance to join New  
York, Clemens didn't second-guess choosing Toronto over the Yankees 
in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``It worked out for me,'' he said. ``It didn't work out for the  
team. We didn't win. That's the bottom line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With a 233-124 career record, Clemens went 20-6 last season  
while leading the AL in ERA (2.65), strikeouts (271) and tying for 
the lead in wins. He led in all three categories in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he won consecutive Cy Young Awards with the Blue Jays, he  
wanted out after the team's Belgium owner, Interbrew SA, decided 
not to compete with baseball's big spenders this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston and Texas were still bidding for Clemens this week, but  
the deal with the Yankees came together after Toronto dropped its 
insistence on obtaining 21-year-old shortstop Alfonso Soriano. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a horse, and he's now our horse,'' New York general  
manager Brian Cashman said. ``We're betting on him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees set an AL record for wins last year, going 114-48 in  
the regular season. New York then went 11-2 in the postseason, 
including a Series sweep of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a tremendous thing -- hopefully to get back again. Not  
that we wouldn't have that chance anyway. But it might improve our 
chances,'' Steinbrenner said.

<HEADLINE> Colon Screening Rates Still Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Too few Americans age 50 and older are regularly  
screened for colorectal cancer, the nation's second-leading cause 
of cancer deaths, according to a new government study. 
</P>
<P>
	The low screening rates come despite the availability of home  
tests for blood in stool samples and increasing insurance coverage 
of some types of colon exams, the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not seeing much of an improvement in screening rates,''  
said Dr. Laura Seeff of the CDC. ``It's increased by 2 percent at 
the most over the last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cancer of the colon and rectum is expected to strike 129,400  
people in the United States this year and kill 56,600. More than 90 
percent of those stricken are 50 and over. 
</P>
<P>
	Many medical experts recommend that men and women age 50 and  
older get some type of colon exam every five years. It's also 
recommended that they get an annual test for blood in the stool. 
This can be done with a simple, at-home test. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 1997 survey of 52,754 people 50 and up, only 30.4 percent  
reported having had a sigmoidoscopy -- a type of colon exam -- within 
the previous five years, and only 19.8 percent had been tested for 
blood in their stool in the preceding year, the CDC said. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, 41 percent reported having one of the tests within the  
recommended time intervals. A sigmoidoscopy is where a tube 
threaded into the rectum checks just the lower half of the colon 
for polyps or cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Tests that can detect the disease early could cut deaths by as  
much as a third, Seeff said. Medicare coverage was expanded last 
year to include colorectal screenings, and most health insurance 
providers also cover them. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC said patients may not be aware of the recommendations or  
are afraid of the discomfort and embarrassment, and that doctors 
share some of the blame. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a subject people are comfortable speaking about, so  
patients aren't bringing it up to their physicians, and physicians 
aren't talking about it either,'' Seeff said.

<HEADLINE> Schools Get $323M More for Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Schools and libraries will get another $323  
million to help pay for discounted connections to the Internet, the 
largest such amount issued to date, the Universal Service 
Administrative Company announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Schools and Libraries Division of the company -- which is  
overseen by the Federal Communications Commission -- did not have a 
breakdown of how many schools and libraries will receive the money 
because the 3,700 recipients can include entire school districts. 
</P>
<P>
	This ninth batch of funding pushes the total amount of money  
released thus far to more than $1.4 billion, covering most of the 
applicants who requested funds in 1998, the company said. The group 
began disbursing money late last year. 
</P>
<P>
	This most recent wave of funding, for the first time, includes  
money to help applicants pay for all the internal wiring schools 
and libraries need to hook their computers together or to the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The money comes from fees imposed on telecommunications  
companies. The FCC oversees the program, which provides eligible 
schools and libraries with discounts that range from 20 percent to 
90 percent off of the costs of various equipment and services they 
need to connect to the Internet, depending on the recipients' 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
	The money for internal connections will cover schools and  
libraries getting discounts that range from 90 percent to 70 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Many rural schools and libraries fall into this 70 percent  
discount level, and earlier this month, Harold Furchtgott-Roth, a 
Federal Communications Commission member, said he feared funding 
wouldn't be available for these applicants. He asked that the 
program make changes to ensure that didn't happen. 
</P>
<P>
	Applicants could receive the funds within a couple of week after  
the approval letters have been sent out.

	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- Samuel L. Jackson had to prove he could  
be a nice guy before he claimed his brass pudding pot for being 
Harvard's Hasty Pudding Man of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, known for playing tough guys who use rough language,  
washed his mouth out with soap Thursday before a sold-out crowd at 
the undergraduate theatrical group's club. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Caterpillar To Still Protect Fites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ill. (AP) -- Caterpillar Inc. will continue to pay about  
$185,000 per year to provide personal security for former company 
Chairman Donald Fites. 
</P>
<P>
	Fites first began receiving such comprehensive security coverage  
early in the 6 1/2-year dispute with the United Auto Workers that 
ended in March 1998. He retired from Caterpillar on Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of continuing concerns regarding the personal safety  
of Mr. Fites, we are providing him with certain post-retirement, 
security-based services,'' the company's annual proxy statement to 
shareholders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement said Fites would be provided with a home security  
system and would have security officers assigned to him. It also 
said Fites would have use of the company aircraft at an annual cost 
not expected to exceed $75,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Fites is going to continue to represent Caterpillar even  
though he has retired as chairman. He is still a director and will 
travel on behalf of the company,'' company spokeswoman Marsha 
Hausser said. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement said Caterpillar, which makes tractors and heavy  
construction equipment, would analyze the security situation 
annually to determine continued need. 
</P>
<P>
	The proxy statement shows Fites' 1998 total compensation was  
$3.537 million, a decrease of about $56,000 from 1997.

<HEADLINE> Perkins Not Slowing for Pacers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Slowly, Sam Perkins is getting his  
37-year-old body into basketball shape. 
</P>
<P>
	He turned in his most productive game for the Indiana Pacers  
Thursday night, scoring 11 points in a 99-95 victory over 
Philadelphia. His first 3-pointer of the season came during a 13-6 
run that gave Indiana its biggest lead of the game, 79-70, early in 
the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been coming,'' he said. ``Some days you feel like you are  
(in shape) and other days you feel like you're not. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt good out there. ... I got a lot of minutes. ... The  
stamina was there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perkins joined the Pacers as a free agent after the NBA lockout,  
so he wasn't around when his future teammates were conducting their 
own workouts. 
</P>
<P>
	The 14-year NBA veteran admits he wasn't as physically ready as  
his new teammates when the season began Feb. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was in decent shape, but I wasn't in basketball shape,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacers signed Perkins to a two-year contract worth $3.75  
million, bringing him to an Eastern Conference team for the first 
time in his career. He's being counted on to provide depth at 
forward and center as a reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	A durable, seasoned player who has missed only three games the  
past five seasons, Perkins knows only one way to play the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I try to be aggressive and realize, I'm coming off the bench,  
I've got to do something,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A first-round draft pick by Dallas in 1984, Perkins is playing  
for his fourth NBA team. He was with Dallas for six years, then 
went to the Los Angeles Lakers and Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	He's been to the NBA Finals twice, but like his teammates never  
has won the league championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``This club believes it can win it, and I'm just trying to lend  
a little experience and depth,'' Perkins said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Larry Bird may soon start using him more.  
</P>
<P>
	``He does what it takes to win,'' Bird said. ``I think Sam needs  
18 minutes a night to stay sharp and he hasn't been getting that. 
... It's our (the coaches) fault.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perkins isn't worrying about his minutes.  
</P>
<P>
	``Whether it's the first or second unit, we are a total team,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Perkins is part of a reserve unit that is one of the deepest in  
the league and the deepest team for which he's played. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing that is different is, we've got bigger guys and guys  
who can do a lot of things. ... '' he said. ``Play two or three 
different positions. That's the key. We've got a lot of guys that 
are interchangeable.''

<HEADLINE>  NEC To Cut 15,000 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- NEC Corp., Japan's biggest computer maker, will cut  
15,000 jobs, or nearly 10 percent of its work force, over three 
years as it struggles to recover from slumping sales and massive 
losses at its Packard Bell unit in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	About 6,000 of the job cuts are outside Japan; the company did  
not say how many will hit its 7,000 U.S. workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The downsizing, disclosed on Friday, was the latest corporate  
fallout from the spreading economic crisis in Asia. But NEC's woes 
also were tied to problems endemic to its U.S. unit, which has been 
hammered by price-cutting wars with U.S.-based makers of personal 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	NEC is one of the world's biggest technology companies, with  
products ranging from laptop computers to cellular phones to fiber 
optic networks. It expects to lose up to $1.25 billion this year 
amid the Asian slump, a prolonged recession in Japan and a rising 
yen, which pushes up the price of Japanese products sold abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	To cope with the losses, NEC will slash executives' salaries by  
up to 20 percent, trim capital spending by a fifth, and cut its 
research and development budget by 10 percent. NEC will also sell 
real estate to pay off debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the damage flows from red ink outside Japan. The Packard  
Bell division, based in Sacramento, Calif., lost $500 million last 
year as its share of U.S. PC sales dropped to 7.1 percent from 9.4 
percent in 1997, according to the Dataquest research firm. 
</P>
<P>
	The drop was sparked by a rush of competitors to sell  
inexpensive PCs, a category Packard Bell traditionally has 
dominated. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they were in the marketplace a few years ago they were  
the leading brand in that market and there wasn't much 
competition,'' Dataquest analyst Charles Smulders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, IBM, Compaq, Hewlett-Packard are all in that market.''  
</P>
<P>
	As part of the restructuring, NEC will separate the profitable  
European subsidiary of Packard Bell NEC from its loss-making U.S. 
division, putting the European unit under direct control of the NEC 
parent company. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, NEC president Hisashi Kaneko will step down, though  
he denied his resignation was an admission of responsibility for 
the poor performance. Koji Nishigaki, currently a managing 
director, will take over as president on March 26. 
</P>
<P>
	NEC's loss, which comes to 150 billion yen, is far more than its  
previous forecast of a net loss of 35 billion yen, or $292 million. 
NEC earned 40.51 billion yen last year. 
</P>
<P>
	NEC and its 130 subsidiaries employ 155,000 people worldwide.  
</P>
<P>
	The company said Packard Bell NEC is expected to post an $80  
million loss before taxes this fiscal year, but predicted the 
division will earn a profit in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	In other Asian fallout on Friday, Toshiba Corp. said a rising  
yen and a slump in sales hurt earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Toshiba said it expects a net loss of 20 billion yen, or $167  
million, this year for its parent company, compared to an earlier 
estimate of a profit of 12 billion yen, or $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss would be the first in 48 years for the parent company,  
which doesn't include Toshiba's subsidiaries.

<HEADLINE> More Tobacco Lawsuits Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The first cases were brought by individuals, people  
who blamed the cigarettes they smoked and the industry that made 
them for illnesses like cancer and emphysema. The smokers lost. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the states got involved, demanding that tobacco companies  
reimburse governments for money spent to treat sick smokers. The 
industry settled those cases for a total of $246 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Emboldened by this success, individuals, cities and countries  
are bringing more product liability lawsuits, and not only against 
tobacco companies. Gun manufacturers are finding themselves in 
court, and law professors wonder if litigation involving alcoholic 
beverages is ahead, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each case that's a winner can help serve as a template for the  
next one,'' said Wake Forest University law professor David Logan. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami-Dade County and Chicago among the municipalities trying to  
take gun makers to court on claims they should pay for gun-related 
violence and make firearms safer. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami-Dade's lawsuit accuses gun makers of negligence in  
designing their guns by not using safety devices that could alert 
users that a round is still in a gun chamber, or that might prevent 
firing by children. 
</P>
<P>
	The $433 million suit filed by Chicago in November against gun  
dealers, manufacturers and distributors claims handguns are a 
public nuisance and that sellers know the weapons will end up in 
the hands of gang members and other criminals. 
</P>
<P>
	A New York jury on Feb. 11 found gun makers were negligent and  
allowed firearms to travel illegally from states where they are 
easy to obtain to those with strict gun laws. 
</P>
<P>
	But while the number of gun-related cases increases, Logan said  
the firearms and other industries may not be as vulnerable at this 
point as tobacco makers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The public perception has turned against tobacco,'' he said.  
``That hasn't happened yet with alcohol or guns, which are the two 
logical next steps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four days after Atlanta's mayor announced the city was suing gun  
makers, and following intense lobbying by the National Rifle 
Association, Georgia's governor signed a law immediately forbidding 
such actions by reserving them for the state. That decision 
underscores the politics of such litigation, Logan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``One, the gun companies aren't going to take this stuff lying  
down. Two, they've got power, they have access, which tobacco used 
to have,'' Logan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcohol is even more a part of American life than cigarettes,  
Logan said, citing the use of wine in religious rituals. And 
previous attempts to restrict alcohol, such as Prohibition, have 
failed enormously. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just real unlikely that very many courts are going to say  
'let's go ahead and plunder from the alcohol industry,' which by 
the way is far more politically connected,'' Logan said. But he 
also admitted that several years ago he had the same opinion about 
cigarette litigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, tobacco cases continue.  
</P>
<P>
	Since October, jurors in Florida have been hearing a lawsuit  
brought on behalf of an estimated 500,000 sick smokers. Evidence 
and experts presented at previous tobacco trials have reappared in 
this case. 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst Gary Black of Sanford C. Bernstein Co. Inc. expects the  
industry to lose the first phase, in which liability is being 
determined, but prevail ultimately. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the history of corporate America -- and I've done a lot of  
research on this -- I cannot find a personal injury class action 
that's gotten past the first phase,'' he said. ``Either it's been 
overturned or the defendants have paid them off. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I'm the industry, I can play it out,'' Black said. ``But  
the longer you play it out, the more people smell blood and the 
more chance you have of creating another litigation craze.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Feb. 10, a California jury awarded a former three-pack-a-day  
smoker a record-breaking $50 million in punitive damages. Late last 
month, Venezuela filed a lawsuit in Miami similar to the state 
suits which the industry settled. Guatemala, Bolivia and Panama 
also have sued. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rather obviously, other countries see what's happening in the  
United States and want a piece of the action,'' said John Banzhaf, 
a Washington law professor and anti-smoking activist. ``Indeed, it 
would almost border on malpractice not to file such a suit.''

</P>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Curtis Carlson, who started with a $55 loan  
during the Great Depression and built it into the giant Carlson 
Companies Inc. that included Radisson Hotels Worldwide, died 
Friday. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, with 147,000 employees, also includes Carlson  
Marketing Group, Carlson Wagonlit Travel franchises, A.T. Mays 
travel agencies, Country Inns and Suites, Radisson Seven Seas 
Cruises, and TGI Friday's and Italianni's restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlson started with the Gold Bond Stamp Co. and built it into  
Carlson Companies with $7.8 billion in annual revenue in 1998. The 
Carlson name was worth another $14.2 billion in annual revenue to 
franchises and other businesses licensed by the company. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1938 to 1978, Gold Bond grew at a rate of 30 percent a  
year, never failing to meet sales goals set by the founder. During 
the post-World War II era when trading stamps were in their heyday, 
Gold Bond broke new ground by signing up such non-traditional 
accounts as rural movie theaters, feed mills, turkey hatcheries and 
mortuaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Until stricken, Carlson had remained active in the company. But  
he had turned over control last year to his daughter, Marilyn 
Carlson Nelson.

	LAUREL, Md. (AP) -- Richard ``Dickie'' Dutrow, the Maryland horse  
trainer behind such winners as King's Swan and Lite the Fuse, died 
Friday of cancer. He was 61. 
</P>
<P>
	He came into prominence in the early 1970s by winning four  
consecutive training titles at Laurel Park and Pimlico Race Course. 
Dutrow set what was then a record in 1975 by training 352 winners, 
according to a statement from Laurel Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Dutrow moved his training operation to New York in 1984,  
training several stakes winners, including King's Swan, who retired 
with earnings of almost $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Dutrow relocated his stable to Maryland, where he won

Wednesday from complications following cancer treatment. He was 75. 
</P>
<P>
	Flint worked at WDAY radio in Fargo as a member of the station  
orchestra while attending Moorhead State. In 1949, he was hired as 
the station's news director. 
</P>
<P>
	When WDAY added television in 1953, Flint became the station's  
first news anchor and was one of the station's first news 
directors. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years later, he became an administrative assistant to North  
Dakota Sen. Milton Young. 
</P>
<P>
	Flint returned to broadcasting in 1958 as general manager and  
vice president of KCMT-TV in Alexandria. 
</P>
<P>

poisoning in Japan, died Thursday of liver cancer. He was 67. 
</P>
<P>
	Kawamoto headed a group of victims of ``Minamata disease,'' the  
sickness that resulted from tons of mercury being dumped into the 
sea surrounding the town beginning in 1932 and ending in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds died and thousands were disabled by the disease, which  
caused nervous system damage in the victims and birth defects in 
their children.

<P>
	POINT CLEAR, Ala. (AP) -- James Kenneth McLean, a pioneer in the  
creation of containerized shipping, died Wednesday. He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
	McLean built McLean Trucking Co. from the ground up with his  
brother and sister during the 1940s. By 1955, the McLeans had moved 
to Mobile to purchase Waterman Steamship Co. and its 
then-subsidiary, Pan-Atlantic Steamship Co. 
</P>
<P>
	While shipping goods to the Far East, the Mediterranean, Pacific  
ports and Northern Europe, the McLeans had the idea of outfitting 
steamships to carry tractor-trailer containers. They converted 
ships with what they called ``cells'' -- holding bays for hundreds 
of truck containers onboard each vessel. The containers, once 
off-loaded, could be shipped over land by trucks or trains. 
</P>
<P>
	Known for his many business interests, McLean owned the Grand  
Hotel, a tranquil resort near Point Clear on the eastern shore of 
Mobile Bay, from 1966 to 1981. He most recently was chairman of the 
Corporation of Magnolia Trace Inc., a real estate development 
company.

instrumental in pioneering American studies as a discipline in 
British universities, died Feb. 5. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
	In the late 1940s, he accepted an invitation to teach English  
literature at the University of Wisconsin. It was there he became 
captivated with American lifestyle and culture. 
</P>
<P>
	He later moved to Tulane University in New Orleans for four  
years. In New Orleans, he produced a radio program that put him in 
touch with writers, including a young Gore Vidal. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore returned to Britain in 1952 as an advocate of American  
literature, and the years following were central in his career. He 
worked as a producer for the British Broadcasting Corp., wrote for 
the Times Literary Supplement and edited the first of his 
influential anthologies of American writing.

<HEADLINE> Devers Tops Flanders Indoor Track </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GHENT, Belgium (AP) -- Gail Devers ran the fastest 60-meter race  
of the indoor season at the Flanders Indoor meet Friday, with only 
a terrible start keeping her from becoming the first woman to break 
seven seconds this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Olympic champion, Ivan Pedroso of Cuba, also set a  
season's best, soaring 27 feet, 1 1/2 inches in the long jump. 
</P>
<P>
	Devers finished at 7.01 seconds, .03 seconds under the season's  
best time she set last Sunday at Birmingham, England. Sevatheda 
Fynes of the Bahamas finished second at 7.04 and world 
record-holder Irina Privalova of Russia was third at 7.23. 
</P>
<P>
	``My starts are terrible,'' Devers said. ``I've been trying to  
work on the start, but I don't know why it doesn't work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Devers caught the fast starters midway through the race and  
never lost her stride as she held off Fynes, who improved on her 
personal best by .08 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	The meet again confirmed Devers is on the way back following a  
nine-month layoff because of an Achilles tendon injury. 
</P>
<P>
	The long absence of the two-time Olympic 100-meter champion,  
which coincided with the emergence of Marion Jones as the top 
women's sprinter, raised questions whether Devers would ever be 
back at full speed. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the world record of 6.92 still is out of reach because  
of her lack of races. ``I know what the world record is, but I just 
cannot focus on that,'' she said. ``I still saw a lot of things 
that were wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Devers will compete at Lievin, France on Sunday and complete her  
European trip at Stockholm, Sweden on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Pedroso saved his best effort for last, improving by one-quarter  
inch on the season's best jump by Romania's Bogdan Tudor. 
</P>
<P>
	Erick Walder finished second at 26-10 1/2.

<HEADLINE> Court Sees Chain at Dragging Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- In a single move, FBI agent Norman Townsend  
snapped a country courtroom out of its slumber by pulling out 24 1/2 
feet of chain, the one prosecutors say was used to drag James Byrd 
Jr. to death because he was black. 
</P>
<P>
	A hush fell and all eyes followed Townsend's hand as he reached  
into a cardboard evidence box and retrieved the steel logging 
chain. A relative of Byrd later called the scene ``bone-chilling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say the chain was attached to the bumper of a pickup  
truck and wrapped around Byrd's ankles. The 49-year-old man was 
dragged for three miles along an east Texas road last June, 
dismembering him in a crime that stunned the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	As evidence goes, the chain isn't much help in the case against  
John King, the first of three white men to be tried for 
first-degree murder. Authorities say it was put through a car wash 
after Byrd was killed, which would have stripped it of any flesh 
and blood evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	But there it was Thursday, stretched out like a lethal jump  
rope. And Townsend, the last of 19 witnesses for the day, 
dramatically revived a courtroom made weary after two days of 
tedious testimony about evidence retrieval. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we thought we were mentally prepared for everything  
that's come into this case,'' said Clara Taylor, one of Byrd's 
sisters. ``But to see that chain was bone-chilling. 
</P>
<P>
	``It made me think back to the slaves -- of slavery when you saw  
black men chained and brought over on ships.'' 
</P>
<P>
	King, 24, faces life in prison or execution if convicted of  
murder. Shawn Berry, 24, and Lawrence Brewer, 31, are to be tried 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	Townsend testified that on June 8, the day after Byrd's death,  
Berry led authorities to an area behind a friend's trailer. Berry 
kicked up a piece of plywood covering a depression in the ground, 
the agent said, and inside was the chain. 
</P>
<P>
	In other testimony, a former prison inmate said King told him  
that he envisioned a racial killing -- ``taking a black out'' -- as 
an initiation rite to prove loyalty to a white supremacist gang. 
</P>
<P>
	``To get in you have to get a blood tie,'' William Hoover, a  
convicted robber, said of the talks he and King had while in prison 
together a few years ago. ``You send somebody on a mission to stab 
somebody or do something. ... You have to spill blood to get in and 
give blood to get out, I guess.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't clear from Hoover's testimony who would do the killing  
or what gang they were talking about. But prosecutors have said 
that King killed Byrd to gain credibility for a racist group he was 
organizing.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton warned Yugoslav President  
Slobodan Milosevic on Friday that he would be ``held accountable'' 
and face NATO airstrikes if he refuses to accept a peace accord 
with ethnic Albanians and allow NATO peacekeeping troops into 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton sent Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to peace  
talks in France for a down-to-the-wire diplomatic bid to seal a 
deal by a Saturday deadline. The president said the time limit was 
firm, and he had ordered U.S. warplanes ``to be ready'' to attack 
Serb targets. 
</P>
<P>
	``There needs to be an agreement before the strikes commence,''  
the president said at a news conference with French President 
Jacques Chirac. ``I don't think there is an option.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chirac said he and Clinton were in ``complete agreement'' that  
the only way Milosevic could preserve Kosovo as part of Serbia was 
by reaching a self-rule settlement with the independence-minded 
ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the population in the 
province. 
</P>
<P>
	``The time has come to shoulder all his responsibility and  
choose the path of wisdom and not the path of war,'' Chirac said of 
Milosevic. ``We want our continent to be at peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic is refusing to accept a 28,000-strong NATO  
peacekeeping force, which could include up to 4,000 Americans, as 
part of any agreement to end a year of fighting, which has killed 
an estimated 2,000. On Friday, he refused to see the chief U.S. 
mediator, Christopher Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	In a message to Milosevic relayed through Yugoslav Foreign  
Minister Zivadin Jovanovic, Hill said ``there is no way to have a 
halfway agreement'' -- that is, a political accord without 
provisions for a military force to back it up, according to State 
Department spokesman James P. Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill went to Belgrade and tried to see Milosevic but the  
Yugoslav leader would not see him, a senior U.S. official said, 
speaking on condition of anonymity. The official said Americans 
were told that Milosevic did not want to undercut his negotiators. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright's scheduled arrival at the talks in Rambouillet,  
France, southwest of Paris, less than six hours before the Saturday 
noon (6 a.m. EST) deadline raised the possibility the clock could 
be stopped and negotiations extended if the Serbs give ground in 
the final hours. 
</P>
<P>
	If there's no agreement by the deadline, it's ``possible'' that  
Albright could go on to NATO headquarters in Brussels, the senior 
U.S. official said. ``There will have to be some kind of 
consultation'' there, the official said, implying that an attack 
would not take place immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton said the Serbs must make a choice now or face the  
military consequences. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can join an agreement that meets their legitimate  
concerns and gives them a chance to show that an autonomous Kosovo 
can thrive as part of their country, or they can stonewall,'' the 
president said. ``But if they do that, they will be held 
accountable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If no accord is reached, Clinton said NATO airstrikes ``would at  
least reduce his (Milosevic's) capacity to take further aggressive 
military action against the Kosovar Albanians.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We now call on both sides to make the tough decisions that are  
necessary to stop the conflict immediately before more people are 
killed and the war spreads,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark, the supreme NATO commander in  
Europe, suggested the military alliance has its Serb targets in 
sight and is ready to move. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are many different assets in Yugoslavia which are  
vulnerable,'' Clark said in a CNN interview, although he refused to 
discuss specific targets. ``We're very much aware of what these 
assets are and where they are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration and NATO are aware that airstrikes  
might embolden ethnic Albanian separatists and anger Serb soldiers, 
causing fresh civilian casualties on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the White House kept up the military pressure, moving  
ahead with plans to deploy more than 50 extra fighter jets, bombers 
and refuelers to the region, adding to 220 U.S. warplanes and a 
total of 430 NATO aircraft that could be used in airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	C-17 cargo planes carrying 250 fighter pilots and support  
personnel from Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico left Friday 
for Aviano Air Base in Italy ahead of 12 radar-evading F-117 
stealth fighters, set to fly overseas during the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	KC-135 refueling tankers left McConnell Air Force Base in  
Wichita, Kan., Friday for Fairchild Air Force Base in Washington 
state. Six KC-135 tanker planes took off from Fairchild for an 
undisclosed air base in Europe. Six B-52 bombers were set to fly to 
Britain over the weekend as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Enough NATO military firepower already was in place for a  
limited initial strike -- most likely Tomahawk missiles fired from 
the USS Enterprise and other ships and submarines now in the 
Mediterranean and moving toward the Aegean Sea. 
</P>
<P>
	First hit would be Serb air defense missile batteries, radar  
sites and command and control centers and key barracks, Pentagon 
planners said. Any second wave would target airfields, military 
warehouses and tank depots. 
</P>
<P>
	``There would probably be a pause to give him (Milosevic) a  
chance to rethink his position,'' said a senior Pentagon official, 
speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Western embassies began evacuating diplomats on Friday from  
Yugoslavia and planning was under way to evacuate some 130 U.S. 
diplomats and dependents there, too, over the weekend, and to 
assist departures of 4,000 other Americans living in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Plans also were being made to withdraw the 1,300 international  
monitors in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Astros' Alou Hurts Knee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KISSIMMEE, Fla. (AP) -- Astros left fielder Moises Alou injured a  
knee while working out in the Dominican Republic and will have an 
MRI performed in Houston on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Alou will miss the start of fill workouts next Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	``There doesn't appear to be any structural damage, which is  
good news, but we don't know the extent of it until he gets the 
tests,'' general manager Gerry Hunsicker said. ``He can put weight 
on it, which is also a good sign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alou set career highs in almost every offensive category last  
season, getting 182 hits, 124 RBIs, 38 homers and 105 runs as the 
Astros won their second straight NL Central title. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida Marlins traded Alou to the Astros after the 1997 season.  
Under his five-year contract, Alou could have demanded a trade 
after last season but elected to stay after the Astros agreed to 
give him an extra $3 million payment in 2002.

<HEADLINE> Senate Candidates Raise Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Rick Santorum could face a difficult  
re-election. The first-term Pennsylvania Republican, who won in 
1994 with 49 percent support, now must withstand criticism of his 
vote to convict President Clinton in the impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	But Santorum, like many of his colleagues also running in 2000,  
already has a cushion of cash to ease the way. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats who hope the impeachment issue will make some GOP  
senators easy targets in the next election will find many 
incumbents well-financed to defend their seats. 
</P>
<P>
	The 19 Republican senators whose terms expire next year raised  
$6.5 million during the last half of 1998, giving them a strong 
head start over challengers, Federal Election Commission records 
show. Eleven Democratic senators up for re-election in 2000 raised 
$1.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're raising money early, it puts you in a better  
position against any challenger,'' said Stuart Roy, a spokesman for 
the National Republican Senatorial Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Just as important, Democratic consultant Peter Fenn said, a  
flush campaign account may scare off potential opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hope for the Republicans is they can steamroll the  
Democrats in some of these big, expensive states,'' Fenn said. 
``Their hope is that they can discourage good candidates from 
running.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Santorum, one of the Republicans targeted as potentially  
vulnerable by Democrats, collected $617,761 in the last half of 
1998. He started 1999 with $1.6 million in his campaign bank 
account. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've just got to be prepared,'' Santorum said. ``I wasn't a  
Boy Scout, but I subscribe to their credo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Santorum and other Republican senators who voted to convict  
Clinton, while polls indicated a majority of Americans wanted him 
acquitted, are preparing to face the issue in statewide campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll obviously be judged on it,'' said Sen. Spencer Abraham of  
Michigan, who voted to convict on both counts of perjury and 
obstruction of justice. Abraham had $1.2 million in his campaign 
bank account as this year began. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Robert Torricelli of New Jersey, chairman of the Democratic  
Senatorial Campaign Committee, said the party does not plan to make 
an issue of impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he said, ``any time a United States senator votes in a  
highly visible and important issue at variance with the 
overwhelming majority of their constituents, there's obviously 
going to be political vulnerability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One liberal group, People for the American Way, is planning to  
spend $5 million through its political action committee for 
advertisements and voter drives targeting Republicans who supported 
impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	The group also hopes to encourage strong challengers to come  
forward by putting together lists of potential supporters and 
campaign contributors from its membership and those of like-minded 
organizations, said the group's president, Carole Shields. 
</P>
<P>
	In Pennsylvania, a state senator who is seeking the Democratic  
nomination to take on Santorum quickly criticized his impeachment 
votes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rick Santorum put partisanship ahead of Pennsylvania,'' said  
Allyson Schwartz, who had $303,910 in her own campaign account at 
the end of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Santorum said he expects voters to consider his position on  
Clinton just as they would weigh his other votes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no problems with any constituent of mine asking me  
about it, questioning me about it and factoring that in as to 
whether they believe that I should continue to serve in the 
Senate,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> GOP Moderates Want Hostility To End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new Republican moderate group says the party  
must soften its language and push a centrist agenda featuring 
``compassion as well as prudence'' or it could lose control of 
Congress in the 2000 elections. 
</P>
<P>
	``Immediately, the rhetoric of partisan hostility must stop,''  
the Republican Main Street Partnership wrote in an open letter to 
congressional Republicans. ``Our language too often has been heard 
as mean, judgmental and partisan. That 'the other side does it' is 
no excuse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letter concedes, ``Challenges will rise from partisan and  
ideological quarters. That is when we must stay the course with 
unity, courage -- and discipline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letter underscores the tug of war under way within the GOP  
in the wake of President Clinton's unpopular impeachment trial and 
party losses in last November's elections. The GOP failed to 
improve its 55-45 Senate edge and lost five House seats, leaving it 
with a precarious 11-seat House margin and big questions about how 
to prepare for the 2000 presidential and congressional races. 
</P>
<P>
	The partnership's preference is to push a bipartisan agenda that  
can be enacted into law with Clinton, including action on Social 
Security, schools and taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``On health care, Medicaid and Medicare, we must legislate with  
compassion as well as prudence,'' they wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The partnership is a year-old group representing moderate  
Republicans in Congress and across the country. Among its listed 
members are 41 House members, three senators, former Secretary of 
State Henry Kissinger and ITT Corp. chairman Rand Araskog. 
</P>
<P>
	The group released its letter even as House GOP leaders tried to  
craft a consensus agenda Republican lawmakers can pursue this year. 
There is general agreement to pursue a Social Security overhaul 
with Clinton and to seek tax cuts, education changes and more 
spending for defense, but the leaders are laboring to line up 
support for specific proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	Some GOP aides privately expressed frustration that the moderate  
group was focusing attention on Republican divisions rather than on 
opposition Democrats. But conservative Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind., 
a member of the House GOP leadership, said he welcomed the letter's 
call for GOP unity behind positive themes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's focus on showing why our ideas are good for people,''  
McIntosh said. 
</P>
<P>
	The moderates' letter was short on specifics, which is where  
many of the internal GOP disputes occur. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, on taxes it says, ``We must work to reduce the  
burden on hardworking middle-class American families.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That is a sentiment supported by all Republicans, and many  
Democrats for that matter. But the GOP is divided over whether to 
support a 10 percent cut in income-tax rates, phased-in rate 
reductions, or narrower reductions such as ending the so-called 
marriage penalty under which some married couples owe more taxes 
than they would if single. 
</P>
<P>
	``That would be hard work'' to resolve those differences,  
McIntosh said. ``But that's what we're paid to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview, Rep. Amo Houghton, R-N.Y., one of the group's  
founders, said the partnership was stressing not just centrist 
policies but also enactment of legislation with Clinton. Many 
Republicans believe bipartisan legislation must become law for the 
GOP to demonstrate it can govern and is not obsessed with Clinton's 
impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're really talking about an agenda that will move the  
country forward,'' Houghton said.

<HEADLINE> Reno Asked To Probe Starr Testimony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno has been asked by  
a Democratic lawmaker to look into whether Independent Counsel Ken 
Starr lied under oath during testimony to a House committee last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The request came in a letter from Rep. Barney Frank of  
Massachusetts and concerned Starr's answer to a question from Frank 
about alleged grand jury leaks from Starr's office. The questioning 
occurred last Nov. 19 as the House Judiciary Committee was 
considering impeaching President Clinton on the basis of Starr's 
report about his liaison with former White House intern Monica 
Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the way Mr. Starr has treated people who have gotten in  
his way in this investigation ... if he were investigating himself 
in this matter he would have almost certainly charged himself with 
perjury,'' Frank said Friday. ``I do not wish to follow Mr. Starr's 
example of using perjury as a political tool. But I do think ... 
his disregard of the truth in testifying under oath ... directly 
relevant to his fitness to continue as independent counsel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Frank released his Feb. 11 letter to Reno.  
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, Justice Department officials continued to weigh how to  
proceed with an investigation of Starr's Lewinsky probe. Justice 
officials wrote Starr recently stating their intention to launch 
such an inquiry, but have held off beginning it pending resolution 
of issues raised by his response, officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
	Questioning whether the Justice Department should be  
investigating him, Starr has proposed that an outside counsel 
handle the inquiry rather than the department's internal watchdog 
agency, the Office of Professional Responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder said, ``We  
would leave all of our options open as to who might do such an 
investigation if one were to be done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was learned that the consideration of Starr's demand for an  
outside counsel is still in a preliminary stage in the department. 
</P>
<P>
	The Independent Counsel Act gives Reno authority to remove Starr  
for good cause and requires her to explain her reasons in writing 
to Congress. Some department officials have argued that implies 
that she has authority to investigate Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno herself has been out of the country all week on official  
trips to Mexico and South Africa and has not been able to meet with 
Starr to discuss the matter, as he requested, it was learned. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Friday, Holder met with Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who  
backed Starr's bid for an outside investigator. Holder told Hatch 
the department was trying to reach an accommodation with Starr, 
according to people familiar with the closed-door meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times reported Friday that Starr had suggested  
former Carter administration Attorney General Griffin Bell as a 
possible candidate for the job. 
</P>
<P>
	Publicly, no one in the department or Starr's office would  
address the sensitive issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's office also did not respond to calls seeking his comment  
on Frank's allegation. 
</P>
<P>
	In his letter to Reno, Frank noted that Starr claimed he was  
hampered in answering Frank's question about leaks because ``I am 
operating under a sealed proceeding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frank then asked: ``Sealed at your request, correct?''  
</P>
<P>
	``No, Mr. Frank,'' Starr replied. ``It is sealed by the chief  
judge base upon her determination of ...'' At that point, Frank 
interrupted with another question. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank noted that U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson had  
since unsealed court documents, filed before Starr's testimony, in 
which Starr's office wrote: 
</P>
<P>
	``The Office of the Independent Counsel urges the court to keep  
the order under seal until the conclusion of the investigation by 
the special master and findings by this court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson had named a special master to probe alleged grand jury  
leaks by Starr's office.

<HEADLINE> Court Bars Repressed Memory Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A parent accused of sexually abusing his  
daughter based on ``repressed memories'' she recovered during 
therapy cannot later sue the therapist for damages, a California 
appeals court ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4th District Court of Appeal in Santa Ana ruled that a  
therapist must be free to act solely in the interests of the client 
and may be sued only by the client for negligent diagnosis or 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``A therapist should not be required to serve two masters,'' the  
court said in Tuesday's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	The case involved James Trear, who was sued in 1992 by his  
daughter, Kathleen Searles. Ms. Searles, 47, said her father had 
raped her during childhood. She said she recalled the abuse during 
therapy with Judith Sills. 
</P>
<P>
	Trear maintained his innocence and sued Sills, saying she  
encouraged his daughter to file the case against him as an aid in 
her recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Sills ``stepped over that line when she adopted the philosophy  
of repressed memory as being a valid malady without any scientific, 
analytical, academic justification for it,'' said Trear's lawyer, 
Tom Allen. 
</P>
<P>
	Trear settled the suit by paying $7,500, but denies ever  
molesting his daughter and can prove he was overseas during part of 
the time covered by her suit, Allen said. Ms. Searles has not 
recanted. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen argued that a therapist whose diagnosis lacks any  
scientific support, and who encourages a client to accuse an 
innocent third person of a crime, should not be immune from 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
	But the court said a therapist is entitled to examine the  
possibility of past sexual abuse and should not be inhibited by the 
possibility of a suit by the alleged abuser. 
</P>
<P>
	``The therapist risks utter professional failure in his or her  
duty to the patient if possible childhood sexual abuse is 
ignored,'' the court held. 
</P>
<P>
	Allowing witnesses to testify about their repressed memories has  
presented questions for trial judges concerned about the 
reliability of the evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	The theory that victims of childhood trauma can ``forget'' abuse  
for decades and later be cured of adult disorders by recovering 
their memories has lost much of its credibility among scientists, 
and might well be barred as evidence in California courts, the 
appeals court ruled.

<HEADLINE>  NEC To Cut 15,000 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- NEC Corp., Japan's biggest computer maker, will cut  
15,000 jobs, or nearly 10 percent of its work force, over three 
years as it struggles to recover from slumping sales and massive 
losses at its Packard Bell unit in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	About 6,000 of the job cuts are outside Japan; the company did  
not say how many will hit its 7,000 U.S. workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The downsizing, disclosed on Friday, was the latest corporate  
fallout from the spreading economic crisis in Asia. But NEC's woes 
also were tied to problems endemic to its U.S. unit, which has been 
hammered by price-cutting wars with U.S.-based makers of personal 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	NEC is one of the world's biggest technology companies, with  
products ranging from laptop computers to cellular phones to fiber 
optic networks. It expects to lose up to $1.25 billion this year 
amid the Asian slump, a prolonged recession in Japan and a rising 
yen, which pushes up the price of Japanese products sold abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	To cope with the losses, NEC will slash executives' salaries by  
up to 20 percent, trim capital spending by a fifth, and cut its 
research and development budget by 10 percent. NEC will also sell 
real estate to pay off debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the damage flows from red ink outside Japan. The Packard  
Bell division, based in Sacramento, Calif., lost $500 million last 
year as its share of U.S. PC sales dropped to 7.1 percent from 9.4 
percent in 1997, according to the Dataquest research firm. 
</P>
<P>
	The drop was sparked by a rush of competitors to sell  
inexpensive PCs, a category Packard Bell traditionally has 
dominated. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they were in the marketplace a few years ago they were  
the leading brand in that market and there wasn't much 
competition,'' Dataquest analyst Charles Smulders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, IBM, Compaq, Hewlett-Packard are all in that market.''  
</P>
<P>
	As part of the restructuring, NEC will separate the profitable  
European subsidiary of Packard Bell NEC from its loss-making U.S. 
division, putting the European unit under direct control of the NEC 
parent company. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, NEC president Hisashi Kaneko will step down, though  
he denied his resignation was an admission of responsibility for 
the poor performance. Koji Nishigaki, currently a managing 
director, will take over as president on March 26. 
</P>
<P>
	NEC's loss, which comes to 150 billion yen, is far more than its  
previous forecast of a net loss of 35 billion yen, or $292 million. 
NEC earned 40.51 billion yen last year. 
</P>
<P>
	NEC and its 130 subsidiaries employ 155,000 people worldwide.  
</P>
<P>
	The company said Packard Bell NEC is expected to post an $80  
million loss before taxes this fiscal year, but predicted the 
division will earn a profit in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	In other Asian fallout on Friday, Toshiba Corp. said a rising  
yen and a slump in sales hurt earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Toshiba said it expects a net loss of 20 billion yen, or $167  
million, this year for its parent company, compared to an earlier 
estimate of a profit of 12 billion yen, or $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss would be the first in 48 years for the parent company,  
which doesn't include Toshiba's subsidiaries.

<HEADLINE> Kids Turn To Work Instead of School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Mike Kyner didn't give much thought to college  
last year after graduating from high school in the small town of 
Beatty. All he could think about were the big paychecks down the 
highway in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	Now 18, he's earning $10.14 per hour washing dishes at Harrah's  
on the Strip. And that's fine with him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought about it (college), but the money wasn't there,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kyner and hundreds of other young adults in Nevada have  
discovered that working in casinos, construction or adult 
entertainment can mean big bucks. It's a trend that has education 
officials at odds with industries that have been the state's 
economic lifeblood for decades. 
</P>
<P>
	The numbers are stark. Nevada's high school dropout rate of 9.9  
percent in 1996-97 was the highest in the nation, as noted by first 
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton during a visit here last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Kenny Guinn said Nevada ranks last in the nation in the  
percentage of high school students who pursue higher education. And 
only 38 percent of high school graduates go on to college, compared 
with the national average of 65 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't really need to go to school to make $50,000,'' said  
Ray Willis, a spokesman for the school district in Clark County, 
home to booming Las Vegas and 60 percent of all Nevada high school 
students. ``The instant gratification aspect of having money 
immediately is fairly powerful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Las Vegas, where parking attendants can bring in $50,000 a  
year and exotic dancers make hundreds of dollars a night, school 
officials are having a hard time persuading students to consider 
college. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are fighting a battle of sorts with our main industry,  
which seems to be a magnet for kids who see an opportunity, a 
financial opportunity that circumvents them having to go to 
college,'' Willis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Take Summer Rivera, 18, who just started work as a hostess at  
Applebee's Neighborhood Grill and Bar. She believes she can make 
enough money to support the 4-month-old baby she is raising with 
her boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she probably won't ever go to college.  
</P>
<P>
	Even some casino officials would like to change that sort of  
thinking. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you want to get ahead, you have to have more skills,'' said  
Arte Nathan, vice president of human resources at Mirage Resorts 
Inc. and head of the Governor's Workforce Development Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	While young people can't work around the gambling tables until  
they turn 21, they easily find work in casino restaurants or 
parking cars. And when they do turn 21, they don't need a diploma 
to deal cards or roll dice. 
</P>
<P>
	Nathan said making a diploma a prerequisite to obtaining a  
casino job would influence students to stay in school, but admits 
that casinos are unlikely to do that. 
</P>
<P>
	Many casinos do offer free general equivalency diploma classes  
to employees and will pay for some college courses. Of the 27,000 
employees at Mirage Resorts, about 15 percent don't have high 
school diplomas. 
</P>
<P>
	Nathan said not having a highly educated work force could  
eventually affect Nevada's chances of attracting new business. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark County schools are trying several programs to push  
students toward college. But at Western High School, where the 
Community College of Southern Nevada offered a free college class 
to seniors, only 45 of the school's 400 seniors took part this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Nikki Adams works 56 hours a week as a hostess at the Hard Rock  
Cafe and as a hostess at the Samba Grill inside The Mirage 
hotel-casino. A 1997 high school graduate, the 20-year-old said she 
is saving money to go to college, but doesn't know when that will 
be. 
</P>
<P>
	``I definitely want to go, but it's been money problems,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	District officials are proposing lengthening the school day for  
students needing more instruction, increasing intervention services 
for at-risk students and a program to lure dropouts back for their 
diploma. 
</P>
<P>
	``The schools can't do it alone,'' Willis said. ``It's a  
challenge the whole community faces.''

<HEADLINE> Performance of Lesbian Play Banned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Organizers of a festival honoring  
promising young playwrights have excluded one of five winning 
entries from tonight's performances because its central characters 
are lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
	The festival sponsors, Children's Theatre of Charlotte and  
Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools, said discussion of sexual 
orientation was not appropriate for the program's middle and high 
school audiences. 
</P>
<P>
	The sponsors had told students in advance that winners could be  
deemed inappropriate for production. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still consider it discrimination,'' said Samantha Gellar,  
17, whose play ``Life Versus the Paperback Romance'' won't be 
performed at the Charlotte Young Playwrights Festival. 
</P>
<P>
	The play is about two adult women, one visually impaired, who  
meet, talk and fall in love. There is no explicit sex or nudity. 
</P>
<P>
	Gellar, a junior at Northwest School of the Arts, said she plans  
to use her $100 prize to help pay to have the play produced at a 
local theater. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a way, the play is my artistic child, it says something  
about me,'' said Gellar, who recently declared herself publicly to 
be lesbian. ``Once you've created something, you feel protective 
and proud of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The director of Time Out Youth, a Charlotte support group for  
homosexual teen-agers, criticized the decision to withhold the 
play. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of well-meaning people who are looking the  
other way, allowing this kind of discrimination to take place,'' 
said Tonda Taylor.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices edged lower Friday, declining for a  
second straight day, as traders turned cautious before next week's 
report to Congress by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 3/32  
point, or 94 cents per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves 
in the opposite direction, was unchanged from late Thursday's 5.38 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading was rather subdued with investors waiting to see what  
Greenspan will say in his semi-annual report to the Senate Banking 
Committee on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	With the economy showing surprising spark after three cuts in  
the Fed's lending rates during fall, analysts have grown concerned 
the central bank may reverse course and raise rates to contain 
inflationary pressures. Notably, the market shrugged off a 
government report early Friday showing that consumer prices rose 
just 0.1 percent in January. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market Friday, prices of short-term Treasury  
securities fell between 1/64 point and 3/32 point, and intermediate 
maturities fell 1/8 point to 5/32 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a 
financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price  
movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, fell 1.19 
points to 1,294.43. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 4.54 percent as the  
discount rose 0.02 percentage point from late Thursday to 4.44 
percent. Six-month yields rose to 4.63 percent, as the discount 
rose 0.02 percentage point to 4.47 percent. One-year yields were 
unchanged at 4.70 percent, while the discount was unchnaged at 4.49 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 4.63 percent from late Thursday's 4.69 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 1/16 point to 125 1/8. The average yield 
to maturity rose to 5.15 percent from late Thursday's 5.14 percent.

<HEADLINE> Social Security's Trust Fund, IOUs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The part of the federal budget surplus that President Clinton  
and Republicans want to use to rescue Social Security actually 
comes -- oddly enough -- from Social Security's own cash reserves in 
the first place. 
</P>
<P>
	How can that be?  
</P>
<P>
	It's a long-standing practice for both Democrats and Republicans  
to count the money in Social Security's reserves, or trust fund, as 
available-to-spend money on the government's balance sheet. 
</P>
<P>
	Right now, the government is collecting far more money through  
the special Social Security payroll taxes than what is needed to 
pay benefits to current retirees. So, hundreds of billions of 
dollars are accumulating. 
</P>
<P>
	That extra money is invested in Treasury bonds -- much as  
individuals might invest their own retirement savings -- and is 
spent as lawmakers see fit on government programs from the military 
to education. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the bonds -- a sort of IOU -- sit in Social Security's  
trust fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Some people argue that through this accounting system, lawmakers  
in effect steal money from the Social Security trust fund. After 
all, in 2013, once baby boomers begin to retire, the program will 
need its cash reserves because the payroll taxes coming in will no 
longer cover promised benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	But most lawmakers accept the premise -- like private investors  
who consider Treasury bonds a safe bet -- that the money borrowed 
from Social Security will be spent in ways that strengthen the 
nation so its debts to the elderly can be paid in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	From that perspective, the debate over how budget surpluses can  
bolster Social Security boils down to how best to strengthen the 
nation's finances now to prepare for the baby boomers' old age. 
</P>
<P>
	Among options: pay down the national debt, cut taxes or increase  
spending on other programs such as education. 
</P>
<P>
	But there are other ways to fix Social Security's financial  
problems: cut retirement benefits, raise payroll taxes or try to 
raise more money through stock market investments. 
</P>
<P>
	Any of those options could help keep Social Security's spending  
in line with its income and thus eliminate the need to rely on the 
old system of trust funds and IOUs.

<HEADLINE> 80-Pound Tumor Removed From Girl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Doctors removed an 80-pound tumor from a  
17-year-old girl who went to the emergency room complaining of 
stomach pains. 
</P>
<P>
	Tests showed a large mass on her ovaries after Marie Bell of  
Baltimore went to Franklin Square Hospital Center on Sunday night. 
On Tuesday, doctors spent 4 1/2 hours removing a benign ovarian growth 
from her body. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Bell, who weighed more than 300 pounds when she checked into  
the hospital, was in good condition Friday. It took four doctors to 
lift the beach ball-sized tumor from her body, lead surgeon Michael 
McCollum said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The tumor was benign and mainly filled with fluid. Doctors said  
they didn't know what caused it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm lighter and I get to do all kinds of things I couldn't do  
before,'' Ms. Bell said Friday from her hospital bed, surrounded by 
stuffed animals. ``Now, I'm able to fit in jeans.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A 20-year employee of the Massachusetts Treasury  
Department has been charged with taking bribes in an embezzlement 
scheme that allegedly siphoned $6.5 million from the state's 
unclaimed check fund. 
</P>
<P>
	John Trischitta, 47, pleaded innocent Friday to bribery and was  
ordered held in lieu of $10,000 bail. Prosecutors said he accepted 
$50,000 in bribes and was promised an additional $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Trischitta helped in the theft of money from  
the check fund, which he oversaw. The fund consists of state-issued 
checks outstanding for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
	His alleged accomplice, Martin Robbins, 51, was arrested  
Thursday. He faces charges of larceny, forgery and passing bad 
checks.

	Robbins worked as an ``heir finder,'' finding unclaimed property  
in clients' names, Attorney General Tom Reilly said. He said $6.5 
million earmarked for the Economic Development Investment Corp. of 
Boston in 1994 found its way into the unclaimed check fund. 
</P>

	Robbins allegedly claimed the money for the Cambridge Economic  
Development Corp., for which he said he had power of attorney. 
Authorities said Trischitta issued two checks on Nov. 6 to Robbins.

been defunct for a decade.

	Reilly said the money came to the attention of the state when  
Robbins tried to withdraw it last week.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Sees 'Two Good Years' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton says Americans want  
Republicans and the White House to put aside ``any destructive 
feelings'' from their bitter fight over impeachment and concentrate 
instead on the nation's business. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said Friday he does not think the impeachment ordeal had  
harmed the presidency. Rather, he said, ``the Constitution has 
been, in effect, re-ratified.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he added, ``I can't say that I think this has been good for  
the country. But we will see. I expect to have two good years 
here.'' He acknowledged that his wife, Hillary, had been through 
``a very exhausting year'' after the revelation of his sexual 
relationship with Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	A week after being acquitted by the Senate, Clinton held a joint  
news conference with visiting French President Jacques Chirac. It 
was abbreviated, with only three questions each from French and 
American reporters. Clinton declined an opportunity to stay longer. 
</P>
<P>
	The president said he had urged his wife, as she decides whether  
to run for the U.S. Senate from New York, to ``take some time, get 
some rest, listen to people on both sides of the argument and 
decide exactly what you think is right to do.'' He said he would 
support whatever she decides and that ``she would do a fabulous 
job'' in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Chirac warned Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic  
he will be held accountable if he refuses to accept an 
internationally sponsored peace agreement for the Serbian province 
of Kosovo. NATO has threatened airstrikes unless an accord was 
reached today. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be a mistake to extend the deadline,'' Clinton said.  
Chirac said there was ``unqualified agreement'' between Paris and 
Washington about Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Halfway through the news conference, Clinton encountered his one  
and only question about impeachment: What lessons had he learned 
from his ordeal and has the office of the presidency been damaged. 
It was his first news conference in two months. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've learned a lot of lessons,'' a subdued Clinton said. He  
said that ``presidents are people, too. I have learned, again, an 
enormous amount of respect for our Constitution, our framers and 
for the American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he would advise future presidents ``to decide what you  
believe you ought to do for the country and focus on it and work 
hard. The American people hire you to do that and will respond if 
you work at it and if they sense that you're doing this for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The American people expect Congress and the president to get  
back to work, Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Americans expect both sides ``not to have any  
destructive feelings -- or if we do -- not to let them get in the way 
of our doing their business. ... I don't believe that any of us can 
afford to let what has happened get in the way of doing our best 
for our own people and for the future. And I'm going to do my very 
best to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday night, Clinton touted his education and neighborhood  
investment initiatives to a friendly audience of civil rights 
activists, saying the programs would help close the gaps in 
opportunity and give all Americans a ``chance to live their 
dreams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at the annual meeting of the NAACP, the president  
cautioned against being lulled into complacency by current economic 
prosperity or the gains made in furthering equality for all. 
``We're in a lot better shape than we used to be in, but we're 
nowhere near where we ought to be,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As evidence of lingering problems, Clinton pointed to incidents  
of qualified blacks being turned down for home loans or of being 
stopped in their cars by police without cause. He lamented the 
state of minority children in failing schools who are blocked from 
reaching their full potential.

<HEADLINE> Switched Babies Pact Reached </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) -- Relatives of one of two girls who  
were switched at birth reached a settlement of about $2 million 
with Virginia officials, their lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	W.T. Robey III, the attorney representing one of the sets of  
grandparents raising Rebecca Chittum, said Thursday night that the 
deal was reached after the state was persuaded to increase its 
original offer by $75,000. The settlement will be paid in 
installments until Rebecca, now 3, turns 30, Robey said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The settlement is based on not what you'd like to have, or  
what your wishes are, but what the case is able to bring in 
court,'' Robey said. ``Virginia has certain limitations on what you 
can get.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state also offered the settlement to the family of the other  
girl, Callie Conley, but it was rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	Paula Johnson, who is raising Callie but is Rebecca's biological  
mother, made a counteroffer through her attorney of approximately 
$25 million, The Daily Progress in Charlottesville quoted an 
unidentified family member as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	The two girls were born a few hours apart at the state-operated  
University of Virginia Medical Center in the summer of 1995. The 
switch was discovered last year as a result of court-ordered blood 
tests in a child support case involving Callie. About the same 
time, the couple raising Rebecca -- Callie's biological parents -- 
died in a car wreck. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sets of families decided it would be best for the girls  
to leave them with the people they knew rather than switch them 
back. The two sets of parents of the couple who died are raising 
Rebecca.

<P>
	CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) -- The family of one of two children  
switched at birth has accepted a $2 million settlement from the 
state, while the couple raising the other girl rejected the offer 
and may sue. 
</P>
<P>
	The two girls were sent home from the University of Virginia  
Medical Center with the wrong parents in 1995 
</P>
<P>
	The grandparents raising Rebecca Chittum will get the money in  
installments until she turns 30, said their attorney, W.T. Robey 
III. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement is subject to court approval. A judge will decide  
how the money is split between the two sets of grandparents raising 
Rebecca. Her parents were killed in a car crash last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The parents of the other child, Callie Conley, did not accept  
the offer. Cynthia Johnson, who represents Callie's parents, would 
not comment Friday but has said the family plans to sue the 
university. 
</P>
<P>
	Callie's family could have a tough time winning more than $1  
million, Virginia's limit on malpractice awards.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Pardon Former Slave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	THOMASVILLE, Ga. (AP) -- In his last two years at West Point, not  
one cadet spoke to Henry O. Flipper, a campaign of silence that 
failed to destroy his drive to become the school's first black 
graduate. 
</P>
<P>
	Flipper persevered against the shunning, graduating in 1877, and  
the former slave persevered until his death at the age of 84 
against the apparently racially motivated charges that led to his 
dishonorable discharge a few years later. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 60 years after Flipper's death, President Clinton was to  
pardon the Army's first commissioned black officer at a ceremony in 
Washington tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	Retired Gen. Colin Powell, who kept a photo of Flipper on his  
wall while serving as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was 
expected to attend along with other black officers and Flipper's 
descendants. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents of Thomasville, the town near the Florida-Georgia line  
where Flipper was born and is buried, said Thursday that the 
posthumous honor was long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of those heartwarming stories where, despite hard  
times, things come out right in the end,'' said Tom Hill, curator 
of the Thomasville Historical Society's museum. ``He was a 
phenomenal person. I'm thankful he's finally getting his just 
due.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign to restore Flipper's reputation began in the 1970s  
in Thomasville, where the new post office, a park and a room at the 
public library are named for Flipper. 
</P>
<P>
	Flipper was the sixth black to enter West Point, but the first  
to graduate. He roomed with another black cadet when he began in 
1873 at 17, but by his junior year he was the only black at the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	After graduating 50th in a class of 76, Flipper was assigned to  
the 10th Cavalry, the ``Buffalo Soldiers,'' one of two all-black 
units in the Army. 
</P>
<P>
	Flipper served in a number of combat assignments on the frontier  
before transferring to Fort Davis, Texas. In 1881, his commanding 
officer accused him of failing to account for commissary money. 
</P>
<P>
	A court-martial acquitted Flipper of embezzlement but convicted  
him of conduct unbecoming an officer. Reviewing the record, the 
judge advocate general of the Army concluded that Flipper had been 
singled out because of his race. 
</P>
<P>
	The final decision rested with President Chester A. Arthur, who  
refused the recommendation for leniency and confirmed the 
conviction. The mandatory penalty was a dishonorable discharge, 
which came in 1882. 
</P>
<P>
	Flipper later served seven years as a special agent for the  
Justice Department, joined the staff of the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee as an expert on political developments in 
Mexico and was special assistant to the secretary of the Interior 
Department, determining where railroad lines should be built in the 
Alaska Territory. 
</P>
<P>
	``Had he stayed in the Army, he would have just been a footnote  
in history,'' Hill said. ``As it was, he used his education and cut 
a swath through history that few people have ever done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite all his accomplishments, Flipper died disappointed in  
1940 because he was never able to clear his name. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray MacColl, a teacher who died in 1994, learned about Flipper  
while taking a black history course and embarked on a campaign to 
right what he regarded as a major injustice. 
</P>
<P>
	With the help of Flipper's family, MacColl persuaded the Army to  
exonerate Flipper in 1976. West Point established an annual award 
in his name for the cadet who has survived the greatest hardship, 
and in 1978, Flipper's body was removed from an unmarked grave in 
Atlanta and was reburied in Thomasville with full military honors. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Army could not reverse Arthur's decision.  
</P>
<P>
	``The president is granting this pardon to correct a past  
wrong,'' a White House official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Hadley, 62, a retired Air Force senior master sergeant who  
has been leading a campaign for a Flipper commemorative stamp, said 
the former slave can be a role model for today's youth. 
</P>
<P>
	``He worked hard. He struggled,'' Hadley said. ``This should let  
people know that if he made it, they can make it today.''

<HEADLINE> US: Compaq Gave Microsoft Secrets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. repeatedly has pointed to tiny  
Be Inc. when the software giant, during its antitrust trial, has 
needed examples of the competition it faces in selling computer 
operating systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Denying the government's claim that it is a monopoly, Microsoft  
contends it cannot rest easy because of the possible success of 
Be's computer software, which even Microsoft praised as ``designed 
with special capabilities'' for software programs ``certain to be 
major growth areas in the years ahead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So it was particularly dramatic Thursday when the government  
disclosed that the world's largest computer maker, Compaq Computer 
Corp., which is testifying in support of Microsoft, recently passed 
secret information to Microsoft that it obtained from Be under a 
confidentiality promise. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyer David Boies made the accusation as he  
tried to discredit Compaq's testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq's witness, John T. Rose, a senior vice president, said he  
was unaware that his company had passed along to Microsoft any 
confidential information. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jean-Louis Gassee, the chairman and chief executive officer  
for Be, based in Menlo Park, Calif., said in a telephone interview 
later with The Associated Press that Compaq had called him ``a 
little embarrassed'' about three months ago confessing what it 
described as an inadvertent disclosure to Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	``Microsoft is such a threat to the livelihood of PC (makers),  
there is a climate of fear,'' Gassee said. ``They will do things 
almost instinctively to propitiate Microsoft.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bois charged that ``Microsoft has such power in the industry  
that Compaq feels it is in Compaq's interest to share the details 
of confidential negotiations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for Compaq, William Coston, called the accusation a  
``cheap trial stunt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ended the matter  
after Rose denied any knowledge of a disclosure. But Jackson seemed 
content with assurances from Boies when he asked, ``You have a 
good-faith basis for that?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another Compaq lawyer, Tom Siekman, said outside the courtroom  
that the company ``takes its obligations very, very seriously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not appropriate to make an allegation of this kind in  
open court,'' said Siekman, who added that Compaq was 
investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	The government alleges that Microsoft violated antitrust laws by  
using its monopoly power to dissuade Compaq and others from doing 
business with its software rivals. Microsoft denies it possesses 
monopoly power. 
</P>
<P>
	Boies' allegation was not the only problem facing Compaq on  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge openly questioned the credibility of a key piece of  
its evidence, saying a disparity over dates in a particular 
contract with Microsoft ``makes no sense at all if this was a 
genuine agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson noted that the agreement in question was dated August  
1995 but was not signed or executed until June 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq is widely believed to enjoy among the lowest prices for  
its Windows operating system that Microsoft charges any computer 
maker, but the actual costs are among the industry's most closely 
guarded secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	The government showed e-mail Thursday disclosing that Compaq and  
Microsoft actually signed two new price contracts last spring, less 
than two months before the government filed its antitrust case. 
</P>
<P>
	One contract, with more favorable terms toward Compaq,  
immediately replaced the other. Boies did not suggest a reason for 
dual contracts, but noted: ``If you're not going to use the false 
(contract) then there's no reason to have it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The e-mail said Compaq wanted dual contracts ``given Microsoft's  
concern that our agreement be 'defendable' to other (computer 
makers) and the Department of Justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rose asserted that Compaq was trying to hide details of the  
price it negotiated from its own employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has charged that Microsoft's ability to use  
Windows prices to discriminate among computer makers illustrates 
its monopoly power. 
</P>
<P>
	A Microsoft spokesman, Jim Cullinan, called it ``outrageous'' to  
suggest that the relatively low price for Windows given to Compaq 
was at all related to the company's offer to testify on its behalf 
during the antitrust trial.

<HEADLINE> OSHA Aims To Curb Strain Injuries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Employers should take steps to prevent certain  
on-the-job stress injuries, such as carpal-tunnel syndrome and back 
strains, a federal agency said Friday in proposed industry 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
	If approved, the standards could force certain employers --  
mainly in the industrial sector -- to alter work stations, redesign 
facilities or change tools and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Setting a national standard would alleviate the burden on  
multistate businesses from complying with ``a patchwork quilt of 
different ergonomics rules in different states,'' Occupational 
Safety and Health Administration Administrator Charles N. Jeffress 
told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Business groups, which have long fought such standards,  
objected. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Chamber of Commerce urged OSHA to wait for the National  
Academy of Sciences to finish its study on whether there is a 
scientific basis for national ergonomics standards. 
</P>
<P>
	``This hopelessly vague draft is a blank check for OSHA  
inspectors,'' said Peter Eide, the chamber's manager for labor law. 
``It would require all American businesses to become full-time 
experts in ergonomics, a field for which there is little if any 
credible evidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The chairman of the House Education and the Workforce  
Committee's panel on workforce protections said he would fight 
against what he called the ``ill-conceived'' regulation until there 
is scientific proof to back it up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Medical researchers must answer fundamental questions  
surrounding ergonomics before government regulators impose a 
one-size-fits-all solution,'' said Rep. Cass Ballenger, R-N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor officials, who have been pushing for the standards for  
nearly a decade, said the proposal represents an effort by OSHA to 
address a problem that accounts for more than one-third of all 
serious workplace injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``These disorders constitute the biggest safety and health  
problem in the workplace today,'' Peg Seminario, director of 
occupational safety and health for the AFL-CIO, wrote in a letter 
to Jeffress. 
</P>
<P>
	But Seminario complained that the proposed OSHA rules exclude  
certain workers: those in agriculture, construction and the 
maritime industry, all sectors in which musculoskeletal disorders 
are serious problems. She also said the standards should deal more 
with potential injuries before they occur. 
</P>
<P>
	Restrictions against such rules included by Republicans in  
appropriations bills expired in October and OSHA moved quickly to 
draft the workplace standards. They were developed over many years 
with input from industry and experts in ergonomics -- the science of 
adapting the work environment to suit the worker. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed rules would apply primarily to industrial jobs,  
such as meatpacking, sewing, assembly lines and package handling. 
But office workers who perform tasks that require repetitive 
motions such as operating a computer keyboard could be included 
under the guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffress said more than 647,000 Americans suffer serious  
injuries and illnesses due to musculoskeletal disorders from their 
jobs, accounting for more than 34 percent of injuries that lead to 
lost workdays. Such injuries and illnesses cost employers $15 
billion to $20 billion a year in worker compensation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The draft language is available on OSHA's Web site at  
www.osha.gov.

<HEADLINE> Intel Exes To Testify at Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Top executives from Intel Corp. are among  
witnesses who will testify at the computer chip-maker's antitrust 
trial, starting next month. 
</P>
<P>
	The government and the company on Friday identified their  
witnesses for the trial, which is scheduled to begin March 9. 
High-profile witnesses include Andrew Grove, Intel's co-founder and 
chairman, and Craig Barrett, who took over as chief executive 
officer last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, the world's largest chip-maker, with $26.2 billion in  
sales last year, also identified 16 more of its own executives and 
15 others from outside the company who will appear as witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shows you that Intel has guts to put their top guns on the  
stand,'' said Robert Litan, an economist with the Brookings 
Institution. He said Grove, who escaped communist Hungary as a 
20-year-old chemistry student, ``has a terrific life story to bring 
into the courtroom. I would suspect he would be a very impressive 
witness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission's case against Intel will take  
place in a courtroom across Constitution Avenue and just blocks 
from the federal courthouse where Microsoft Corp. is fighting its 
own antitrust case against the Justice Department and a group of 19 
states. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Microsoft's trial, where Chairman Bill Gates has not  
testified in his own company's defense, Intel plans to put both its 
CEO and former CEO on the stand. 
</P>
<P>
	``These witnesses present very tempting targets in the sense  
that if you can obtain some admission or concession, it weighs very 
heavily,'' said Richard Gray, an antitrust lawyer in San Jose, 
Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	But he added: ``I strongly suspect the FTC will have a much  
tougher time with (Grove and Barrett) than the Justice Department 
has had with Microsoft executives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government will use testimony from executives at rival  
Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Compaq Computer Corp., Micron 
Technology Inc. and others to try to prove that Intel abused its 
market influence to freeze out and punish competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC sued Intel in June, accusing it of denying three of its  
competitors access to important technical information about 
upcoming Intel chips. It said Intel sought to punish the 
competitors for refusing to license key patents on Intel's terms. 
</P>
<P>
	The three companies were Digital Equipment Corp., Intergraph  
Corp. and Compaq Computer Corp., which now owns Digital. 
Intergraph's chief executive officer, James W. Meadlock, will also 
be a government witness.

<HEADLINE> Reno Asked To Probe Starr Testimony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Democratic lawmaker wants Attorney General  
Janet Reno to look into whether Independent Counsel Ken Starr lied 
under oath to the House Judiciary Committee's impeachment hearings 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to Reno, Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts  
criticized Starr's answer to a question from Frank about alleged 
grand jury leaks from Starr's office. The questioning occurred last 
Nov. 19 as the committee was considering impeaching President 
Clinton on the basis of Starr's report about his liaison with 
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the way Mr. Starr has treated people who have gotten in  
his way in this investigation ... if he were investigating himself 
in this matter he would have almost certainly charged himself with 
perjury,'' Frank said Friday. ``I do not wish to follow Mr. Starr's 
example of using perjury as a political tool. But I do think ... 
his disregard of the truth in testifying under oath ... directly 
relevant to his fitness to continue as independent counsel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Frank released his Feb. 11 letter to Reno.  
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, Justice Department officials continued to weigh how to  
proceed with an investigation of Starr's Lewinsky probe. Justice 
officials wrote Starr recently stating their intention to launch 
such an inquiry but have held off beginning it pending resolution 
of issues raised by his response, officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
	Questioning whether the Justice Department should be  
investigating him, Starr has proposed that an outside counsel 
handle the inquiry rather than the department's internal watchdog 
agency, the Office of Professional Responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	It was learned that the consideration of Starr's demand for an  
outside counsel is still in a preliminary stage in the department. 
</P>
<P>
	The Independent Counsel Act gives Reno authority to remove Starr  
for good cause and requires her to explain her reasons in writing 
to Congress. Some department officials have argued that implies 
that she has authority to investigate Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder said, ``We  
would leave all of our options open as to who might do such an 
investigation if one were to be done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reno herself has been out of the country all week on official  
trips to Mexico and South Africa and has not been able to meet with 
Starr to discuss the matter, as he requested, it was learned. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Friday, Holder met with Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who  
backed Starr's bid for an outside investigator. Holder told Hatch 
the department was trying to reach an accommodation with Starr, 
according to people familiar with the closed-door meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr has suggested former Carter administration Attorney  
General Griffin Bell as a possible candidate for the job, The New 
York Times reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Publicly, no one in the department or Starr's office would  
address the sensitive issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Nor did Starr's office respond to a call seeking his comment on  
Frank's allegation. 
</P>
<P>
	In his letter to Reno, Frank noted that Starr claimed he was  
hampered in answering Frank's question about leaks because ``I am 
operating under a sealed proceeding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frank then asked: ``Sealed at your request, correct?''  
</P>
<P>
	``No, Mr. Frank,'' Starr replied. ``It is sealed by the chief  
judge based upon her determination of ...'' At that point, Frank 
interrupted with another question. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank noted that U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson had  
since unsealed court documents, filed before Starr's testimony, in 
which Starr's office wrote: 
</P>
<P>
	``The Office of the Independent Counsel urges the court to keep  
the order under seal until the conclusion of the investigation by 
the special master and findings by this court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson had named a special master to investigate alleged grand  
jury leaks by Starr's office.

<HEADLINE> Abortion Clinics Receive Threats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Packages said to contain the potentially deadly bacterium  
anthrax forced several abortion clinics across the nation to close. 
As with other recent scares, it appeared the latest threats were 
hoaxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Materials sent Thursday to several Planned Parenthood offices  
and other women's health centers were being examined by the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	Packages containing explicit threats were reported at abortion  
clinics in Milwaukee, Cincinnati, and Washington, D.C., and at 
Planned Parenthood offices in Manchester, N.H., and Rapid City, 
S.D. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI also was investigating suspicious packages received by  
Planned Parenthood centers in Sioux Falls, S.D., and Burlington, 
Vt. It was not immediately clear if these packages warned of 
anthrax. 
</P>
<P>
	In Milwaukee, the person who opened the envelope and three  
firefighters were hospitalized for an hour for decontamination and 
observation. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthrax mostly affects farm animals, but its germs, when inhaled  
by humans, can cause flu-like symptoms and can lead to death if not 
treated early enough with antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
	Phony anthrax threats have been very common in recent months.  
Last fall, abortion clinics in four states were the subjects of 
fake threats. It is a federal felony to send an anthrax threat, 
even if it is a hoax. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have received threats in the past but we have never  
received any threats like this,'' said Allie Stickney, president of 
Planned Parenthood of Northern New England. ``We will not be 
intimidated.''

<HEADLINE> Assisted Suicide Coverage Debated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional Republicans are asking the  
Clinton administration to review whether Oregon is complying with 
federal law by covering assisted suicides in its health plan for 
the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress in 1997 prohibited the use of federal funds for  
assisted suicide. The Oregon Health Plan is funded in part by 
federal Medicaid dollars, but state and federal officials say 
assisted suicides are covered entirely by the state. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan covers about 350,000 Oregonians and has not paid any  
assisted suicide claims since it began coverage of suicides last 
Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Thomas Bliley, R-Va., chairman of the House Commerce  
Committee, and three other Republicans wrote Health and Human 
Services Secretary Donna Shalala last week asking for a review of 
how Oregon was given a waiver for assisted suicide coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	They also want to know if Health Care Financing Administration  
officials met with Oregon officials, reviewed congressional intent 
behind the 1997 law and met with outside experts on assisted 
suicide. The Health Care Financing Administration oversees Medicare 
and Medicaid. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to make sure the law is being followed and no federal  
funds are being used to pay for physician-assisted suicides,'' a 
committee spokesperson said. 
</P>
<P>
	HCFA spokesman Chris Peacock said, ``Under no circumstances does  
HCFA allow Medicaid coverage for assisted suicide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As with abortion cases, Oregon says it would spend only state  
dollars on assisted suicide cases. Even the billing claims for 
assisted suicide would be handled separately by clerks who are not 
being paid with federal money. 
</P>
<P>
	``HCFA was very clear with us,'' said Hersh Crawford, director  
of the Oregon Health Plan. ``No federal funds were (to be) spent on 
assisted suicide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State officials said this week that 15 terminally ill Oregonians  
used the landmark Death With Dignity Act to end their lives during 
the law's first year. Two were covered by the Oregon Health Plan, 
but the plan didn't cover assisted suicides at the time of their 
deaths.

<HEADLINE> Albright To Join Kosovo Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Threatening force but still trying diplomacy,  
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright plans to join Kosovo 
negotiations in France only hours before Saturday's deadline for a 
settlement to the yearlong war in the Serbian province. 
</P>
<P>
	All week, Albright has been threatening Yugoslav President  
Slobodan Milosevic with NATO bombardment if he holds out against a 
six-nation plan for ethnic Albanian self-rule in Kosovo or 
continues his refusal to let NATO deploy peacekeepers to ensure the 
plan, once agreed to, is carried out. 
</P>
<P>
	Her arrival at Rambouillet, southwest of Paris, on Saturday,  
just before the noon deadline, raises the possibility the clock 
could be stopped and negotiations extended if the Serbs give enough 
ground in the final hours to enhance prospects for settlement. The 
deadline corresponds with 6 a.m. Saturday, Washington time. 
</P>
<P>
	However, White House press secretary Joe Lockhart noted the  
deadline has already been extended once. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both parties should understand that they now face the  
difficult choices to get a peace, to get a political settlement. 
And they should work over the next few hours to come to that 
agreement,'' Lockhart said today. ``They need to understand the 
consequences should they decide to walk away from a peaceful 
political settlement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He warned there ``would be very real consequences.''  
</P>
<P>
	Albright's plans beyond a day at the 14th-century chateau in  
Rambouillet were not disclosed and probably have not been made. One 
possibility, a senior U.S. official said, is that if no accord is 
struck she would go to NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, to 
talk to the allies about attacking the Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Engaging in her now-familiar strategy of mixing threats of force  
with diplomacy, Albright said Thursday that Milosevic, with whom 
she had just spoken on the telephone, ``should understand that if 
airstrikes occur, they will be hard, and he will be deprived of the 
things that he values.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scores of sea-launched Tomahawk missiles would hit Serb  
air-defense sites and radar facilities first, then key command 
centers and barracks in what would likely be a limited NATO strike, 
Pentagon planners said. They cautioned, however, that a more 
aggressive attack plan also was being considered. 
</P>
<P>
	Planning was under way, meanwhile, to evacuate the 130 American  
diplomats and dependents in Yugoslavia and to assist departures of 
4,000 other Americans living there. 
</P>
<P>
	Plans also are being made to withdraw the 1,300 international  
monitors in Kosovo to try to deter conflict between Serb troops and 
the independence-minded Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the State Department warned U.S. citizens today against  
travel to Serbia and strongly urged Americans in that country to 
depart due to the possibility of military intervention. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given recent history in the region, the possibility exists  
that U.S. citizens could be singled out in sporadic acts of 
violence, even though the government of Serbia-Montenegro has 
offered assurances that no retaliatory actions would be taken 
against U.S. citizens,'' the State Department said. 
</P>
<P>
	It also warned Americans of the potential for increased danger  
of travel to Bosnia, particularly in the Serb-dominated entity 
there. ``The possibility exists for spontaneous reactions against 
U.S. citizens,'' the department said. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign Minister Knut Vollebaek of Norway, whose government now  
heads the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, said 
after meeting with Albright at the State Department that ``we still 
hope for a political settlement on Saturday. We expect that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plan being forced on the Serbs and Albanians by the United  
States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Russia, would depend on 
28,000 NATO troops, about 4,000 of them Americans, to see that 
weapons are surrendered and a way is cleared to elections for 
self-rule. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we are at the stage where we need to exert utmost  
pressure, maximum pressure on the parties in this final phase,'' 
Vollebaek said. 
</P>
<P>
	An additional 51 U.S. warplanes ordered to the region were due  
to arrive this weekend or early next week. Already at European 
bases are 220 aircraft, and the USS Enterprise is in the 
Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
	A dozen F-117 stealth fighters, which can evade Serb radar, were  
among the freshly ordered warplanes as well as 10 EA-6B electronic 
warfare planes and 29 refueling planes. 
</P>
<P>
	Additional U.S. aircraft, including bombers, have been ordered  
to stand by in case they are needed, Defense Secretary William 
Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday night, Cohen ordered six U.S. B-52 bombers to fly to  
the Royal Air Force's Fairford Base in Britain this weekend to 
augment other aircraft in NATO's strike force. Pentagon spokesman 
Ken Bacon called the action ``a purely precautionary measure'' but 
added that the order directs the bomber crews to ``be prepared to 
execute their mission within 48 hours of arrival.''

<HEADLINE> Bavarian Metal Workers Might Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- The threat of a metalworkers strike  
was averted Friday in a second negotiating district when workers 
and employers in Lower Saxony reached agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The metalworkers industry is Germany's largest, encompassing  
automakers DaimlerChrysler, BMW and Volkswagen as well industrial 
concerns like Siemens AG. The outcome of the union's wage 
negotiations is expected to set the tone for upcoming talks on jobs 
creation, which involve unions, employers and government 
representatives. 
</P>
<P>
	The powerful metalworkers union, IG Metall, traditionally sets  
the pace for wage hikes in other industries. Already Friday, the 
public service and transport union said it would use the agreement 
as a benchmark for their own demands. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement affecting 80,000 workers in Lower Saxony -- home to  
VW -- was based on one reached for 840,000 workers Thursday in 
Baden-Wuerttemberg, home of DaimlerChryser. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lower Saxony agreement is for a 3.2-percent increases  
effective March 1, plus a one-time payment of 1 percent of annual 
pay, and 350 marks ($159) retroactive for January and February, 
matching the Baden-Wuerttemberg pact. 
</P>
<P>
	Employers said the overall worth of the wage package was 3.6  
percent; but the union, using a different calculation, claimed they 
negotiated increases of 4.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bavarian branch of IG Metall increased pressure on employers  
Friday, threatening to strike if the same agreement isn't extended 
to Bavarian metalworkers, including at BMW. 
</P>
<P>
	IG Metall, which has 2.7 members nationwide but negotiating  
power for 3.4 million, has said the original Baden-Wurettemberg 
agreement was a pilot deal that would be extended to the other 
negotiating districts, with eight still undecided. 
</P>
<P>
	The employer's association, Gesamtmetall, however, says the two  
deals accepted so far are too expensive to replicate, and warned 
they would worsen joblessness, already at 11.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Volcanic Ash May Cause Lung Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- British researchers say that ash spewing from  
a volcano on the Caribbean island of Montserrat may contain a fine 
mineral that could put residents there at a high risk of silicosis, 
a serious lung disease. 
</P>
<P>
	In a study published today in the journal Science, the  
researchers said that the ash from Montserrat's Soufriere Hills 
volcano contains harmful levels of critobalite, a silica mineral 
that is small enough to lodge in the smallest air passages of the 
lungs. 
</P>
<P>
	An accumulation of the mineral can cause thickening and  
scarring, leading to silicosis, a disease that reduces the lungs' 
ability to supply oxygen to the blood, the researchers say in the 
study. 
</P>
<P>
	Soufriere Hills volcano erupted in 1995, forcing evacuation of  
most of the 11,000 residents on the 39-square-mile island. Many 
people, however, moved to the northern part of Montserrat, an area 
relatively free of ash. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 3 1/2 years since the volcano came to life, there have been  
periods of quiet between eruptions and many people returned to 
check on property near Soufriere Hills. More than a dozen people 
who had returned to a danger area were killed in 1997 when the 
volcano suddenly erupted. 
</P>
<P>
	The study in Science suggests that even those who remained in  
the northern part of the island may suffer long-term health effects 
from the volcano's ash flows because of harmful levels of 
cristobalite. 
</P>
<P>
	Cristobalite forms inside the volcano dome, the researchers  
found, and then becomes concentrated in ash eruptions. The ash 
falls in clumps and can be sent back into the air by human 
activities, such as driving or sweeping. This increases the risk 
that residents will inhale the small cristobalite particles, the 
study found. 
</P>
<P>
	``The period after the eruption might not seem like the most  
dangerous, especially because you can't see the ash suspended in 
the air, but it does hang around for quite a long time,'' Bristol 
University researcher Stephen Sparks said in a statement. Sparks is 
a co-author of the study.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Approves Ga. Woodpecker Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration has approved a  
paper company's plan to develop a conservation bank for the 
endangered red cockaded woodpecker in southwest Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	Jamie Clark, director of the Fish and Wildlife Service, said the  
plan developed by International Paper Co. marks the first time 
under the Endangered Species Act that a private landowner has 
committed to increasing the numbers of an endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is certainly an economic incentive in this for  
International Paper,'' Clark said in a telephone interview from the 
company's Southlands Experiment Forest near Bainbridge, Ga.. ``They 
have a plan where they hope to one day market woodpecker credits. 
We think that's great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plan, developed by company biologists in consultation with  
the Environmental Defense Fund, calls for the paper company to 
manage 5,300 acres at its Southlands Forest as woodpecker habitat, 
including installing artificial cavities for the birds and creating 
new areas of nesting and foraging. 
</P>
<P>
	The 16 pairs of red cockaded woodpeckers now living on company  
land in Alabama, Louisiana and South Carolina will be moved to join 
the two pairs now at Southlands. Once the relocated birds become 
established in Georgia, the company could harvest the timber on the 
1,300 acres of land now tied up as woodpecker habitat in those four 
states. 
</P>
<P>
	By concentrating the birds in one area of actively managed  
habitat, the paper company hopes the number of pairs will increase 
to at least 30 over the next few years. That would enable 
International Paper to sell a credit for each pair over 18 to other 
landowners who now cannot use their property because federal law 
prohibits destruction of the habitat of endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
	A landowner with a pair the endangered birds could buy the right  
to destroy the woodpecker habitat on his property by paying a 
mitigation fee to International Paper for one of the pairs the 
company has in excess of the 18 now on its property. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Bonnie, an economist with the Environmental Defense Fund,  
said the company could charge as much as $100,000 per pair for such 
credits because most remaining red cockaded woodpecker habitat is 
in valuable property along the coastal plains of the Southeast. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will create a monetary advantage for landowners to  
actively manage for red cockaded woodpeckers,'' he said. ``They 
will understand that they can actually make some money for growing 
woodpeckers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bonnie said the concentration of the red cockaded woodpeckers at  
the southwest Georgia site will benefit the birds, because the 
species cannot survive in widely scattered, isolated clusters. 
</P>
<P>
	Biologists have had trouble in the past getting red cockaded  
woodpeckers to stay in a new area once they are moved. 
</P>
<P>
	But both Bonnie and Clark said they are confident such  
difficulties can be overcome without any further harm to the 
species, which has been listed as endangered for more than a 
quarter century.

<HEADLINE> Report: Atlanta Ignored Gift Limit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A top official on Atlanta's Olympic committees  
admitted that he and others ignored the $200 gift limit set by the 
International Olympic Committee, The Washington Post reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlie Battle, who served on the bid and organizing committees,  
said that as Atlanta pushed to secure the 1996 Summer Games, his 
panel gave IOC members $475 sets of golf clubs, free travel for 
family members and even a bulldog for a Cuban delegate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hey, that's what you do,'' Battle said. ``That's the kind of  
thing you feel maybe would have an impact. ... We were true 
believers in trying to build a relationship, a real true 
friendship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Battle repeatedly insisted that the committee did nothing wrong  
because the gift-giving rule was widely ignored and never enforced. 
He said he did not consider the gifts excessive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm proud of what we did,'' he said. ``We didn't do anything  
illegal, immoral, unethical or what I felt was improper given the 
context of lavish hospitality and entertainment that was the 
accepted route. I mean, that's what was going on. ... We felt like 
we conducted our bid in the spirit of what we felt like were the 
guidelines that were given to us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bid committee bought a $400 sports jacket and tie for the  
traveling companion of one IOC member, and it might have paid for 
some side trips by IOC delegates to Disney World, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure we gave out some things that probably cost $300 or  
$400 or $500 or maybe even more,'' said Battle, an attorney who is 
president of Central Atlanta Progress, a downtown development 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	Battle and former Atlanta committee president Billy Payne have  
publicly said in recent days they were unaware of any improprieties 
during the two-year bid process. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta's campaign for the Olympics cost $7.8 million, according  
to bid committee documents. The committee spent $376,545 on one 
trip alone, the crucial 1990 IOC meeting in Tokyo at which the 
games were awarded. 
</P>
<P>
	At least five investigations are under way into the Salt Lake  
effort that won the 2002 Winter Games. An ethics panel last week 
reported that Salt Lake bidders paid more than $1.2 million in 
cash, travel, medical care and gifts to 24 IOC members.

<HEADLINE> SEC Fights Small-Stock Manipulation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Extending their fight against small-stock  
fraud, federal regulators on Friday adopted rule changes aimed at 
choking off potential stock manipulation before ordinary investors 
lose money in such schemes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Securities and Exchange Commission will continue to make its  
enforcement actions against small-stock fraud a top priority, SEC 
officials said at an open meeting. The new rules are designed to 
supplement that effort by increasing the amount of information on 
small companies available to investors and making it harder for 
people to fraudulently promote stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the changes, for example, small companies will be required  
to disclose more information when they issue stock under special 
rules allowing them to do so without registering with the SEC. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the fraudulent promotion schemes involve a practice  
known as ``pump and dump,'' in which promoters push up a stock's 
price by making false claims about the company and later sell their 
own shares to cash in on the artificially high price. 
</P>
<P>
	Some small companies have improperly paid consultants, in cash  
or shares of their stock, to promote the stock. Under the changes 
adopted Friday, companies won't be able to sell their stock to 
public investors through consultants who are improperly compensated 
by the companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheap, high-risk stocks, often called penny stocks or microcap  
stocks, are usually traded legitimately but have become a breeding 
ground for fraud in recent years. The stocks often are thinly 
traded and the companies issuing them sometimes have minimal assets 
or none at all, making them only corporate shells. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC has warned investors to avoid being taken in by sales  
pitches for penny stocks, especially those making exaggerated 
promises of big returns. Pitches are made by telephone, in 
television, radio or newspaper ads or on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stock manipulation schemes provide the means to cheat  
investors out of their life savings,'' SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt 
said before the vote. ``The best, most effective protection an 
investor can provide for himself is awareness. ... Investors have 
got to be the front line in protecting themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC also issued a new investor education brochure titled  
``Microcap Stock: A Guide for Investors.'' The brochure, which 
offers tips on how to detect and avoid small-stock fraud, is 
available on the agency's Web site at www.sec.gov and by calling 
1-800-SEC-0330. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency's rule changes ``will be important weapons in the war  
against microcap stock fraud, which costs unsuspecting investors 
millions and millions of dollars a year,'' said Marc Beauchamp, 
spokesman for the North American Securities Administrators 
Association, which represents state securities regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investors always have to do their homework, but they really  
have to sharpen their pencils'' to avoid small-stock fraud, 
Beauchamp said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a related action, the SEC announced it had filed a civil suit  
against Glittergrove Investments Ltd., a firm based in Ireland, for 
allegedly selling stock in two small U.S. companies without 
registering the stock as required. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC recently suspended for 10 days trading in shares of the  
two companies, Citron Inc. and Electronic Transfer Associates Inc., 
citing questions about the accuracy of the companies' public 
statements. A federal judge in New York City issued an order 
freezing $2.5 million in Glittergrove's proceeds from the stock 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Such trading suspensions are a ``very effective tool'' in  
fighting small-stock manipulation, SEC Enforcement Director Richard 
Walker said at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Glittergrove officials couldn't be reached for comment Friday  
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC last year made an anti-fraud ``sweep'' of several  
brokerage firms that specialized in small-company stocks, 
confiscating brokers' telephone sales scripts showing evidence of 
high-pressure tactics. More than 40 people were charged and 
convicted under criminal laws and several such ``boiler room'' 
sales operations were shut down. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC's enforcement staff also cracked down on investment  
fraud in cyberspace, taking civil actions against people promoting 
small-company stocks who didn't disclose they were paid to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC commissioners voted 4-0 to adopt the rules, which will  
take effect 30 days after being published in the Federal Register.

<HEADLINE> Charges Dropped in Ariz Prison Plot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- A judge has dismissed charges against three men  
accused of plotting to kill the Arizona prison director because a 
key prosecution witness refused to answer questions during 
cross-examination. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked about killings he committed while a member of the  
Mexican Mafia prison gang, Carlos Velez refused to testify Thursday 
unless he was granted immunity. Prosecutors denied the request and 
had no other evidence to present, so Judge Gregory Martin dismissed 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Velez claimed he and defendant John Alday twice were within  
moments of gunning down Corrections Department Director Terry 
Stewart last summer at a Phoenix restaurant in a plot directed by 
the other defendants, Michael Garcia and Raymond Llamas. 
</P>
<P>
	Prison gangs allegedly wanted Stewart dead because his policy of  
locking their leaders in solitary confinement was cutting into 
their control over inmates. 
</P>
<P>
	The three defendants were arrested in December.  
</P>
<P>
	Their attorneys said they didn't believe the plot existed and  
doubted that Velez ever was a member of the prison gang. Instead, 
they said, Velez made up his story to get a reduced sentence for 
more than 10 unrelated crimes, including armed robbery and 
marijuana possession. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is nothing to indicate he was a member of the new  
Mexican Mafia. He has no tattoos, and no one came forward to say he 
was a member. He didn't meet any criteria for what to look for in a 
gang member,'' said Dan Raynak, Garcia's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill FitzGerald, a spokesman for the Maricopa County Attorney's  
Office, said Velez's story and gang membership had been 
corroborated by police and witness testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel very certain that Mr. Stewart's life was in danger and  
may still be in danger,'' FitzGerald said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, prosecutor Barnett Lotstein said his office hadn't known  
the witness was a ``mass murderer'' until Velez said as much on the 
stand. 
</P>
<P>
	FitzGerald said that in a plea agreement with prosecutors, Velez  
pleaded guilty to a weapons charge and two counts of armed robbery. 
All other charges were dropped, and Velez faces five to 10 years in 
prison.

<HEADLINE> United Air May Buy America West </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The parent company of United Airlines has made a  
cash offer for America West Holding Corp., setting up the prospect 
of a bidding war with Continental Airlines over the nation's 
ninth-largest airline, the Wall Street Journal reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	United spokesman Andy Pews declined comment today on the report.  
UAL Corp. disclosed on Jan. 20 it was talking to America West about 
a potential pairing but has refused to provide additional details 
on the discussions. At the same time, America West said it had been 
contacted by a number of airlines about a possible deal, though it 
also did not provide any details. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing people familiar with the situation, the Journal said UAL  
tendered a cash offer on Wednesday. It also said that Delta Air 
Lines had been mulling an offer but that the Atlanta-based airline 
took itself out of the running on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper did not cite a dollar amount for the deal, though  
America West's market value is about $800 million based on 
Thursday's closing stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
	An investment firm, Texas Pacific Group Inc., holds a 49 percent  
stake in America West. Continental, the nation's fifth-largest 
airline, owns 8.3 percent and has first rights to purchase TPG's 
shares for an America West acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
	A Continental spokesman declined to comment to the Journal,  
except to say that Continental will ``do what's in the best 
interest of our shareholders and employees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A merger between United, the nation's largest airline, and  
Continental is sure to face regulatory hurdles as well. In October, 
the Justice Department filed a lawsuit over the planned purchase by 
Northwest -- the nation's fourth-largest airline -- of a controlling 
stake in No. 5 Continental, saying it would reduce competition, 
raise prices for travelers and lower the quality of service. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of any United-America West deal are sure to argue that  
pairing the dominant West Coast carrier with the No. 3 carrier in 
the region also would pose antitrust concerns. The biggest losers 
would be American, which has been seeking to bolster its Western 
operations, Southwest Airlines and Delta Air Lines. 
</P>
<P>
	America West, founded in 1983, has 12,000 employees and hubs at  
its base in Phoenix as well as Las Vegas and Columbus, Ohio. It 
flies to more than 60 cities in the United States, Mexico and 
Canada and has code-sharing agreements to book passengers on other 
airlines for more than 30 other U.S. destinations. 
</P>
<P>
	United Airlines, based in Elk Grove Village, Ill., serves more  
than 150 destinations in the United States and an additional 29 
worldwide. Along with Chicago, it has hubs in Denver, London, San 
Francisco, Tokyo, and Washington, D.C.

	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Free agent quarterback Warren Moon will visit  
the Cleveland Browns on Tuesday and Wednesday, his agent said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Moon, released by Seattle last week, began his job search with a  
visit to the San Diego Chargers on Monday. He spoke by telephone 
Monday with Browns coach Chris Palmer, who was Moon's quarterbacks 
coach with Houston in the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's intrigued by the intense fan fervor in Cleveland, and he  
had a previous relationship with coach Palmer,'' agent Leigh 
Steinberg said Friday. ``Following that, he should be in a 
decision-making mode.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moon, 42, needs 903 yards passing to join Dan Marino and John  
Elway as the only 50,000-yard passers in NFL history.

<HEADLINE> Jerusalem Arabs Await Bulldozers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Sitting on stripped beds amid stacks of plastic  
bags stuffed with their belongings, the Ajaj family waits for the 
bulldozers. 
</P>
<P>
	The family -- Omar, wife Nawal, two-year-old daughter Gadir and  
baby Ahmed -- received notice from the Interior Ministry on Feb. 1 
that their illegally built house was slated to be demolished within 
30 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Palestinian activists and Israeli sympathizers say such scenes  
are common among Jerusalem's Arabs. They say one way that Israel 
contains Arab growth in Jerusalem is to deny building permits to 
Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
	But Arab families traditionally are quite large, and  
overcrowding in Arab neighborhoods is severe. Many Arab families 
take the risk of building without a permit because the extra space 
is needed. 
</P>
<P>
	The law does not require more than 30 minutes notice for the  
actual demolition, and occasionally the police never show up within 
the 30-day period -- leaving families like the Ajajs in limbo, 
hoping they will be forgotten and left alone. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jerusalem municipality said that 12 illegally built houses  
were destroyed in 1998 out of 38 that received the order, in both 
Jewish and Arab sectors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Committee Against House Demolition, an Israeli activist  
group, said the 1998 numbers were actually 35 houses destroyed out 
of 600 demolition orders issued in the Arab sector alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``We already packed things for if they come, so we can take it  
out quickly,'' Omar Ajaj said Thursday, his restive eyes moving 
from bare wall to bare wall. ``We haven't slept all night.'' He 
rubbed his face. 
</P>
<P>
	Ajaj built his small, square concrete home on a ledge  
overlooking the Arab suburb of Jebel Mukaber in southeast Jerusalem 
without a license. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried to get a permit for three years, but didn't get it,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He left his family's home three years ago because it was crowded  
and built the house on land he says his family owns. Recently, Ajaj 
gave up his job as a truck driver so he could be at home in case 
the bulldozers come. 
</P>
<P>
	The anti-demolition committee said its members would chain  
themselves to the house in that case. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until the end of the month they have to live with, `Do I have  
to go or not?''' said Rabbi Arik Ascherman, the group's leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the Jerusalem municipality and the Interior Ministry said  
Thursday that the other agency was responsible for the final 
decision to tear down the Ajaj house. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither body has ever acknowledged a policy of house  
demolitions. Both insist they do not discriminate between Jewish 
and Arab neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	But the committee and other groups contend that there is a  
preponderance of jerrybuilt structures throughout Jewish 
neighborhoods, some left alone for years. They say it is easier for 
Jews to get demolitions delayed through appeals to the authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	In his last two years as Jerusalem's mayor, Teddy Kollek accused  
Israeli authorities of deliberately containing Arab growth and 
refused to sign any further demolition orders from 1992 to 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	His successor, Ehud Olmert, has allowed the demolitions to  
resume, but has said he will encourage building development in Arab 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	Palestinians see the demolitions as an Israeli effort to  
consolidate sovereignty over the disputed city. 
</P>
<P>
	``I lost my job already,'' Ajaj said. ``I hope not to lose my  
house.''

<HEADLINE> Local Leader Implicated in Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- The city council president was accused in  
federal papers today of ordering the 1998 firebombing of a local 
weekly newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	The allegations against council President Louis Armstrong were  
included in a criminal information read during a court appearance 
for Clinton Moses as he pleaded guilty to bombing the weekly 
Jackson Advocate. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper office was gutted Jan. 26, 1998, when two Molotov  
cocktails were thrown through a plate glass window before dawn. No 
one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the information, Armstrong, who is black, moved  
against the black-owned newspaper because he was upset with 
articles and editorials Publisher Charles Tisdale had written about 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong allegedly paid Moses, a former campaign worker, $500  
to carry out the firebombing. 
</P>
<P>
	Just this Tuesday, Armstrong, 48, pleaded guilty to unrelated  
charges that he conspired to extort $28,500 from a topless-bar 
owner in exchange for a favorable zoning vote. 
</P>
<P>
	He has not been charged in connection with the bombing. U.S.  
Attorney Brad Pigott said there was ``likely to be an announcement 
later about any other charges in this matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The document read in court was based on statements by Moses and  
a lengthy investigation by federal authorities. Moses told U.S. 
District Court Judge Henry T. Wingate under oath the information 
was true. 
</P>
<P>
	Tisdale said following the Moses hearing that it added ``another  
enigma to the whole puzzle'' about the firebombing, and people 
should withhold judgment until the investigation is concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	In the wake of the firebombing, Tisdale and others accused law  
enforcement agencies of dragging their feet in tracking down those 
responsible. 
</P>
<P>
	Moses, an aide during Armstrong's 1997 campaign, also entered  
guilty pleas today to two counts of bank robbery. He faces 
sentencing later. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert R. McNeil, attorney for Moses, said he would not have  
advised his client to make the statements about the firebombing 
unless he believed Moses was telling the truth. He declined to 
comment further.

</P>
<P>
	TRW President and Chief Operating Officer Peter S. Hellman, 49,

	KOKOMO, Ind. (AP) -- Bill Lipkey, who organized the first U.S.  
Auto Club race more than 40 years ago, died Monday. He was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	Lipkey began organizing auto races in the early 1950s. On Jan.  
8, 1956, when USAC took over race sanctioning from the American 
Automobile Association, Lipkey set up the first USAC race, for 
midget cars, at the Memorial Coliseum in Fort Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, he organized numerous races at the Coliseum and other  
area tracks, as well as at the Kokomo Speedway, which he secured in 
1952. 
</P>
<P>
	Lipkey also served for a number of years on the USAC advisory  
board as the race organizer representative. In 1983 he received the 
Jim Blunk Award in recognition of his contributions to the sport of 
midget auto racing.

and designer of a running track, died Sunday following surgery. He 
was 55. 
</P>
<P>
	McMahon and a colleague designed the so-called ``tuned'' running  
track, a soft and springy track that has reduced injuries by half 
and improved running times by about 3 percent. When the track was 
used for the first time at Madison Square Garden, records were set 
in 11 of the 12 events. 
</P>
<P>
	McMahon, a biology professor at Harvard University, was  
considered an authority on the physics of animal locomotion. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
	Pedroza often sang with the Mexico City Opera Company. In 1985,

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pushes Tax Credit in N.H. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton went to New Hampshire  
determined not to look like he was gloating. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was something in the long, hearty cheers he drew  
Thursday night, seven years after he promised to fight until ``the 
last dog dies,'' that made him want to show the world -- or at least 
his critics -- that he still is standing despite the Monica Lewinsky 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``This dog is limping, but still going,'' Clinton said, giving  
credit to his supporters. ``If you had listened to the political 
experts, this dog would have died. But instead you held out a 
lifeline. You embraced our cause.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spent much of Thursday tiptoeing along the edge of  
gloating, taking advantage of the fine ironies that surrounded him. 
The visit to New Hampshire, where he turned a second-place showing 
in 1992 into a victory of sorts, marked his first political outing 
since the Senate acquitted him last week of perjury and obstruction 
of justice charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The place where he once begged for a second chance was also the  
place where he paused to catch his second wind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am glad to be back,'' Clinton said before hundreds of New  
Hampshire's Democratic faithful in the National Guard Armory in 
Manchester. ``All the experts expected you to send me home; instead 
you made me feel at home, and I still do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He worked the crowd zealously, posing for pictures and absorbing  
more than a few hugs and kisses -- and he held a baby -- 1-month-old 
Alexander Zacher. 
</P>
<P>
	``They took a chance on him and I think he's repaid that trust  
with his performance in office,'' said Paul Begala, a campaign 
strategist in 1992, a White House strategist today. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a popular myth that he survived in New Hampshire, or  
indeed survived today, because of his political talent, which is 
manifest,'' Begala said. ``My view is that he's surviving, then and 
today, because of his ideas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton tried to put those ideas on display Thursday, holding a  
roundtable discussion with Gov. Jeanne Shaheen and people whose 
health care hardships illustrate what some of his budget proposals 
-- particularly a $1,000 tax credit for long-term care -- are 
designed to help alleviate. 
</P>
<P>
	``You will hear all kinds of debates in the next year about what  
to do with the (budget) surplus,'' Clinton said. ``But we have to 
ask ourselves, 'What should our first priority be?''' 
</P>
<P>
	He argued that priority should be people, echoing the 1992  
mantra that he and Vice President Al Gore put into a book. He 
liberally put in plugs for Gore, reminding them that the vice 
president cast the deciding vote on the 1993 budget plan that 
Clinton says paved the way for today's surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody had more to do with the decisions we've made and  
success we've enjoyed than Vice President Al Gore,'' he said. As if 
on cue, dozens of people began waving white ``Gore 2000'' placards. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton punched the air confidently with his fist as he left the  
stage and lingered to shake hands. For the first time in months, he 
ventured close to reporters who wanted to know whether being in New 
Hampshire was nourishing for his soul. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sounds pretty good,'' Clinton said. ``What do you think?''

<HEADLINE> Bell Seeks Long-Distance N.Y. Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bell Atlantic hopes to file an application  
with federal regulators in a few months seeking to provide 
long-distance service in New York, part of its local phone 
territory, President James Cullen said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal policy-makers and analysts believe Bell Atlantic will be  
the first regional Bell telephone company to win Federal 
Communications Commission approval to provide long-distance service 
to some of its local phone customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC has turned down previous long-distance applications by  
other Bell companies saying that they haven't sufficiently opened 
their local phone markets to rivals -- a prerequisite to 
long-distance entry. 
</P>
<P>
	Cullen mentioned the New York application in a speech at the  
Alliance for Public Technology's annual conference here. 
</P>
<P>
	Cullen also renewed his pitch for the FCC to free Bell Atlantic  
and the rest of the Bell companies from regulations that bar them 
from moving Internet and other data traffic across local calling 
boundaries.

<HEADLINE> Ploy Used To Free Death Row Inmate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A videotape of a hired actor giving a phony  
eyewitness account of a murder was used to extract the surprising 
confession that freed an inmate from death row after 17 years, a 
prosecutor said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Thomas Gainer's courtroom disclosure threw an  
extraordinary new light on a legal episode that had been applauded 
as an example of what investigative journalism can accomplish. 
</P>
<P>
	``This new piece of information demands some investigation,''  
Gainer said following a court hearing on erasing the 1982 murder 
conviction of Anthony Porter. No decision was made at the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter, 43, was released on bail two weeks ago after Milwaukee  
laborer Alstory Simon made a videotape in which he admitted killing 
two people in an alleged dispute over drug money. Porter had been 
on death row for the killings. 
</P>
<P>
	Simon, 48, made the videotape at the urging of private  
investigator Paul Ciolino, who was working for a Northwestern 
University journalism professor and his investigative reporting 
class. 
</P>
<P>
	The journalism students had been widely applauded for tracking  
down Simon and gathering preliminary information that led to his 
admission. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ciolino went by himself to the interview at which Simon  
admitted to the killings. 
</P>
<P>
	Ciolino said at the time that he appealed to Simon's conscience  
and warned him that witnesses were recanting their testimony 
against Porter. He said Simon became even more worried when his 
estranged wife appeared in a national television interview talking 
about the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Gainer told the court hearing, however, that on Monday,  
prosecutors got a call from Ciolino's attorney saying that the 
private investigator had played Simon a videotape of an actor. The 
actor had been hired to pretend he witnessed the shooting, Gainer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor would not comment later on whether the use of the  
phony eyewitness statement would make Simon's confession 
inadmissible in court. But he said it didn't reflect on Porter's 
innocence.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Higher; Dow Up 41.32 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock indexes ended the day higher but pulled  
back from substantial gains in the final 15 minutes of trading 
today, after President Clinton reiterated that Serbian leaders will 
be ``held accountable'' if peace talks on Kosovo collapse and a 
NATO bombing campaign is needed there. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrials ended the day up 41.32 at 9,339.95,  
but a 97-point gain at 3:45 p.m. EST dwindled to nothing before the 
market picked up again. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 composite index rose 1.91 to 1,239.21,  
and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 22.90 to 
2,283.45. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by 1,530 to 1,413 on the  
New York Stock Exchange, with 610 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 696.93 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.  
738.56 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 0.10 to 586.56, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 2.75 to 692.57. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rise 1.20 to 392.29.  
</P>
<P>
	In a press conference at 3:45 p.m. EST, 15 minutes before the  
close of trading, President Clinton said U.S. military planes were 
ready to assist NATO troops in Kosovo if Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic failed to strike a peace agreement with ethnic 
Albanians by a 6 a.m. EST Saturday deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from the flurry of activity in the final minutes, the  
stock market was quiet and stable for most of the session, with the 
Dow higher for most of the day as technology shares marked their 
second day of recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Hugh Johnson, market strategist at First Albany Corp., said the  
market lacked direction. So-called defensive stocks like soft drink 
and drug stocks, which tend to do well during a recession, did well 
today. But so did economically vulnerabe manufacturing stocks, like 
autos and chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	And financial services stocks rose, despite a drop in bond  
prices that pushed interest rates higher. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some event is going to have to come along and turn the fence  
sitters into buyers and sellers,'' Johnson said. ``It could be 
anything'' -- from a negative event, such as a further rise in 
interest rates, to positive economic developments in Japan and 
throughout Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've seen a lot of activity over there, and that could  
improve the prospect of economic recovery'' that could boost the 
shares of U.S.-based global companies that do business there, 
Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, technology stocks, which have been battered in recent  
weeks, rose for the second straight day. The Nasdaq composite 
gained 15 percent in January, but most of those gains were lost 
amid a steep selloff in technology shares this month. The Nasdaq is 
now up only 4 percent for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Fueling today's gains was CIBC Oppenheimer analyst Henry  
Blodget's prediction that Internet stocks would hit new highs this 
year. Among the stocks he thought would do especially well was 
Amazon.com and Yahoo!. 
</P>
<P>
	Blodget gained investors' attention last December after he  
sharply increased his price projection for Amazon.com. to $400 a 
share, prior to its 3-to-1 stock split. Once it surpassed that 
level, he refused to raise his price target again, which put 
pressure on the entire Internet sector. 
</P>
<P>
	There was little reaction in the market today to a tame  
inflation report from the Labor Department, which showed consumer 
prices rising just a tiny 0.1 percent in January. The 
smaller-than-expected report failed to calm investors' fears that 
the Federal Reserve would soon raise interest rates to cool the 
U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a narrow margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to an anemic 696.93 
million shares, down from Thursday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average 0.34 percent, Germany's  
DAX index fell 1 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 fell 0.7 percent, and 
France's CAC-40 rose 1.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> Wells Depressed After Yankees Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- David Wells needed to get away. So after  
pacing around his Palm Harbor, Fla. home, Wells traveled to Miami 
for a weekend of golf. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never seen him so down ... beyond depressed,'' New York  
Yankees pitcher David Cone said Friday, a day after Wells was dealt 
to Toronto along with Graeme Lloyd and Homer Bush for Roger 
Clemens. ``I've never seen anybody so stunned by a trade ... 
confused and stunned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cone spent four hours at Wells' home on Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's (normally) so upbeat. He was pacing around and couldn't  
sit down,'' Cone said. ``He was at a loss for words. He just had to 
get away. I don't think it has sunken in yet. He probably feels 
rejected and needs somebody to want him. He was very disappointed. 
He truly loved playing for the Yankees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wells became the toast of New York after pitching a perfect game  
against Minnesota last May. Fans loved him for his biker and beer 
image. Yankees owner George Steinbrenner became fond of Wells, even 
tolerating the pitcher's love of heavy metal music. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think our friendship will continue,'' Steinbrenner said.  
``It was tough yesterday. I think David knows how I feel about 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrenner wasn't upset that some Yankees fans didn't like the  
trade. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fan reaction is important, but it's not the final grade,'' he  
said. ``I learned a long time ago from (former Yankees general 
manager) Gabe Paul, who was one of the smartest men I ever met in 
baseball, you can not make a move and have it judged by the fan 
reaction. You let the results speak for themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York sportsradio was abuzz with negative reaction.  
</P>
<P>
	``People love him just because of the way he is,'' Yankees  
manager Joe Torre said. ``Boomer is a character. The whole thing on 
and off the field, I think endeared him to the New York people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some in baseball said the trade was just another example of how  
baseball's rich get richer. The arrival of Clemens boosted the 
Yankees' payroll to $86.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really resent people making this a fiscal deal. I'm tired of  
hearing people saying, `Oh, the Yankees can do this, the Yankees 
can do that,' '' Steinbrenner said. ``This was a trade ... people 
have seem to forgotten that. If our guys made a better trade than 
somebody else, so be it. Don't let them start saying we're doing 
all this because we've got the money. That didn't come to bear 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team was anticipating the arrival of Clemens on Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	``He'll fit in the with group ... he's a Yankee now,''  
Steinbrenner said. ``He's bigger than life almost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cone wants to learn from his former rival.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm anxious to see that legendary game-day preparation. It's  
very intense,'' Cone said. ``I'd like to talk with him and compare 
notes on American League hitters.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Yankees closer Mariano Rivera is ready to move on after  
winning a $4.25 million arbitration ruling on Thursday. ``We went 
through the process, we fought and we won,'' Rivera said. ... With 
the departure of Graeme Lloyd, the Yankees have just one 
left-hander, Mike Stanton in the bullpen. ``Having two lefties was 
a luxury,'' Torre said. ``Still, you always keep your eyes open for 
a left-hander. I would like to find out what we have in camp.'' 
Non-roster invitees David Carroll and Ed Yarnall are only two 
left-handed bullpen candidates in camp. ... Darryl Strawberry, 
still recovering from colon cancer surgery, intends to call Atlanta 
first baseman Andres Galarraga, who will miss this season because 
of a cancerous tumor in a bone in his back. ``I want to try to 
encourage him,'' Strawberry said. ``I want to try and let him know 
about the road ahead.'' Strawberry said prior to his surgery, he 
benefited from talking with Baltimore outfielder Eric Davis, who 
had also had colon cancer. ``It's a tough situation,'' Strawberry 
said. ``People that have been through it know more about it than 
anybody.''

<HEADLINE> Hurdler Torian Wins at D.C. Event </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FAIRFAX, Va. (AP) -- Because of a lost shuttle van driver, it  
took Reggie Torian 5 1/2 hours to travel the 15 miles from Dulles 
Airport to his Fairfax hotel. Fortunately, he was able to drive 
himself when it came time to run the hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
	Torian won the 60-meter hurdles in 7.45 seconds Friday night at  
the D.C. Invitational, making him 3-for-3 on the U.S. Track &AMP; 
Field's Golden Spike Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was going for the hat trick,'' said Torian, who won the  
tour's first two meets, the Millrose Games and the Los Angeles 
Indoor Invitational. ``I think I scored all three goals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jon Drummond won the 60-meter dash, Mark Everett took the 800,  
and Jeff Hartwig set a meet record in the pole vault in the final 
major meet before next weekend's U.S. indoor championships in 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the women, Inger Miller won the 60, which was once again  
contested in a one-on-one format in the semifinals and final. Tisha 
Waller took the high jump, although the experiment in which the 
athletes jumped to their own musical selections didn't seem to 
catch on with the crowd at the George Mason University field house. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Torian, he arrived at Dulles at noon on Thursday, but  
soon found himself in Baltimore when his driver got lost. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tell him to let me out on the side of the road. He lets me  
out, and I walk to a 7-11 and I call a cab,'' said Torian, who was 
loaned 35 cents for the phone by a fellow passenger and was bought 
a Twinkie by another. 
</P>
<P>
	``It takes the cab an hour-and-a-half to get to me, then I had  
to pay $75 for the cab ride to the hotel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, at race time, Torian wasn't the one in a hurry. Mark Crear,  
who was disqualified by two false starts at the Millrose Games, had 
one called on him this time. He finished second at 7.57. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't speak for him, but when I jump a gun I have to reload  
and I actually have to sit in the blocks,'' Torian said. ``On 
Mark's behalf, I don't think he should do that anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hartwig was in a groove and felt primed to break the American  
indoor record of 19 feet, 4 3/4 inches, but his 19-2 1/4 vault that beat 
Lawrence Johnson was the last jump of the event. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a little disappointment there because I felt like it  
was a good enough jump that, put the bar at the new American 
record, I could have jumped that again,'' Hartwig said. 
</P>
<P>
	Everett won the 800 easily in 1:48.30. Johnny Gray withdrew  
shortly before the race with a leg cramp. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been doing this since 1987, and it's amazing that  
everybody's surprised that I'm able to do it every time,'' Everett 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Waller chose Aretha Franklin's ``Jump to It'' as the music that  
blared from the loudspeakers every time she jumped, and her 
competitors picked selections from Shania Twain and the Rolling 
Stones. But the crowd never really caught on, and a confused public 
announcer didn't help. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, Waller won with a jump of 6-4 1/4, keeping her  
unbeaten on the Golden Spike. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller outdueled Chryste Gaines in a two-woman final to take the  
women's sprint in 7.18 seconds, making her also undefeated on the 
tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't lost yet, so it's good,'' Miller said of the  
one-on-one finals. ``I like it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Drummond wouldn't mind seeing the same format in the men's  
sprint, which he won in 6.50. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's awesome,'' Drummond said. ``If they did it with the men,  
I'd say screw the blocks and line 'em up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Melissa Mueller won the women's pole vault by clearing 14-5 1/4.  
She failed in four attempts to break her own American record of 
14-9.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks' Olson Ready for 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- A year ago, Gregg Olson practically had to  
beg for an invitation to spring training from the expansion Arizona 
Diamondbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	What followed was one of baseball's most remarkable comebacks of  
1998. Now Olson enters 1999 with a firm grip on the closer's role 
for what could be one of the National League's strongest pitching 
rotations. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, with a team that won 67 games, Olson had 30 saves in  
34 opportunities, the fifth-best percentage in the National League. 
</P>
<P>
	``You come to never doubt the heart of a guy like Gregg Olson,''  
manager Buck Showalter said. 
</P>
<P>
	It is a heart that's been sorely tested.  
</P>
<P>
	Olson burst into the majors with Baltimore in 1989 and  
immediately became one of the game's best closers -- 27 saves in 
1989, 37 in 1990, 31 in 1991, 36 in 1992 and 29 in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the first reliever ever to have 25 saves in his first  
five seasons, but on Aug. 23, 1993, he went on the disabled list 
with a sore pitching elbow, an injury later diagnosed as a torn 
ligament. 
</P>
<P>
	Olson signed with Atlanta but refused to undergo surgery,  
choosing instead to try to work his arm back into shape. He 
couldn't regain his form and became a baseball nomad. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1994 through 1997, he pitched for six major league and five  
minor league teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``My stuff left me for four years,'' he said. ``My breaking ball  
was inconsistent, my fastball was probably 89 mph and my location 
wasn't very good because my mechanics were bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After 1997, nobody was interested in him period, let alone as a  
closer, but he talked his way into a non-roster invitation from the 
Diamondbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year was kind of my final shot at getting back to it,''  
he said. ``I was running out of opportunities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He barely made the team as a middle reliever. But Arizona got  
off to an 8-31 start, and Showalter was looking for answers. On May 
31, Olson got his first chance to close, and his first save. 
</P>
<P>
	Suddenly, he was not just the Olson of old. He was better.  
</P>
<P>
	``I picked up a changeup, and all of a sudden my mechanics came  
back,'' he said. ``My curveball was consistent. My location was 
much better than it ever has been. I was consistent on my fastball 
at 91 to 92 mph.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his early days, he could throw a consistent 94 mph.  
</P>
<P>
	``But that was the middle of the plate, hard as I can go, here  
it is kind of pitch,'' he said. ``Last year it was 92 inside 
corner, two-seamer, here it is, and when I needed 94 once in awhile 
it was there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During one stretch, he had 22 consecutive saves. He finally  
topped 200 saves for his career, the 22nd pitcher to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	``What a nice story,'' said Stottlemyre, who pitched against  
Olson in those heady Baltimore days. ``It tells you a lot about his 
character. It tells you a lot about what type of competitor he 
is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olson was a major factor in keeping the Diamondbacks  
respectable. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, if we have a lot of blown saves, we're going to  
lose 110 games,'' Andy Benes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Olson is on a team with much higher expectations. Instead  
of coming in for Willie Blair, Amaury Telemaco or Jeff Supan, he'll 
be following Stottlemyre, Benes, Omar Daal, Armando Reynoso -- and 
one of the best of them all -- Randy Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Following Johnson will mean nothing different to Olson, a  
serious student of the game who carefully charts pitches on his 
laptop computer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to try not to blow any of his games,'' Olson said.  
``But I'm going to try not to blow any of Omar's, or Andy's, or 
Todd's.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At spring training, Olson is trying to not push things too hard  
and strain something, as he's done the last three springs, minor 
injuries that set him back a week or so. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a small worry compared to those big ones of the past, such  
as whether he would make the team, or whether he would ever make it 
back as a big-time closer. 
</P>
<P>
	Olson is a 32-year-old bargain for the Diamondbacks, who  
exercised their option for a second year on the contract they 
signed him to last year. His $850,000 salary is paltry by today's 
standards for closers. 
</P>
<P>
	He isn't sure how much longer he will pitch, but he intends to  
make up for those lost years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like I wasted four of them,'' Olson said. ``Add four to  
what I was going to do, maybe it will be until I'm 40.''

<HEADLINE> Intel execs to testify at trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Top executives from Intel Corp. are among  
witnesses who will testify at the computer chip-maker's antitrust 
trial, starting next month. 
</P>
<P>
	The government and the company on Friday identified their  
witnesses for the trial, which is scheduled to begin March 9. 
High-profile witnesses include Andrew Grove, Intel's co-founder and 
chairman, and Craig Barrett, who took over as chief executive 
officer last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, the world's largest chip-maker, with $26.2 billion in  
sales last year, also identified 16 more of its own executives and 
15 others from outside the company who will appear as witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shows you that Intel has guts to put their top guns on the  
stand,'' said Robert Litan, an economist with the Brookings 
Institution. He said Grove, who escaped communist Hungary as a 
20-year-old chemistry student, ``has a terrific life story to bring 
into the courtroom. I would suspect he would be a very impressive 
witness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission's case against Intel will take  
place in a courtroom across Constitution Avenue and just blocks 
from the federal courthouse where Microsoft Corp. is fighting its 
own antitrust case against the Justice Department and a group of 19 
states. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Microsoft's trial, where Chairman Bill Gates has not  
testified in his own company's defense, Intel plans to put both its 
CEO and former CEO on the stand. 
</P>
<P>
	``These witnesses present very tempting targets in the sense  
that if you can obtain some admission or concession, it weighs very 
heavily,'' said Richard Gray, an antitrust lawyer in San Jose, 
Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	But he added: ``I strongly suspect the FTC will have a much  
tougher time with (Grove and Barrett) than the Justice Department 
has had with Microsoft executives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government will use testimony from executives at rival  
Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Compaq Computer Corp., Micron 
Technology Inc. and others to try to prove that Intel abused its 
market influence to freeze out and punish competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC sued Intel in June, accusing it of denying three of its  
competitors access to important technical information about 
upcoming Intel chips. It said Intel sought to punish the 
competitors for refusing to license key patents on Intel's terms. 
</P>
<P>
	The three companies were Digital Equipment Corp., Intergraph  
Corp. and Compaq Computer Corp., which now owns Digital. 
Intergraph's chief executive officer, James W. Meadlock, will also 
be a government witness.

<HEADLINE> Cone Mills To Cut 650 More Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Cone Mills Corp. will cut an additional  
650 jobs, or about 11.5 percent of its work force, as the denim 
maker tries to boost its earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	The job cuts, coupled with last month's decision to shut down  
its plant in Salisbury that employs 625 people, would leave it with 
about 5,000 workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's cuts come in the wake of several restructuring moves by  
the denim maker, including merging its denim and sportswear fabrics 
businesses and laying off an unspecified number of white-collar 
workers in manufacturing and management. 
</P>
<P>
	Other cuts will come from the discontinuation of yarn  
manufacturing at the company's Cliffside and Florence plants in 
Rutherford County this spring, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We deeply regret the impact that these changes will have on  
the lives of our displaced employees,'' said president and chief 
executive officer John L. Bakane. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is nothing that can be said to offset the painful impact  
of losing one's job,'' he said. ``The only consolation that we at 
Cone Mills have is that the dedication and commitment of the new 
Cone organization to revitalizing the company will ensure the 
future security of our approximately 5,000 remaining employees and 
their families.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Cone Mills said it will shut down its Salisbury  
plant, which put 625 hourly and salaried employees out of work. It 
was the city's oldest cotton mill, opening in 1888. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to the cuts, the company employed more than 6,000 workers  
at nine plants in North Carolina and South Carolina and a joint 
venture plant in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	The revised restructuring program is expected to save about $30  
million per year, Bakane said. That's up from the $20 million in 
savings pinned to last month's cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our restructuring program has been more extensive than  
originally expected ...'' Bakane said. ``This should go a long way 
toward accelerating the company's earnings recovery and, therefore, 
ensuring the future security of the company and the interests of 
our shareholders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cone Mills lost $6.7 million, or 37 cents per share, in 1998  
compared to a loss of $9.4 million, or 47 cents per share,in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Cone Mills is the world's largest producer of denim fabrics and  
the largest commission printer of home furnishings fabrics in North 
America.

<HEADLINE> Celine Dion Denies Anorexia Rumors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Celine Dion wants the rumors about her being  
anorexic to stop. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have an eating problem, and there's nothing more I can  
say about that,'' she tells this week's edition of People magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Dion, who is 5-foot-7 and 115 pounds, said her thin physique  
comes from her high metabolism. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm lucky,'' she said. ``If I had a problem with my health, I  
would let my fans know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year-old Canadian singer, who rose to fame with her  
rendition of the ``Titanic'' movie theme, ``My Heart Will Go On,'' 
stunned fans by saying she will take a yearlong break to spend time 
with her husband, beginning next January. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't wait to do normal things -- like just doing your own  
groceries, looking for your own tomatoes,'' she said. ``I just 
can't wait to get up in the morning and look awful. I'm looking 
forward to getting bored.''

<HEADLINE> Padres' Hoffman Confident on Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ariz. (AP) -- San Diego's Trevor Hoffman, baseball's most  
dominant closer last year, knows his potential free agent status at 
the end of this season could get him traded. 
</P>
<P>
	But don't count on it, he said Friday, the first day of spring  
workouts for pitchers and catchers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm optimistic,'' he said of the stalled negotiations on his  
contract extension. ``I really think we're going to get something 
done. I really think they can't afford to get rid of me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman converted 53 of 54 save chances last season, the best  
percentage (.981) in baseball history, and finished second in the 
Cy Young voting to Atlanta's Tom Glavine. The 31-year-old 
right-hander will make $4.1 million this season in the final year 
of an $8.4 million, three-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres approached Hoffman about an extension after the World  
Series, but talks broke off in early December. Hoffman said his 
price went up when Kevin Brown, the Padres' ace last year, signed 
his $105 million, seven-year deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The deal that I'm going to sign is going to be a fair deal,  
and in return, I'm going to want a no-trade to go with that,'' 
Hoffman said. ``Part of the whole philosophy is to stay. I don't 
know if that's the hang-up or not, but that's important to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres began with a three-year offer for about $6 million  
per season, then increased it to four years at $24 million, 
according to a source familiar with the negotiations. At that time, 
Hoffman was seeking four years at $28 million, but since then, his 
price is believed to have gone up to $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Padres owner John Moores said he hoped to have Hoffman signed  
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect to be aggressive in bidding for Trevor,'' Moores  
said. ``We're not going to go off the chart. We're not going to 
offer Kevin Brown kind of money to Trevor. And we're not going to 
offer a seven-year contract. It just doesn't make any sense for a 
closer. But we will be competitive, and we'll have to see how it 
goes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Padres general manager Kevin Towers said he hopes to sit down  
with Hoffman informally sometime in the next week to find out where 
he's coming from. Towers also said he's willing to change the 
club's policy of not negotiating during the season, if that's what 
it takes to get a deal done. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, Hoffman said he needs to focus on getting ready  
for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if I'm fearful or nervous,'' said Hoffman, who  
was aware of the negative fan reaction after slugger Greg Vaughn 
was traded to Cincinnati on Feb. 2. ``I know from their standpoint 
that they're in no position to trade me. For one, it would be a 
public snafu for them. Not that I'm using that for leverage, but I 
understand it's a business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other news, left-handed reliever Randy Myers, who's on the  
trading block because of his $6 million salary and ineffectiveness 
last season, has told the team he won't be in camp until Tuesday, 
when the full squad is expected to report. And right-hander Dan 
Miceli arrived in camp after recently shedding 30 pounds.

<HEADLINE> Genetic Engineering Summit Held </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Prospecting, piracy, private eyes -- the buzzwords negotiators  
are using at an international summit this week suggest intrigue and 
danger. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the meeting's backdrop -- the exotic old Caribbean pirate  
port of Cartagena, Colombia -- adds to the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	But instead of weapons or precious metals, experts from 174  
nations are debating how to regulate trade in gene-engineered 
potatoes, cotton, grains and trees. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N.-backed summit represents the first global attempt to  
reduce the risks that laboratory-designed species might pose to 
public health and the environment. 
</P>
<P>
	For 20 years, biotech companies have been genetically  
manipulating plants and animals to make them more attractive -- 
redder, juicer tomatoes, for example -- speed their growth or make 
them more resistant to disease. 
</P>
<P>
	These new combinations could increase the food supply and reduce  
the need for hazardous farm chemicals. But opponents fear the 
unintended consequences of messing with nature. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, scientists added commercially valuable traits from  
the brazil nut to a strain of soybeans but ended up making the 
soybeans risky for people with nut allergies. 
</P>
<P>
	Another fear is that genes inserted in crops to give them  
certain favorable traits -- resistance to herbicides, for example -- 
might jump to surrounding wild plants. Some weeds have already 
become impervious to weedkillers in this way. 
</P>
<P>
	These plants, animals and microbes are commercial products as  
much as they are life forms, and the rights are tightly held by a 
small and shrinking group of multinational companies. Policing 
these rights is also on the agenda at the conference, which was 
convened to negotiate what is being called the Biosafety Protocol. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're experiencing a big shift into a biotech century,'' said  
Jeremy Rifkin, who is president of the Washington-based Foundation 
on Economic Trends and wants a moratorium on the commercial use of 
genetically engineered organisms. ``We need to be asking a whole 
different set of regulatory, environmental and liability questions. 
It's going to affect everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Biotech industry leaders contend their products are already  
subject to stringent safety standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Agribusiness giant Monsanto says its 60 genetically engineered  
crops have been the subject of 25,000 field trials in 45 nations. 
More regulation would ``massively disrupt all international trade 
in biological materials,'' said Val Giddings of the Biotechnology 
Industrial Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States is taking part in the summit but cannot vote  
on the protocol because the Senate has not ratified the 
U.N.-sponsored biodiversity agreement negotiated in Rio de Janiero 
in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	The biosafety debate has gotten little attention in the United  
States, even though it exports 80 percent of the world's 
bioengineered materials. 
</P>
<P>
	Europe, however, has seen protests calling for a ban on the sale  
of ``Frankenstein foods,'' at least until their risks can be 
determined. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a huge domain of scientific uncertainty about the  
impact of these things,'' said Ian Taylor, scientific adviser for 
the environmental group Greenpeace in England. 
</P>
<P>
	A 68-year-old toxicologist in Scotland, Arpad Pusztai, has  
become a cause celebre in the biosafety debate. 
</P>
<P>
	He added insect-resistant genes and proteins to potatoes and fed  
them to rats. The animals suffered damaged immune systems, growth 
problems and shrunken brains, he said. It was thought to be the 
first time that trials of genetically modified food showed harmful 
effects. 
</P>
<P>
	However, his employer, the Rowett Research Institute in  
Aberdeen, described the findings as ``muddled'' and ``misleading'' 
and refused in August to renew his contract. Other scientists have 
come to his defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Even supporters of genetic engineering say more testing is  
necessary, especially when food is involved. 
</P>
<P>
	``Genetically manipulated organisms are part of the solution of  
raising food production in the world,'' said Maarten Chrispeels of 
the University of California at San Diego. ``It is a good idea if 
there are uniform practices and all countries subscribe to minimum 
standards for testing and release.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reaching a consensus before Tuesday, the last scheduled day of  
the summit, may prove difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	As of Friday, negotiators from the developed world led by the  
United States had succeeded in watering-down a draft text to 
exclude food crops and most other commodities -- such as jeans made 
from genetically engineered cotton -- from the list of regulated 
organisms. 
</P>
<P>
	Other issues in the debate include:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Labeling: Consumer and environmental groups want genetically  
altered foods and other products to carry labels explaining their 
scientific histories. Many biotech companies and grocers are 
opposed. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Permits: Some nations want to establish export permits for  
each biologically altered product. The Clinton administration wants 
to require permits only for those products that might cause 
environmental harm. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Prospecting and Piracy: Corporations employ researchers to  
``hunt'' down genes in biologically rich countries and 
commercialize them. The host nations want to earn royalties on the 
genes. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Private eyes: Monsanto has been sending private investigators  
to make sure farmers are not violating agreements that bar them 
from saving gene-engineered seeds and using them in a later growing 
season.

<HEADLINE> First Lady Considers Senate Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton and her advisers  
are contacting dozens of political consultants, Democratic donors 
and election law attorneys in a rapidly growing effort to determine 
whether she will run for the Senate in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady did some of her own research Friday, meeting  
privately in the White House with retiring New York Sen. Daniel 
Patrick Moynihan, a session that press secretary Marsha Berry 
called ``an opportunity to explore thoughts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several of Mrs. Clinton's advisers say she is increasingly  
warming to the notion of running. Yet they caution that her 
decision could be weeks or months away. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton said Friday that he will ``be strongly  
supportive of whatever decision she makes'' but that he was 
encouraging her to ``take some time, get some rest, listen to 
people on both sides of the argument.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She has just been through a very exhausting year and there are  
circumstances which have to be considered,'' Clinton said. ``I 
think some time has to be taken here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The possibility of a lengthy exploratory period worries New York  
Democrats who have little hope of fielding quality candidates until 
Mrs. Clinton gets in or out. Polls show New York Mayor Rudolph 
Giuliani, often mentioned as a possible GOP nominee, leads all 
potential Democratic candidates with the exception of Mrs. Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Close friends say her decision hinges mostly on personal issues,  
because she is already convinced she can raise enough money and 
build a strong enough political operation to mount a credible 
campaign. They say it boils down to this: Does she want to be a 
junior senator? And can she overcome her visceral distrust of the 
media and accept the scrutiny a campaign would bring? 
</P>
<P>
	After Mrs. Clinton's meeting Friday with Moynihan, whose  
retirement will open the New York seat, the senator said they 
discussed his state's voting patterns and demographics. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're more complex than you might think,'' he said, adding  
that the numbers ``look very good for her, but New York is a big 
demographic problem.'' He said he did not advise her on whether she 
should run, but ``of course I'd support her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two friends who talked to her recently say Mrs. Clinton has  
suggested that, of all the options open to her, seeking the New 
York seat may be the most compelling. ``The Senate ranks very 
high,'' said one friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Those sentiments surprise many other close friends and allies  
who remain convinced she will eventually decide against running. 
Some cite the family's multimillion-dollar legal bills and her need 
to make money after leaving the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	At her direction, these supporters have sounded out scores of  
political operatives from across the country, some of whom would be 
in line for campaign jobs if she runs. Bill Carrick and David Doak, 
both of whom have ties to New York, received calls recently. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore, after addressing the AFL-CIO executive  
committee in Florida on Friday, told reporters, ``If she chooses to 
run for the Senate, I predict she will win and be a great 
senator.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, who is running for president, was asked if he would  
consider her as a vice presidential candidate. He chuckled and 
said, ``You'll have to hold off on questions like that until she 
can make her decision and I have the privilege'' of winning the 
nomination and choosing a running mate. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani said Friday that the high profile Mrs. Clinton would  
bring to the Senate race might make running more enticing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just given the attention that the possibility of this  
happening has gotten, can you imagine what would actually occur if 
it did happen?'' the Republican mayor said on CNN's ``Inside 
Politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He predicted the first lady's impressive money-raising abilities  
would redound to the benefit of the GOP candidate as well: ``There 
are people who strongly support her and there are people on the 
other side who oppose her, so that makes her opponent more in a 
position to raise money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton has met previously with Moynihan's wife, Elizabeth;  
Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.; Senate Democratic campaign committee 
chairman Sen. Robert Torricelli of New Jersey and a few female 
senators, including Barbara Boxer, D-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	She meets next week with AFL-CIO President John Sweeney.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton has not raised money or commissioned polling and  
there are no plans to do so, advisers say. She did have operatives 
contact lawyers versed in campaign laws to ensure she stays within 
legal bounds during this exploratory stage. They also are examining 
complicated questions that would be raised in the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Stung by years of investigations in the White House, Mrs.  
Clinton is said to fear her every move will be studied while she 
explores the Senate option. Questions already have been raised 
about who should pay for her travel as first lady if she seeks the 
Senate seat. 
</P>
<P>
	Harold Ickes, a former White House chief of staff and longtime  
ally of Mrs. Clinton, plans to meet with lawyers next week, sources 
say. 
</P>
<P>
	The prospect of nominating a sitting first lady with a huge  
fund-raising base and a strong following excites party activists. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would love to see her run,'' said Sandra Feldman, president  
of the American Federation of Teachers attending the four-day 
AFL-CIO convention in Florida that ended Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton was the hot topic among labor bosses and Democratic  
operatives here. Sweeney said she would be a good candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile in Washington, anti-abortion leaders announced plans  
to field protesters at every campaign event Mrs. Clinton might 
hold. ``We will have signs, we will ask questions,'' said the Rev. 
Patrick Mahoney, director of the Christian Defense Coalition.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some House members are questioning whether  
Oregon is complying with federal law by covering assisted suicides 
in its health plan for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress in 1997 prohibited the use of federal money for  
assisted suicide. The Oregon Health Plan is funded in part by 
federal Medicaid dollars, but state and federal officials say 
assisted suicides are covered entirely by the state. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan covers about 350,000 Oregonians and has not paid any  
assisted-suicide claims since it began coverage of suicides Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Thomas Bliley, R-Va., who chairs the House Commerce  
Committee, and three other Republicans wrote a letter to Health and 
Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala last week asking for a 
review of how Oregon was given a waiver for assisted suicide 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	They also want to know if officials of the Health Care Financing  
Administration met with Oregon officials, reviewed congressional 
intent behind the 1997 law and met with outside experts on assisted 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	HCFA spokesman Chris Peacock said, ``Under no circumstances does  
HCFA allow Medicaid coverage for assisted suicide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As with abortion cases, the state says it would spend only state  
dollars on assisted-suicide cases. Even the billing claims for 
assisted suicide would be handled separately by clerks who are not 
being paid with federal money. 
</P>
<P>
	``HCFA was very clear with us,'' said Hersh Crawford, director  
of the Oregon Health Plan. ``No federal funds were (to be) spent on 
assisted suicide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State officials said this week that 15 terminally ill Oregonians  
used the landmark Death With Dignity Act to end their lives during 
the law's first year. Two were covered by the Oregon Health Plan, 
but the plan didn't cover assisted suicides at the time of their 
deaths.

<HEADLINE> Olivetti May Bid $58B for Rival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Italian telecommunications firm Olivetti SpA  
announced its board would meet Sunday to discuss giant rival 
Telecom Italia SpA, as a report said Olivetti was planning to 
launch a bold $58 billion takeover bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti did not disclose other details of the weekend meeting,  
and on Friday only revealed that the session would concern Telecom 
Italia because stock market regulators asked Olivetti to comment on 
rampant merger rumors. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, The Wall Street Journal Interactive Edition reported  
Friday that Olivetti was preparing to bid for Telecom Italia -- 
whose market value of about $52 billion is more than five times 
that of Olivetti. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom Italia, the former state monopoly, is the world's  
sixth-largest phone company, but has endured three management 
shakeups in the past 18 months. A takeover by Olivetti would rank 
as Europe's richest telecommunications deal ever. 
</P>
<P>
	The bid hinges on a plan for Olivetti to sell stakes in two  
Italian telecom operators to Germany's Mannesmann AG for $10 
billion to help raise money for the Telecom Italia bid, according 
to the report on the Journal's Web site from The Wall Street 
Journal Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The Journal said Olivetti's board would vote on those sales and  
the Telecom Italia bid on Sunday. Mannesmann declined to comment on 
Olivetti's board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The news pushed Olivetti stock up 8.7 percent in Milan, while  
Telecom Italia shares climbed 2.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Rumors about a possible deal have building over the past two  
months. Last month, Olivetti said a report that it was planning to 
buy Telecom Italia ``unfounded and impracticable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Italy's stock market regulator, Consob, is now evaluating  
Olivetti's denial in light of current developments, and also said 
it had opened a preliminary inquiry into insider trading of Telecom 
Italia shares after a large block changed hands Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Magic Johnson Angered by Rodman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- An exasperated Magic Johnson says  
Dennis Rodman is ``trying to hold us hostage,'' and the Los Angeles 
Lakers should forget about signing him. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said the uncertainty surrounding Rodman's situation has  
damaged the image of the team he led to five NBA championships 
during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm tired of this. I am,'' said Johnson, a part-owner and vice  
president of the Lakers, said on David Letterman's show Thursday 
night. ``I'm going to say this tonight and I've been holding it. 
It's like a circus now. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are a first-class organization. We do things the right way,  
and right now, he's like trying to hold us hostage. ... He's 
driving me crazy because he's hurting the team, he's hurting the 
organization, so I would love us just to say forget it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, that hasn't been the case. Team spokesman John Black  
said Thursday the Lakers weren't ready to issue an ultimatum to the 
flamboyant seven-time rebounding champion, who met with team owner 
Jerry Buss on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers can sign Rodman only for the veteran minimum of $1  
million, prorated to $600,000 for the shortened season and 
diminishing further with each game he misses. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Rodman will receive $3 million in a deal with Converse  
if he plays in Los Angeles, Chicago or New York. 
</P>
<P>
	At a shootaround Friday, several hours before the Lakers faced  
the San Antonio Spurs at the Forum, Black said he didn't expect any 
action Friday on Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry West, the team's vice president of basketball operations,  
said he knew of no developments and was tired of talking about it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers first expressed interest in Rodman more than two  
weeks ago, and it was reported last weekend he had decided to play 
for them. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, who turns 38 in May, played on championship teams in  
Chicago the last three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers certainly could use Rodman. Power forward Robert  
Horry, diagnosed with an irregular heartbeat last Sunday, didn't 
play against the Spurs and will miss at least three more games. 
</P>
<P>
	Black said Horry will wear a monitor Monday and Tuesday before  
being evaluated, meaning the earliest he could return is Thursday 
night against the Los Angeles Clippers. The Lakers play at Seattle 
on Sunday, at Denver on Monday night, and at Vancouver on Tuesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers reached the 12-player limit Friday by placing rookies  
Sam Jacobson and Tyronn Lue on the injured list. Jacobson broke his 
left ring finger during pregame warmups Wednesday night; Lue has 
back spasms.

<HEADLINE> Man Sentenced in Quads' Mom Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARASOTA, Fla. (AP) -- A man was sentenced Friday to life in  
prison for plotting to kill a woman who was shot in the face and 
stabbed twice before bleeding to death with her then-2-year-old 
quadruplets nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Rocha of San Antonio was convicted of first-degree murder  
in the death of Sheila Bellush, 35, who had moved from Texas to 
Florida with her quadruplets and two teen-age daughters to start a 
new life. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors claimed that Mrs. Bellush's wealthy ex-husband,  
Allen Blackthorne, told Rocha that she was abusing their two 
teen-age daughters and that he wanted to regain custody of them. 
</P>
<P>
	Rocha made arrangements to hire someone to harm Mrs. Bellush as  
a favor to Blackthorne, his golfing pal, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense said Rocha intended only for Mrs. Bellush to be  
beaten. 
</P>
<P>
	A friend of Rocha's testified he recruited his cousin Jose Luis  
Del Toro, who borrowed a .45-caliber handgun and said he had broken 
into Mrs. Bellush's home and killed her. 
</P>
<P>
	Del Toro is jailed in Mexico and is fighting extradition.  
Blackthorne has not been charged with a crime and has denied 
involvement in any plot. 
</P>
<P>
	Rocha's lawyer said he planned to appeal the sentence.

<HEADLINE> `The Volunteer' Executed in Ohio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LUCASVILLE, Ohio (AP) -- A killer dubbed The Volunteer because of  
his desire to die rather than face life in prison was put to death 
by injection Friday night in Ohio's first execution since 1963. 
</P>
<P>
	In the afternoon, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected an appeal from  
36-year-old Wilford Lee Berry Jr., who refused to participate in 
his lawyers' efforts to save his life. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeal, filed on behalf of his mother and sister, claimed  
that Berry is too mentally ill to decide to drop his legal 
defenses. His lawyers cited a history of suicide attempts since he 
was 9 and head injuries suffered during a beating by fellow inmates 
in a 1997 prison riot. 
</P>
<P>
	State prisons spokesman Joe Andrews said Berry declined to write  
a last statement or meet with a chaplain. Andrews described the 
convict as ``stoic and on an even keel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berry was convicted with a cohort of shooting to death a  
Cleveland baker in a 1989 robbery. Berry had been hired to work as 
a handyman at the shop a few days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio, one of 38 states that have the death penalty, reinstated  
capital punishment in 1981. Since 1976, when the Supreme Court 
reauthorized the death penalty, there have been 518 executions, 18 
of them this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry was turned down for clemency Thursday by Gov. Bob Taft. He  
retained the right to change his mind up to the last minute, which 
would allow him to begin an appeal process. However, he told a 
lawyer for the governor this week that he still wished to die.

<HEADLINE> Three Deliver Black Vaudeville </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The black vaudeville circuit may not have been  
fun for the performers, but ``Rollin' on the T.O.B.A.,'' now at the 
off-Broadway 47th Street Theater, provides an evening of delightful 
entertainment today. 
</P>
<P>
	In the show, Sandra Reaves-Phillips is the singer and Rudy  
Roberson and Jeffery V. Thompson are the comedy team and dance men 
booked by the Theater Owners Booking Association, T.O.B.A. The 
vaudeville circuit of theaters that presented black performers to 
black audiences was called tough by those who toured. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rollin' on the T.O.B.A.'' is basically a revue. In the thread  
of plot, Reaves-Phillips, as star Bertha Mae Little, has booked 
Roberson and Thompson to travel and entertain with her in 1931, 
near black vaudeville's end. 
</P>
<P>
	The better-known comedy teams of black vaudeville, like Miller  
and Lyles, made recordings, and Roberson and Thompson deliver some 
of those routines. The jokes are so old most people now never heard 
them, and they again strike the funnybone. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberson and Thompson do a couple of clever mime sequences,  
playing checkers and playing poker, to a recording of the Ellington 
Band playing ``Black and Tan Fantasy.'' And they run through a 
hilarious Pigmeat Markham and Seals routine, saying they plan to 
steal it for their show with Bertha Mae. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the evening is accompanied by pianist David Alan Bunn.  
</P>
<P>
	Reaves-Phillips' sings in a big, rich voice which remains  
musical, having no need to belt. She sings ``Travelin' Blues''; 
``St. Louis Blues''; a double entendre blues, ``One Hour Mama''; 
``Trouble in Mind,'' and ``A Good Man Is Hard To Find.'' Her 
theater credits include Mama Younger in ``Raisin'' on Broadway, 
``Black and Blue'' in Paris and a national tour of ``One Mo Time!'' 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Rollin' on the T.O.B.A.,'' she plays a Butterbeans and  
Suzie vaudeville comedy routine with Roberson as her lazy husband. 
</P>
<P>
	The three performers sing the title song and ``Let the Good  
Times Roll.'' Sometimes they're seen on stages, sometimes on an 
ancient, shabby, train chair-bench as they travel to the next town. 
</P>
<P>
	Though there are references to segregation -- the men talk about  
being hungry and finding no place marked ``colored'' to eat -- the 
troupers complain very little about the hardships of their life. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, they talk about enjoying entertaining and throw  
themselves into very heads-up performance.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Up Against Yen, Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose against the yen and the euro  
Friday as the United States got some good marks on a new economic 
report card while Europe faltered and Japan remained mired in 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
	``People still feel the United States has a little more  
potential than Europe,'' said Jeffrey Yu, a senior foreign exchange 
dealer at Sanwa Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.1076, down  
from $1.1200 late Thursday. During the trading day, the euro 
drifted as low as $1.1055, its lowest level since the euro was 
introduced at the beginning of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in late trading, the dollar was quoted at 121.15 Japanese  
yen, up from 119.81 Thursday. During trading, the dollar rose to 
121.20 yen, its highest figure since Dec. 2, when the dollar 
reached 122.10 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar's biggest boost came in a batch of mixed numbers. The  
U.S. had an unexpected drop in its trade deficit in December, to 
$13.8 billion, a 10 percent drop over November, the Commerce 
Department reported. Analysts were expecting a widening to $16.0 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	But the department also reported that the trade deficit surged  
to an all-time high of $168.6 billion for the year, a 53 percent 
jump from 1997. The old record of $153.4 billion was set in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	But more good news came from the Labor Department, which  
reported that inflation remained tame with consumer prices rising 
just 0.1 percent in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, business confidence in western Germany fell in  
January for the eighth consecutive month, a close indicator of 
economic growth for the weakened German economy, one of the major 
engines of the 11 countries using the new euro. In France, another 
major European economic power, industrial output declined from 
November to December. 
</P>
<P>
	With the economy remaining on track in the United States,  
analysts see no need for an interest rate cut; some speculated 
there could even be a rate hike. But in Europe, analysts said a 
rate cut was probable. Rate cuts make a country's assets and 
currency less appealing to investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The euro is under steady pressure,'' Yu said.  
</P>
<P>
	Japan provided no further solutions to its economic woes but, Yu  
said, the new official policy allowing the yen to weaken isn't 
helping Japan reverse its worst recession in decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as the U.S. doesn't object to that policy right now,''  
traders will take the yen lower against the dollar, Yu said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4468 Swiss francs, up from  
1.4281, and 1.4852 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4875. The British 
pound fell to $1.6226 from $1.6353. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Friday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.7658 German 
marks, up from 1.7464; 5.9207 French francs, up from 5.8582; and 
1,748.25 Italian lire, up from 1,730.10.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Sees 'Two Good Years' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A week after surviving impeachment, President  
Clinton said Friday he expects ``two good years here'' but 
acknowledged that America probably paid a price for his ordeal. He 
said it has been ``a very exhausting year'' for his wife, Hillary. 
</P>
<P>
	The president said he hoped the presidency had not been harmed  
by his experience, which provoked bitter battles in the courts and 
in Congress. He added, ``I think the Constitution has been in 
effect re-ratified.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton strode into the East Room with visiting President  
Jacques Chirac for his first post-impeachment news conference, a 
session limited to only three questions each from French and 
American reporters. Clinton declined an opportunity to stay longer. 
</P>
<P>
	The president said he has urged his wife, as she decides whether  
to run for the U.S. Senate from New York, to ``take some time, get 
some rest, listen to people on both sides of the argument and 
decide exactly what you think is right to do.'' He said he would 
support whatever she decides and that ``she would do a fabulous 
job'' in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Chirac warned Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic  
he will be held accountable if he refuses to accept an 
internationally sponsored peace agreement for the Serbian province 
of Kosovo. NATO has threatened airstrikes unless an accord is 
reached by noon Saturday (6 a.m. EST). 
</P>
<P>
	``It would a mistake to extend the deadline,'' Clinton said.  
Chirac said there was ``unqualified agreement'' between Paris and 
Washington about Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Halfway through the news conference, Clinton encountered his one  
and only question about impeachment: What lessons had he learned 
from his ordeal and has the office of the presidency been damaged. 
It was Clinton's first news conference in two months. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've learned a lot of lessons,'' a subdued Clinton said. He  
said that ``presidents are people, too. I have learned, again, an 
enormous amount of respect for our Constitution, our framers and 
for the American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he would advise future presidents ``to decide what you  
believe you ought to do for the country and focus on it and work 
hard. The American people hire you to do that and will respond if 
you work at it and if they sense that you're doing this for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he did not believe that his experience had harmed  
the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	But then, he added, ``I can't say that I think this has been  
good for the country. But we will see. I expect to have two good 
years here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The American people expect Congress and the president to get  
back to work, Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Americans expect both sides ``not to have any  
destructive feelings -- or if we do -- not to let them get in the way 
of our doing their business. ... I don't believe that any of us can 
afford to let what has happened get in the way of doing our best 
for our own people and for the future. And I'm going to do my very 
best to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Urging patience for his wife's decision about her political  
future, Clinton noted that the Senate election is two years away. 
</P>
<P>
	``And she has just been through a very exhausting year,''  
Clinton said. ``And there are circumstances which have to be 
considered and I think some time needs to be taken here.'' Besides, 
he said, ``it's hard to keep a kettle of water boiling for almost 
two years.''

<HEADLINE>  Bombers Add Rocket to Arsenal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Roger Clemens always thought he'd look good  
in pinstripes. He just couldn't bring himself to wear them when he 
got his first chance. 
</P>
<P>
	Two seasons after rejecting George Steinbrenner's plea to sign  
with the New York Yankees as a free agent, Rocket is getting 
another opportunity to play for the Boss. 
</P>
<P>
	New York, trying to improve on perfection, traded for the  
five-time Cy Young Award winner and said goodbye Thursday to David 
Wells and two other players from the team that won 125 games and 
the World Series last year. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Yankees weren't eager to tinker with success, Clemens  
is considered well worth the risk after leading the AL in wins, ERA 
and strikeouts the past two seasons with the Toronto Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `I finally got you,''' the 36-year-old right-hander  
said, relating a telephone conversation he had with Steinbrenner 
after the deal was finalized. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel real fortunate that they had a championship team and  
still had an interest in me,'' Clemens said. ``I feel pretty 
fortunate to get a second chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for Wells, he left the Yankees' first day of spring training  
in tears after speaking with Steinbrenner and manager Joe Torre. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a little emotional right now,'' Wells said. ``Give me a  
couple days. It's a little tough right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York and Toronto actually completed the deal late Wednesday  
night, but delayed the announcement to tell Wells in person. 
</P>
<P>
	``He took it like a real man. He took it better than I took  
it,'' Steinbrenner said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Boomer,'' as the 35-year-old left-hander is known throughout  
the Bronx and beyond, has been the toast of New York since pitching 
a perfect game against Minnesota at Yankee Stadium on May 17. He's 
coming off the best season of his career, 18-4 with a 3.49 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	Mr. Perfection was also Mr. Personality, as far as Yankee fans  
were concerned. They loved his loud mouth and his loud music -- 
Metallica was a favorite. They loved his beer belly and the way he 
loves The Babe. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees pitcher David Cone spent four hours at Wells' house in  
Palm Harbor Thursday and said Wells left Thursday night for a 
golfing weekend in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never seen him so down ... beyond depressed,'' Cone said  
today. ``I've never seen anybody so stunned by a trade. He was 
pacing around and couldn't sit down. He just had to get away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens' resume is impressive -- more Cy Youngs than any player  
in baseball history, second on the career ERA title list with six, 
fourth on the career strikeout list with 3,153 -- but doesn't 
include the ultimate team accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good to give fellows a chance who deserve a chance for a  
World Series ring,'' Steinbrenner said. ``Hopefully we can get back 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens is owed $16.1 million during the final two years of his  
contract and has the right to demand a trade following this 
season's World Series. However, he doesn't expect that to become an 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	While stressing that he appreciates a second chance to join New  
York, Clemens didn't second-guess choosing Toronto over the Yankees 
in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``It worked out for me,'' he said. ``It didn't work out for the  
team. We didn't win. That's the bottom line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With a 233-124 career record, Clemens went 20-6 last season  
while leading the AL in ERA (2.65), strikeouts (271) and tying for 
the lead in wins. He led in all three categories in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he won consecutive Cy Young Awards with the Blue Jays, he  
wanted out after the team's Belgium owner, Interbrew SA, decided 
not to compete with baseball's big spenders this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston and Texas were still bidding for Clemens this week, but  
the deal with the Yankees came together after Toronto dropped its 
insistence on obtaining 21-year-old shortstop Alfonso Soriano. 
</P>

	``He's a horse, and he's now our horse,'' New York general  
manager Brian Cashman said. ``We're betting on him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees set an AL record for wins last year, going 114-48 in  
the regular season. New York then went 11-2 in the postseason, 
including a Series sweep of San Diego.

<P>
	``This is a tremendous thing -- hopefully to get back again. Not  
that we wouldn't have that chance anyway. But it might improve our 
chances,'' Steinbrenner said.

<HEADLINE> Man Sentenced in Quads' Mom Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARASOTA, Fla. (AP) -- Before Daniel Rocha was led away to a life  
behind bars for killing a mother of six, his grandmother asked a 
judge to let her hug him for the last time. 
</P>
<P>
	``She believes she will never see him again,'' a defense  
attorney told Circuit Judge Nancy Donnellan on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Marie Purcell came forward in the courtroom, threw her arms  
around Rocha and hugged and kissed him. The 29-year-old Texan, 
shackled hand and foot, could not return her embrace. He closed his 
eyes. Then bailiffs took charge and fingerprinted him. 
</P>
<P>
	Rocha was convicted of first-degree murder in the death of  
Sheila Bellush, 35. The woman who had moved from Texas to Florida 
to start a new life was shot in the face and stabbed twice before 
bleeding to death with her then-2-year-old quadruplets nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors claimed that Mrs. Bellush's ex-husband, Allen  
Blackthorne, told Rocha that she was abusing their two teen-age 
daughters and that he wanted to regain custody. The girls, like the 
quadruplets, also lived with Mrs. Bellush. 
</P>
<P>
	Rocha made arrangements to hire someone to harm Mrs. Bellush as  
a favor to Blackthorne, his golfing pal, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense said Rocha intended only for Mrs. Bellush to be  
beaten. 
</P>
<P>
	A friend of Rocha's testified he recruited his cousin Jose Luis  
Del Toro, who borrowed a .45-caliber handgun and said he had broken 
into Mrs. Bellush's home and killed her. 
</P>
<P>
	Del Toro is jailed in Mexico and is fighting extradition.  
Blackthorne has not been charged with a crime and has denied 
involvement in any plot. 
</P>
<P>
	Rocha's lawyer said he planned to appeal Friday's sentence.  
</P>
<P>
	Before sentencing him, Donnellan had strong words for Rocha.  
</P>
<P>
	``Who made you God?'' she asked. ``Who gave you the right to  
inflict pain on another human life, let alone to take another's 
life. You did both because you wanted a piece of a golf course. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now your life, too, is over the way you dreamed it or lived it  
or knew it. It cannot be redeemed.''

<HEADLINE> Oregon Boasts Own 'Shaq' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- Shaquala Williams became ``Shaq'' to friends  
and classmates in grade school, about the same time Shaquille 
O'Neal was throwing down his first monster dunks in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	While her 7-foot-1 namesake revels in the Hollywood spotlight  
with the Los Angeles Lakers, the 5-foot-6 Williams is quietly 
making a name for herself up the West Coast with No. 18 Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
	The freshman has gone from little-used backup to dependable role  
player to team leader in just a few months. Since taking over as 
the starting point guard nine games ago, the freshman has averaged 
14 points for the Ducks, who went 8-1 during that stretch and have 
their highest ranking since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	``I nominated her for All-American because she's playing like an  
All-American,'' Oregon coach Jody Runge said this week as the Ducks 
prepared for their final home games -- tonight against Arizona State 
and Sunday against Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Williams, Oregon isn't often mentioned in discussions about  
the nation's best. But the Ducks (20-4 overall, 11-2 Pac-10) are 
tied with No. 13 UCLA (19-6, 11-2) for first place in the Pac-10. 
If the teams each win their last five games, Oregon would win the 
automatic NCAA tournament bid by virtue of an edge in tiebreakers. 
That would almost assure the Ducks of staying home for the first 
two rounds of the tournament after losing in the first round on the 
road each of the past five seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Oregon has been an annual power in the Pac-10 under Runge, but  
it wasn't until Williams began asserting herself that the Ducks 
emerged as the conference's dominant team. 
</P>
<P>
	In Oregon's first 13 games, Williams averaged just 4.8 points  
while shooting just 30 percent from the field. Her breakout 
performance came at Southern California on Jan. 8, when she scored 
14 points in a 77-53 win over the Trojans. At UCLA two days later, 
she played 38 minutes and had 15 points in a 76-72 loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did everything a point guard needs to do in that game --  
except win,'' she said. ``But I think it kind of set a standard for 
me as far as what I could be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams replaced sophomore Karen Piers at point guard, and in a  
home game against Washington on Jan. 15, Williams had 25 points on 
10-of-12 shooting and 11 rebounds in the Ducks' 70-56 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	She was nothing short of spectacular in a 106-79 blowout of  
UCLA, then ranked No. 7, at home Feb. 4. She made 11 of 15 shots, 
including 6-of-8 from 3-point range, for 31 points. She also had 
seven assists and played solid defense, a skill that prevented her 
from becoming a starter sooner. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kids on this team know that if they don't defend, they don't  
get to play a whole lot,'' Runge said. ``We always knew she had the 
offensive skills, which came early for her. Now she's really 
improved the defensive part of her game and working on her 
leadership skills. That's a huge accomplishment for a freshman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was Williams' older brother Michael who named her Shaquala,  
for reasons that are still unknown to her. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was sixth grade -- when Shaq came into the league,''  
Williams said of when she first heard her moniker. ``Most people 
couldn't pronounce my name anyway, so they just took the easy way 
out and pronounced it `Shaq.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams played for three different Portland-area high schools  
in four years, and she had a reputation as a selfish player. When 
her first school, St. Mary's, failed to make the state tournament 
her sophomore year, she transferred to Jesuit, an affluent suburban 
school that had a better team but where she feuded with her coach. 
She transferred to Reynolds High in her neighborhood and averaged 
26 points as a senior. But she drew little interest from the big 
colleges. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I came out of high school, everyone said, `Why are you  
going to Oregon? They're not that good,''' Williams said. ``I said, 
`This is a team that can get to the Final Four.' No one believed 
me. Now everything I said is coming true.''

<HEADLINE> Horse Trainer `Dickie' Dutrow Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUREL, Md. (AP) -- Richard ``Dickie'' Dutrow, the Maryland horse  
trainer behind such winners as King's Swan and Lite the Fuse, died 
Friday after a long battle with cancer. He was 61. 
</P>
<P>
	He came into prominence in the early 1970s by winning four  
consecutive training titles at Laurel Park and Pimlico Race Course. 
Dutrow set what was then a record in 1975 by training 352 winners, 
according to a statement from Laurel Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Dutrow moved his training operation to New York in 1984,  
training several stakes winners, including King's Swan, who retired 
with earnings of almost $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Dutrow relocated his stable to Maryland, where he won  
58 more races on the circuit before his death. Last year, he 
finished in a three-way tie for saddling stakes winners with eight 
added money victories. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife, Vicki, and three sons.

<HEADLINE> Myllylae Wins Nordic Freestyle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RAMSAU, Austria (AP) -- In a snowstorm, nobody can beat Mika  
Myllylae. 
</P>
<P>
	The 29-year old Finn has a history of triumphs in extreme  
weather conditions, and Friday's victory in the 30-kilometer 
freestyle at the Nordic Ski World Championships was no exception. 
</P>
<P>
	While beating second-place finisher Thomas Alsgaard of Norway by  
35.3 seconds and teammate Bjorn Daehlie by almost a quarter of a 
minute in the opening event of the championships, Myllylae grabbed 
the Finnish flag in the home stretch and waved to his fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``With a 35-second advantage, I knew I could always walk to the  
finish line if it came to the worst,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Snow has been falling in Ramsau for several days, a factor  
crucial to Myllylae's decision to take to the course. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was only yesterday morning that I decided to take part in  
the race,'' he said. ``When you see it's the right weather for you, 
you just have to ski.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Originally, Myllylae's main focus on the championships was to be  
the 50K, an event he won at the Nordic worlds in Trondheim, Norway, 
two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``After all the health problems I had in December and January, I  
wanted to save energy for my favorite discipline,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, however, there was no doubt about his victory.  
</P>
<P>
	``I did very well in the second part of the race and on the 28th  
kilometer, I already knew I would win,'' he said. ``Today's victory 
means a lot to me because I was fighting against the time for most 
of the season and my self-confidence was very low.''

<HEADLINE>  QB Couch Has Heard Critics Before </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Tim Couch's has heard the critics.  
</P>
<P>
	They say his arm is too weak to throw the 15-yard out pattern or  
the deep ball. He's too slow, they insist. And wait a minute, who 
did the guy ever beat in college anyway? 
</P>
<P>
	Couch has heard it all.  
</P>
<P>
	``Year in and year out this happens to all the top guys,'' the  
Kentucky quarterback said. ``Everybody finds something wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's hard to find many flaws in Couch's game. After all, he set  
26 school passing records, 12 Southeastern Conference and four NCAA 
marks. He completed 400 of 553 passes for 4,275 yards and 36 
touchdowns as a senior with the Wildcats. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there are those who think he's not worthy of being the  
No. 1 selection in the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
	But on March 11, Couch plans to answer the questions about his  
arm by showing it off for the Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm definitely going to try to persuade them I'm the guy to  
take, but it's really going to depend on my workout,'' he said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch was in town to be honored as the Cleveland Touchdown  
Club's 1998 college player of the year. It was merely coincidence, 
but Couch holding his award during an afternoon news conference 
with a brown and orange banner complete with Browns helmet and the 
initials TC was kind of funny. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, this is not my last trip to Cleveland,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Couch is on his way to Indianapolis for this week's NFL scouting  
combine. However, he won't be displaying his talents for teams to 
evaluate and will only undergo a physical. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he'll wait until next month to prove to the Browns he  
should be their quarterback of the future. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been plotting his strategy for the Browns' brass like he  
used to prepare for facing Alabama's defense. Using four Wildcats 
wide receivers, including Craig Yeast, a potential high-round draft 
pick himself, Couch plans to throw everything he's got at Browns 
coach Chris Palmer, football operations director Dwight Clark. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to go out and try and put on a good show for  
them,'' Couch said. ``I'll try and show them exactly what they want 
to see. We've been going over our game plan like we're preparing 
for a game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The knock on Couch is his arm strength. He rarely got a chance  
to throw deep while at Kentucky, but he's sure he can air it out 
far enough to play in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think if you can throw the ball accurately 55 yards on a  
deep post and you throw it on time, I think that's as far as you'll 
have to throw it,'' he said. ``Except on Hail Mary's.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Couch knows the Browns could decide to take Texas running back  
Ricky Williams with the top pick, or they could trade the 
selection. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's always a chance that could happen,'' he said. ``A lot  
can happen between now and April 17. I'm going to have to wait this 
out, but hopefully I'll persuade them to take me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Couch said he's been monitoring the Browns rebirth, and has been  
impressed with what the expansion team has done so far. He was 
glued to the TV on the day of the expansion draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh yeah, I watched all that,'' he said. ``I think it's been  
great. ``They've already got a really good offensive line in 
place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns have been shopping for a veteran quarterback, and  
could be bringing in 42-year-old Warren Moon for a visit next week. 
Couch understands that spending a year as an understudy could be 
helpful. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they do bring in a veteran, it can do nothing but help  
me,'' he said. ``But just for competition, I'd like to be on the 
field and learn on the run. But if they want me to sit, that would 
be fine.''

<HEADLINE> Deal Set for Lewinsky TV Interview </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Under an arrangement with Kenneth Starr's  
office, Monica Lewinsky can answer a wide range of questions in her 
upcoming television interview, legal sources familiar with the 
agreement say. 
</P>
<P>
	The former White House intern cannot make statements to ABC  
interviewer Barbara Walters that go beyond what Ms. Lewinsky has 
already told the grand jury and Starr's office in numerous meetings 
about her relationship with President Clinton, said the sources, 
speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	There are some other restrictions dealing with specific areas of  
Starr's ongoing criminal investigation, the sources said Thursday 
after several days of discussion between Starr's office and Ms. 
Lewinsky's lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lewinsky interview will be aired during ``sweeps'' week  
which ends March 3, the critical ratings period on which network 
advertising rates are based. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr spokesman Charles Bakaly did not return phone calls  
seeking comment. ABC spokeswoman Eileen Murphy declined to comment, 
as did Lewinsky spokeswoman Judy Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal came as Starr's staff continues to experience some key  
departures, even as his criminal investigation continues. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr deputy Solomon Wisenberg departs next month to become a  
partner at a private law firm. Wisenberg conducted much of the 
grand jury questioning of witnesses in the Lewinsky investigation 
and questioned Clinton extensively in the president's videotaped 
grand jury testimony. Starr deputy Robert Bittman already has left 
the office. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr deputies Hickman Ewing and Jackie Bennett remain, along  
with a staff of prosecutors who are preparing for three trials in 
the next four months. The trials are against longtime presidential 
friend Webster Hubbell, the Clintons' ex-Whitewater partner Susan 
McDougal and a Virginia woman, Julie Hiatt Steele, who is involved 
in Starr's investigation of whether the president made an unwanted 
sexual advance against former White House volunteer Kathleen 
Willey.

<HEADLINE> License Photo Co. Got Federal Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- State officials and civil liberties groups  
want investigations and explanations after learning the U.S. Secret 
Service helped fund a planned private national databank of driver's 
license photos. 
</P>
<P>
	Three states that had agreed to provide a private company with  
the photos already were complaining the system could lead to 
privacy violations. 
</P>
<P>
	They received new ammunition on Thursday after a published  
report disclosed that the Secret Service contributed nearly $1.5 
million to help finance the undertaking and that lawmakers who 
arranged the funding suggested that the system also could be used 
for combating terrorism and immigration abuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say that is far from what Image Data LLC of Nashua,  
N.H., said the system was supposed to do: catch criminals who try 
to pass fraudulent checks at stores. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here you have what's being called a simple way to deal with  
credit fraud and you pull the sheet back a little and see that the 
government is looking at other ways to use the information,'' said 
Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic Privacy Information 
Center in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The three states that agreed to sell their driver's license  
photos to Image Data -- South Carolina, Florida and Colorado -- have 
tried to back out after consumers voiced concerns about how the 
photos would be used. Officials in South Carolina and Colorado said 
they were not informed of the federal funding. 
</P>
<P>
	South Carolina's attorney general, Charlie Condon, on Thursday  
asked the state's law enforcement division to investigate whether 
Image Data's president committed perjury by not mentioning the 
Secret Service financing in a court hearing earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Condon was trying to get a judge to stop the sale of the photos,  
but the judge eventually decided the contract could continue. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, the American Civil Liberties Union and other  
groups called for hearings and tighter drivers' privacy laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Image Data denied that it misled states about its TrueID system.  
When fully operational, the system would send photo images from its 
databank to merchants so they can check the identification of 
customers paying with checks. The system is being tested at 10 
stores in South Carolina. It has photos of 3.5 million drivers in 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
	The Secret Service funding simply never came up, said Lorna  
Christie, Image Data spokeswoman. The company was barred from 
discussing the Secret Service's involvement anyway, she added. 
</P>
<P>
	The money was used to fund the test phase of the project. The  
Secret Service, which oversees the government's efforts to combat 
credit card and check fraud, benefits from the system because it's 
``a tool for detecting fraud,'' Christie said. 
</P>
<P>
	Secret Service officials said the agency provided expertise on  
how financial crimes are committed. Congress requested that it 
provide funds to Image Data, which will report back to the Secret 
Service on how the system is working, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency did not advise the company on how to gather the  
photos and it will not have access to them, the officials said. 
They said they were not aware of similar funding arrangements with 
other companies or any plans to use the information to fight 
terrorism or immigration abuses.

	``To suggest that Image Data intends to break its contracts or

	TrueID ``has widespread potential to reduce crime in the credit

terrorism, and in immigration and naturalization to verify proper 
identity,'' lawmakers wrote in two 1997 letters to Sen. Ben 
Nighthorse Campbell, R-Colo., chairman of an appropriations 
committee panel that oversees the Secret Service. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Secret Service can provide technical assistance and assess  
the effectiveness of this new technology,'' said a September 1997 
letter signed by eight lawmakers. Four of the eight represent Image 
Data's home state of New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	Christie said the lawmakers mentioned ``a very broad range of  
the types of uses'' for TrueID and said the company is focused on 
retail and banking applications.

<HEADLINE> Analysis: Tax Cut To Benefit Rich </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- People with earnings above $100,000 a year  
would get over half the benefits of the Republican proposal to cut 
all income tax rates by 10 percent, according to a nonpartisan 
congressional analysis released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Joint Committee on Taxation study was circulated by  
Democrats to buttress their claim that the proposal introduced by 
House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio, is tilted too 
heavily toward the wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this is an across-the-board tax cut, then the board must  
have a lot of knotholes in it,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., 
senior Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The analysis says that in 2001, the first full year the rate cut  
would be in effect, 52.5 percent of the dollars would go to 
taxpayers with incomes over $100,000. People making between $50,000 
and $100,000 would get almost 31 percent of the tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, 48 million taxpayers -- three-quarters of them  
earning less than $20,000 a year -- would get no tax cut. However, 
most of these people now pay no federal income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Further, the 8 percent of taxpayers with incomes above $100,000  
pay two-thirds of all income taxes, an average of $41,600 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of an anticipated budget surplus estimated at $2.6  
trillion over the next decade, Republicans argue it is appropriate 
to return a portion of the money in tax cuts to the people who paid 
it. They contend Democrats are engaging in political class warfare 
to portray the cut as skewed to the rich. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the Republican Party ought to be about the  
redistribution of wealth,'' Kasich said in a telephone interview 
Friday from Iowa, where he was exploring a bid for the 2000 GOP 
presidential nomination. ``Liberals are about the redistribution of 
wealth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich added that a broad tax cut would help the U.S. economy  
continue growing while preventing use of the surplus to create more 
government programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``People shouldn't be punished for working and trying to get  
ahead. They should be rewarded for it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats such as Rangel contend that a dollar means much  
more to the people on the lower income rungs and that targeted tax 
breaks reach them best. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats also note that the working poor still pay federal  
payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare and deserve relief 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like these people do not exist to the Republicans,''  
Rangel said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Joint Committee on Taxation analysis pegs the 10-year cost  
of Kasich's tax cut at $775.7 billion. President Clinton and GOP 
leaders have agreed that 62 percent of the surplus should be 
reserved until Social Security is saved, but the president opposes 
use of so large a chunk of the remainder for a broad tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Republicans are also questioning the wisdom of pushing the  
10 percent tax rate cut, given Clinton's opposition and the charges 
that it benefits the wealthy. Many are pushing alternatives, such 
as relief from the marriage penalty, in which many two-earner 
couples pay more than if they were single. 
</P>
<P>
	The study indicates that 91.8 million taxpayers would see some  
tax reduction under the proposal, but 24.7 million would get less 
than the 10 percent promised. 
</P>
<P>
	Another 177,000 would actually see a tax increase, mainly  
because they would be subject to the alternative minimum tax 
intended to prevent taxpayers from escaping Uncle Sam because of 
deductions and credits.

<HEADLINE> Annan Meeting New U.S. Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Secretary-General Kofi Annan is heading to  
Washington next week and the U.S. debt to the United Nations is a 
likely topic in expected meetings with Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first year in office, Annan lobbied hard to press  
Congress to pay the more than $1 billion the United States owes the 
world body in arrears. But he has since backed off somewhat, saying 
the issue was in Washington's hands. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. officials had few details Friday on Annan's schedule or  
agenda, but said he hoped to meet with administration officials and 
the new congressional leadership Tuesday and Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States nearly lost its vote in the General Assembly  
last year for failing to pay its dues. U.N. officials have warned 
Washington it faces the same embarrassing threat this year if it 
doesn't come forward with a significant chunk of the arrears. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress has held up payments of U.N. debts for years to demand  
a reduction in the U.S. assessment and streamlining of the world 
organization. Annan claims he has largely come through with the 
demanded reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress passed legislation last year that would have paid off  
much of the debt, but President Clinton vetoed it because it 
contained what he said were unrelated anti-abortion restrictions.

<HEADLINE> USOC May Reopen Atlanta Bid Inquiry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The U.S. Olympic Committee might take a second  
look at Atlanta's bid for the 1996 Games because IOC members 
received gifts that possibly were too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Schultz, executive director of the USOC, said Friday a  
response to the IOC's request for information about the Atlanta bid 
was due to go out early next week, but that the letter might be 
delayed as investigators might ask further questions of local 
Olympic organizers. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlie Battle, the former vice president for international  
relations for the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games, was 
quoted in Friday's Washington Post as saying the Atlanta bid 
committee ignored the IOC's gift limit. 
</P>
<P>
	The limit at the time for IOC members was $200 but has since  
been reduced to $150. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Associated Press on Friday, Battle  
acknowledged the gifts, which included golf clubs, first-class 
airline tickets and clothing. But he said they were ``pertinent, 
appropriate and were not lavish or out of line in any way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schultz said the investigators most likely will want to question  
Battle further. 
</P>
<P>
	``They'll probably want to know to what extent this went to, and  
that will go into the report to the IOC,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Battle: ``We'll acknowledge what we did and confirm  
everything we did was proper. We've been ready to respond for a 
while, but they've asked us to delay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to WSB-TV, former Atlanta mayor Andy Young, who was  
also a member of the bid committee, defended the gifts as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we exceeded the guidelines, it was in the spirit of  
generosity, not out of any sense of bribing people,'' Young said. 
``Remember, we did not have any money and not a lot of time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC is investigating the Olympic bid process after last  
December's revelations that Salt Lake Olympic officials provided 
college scholarships, free health care and other expensive gifts to 
IOC members and their families while securing the 2002 Winter 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-four IOC members, more than one-fifth the membership,  
have been implicated in the worst corruption scandal in Olympic 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Pound, who is leading the IOC's investigation, has  
requested all bid cities dating to the 1996 Games review their 
dealings with IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound was traveling Friday and unavailable for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Battle said there was ``never any effort or intent to abuse the  
process or to do anything which we felt was not the right thing to 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Battle, a lawyer who now runs an Atlanta development group,  
insisted there was no wrongdoing. He contends IOC rules were vague, 
other bid cities were also lavishing IOC members with travel and 
gifts and Atlanta organizers ``stayed within the spirit of the 
relevant guidelines and accepted practices at that time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An IOC panel this weekend will discuss the bribery scandal. IOC  
spokesman Franklin Servan-Schreiber on Friday said the committee 
has solicited responses from those members implicated in a report 
issued this month by a Salt Lake ethics committee. 
</P>
<P>
	That report cited 10 additional IOC members who were not  
included in the list of 14 implicated earlier during the IOC's 
internal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Any additional expulsions will be submitted to the full general  
assembly at the March 17-18 emergency session in Lausanne, 
Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	In another matter, IOC executive board member Jacques Rogge said  
the games are unlikely to lose their major sponsors, a group that 
includes Coca-Cola, IBM, Kodak and McDonald's. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Rogge, all the major sponsors for the 2000 Games in  
Sydney, Australia, and 2004 Games in Athens, Greece, are standing 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
	But the scandal clearly could hurt the bottom line for host  
cities. The chief executive of the Sydney Games, Sandy Hollway, 
said Thursday his group faces a $130 million shortfall in the 
sponsorship budget. 
</P>
<P>
	John Hancock, another major sponsor, has canceled negotiations  
with NBC for $20 million in ads to protest the IOC's handling of 
the scandal.

<HEADLINE>  Lawyers: DNA Links King to Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- A stain on a shirt found in the apartment  
of dragging-death defendant John William King is the blood of 
victim James Byrd Jr., an FBI analyst testified today. 
</P>
<P>
	The stain was one of several DNA samples prosecutors say link  
King to the death of Byrd, a 49-year-old black man whose body was 
found in pieces along an east Texas road last June. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Baechtel, a forensics examiner with the FBI, said  
bloodstains on tires from a truck prosecutors said was used to drag 
Byrd matched the DNA of the victim. 
</P>
<P>
	An ex-girlfriend of King's said she saw King getting into a  
pickup truck with two co-defendants the night Byrd was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Other DNA samples included an undetermined fluid found on  
cigarette butts and a beer bottle at the crime scene, which 
Baechtel said matched the DNA of King and the two other men charged 
in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The DNA evidence came a day after FBI agent Norman Townsend  
brought into evidence the 24-foot logging chain that prosecutors 
say was attached to the bumper of the pickup truck and wrapped 
around Byrd's ankles. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say the chain was put through a car wash, removing  
any flesh and blood evidence it may have contained. But a hush fell 
and all eyes followed Townsend's hand as he reached into a 
cardboard evidence box and pulled it out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we thought we were mentally prepared for everything  
that's come into this case,'' said Clara Taylor, one of Byrd's 
sisters. ``But to see that chain was bone-chilling. 
</P>
<P>
	``It made me think back to the slaves -- of slavery when you saw  
black men chained and brought over on ships.'' 
</P>
<P>
	King, 24, faces life in prison or execution if convicted of  
murder. Shawn Berry, 24, and Lawrence Brewer, 31, are to be tried 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	Townsend testified that on June 8, the day after Byrd's death,  
Berry led authorities to an area behind a friend's trailer. Berry, 
who lived with King, kicked up a piece of plywood covering a 
depression in the ground, the agent said, and inside was the chain. 
</P>
<P>
	In other testimony Thursday, a former prison inmate said King  
told him that he envisioned a racial killing -- ``taking a black 
out'' -- as an initiation rite to prove loyalty to a white 
supremacist gang. 
</P>
<P>
	``To get in you have to get a blood tie,'' William Matthew  
Hoover, a convicted robber, said of the talks he and King had while 
in prison together a few years ago. ``You send somebody on a 
mission to stab somebody or do something. ... You have to spill 
blood to get in and give blood to get out, I guess.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't clear from Hoover's testimony who would do the killing  
or what gang they were talking about. But prosecutors have said 
that King killed Byrd to gain credibility for a racist group he was 
organizing.

<HEADLINE> Intel Execs To Testify at Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Top executives from Intel Corp. will testify  
at the computer chip-maker's antitrust trial, set for March 9. 
</P>
<P>
	The government and the company identified their witnesses Friday  
for the trial. High-profile names include Andrew Grove, Intel's 
co-founder and chairman, and Craig Barrett, who took over as chief 
executive officer last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, the world's largest chip-maker, with $26.2 billion in  
sales last year, also identified 16 more of its own executives and 
15 others from outside the company who will appear as witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The government identified two dozen witnesses. Daniel Wall, an  
antitrust lawyer in San Francisco, said the sheer number suggests 
the government plans a far broader case against Intel than 
originally believed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has to,'' Wall said. ``It doesn't take that many people to  
cover the issues pleaded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It shows you that Intel has guts to put their top guns on the  
stand,'' said Robert Litan, an economist with the Brookings 
Institution. He said Grove, who escaped communist Hungary as a 
20-year-old chemistry student, ``has a terrific life story to bring 
into the courtroom. I would suspect he would be a very impressive 
witness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission's case against Intel will take  
place in a courtroom just blocks from the federal courthouse where 
Microsoft Corp. is fighting its own antitrust case against the 
Justice Department and a group of 19 states. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Microsoft's trial, where Chairman Bill Gates has not  
testified in his own company's defense, Intel put both its CEO and 
former CEO on the witness list. 
</P>
<P>
	``These witnesses present very tempting targets in the sense  
that if you can obtain some admission or concession, it weighs very 
heavily,'' said Richard Gray, an antitrust lawyer in San Jose, 
Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	But he added: ``I strongly suspect the FTC will have a much  
tougher time with (Grove and Barrett) than the Justice Department 
has had with Microsoft executives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wall said it was impossible to gauge Intel's risks in exposing  
Grove and Barrett to tough questioning by the FTC's lawyer, Richard 
Parker, because ``you don't know what the FTC might have from their 
e-mail and documents and so forth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This might indicate that Intel is just not worried that Andy  
Grove and Craig Barrett can be impeached, that they're clean,'' 
Wall said. 
</P>
<P>
	The government will use testimony from executives at rival  
Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Compaq Computer Corp., Micron 
Technology Inc. and others to try to prove that Intel abused its 
market influence to freeze out and punish competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC sued Intel in June, accusing it of denying three of its  
competitors access to important technical information about 
upcoming Intel chips. It said Intel sought to punish the 
competitors for refusing to license key patents on Intel's terms. 
</P>
<P>
	The three companies were Digital Equipment Corp., Intergraph  
Corp. and Compaq, which now owns Digital. Intergraph's chief 
executive officer, James W. Meadlock, will also be a government 
witness.

<HEADLINE> Dale Jarrett Is Anxious To Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKINGHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Dale Jarrett isn't an angry man. He's  
just anxious to race again. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett, who finished third in the Winston Cup points last  
season, got off to a bad 1999 start last Sunday when he ignited a 
13-car crash midway through the Daytona 500. He wound up 37th. 
</P>
<P>
	Frustration finally overwhelmed him after the race when the  
usually mild-mannered Jarrett erupted at media members who kept 
asking him whether teammate Kenny Irwin had hit his car before the 
big wreck. 
</P>
<P>
	``The worst thing about the whole situation is Kenny is not  
getting to enjoy his best run as a Winston Cup driver,'' said 
Jarrett, considerably calmer Friday at North Carolina Speedway. 
``He did a tremendous job and put himself in a position to win the 
Daytona 500, and people aren't letting him enjoy that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett was relaxing in his motorhome while rain fell outside,  
eventually postponing time trials for Sunday's Dura-Lube/Big Kmart 
400 until today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did touch, yes, that did happen,'' Jarrett said of the  
incident with Irwin. ``But it was racing and it's as much my fault 
as anybody's.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett said he put himself in position for something like that  
to happen, so he says everything is fine the between the drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	``He called me Monday to see if I was all right and to talk  
about it,'' Jarrett said. ``I was fine with everything. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew I had gotten tapped, but he just happened to be the one  
that was there and it was going to happen whoever was there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NASCAR requires a carburetor restrictor plate be used on the  
cars in Daytona and Talladega, its longest and fastest ovals. The 
plate saps horsepower and the teams make the cars as slippery, 
aerodynamically, as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	On the flatter and shorter 1.017-mile oval at Rockingham, the  
engines are unrestricted and the downforce is much more important. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't judge anything off of Daytona,'' said Daytona winner  
Jeff Gordon. ``You're restrictor-plate racing, you've got a 
superspeedway car and downforce means nothing compared to most of 
the other tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	``This week, downforce will mean a whole lot more for getting  
through the corners.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond that, running as close together as they do in the  
restrictor-plate events, big crashes like the one on Sunday are 
almost inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just told Jeff that if we had to race those things 30 times  
a year, I might retire or something,'' Jarrett said. ``I'm glad to 
be here at Rockingham and get back to these other racetracks where 
handling comes into play and we can work on our car and make it 
better than somebody else's. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Rockingham is where everybody finds out who has been  
working over the winter and whose programs are on top. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not to take away from anything anybody accomplished at  
Daytona because you have to do a lot there,'' Jarrett said. ``But 
when you get to these places, handling comes in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Qualifying could play a big part in Sunday's race, with only 31  
pit positions on the front straightaway. That means that 12 
starters in Sunday's race will have to pit on the backstretch. 
</P>
<P>
	That's a definite disadvantage, particularly on yellow flag  
stops when the drivers up front are often getting done with their 
stops by the time the guys in the back are reaching their pits. 
</P>
<P>
	The only driver to win at The Rock from the back pits in 67  
races was Neil Bonnett in 1988. He started 30th when only 21 
drivers pitted on the front straight. 
</P>
<P>
	``With two pit roads at Rockingham, you want to avoid that back  
pit like the plague,'' Jeremy Mayfield said. ``The tough situation 
is where you end up with just a little practice time on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Hershiser Turns Down Phillies Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Free-agent Orel Hershiser has declined an  
offer to pitch for the Philadelphia Phillies this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The agent for the 40-year-old right-hander informed the Phillies  
Thursday that Hershiser would look elsewhere for work in 1999, 
general manager Ed Wade said. Philadelphia had offered Hershiser a 
chance to join their starting rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	Hershiser, who made $3.7 million including bonuses last year  
with the San Francisco Giants, reportedly rejected $2 million 
contract offers from the Giants and the Florida Marlins. The 
Phillies' offer also was about $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing got hung up in some negatives that I don't think  
should have been a factor,'' Wade said. ``We made it clear we 
weren't bringing Orel in for an audition. We were bringing him in 
to be in our rotation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hershiser was 11-10 with a 4.41 ERA for San Francisco last  
season.

<HEADLINE> Chamber President Seeks Labor Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Seeking a partnership with labor, the  
U.S. Chamber of Commerce's president says unions and business 
should unite against excessive environmental rules that ``spell 
disaster for good-paying American manufacturing jobs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There is much that binds employers and employees together,''  
Thomas J. Donohue was telling the AFL-CIO executive committee today 
before it heard from Vice President Al Gore, who is courting labor 
leaders for the 2000 presidential race. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wall Street and Main Street are becoming the same street,'' he  
said in a text of his speech scheduled for delivery behind closed 
doors. The Associated Press obtained an advance copy of his 
remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first address of a Chamber of Commerce president to the  
powerful labor group, Donohue said the Chamber will continue to 
clash with unions over many issues but also will look for common 
ground on issues such as transportation, health care, pensions and 
national security. 
</P>
<P>
	He said business and labor could fight together against the  
global warming treaty and excessive environmental regulations. 
Donohue said they are ``politically appealing to many Americans, 
but together they will spell disaster for good-paying American 
manufacturing jobs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Donohue's comments underscore a division between Gore and the  
otherwise friendly labor group. Some AFL-CIO affiliates are 
concerned about Gore's environmental record and the global warming 
treaty, while others disagree with his trade policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, Gore's only announced  
opponent for the Democratic nomination, tried to take advantage of 
the vice president's soft support with a last-minute decision to 
appear before the AFL-CIO on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In brief remarks, Bradley reminded the labor leaders that he  
helped organize the professional basketball players' union. But 
Bradley conceded that he, too, differs with labor on many trade 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The point of his speech and several private one-on-one sessions  
with labor leaders was to convince them that his candidacy is 
serious, and that he will challenge Gore every step of the way. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president, who holds a healthy lead in polls and enjoys  
President Clinton's support, wants to foster an atmosphere of 
inevitability about the nomination. One component of that strategy 
is to secure early endorsements from labor groups, the cornerstone 
of any winning Democratic coalition. 
</P>
<P>
	``If your position is inevitability, there's only one way to  
go,'' Bradley said at a news conference following his closed-door 
speech to AFL-CIO leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Two AFL-CIO affiliates -- the International Association of Fire  
Fighters and the Communication Workers of America -- already are 
supporting Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	In a move welcomed by Bradley's team, the AFL-CIO executive  
council passed a resolution Thursday urging that no other 
affiliates follow suit before the panel meets in August to consider 
endorsements. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, union and Democratic operatives still expect Gore  
eventually to secure the endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, relations between business and labor remain tense,  
despite the peacemaking efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	In the fall, AFL-CIO president John Sweeney appeared before the  
Chamber, saying, ``Your success is our success and we can help you 
compete if you'll give us half a chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Noting that Sweeney accused the Chamber of trying to bust unions  
and silence workers, Donohue said both sides can disagree while 
granting ``each other the sincerity of our convictions.' 
</P>
<P>
	``I have not come here suggesting that the AFL-CIO wants to  
destroy business,'' he said. ``To suggest that we want to do that 
to workers or unions is wrong.''

<HEADLINE>  Homer Bush Joins Blue Jays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUNEDIN, Fla. (AP) -- Former Yankee Homer Bush wasted no time in  
reporting to his new team, the Toronto Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited,'' Bush said Friday, a day after the New York  
Yankees traded him along with David Wells and Graeme Lloyd for 
Roger Clemens. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great opportunity for me, after watching greatness in  
New York,'' the 26-year-old infielder said. ``I didn't contribute 
at all there, maybe a little bit, but maybe here I can get more at 
bats and have some fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush didn't have to report until next week, when the Blue Jays  
officially open camp. But he wanted to get off to a quick start. 
He'll probably compete with Joey Cora and Craig Grebeck for the 
starting spot at second. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be under a little pressure competing for a big role on  
this team,'' Bush said, ``but I'm going to be relaxed as 
possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush hit .280 last season but had just 71 at-bats. He had one  
homer, five RBIs and six steals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was looking forward to having a role with the Yankees this  
year after scraping to get at-bats in 1998,'' he said. ``It hasn't 
sunk in yet, the trade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush is looking forward to working with Maury Wills, who will be  
a spring training instructor for Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	``They say he's the bunt king, and it's definitely something I  
need to work on,'' Bush said. ``I'd love to have a breakout 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Paul Quantrill, who injured himself snow mobiling, reworked  
his contract, which called for a $1.4 million salary. The guarantee 
was reduced to $500,000, but he can earn the entire amount 
depending on when he's back on the active 25-man roster. There are 
also performance bonuses and options for 2000 (about $1.8 million) 
and 2001 ($2.1 million) that become guaranteed depending on how 
many games he pitches.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Chirac Discuss Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton welcomed French President  
Jacques Chirac to the White House on Friday for discussions on ``a 
lot of important things,'' from Kosovo to the global economy. 
</P>
<P>
	At the outset of the meeting, Clinton said he and Chirac had  
developed ``a good working relationship and a warm personal 
friendship.'' Chirac called Clinton ``my good friend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The niceties belied some of the differences, from Iraq to  
currency issues, between the two allies. 
</P>
<P>
	Before meeting Clinton, Chirac held talks at Blair House with  
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on reforming the 
international financial system. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and 
his French counterpart, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, joined their 
respective leaders at lunch. 
</P>
<P>
	Chirac said Thursday a way must be found to reduce volatility  
among the world's major currencies -- meaning some coordinated 
effort to maintain the dollar, Europe's 6-week-old currency, the 
euro, and the Japanese yen within acceptable ranges. But French 
officials said he was not advocating tight target zones as Germany 
has recommended. 
</P>
<P>
	``One cannot hope for world financial stability while at the  
same time accepting unstable exchange rates,'' Chirac said in a 
speech at the International Monetary Fund. ``We must aim for more 
stable relations between currencies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin has dismissed the idea as unworkable. Finance ministers  
from the world's wealthiest nations will meet Saturday in Germany 
to discuss these topics. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovo and the looming Saturday deadline for NATO airstrikes was  
high on the agenda for the Clinton-Chirac meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Chirac said he hoped that ``both sides will understand that it  
is in their interest to find an agreement because the side which 
does not understand then would have to bear all the consequences, 
which would be serious for them and their country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chirac also said he and Clinton would discuss the NATO's 50th  
anniversary celebrations in Washington in April. France is 
concerned that if the meeting turns into a Cold War victory party, 
it could anger Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Chirac also differ on defining a new strategy for  
NATO operations outside the borders of member nations. 
</P>
<P>
	After seeing Clinton, Chirac planned talks with Anthony  
Williams, the new mayor of Washington, D.C. Before becoming 
president in 1995, Chirac was mayor of Paris for many years and is 
expected to share some of his experiences with Williams, French 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chirac also was decorating four American veterans of World War I  
and a former French sailor who now lives in the United States with 
the Legion of Honor, France's highest award for their service in 
the conflict.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Mostly Lower / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly  
lower in listless trading early today on the Chicago Board of 
Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Futures prices across the board were pressured by expectations  
of bumper world supplies at a time of weak global demand. Investors 
in wheat futures believe prices must go lower to make the grain 
more competitive and more attractive as an animal feed. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans continue to slump on expectations Brazil will harvest a  
near-record crop, bringing competing supplies to market at a time 
when demand for vegetable oils has sunk to new lows. Corn futures 
slipped as Argentina also gets ready to harvest large supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for March delivery fell 1 cent to $2.57 a bushel; March  
corn fell 1/4 cent to $2.14 3/4 a bushel; March oats fell 1/4 cnet to 
$1.01 1/4 a bushel; March soybeans fell 1/4 cent to $4.81 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meat and livestock futures were mostly lower on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	April live cattle fell .12 cent to 66.45 cents a pound; March  
feeder cattle fell .25 cent to 73.20 cents a pound; April lean hogs 
fell .30 cent to 44.75 cents a pound; March pork bellies fell .32 
cent to 53.40 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> US, France Plan Balkans Initiative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP ) -- President Clinton and French President  
Jacques Chirac covered a wide range of issues in talks Friday, 
including NATO's future and a new initiative to increase stability 
in the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the Kosovo conflict underlined the problem of  
instability in the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States and France will pursue a new initiative to  
increase cooperation with nations in southeast Europe on security 
issues,'' Clinton said. He gave no details. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said they dealt with reforming the global financial  
system, economic recovery and nuclear security in Russia and 
restraining Iraq from developing weapons of mass destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	The two old allies have disagreed on Iraq in the past with the  
French opposing the U.S.-led bombing raids in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Chirac said he was satisfied with the talks, which he said  
included the increasing globalization of the world economy and ways 
to humanize the process. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's inevitable and brings progress every day,'' Chirac said.  
``Its a process that must be encouraged but everyone must 
understand there are social costs as well and our job is to control 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The niceties belied some of the differences between the two  
allies -- from Iraq to currency issues to bananas. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Clinton and Chirac acknowledged that they had discussed a  
contentious trade dispute involving bananas without making any 
progress in resolving differences that are threatening to spark a 
trade war between the United States and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States is seeking to impose punitive tariffs on $520  
million worth of European imports in a retaliation for the lost 
sales U.S.-based banana companies claim they are suffering because 
of European import restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	While the United States has received favorable rulings from the  
World Trade Organization, U.S. officials claim Europe has made only 
cosmetic changes to import rules that discriminate against American 
companies in favor of bananas grown in former French and British 
colonies. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton told reporters at a joint news conference that Europe's  
refusal to abide by a WTO decision set a bad example for losing 
countries in WTO disputes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're being quite strong about it because we do have companies  
involved ... and because we think the trade law is clear,'' Clinton 
said. ``We don't want to provoke a trade crisis, but we won.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chirac, taking a dig at the U.S. stand on an issue that involves  
a relatively minor part of trade between the world's two largest 
trading partners, said that Europe was just as firm in its position 
and it was looking for ways to protect ``actual workers who are 
involved here'' in its former colonies in the Caribbean, Africa and 
the Pacific islands. 
</P>
<P>
	Two American companies, Chiquita Brands International Inc. and  
Dole Food Co. grow bananas mostly in large plantations in Latin 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	Absent a negotiated settlement in coming days, the United States  
has said it will begin next month imposing punitive tariffs of 100 
percent on a variety of European imports, ranging from expensive 
cashmere sweaters and French handbags to German coffee makers. 
Tariffs at that level would have the effect of doubling the price 
of the affected goods in the U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
	Before meeting Clinton, Chirac held talks with Federal Reserve  
Chairman Alan Greenspan about the international financial system. 
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and his French counterpart, 
Dominique Strauss-Kahn, joined their respective leaders at lunch. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Chirac appealed for measures to reduce volatility  
among the world's major currencies -- meaning some coordinated 
effort to maintain the dollar, Europe's 6-week-old currency, the 
euro, and the Japanese yen within acceptable ranges. But French

<HEADLINE> Cincinnati Basketball Coach Rebuked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Conference USA has reprimanded Cincinnati  
men's basketball coach Bob Huggins for comments he made over the 
public address system during a game against UNC Charlotte Feb. 17. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coach Huggins' effort to control the crowd is appreciated, but  
his derogatory comments about other conference institutions are a 
violation of the conference's code of conduct,'' Mike Slive, 
conference, commissioner, said in a statement released Friday. 
``They were unnecessary and inappropriate, resulting in this public 
reprimand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the game, some fans threw change at the UNC Charlotte  
bench. Huggins got angry and drew a technical, then grabbed a 
microphone and told fans to control themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	He urged fans to single out anyone who threw anything on the  
court so they could be ejected. He also made a vague reference to 
other people in the conference ``who don't have class.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have class here,'' Huggins said.  
</P>
<P>
	Right after Huggins' talk, Pete Mickeal scored three straight  
baskets to start a 17-2 surge that put Cincinnati ahead to stay. 
The Bearcats went on to win 82-69. 
</P>
<P>
	Huggins and school athletic department officials were not  
immediately available for comment.

<HEADLINE> Giants Sign Collins; Release Kanell </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- The New York Giants on Friday  
signed troubled free-agent quarterback Kerry Collins, but 
maintained that he will enter the season as the backup. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kent Graham is our starter,'' Coach Jim Fassel said, asserting  
there would be no open competition in training camp. ``Kent has 
earned that right by what he did last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team also released quarterback Danny Kanell, leaving the  
former starter somewhat stunned. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins, whose recent difficulties include a drunken driving  
arrest, issued a statement saying, ``A great deal has happened in 
my life over the past year or so, and I am looking forward to a 
fresh start with the Giants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fassel, a former quarterback coach, admitted he was eager to  
rehabilitate Collins, a four-year pro from Penn State who Fassel 
said needs to make playing quarterback ``the complete focus of his 
life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fassel said Collins will be at Giants Stadium the entire  
offseason, lifting, watching tapes, and preparing to work on his 
fundamentals. 
</P>
<P>
	Noting that Collins, at 6-foot-5 and 240 pounds, can be a big,  
physical player, Fassel also maintained he has a ``big-league 
arm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If handled right and developed ... you see a very, very big  
upside,'' Fassel said. ``If we get him right, he has that kind of 
ability'' to take a team to the next level. 
</P>
<P>
	A meeting with Collins this week persuaded Fassel that the  
quarterback is ready to work. ``He said all the right things, and 
in a convincing way,'' Fassel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins struggled this past season with the Carolina Panthers,  
who made him the fifth overall pick in the 1995 draft. He was 
released on Oct. 13 after reportedly telling then Panthers coach 
Dom Capers that he didn't have the heart for pro football. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins was signed by New Orleans, and returned with the Saints  
to Carolina two weeks later. He was arrested about nine hours later 
in Charlotte, N.C., on drunken driving charges. A hearing earlier 
this week on the case was adjourned, and no new date was set. 
</P>
<P>
	He was waived after the season by the Saints, for whom he was  
94-for-191 passing for 1,202 yards with four touchdowns and 10 
interceptions. Overall, he was 170-for-353 for 2,213 yards and 12 
TDs with 15 interceptions 
</P>
<P>
	The Daily News reported Friday that Collins agreed to a  
four-year, $16 million deal, including a signing bonus of almost $5 
million. With a minimum salary of $400,000, he would count $1.6 
million against the 1999 salary cap. Kanell's release clears $2 
million from the salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Post said Collins is expected to receive a  
four-year deal for slightly more that $16 million, with a $4 
million signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	Kanell figured he would have to take a pay cut, because of cap  
concerns, but did not expect to be cut. 
</P>
<P>
	``I kind of think I got a quick hook. But that's the business,''  
Kanell said from Florida. ``No team has ever cut me before. It will 
be a motivating factor for me, pushing me to work harder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kanell said he learned of the deal Thursday night, and is  
already looking for a new team and could end up in Miami, Minnesota 
or Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Kanell admitted being a little bitter at the Giants, calling his  
release a ``mistake,'' but he acknowledged his performance in 1998 
did not compare to 1997, when he led the team to the NFC East title 
and the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The 25-year-old rarely displayed similar consistency this past  
season, posting a 3-7 record, completing 160 of 299 passes for 
1,603 yards, 11 TDs and 10 interceptions. He seemed to lose his 
confidence as the team lost three straight before he was benched 
for Graham.

	``There's a lot of areas on offense that need improvement,''  
Kanell said. ``Maybe I shouldn't have played after I had surgery. 
Maybe I shouldn't have played when my back hurt,'' Kanell said. 
``But I'm not one to make excuses.''

	Graham led New York to five wins in the last six games,  
including a stunning 20-16 decision on Dec. 13 that ended Denver's 
hopes for a perfect season.

<HEADLINE> File Taxes Early and Buck the Trend / On the Money  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- There's one way to buck the trend this tax  
season -- file your return early. 
</P>
<P>
	Each year, millions of Americans wait as late as possible to  
prepare their income taxes. The Internal Revenue Service says it 
expects to receive around 36 million returns the week before and 
after the April 15 deadline. (That's nearly 30 percent of the 126 
million individual returns anticipated.) 
</P>
<P>
	While it's understandable that those who owe additional taxes  
would want to put off the inevitable, there's little excuse for 
anyone expecting a refund. And roughly 70 percent of all taxpayers 
should be getting money back this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think most people perceive it as an unpleasant chore ... and  
anytime you have something you don't like doing, I think it's human 
nature to put it off as long as possible -- even though you're 
getting a refund,'' says John Gardner, senior manager in KPMG's 
personal financial planning practice in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gardner and other tax professionals say it's crucial to get  
started as early as possible this year due to the many tax law 
revisions effective in tax year '98. There are changes to the 
Individual Retirement Account, including the introduction of the 
Roth IRA; new education tax credits, including the Hope scholarship 
and Lifetime Learning credit; and new ways of calculating taxes on 
long-term capital gains, to name a few. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like it or not, you're not going to be able to pick up a form  
on April 14 and say, 'I'm ready,''' says Gardner. ``If someone is 
doing his own taxes, it's pretty critical this year that he allow 
himself a little extra time to get familiar with the changes and 
take full advantage of what's available.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, the other incentive for filing early is that you'll  
get a refund check earlier, which may enable you pay off holiday 
debts faster or take that longed-for spring vacation. (If you owe 
money, it's better to know the amount in advance so you can make 
the payment on time and avoid possible penalties.) 
</P>
<P>
	Early birds will likely see a refund check three to four weeks  
after filing, vs. four to six weeks for the last-minute crowd, says 
Joe Schwartz, president of the California Society of Enrolled 
Agents. Filing electronically, though, speeds up the process to 
around three weeks, he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Organization and planning will help ensure efficient, speedy  
returns. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwartz suggests gathering all necessary documents ahead of  
time and separating them into four categories: income, expenses, 
home and investments. 
</P>
<P>
	By now, all eligible taxpayers should have received their W-2  
wage and tax statement from their employers as well as 1099 forms 
for non-wage income from banks, brokerages or mutual fund 
companies. Information about undistributed long-term capital gains 
will be contained in form 2439. Income from partnerships or trusts 
is contained on form K-1. 
</P>
<P>
	IRS spokesman Don Roberts says the deadline for sending out  
those documents was Feb. 1. If you haven't received them yet, 
contact your employer or financial institution. 
</P>
<P>
	The main form most people will need to include with a return is  
the W-2. If, for whatever reason, one can't be obtained, a 
substitute W-2 form can be filled out using data from other 
sources, like paycheck stubs, says Schwartz. 
</P>
<P>
	Gardner says taxpayers shouldn't overlook time-honored tax  
deductions, such as: home mortgage interest; home mortgage interest 
points; property taxes; unreimbursed employee travel; job hunting 
costs; professional tax preparation and moving expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	He also suggests getting Social Security numbers for newborns as  
soon as possible and opting for direct deposit to speed up receipt 
of a refund check. 
</P>
<P>
	One caution, however, try not to rush. Mistakes can delay the  
process and could even result in penalties if your corrected return 
is received after the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the more common errors, according to tax professionals:  
listing an incorrect Social Security number or leaving a 
dependent's Social Security number off a return, insufficient 
postage on the envelope, failure to sign and date a return, 
reporting income in the wrong place and math miscalculations.

<HEADLINE> Abortion Clinics Receive Threats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Packages said to contain the potentially deadly bacterium  
anthrax forced several abortion clinics across the nation to close. 
As with other recent scares, it appeared the latest threats were 
hoaxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Materials sent Thursday to several Planned Parenthood offices  
and other women's health centers were being examined by the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	Packages containing explicit threats were reported at abortion  
clinics in Milwaukee, Cincinnati, and Washington, D.C., and at 
Planned Parenthood offices in Manchester, N.H., and Rapid City, 
S.D. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI also was investigating suspicious packages received by  
Planned Parenthood centers in Sioux Falls, S.D., and Burlington, 
Vt. It was not immediately clear if these packages warned of 
anthrax. 
</P>
<P>
	In Milwaukee, the person who opened the envelope and three  
firefighters were hospitalized for an hour for decontamination and 
observation. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet another letter was opened today, at a Planned Parenthood  
clinic in Des Moines, Iowa. The sender claimed the letter had a 
hazardous substance on it, and the office was evacuated, but it 
appeared there was nothing really wrong with the letter, Police 
Sgt. Bruce Elrod said. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthrax mostly affects farm animals, but its germs, when inhaled  
by humans, can cause flu-like symptoms and can lead to death if not 
treated early enough with antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
	Phony anthrax threats have been very common in recent months.  
Last fall, abortion clinics in four states were the subjects of 
fake threats. It is a federal felony to send an anthrax threat, 
even if it is a hoax. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have received threats in the past but we have never  
received any threats like this,'' said Allie Stickney, president of 
Planned Parenthood of Northern New England. ``We will not be 
intimidated.''

<HEADLINE>  Vatican Intervened in Pinochet Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The Vatican confirmed today that it intervened in  
the extradition row over Gen. Augusto Pinochet, asking the British 
government to send the former Chilean dictator home. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said the Vatican made its appeal  
about a month ago after a request from the Chilean government. 
</P>
<P>
	Chile, which opposes a foreign trial for the 83-year-old  
general, expressed concerns about ``national sovereignty, including 
in the field of justice,'' Navarro-Valls said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vatican spokesman also made a reference to another of  
Chile's arguments, that the general's arrest interferes with the 
process of national reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Holy See supports national reconciliation everywhere,  
including Chile,'' Navarro-Valls said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet was arrested Oct. 16 in London on a Spanish warrant  
alleging that he ordered killings, torture and hostage-taking 
during his 17-year rule, which began when he ousted Chile's elected 
president, Marxist Salvador Allende, in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	An official Chilean report says 3,197 people were killed or  
disappeared at the hands of his secret police during Pinochet's 
regime. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet, who remains under armed guard in a rented mansion  
southwest of London, is fighting extradition to Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	His lawyers contend that, under British law, the general is  
entitled to immunity for any acts committed while a head of state. 
A ruling from Britain's highest court on the immunity issue is 
pending. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vatican's intervention in the case was disclosed Thursday by  
Baroness Symons, a British Foreign Office minister, in a written 
answer to a question in the House of Lords. 
</P>
<P>
	A Foreign Office spokesman, speaking with customary anonymity,  
said Britain responded to the Vatican appeal, but would disclose no 
details. 
</P>
<P>
	Human rights groups condemned the Vatican's intervention.  
</P>
<P>
	``Pinochet has been indicted many times for crimes against  
humanity, so how can the Pope defend a person like that?'' said 
Carlos Reyes, president of the London-based anti-Pinochet group 
Chile Democratico.

<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- A Japanese company has agreed to make payments  
to Procter &AMP; Gamble Co. as part of an agreement to resolve a 
dispute over patents for disposable diaper products. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Kao Corp., based in Tokyo, nor Procter &AMP; Gamble would  
reveal the amount of the payments or other specific details of the 
agreement announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal provides for Kao to make a series of payments to P&AMP;G to  
correct an imbalance between the value of patent rights held by the 
companies, management said. They also agreed to mutual use of 
certain patent rights that they declined to publicly identify. 
</P>

	Kao, a diversified manufacturer, owns Andrew Jergens Co., the

<HEADLINE> US Trade Deficit Hits New High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *AP Economics Writer ccccc	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. trade deficit surged to an all-time    	
high of $168.6 billion last year as the global financial crisis  
battered American manufacturers and farmers, triggering the first 
decline in exports in 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department reported today that last year's deficit  
jumped 53 percent from a 1997 imbalance of $110.2 billion, 
surpassing the old record of $153.4 billion set in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	In one bit of good news, the deficit in December narrowed  
unexpectedly to $13.8 billion, down 10 percent from November, but 
analysts saw that as a momentary respite from what is likely to be 
more bad news in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Many economists believe that the deficit for all of this year  
will be at least $60 billion worse than the 1998 figure as American 
exporters face continued troubles selling into global markets with 
one-third of the world in recession. 
</P>
<P>
	In other economic news today, the Labor Department reported that  
inflation remained tame with consumer prices rising just a tiny 0.1 
percent in January as higher costs for oranges, airline tickets and 
cigarettes were offset by price declines elsewhere, including the 
biggest one-month drop in clothing costs in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	There was little immediate reaction in financial markets. The  
yield on 30-year Treasury bonds, a barometer for long-term 
borrowing costs, nudged up a bit after the trade and inflation 
figures were released, while stocks slipped a bit. In early 
trading, the Dow Jones industrial average was down nearly 25 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	The worsening trade performance has presented a political  
headache for President Clinton, who took office in 1993 vowing to 
negotiate global trade deals that would expand opportunities for 
American producers. The administration stressed that today's 
figures highlighted the disparity between a strong U.S. economy and 
weakness abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	``The challenge is to promote a return to solid economic growth  
overseas that will benefit everyone,'' Commerce Undersecretary 
Robert Shapiro told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Exports for all of 1998 fell 0.7 percent to $931.3 billion, the  
first setback in sales abroad since 1985. Until last year, healthy 
export gains had contributed fully one-third of total U.S. economic 
growth through the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	The widening of the global financial crisis, which began in Asia  
in July 1997, has meant hard times for many American exporters. 
Farmers suffered through their worst year in a decade and many 
manufacturing companies have been forced to cut back production and 
lay off workers. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, U.S. producers of certain items, notably steel and  
autos, have faced increased pressure from imports as crisis 
countries have shipped their excess goods to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The politically sensitive trade deficits with both Japan and  
China widened last year. The imbalance with China rose 15 percent 
to a record $56.9 billion, the highest ever for any country other 
than Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	America's deficit with Japan rose 14 percent to $64.1 billion,  
the second worst showing on record, surpassed only by a $65.7 
billion deficit with Japan in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. deficit with all Pacific Rim countries, the hardest hit  
region from the global crisis, rose 33 percent in 1998 to $160.4 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration is already under increased pressure from U.S.  
steel makers and their union to raise trade barriers to halt a 
flood of cheap imported steel. The Commerce Department last week 
issued a preliminary ruling that tariffs on certain types of steel 
from Japan and Brazil would face increased tariffs of up to 70 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry is also pressuring Congress to impose worldwide  
quotas on steel, warning of more layoffs and bankruptcies without 
government relief. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton used his State of the Union address to pointedly alert  
Japan that the administration will bring its own trade cases unless 
Japanese steel shipments to this country start to decline. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration is concerned that steel will be the first in  
a long line of U.S. industries seeking increased protection from 
foreign competition in moves that could trigger retaliation and 
rising protectionism around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	To counter this threat, Clinton is proposing the launching of a  
new global round of trade negotiations under the auspices of the 
124-nation World Trade Organization. But critics charge that 
Clinton's free trade policies have been a failure and Congress for 
two years has blocked his requests for the authority he will need 
to negotiate any new trade liberalization agreements. 
</P>
<P>
	For 1998, total exports dropped 0.7 percent to $931.3 billion,  
the first setback since 1985. Exports had been up 11 percent in 
1997.

<HEADLINE> Minorities Have It Tough on Wall Street </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Thirty-one years ago, Muriel Siebert broke a  
barrier in becoming the first woman to own a seat on the New York 
Stock Exchange, joining 1,365 men. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, the horizon for women and minorities has broadened  
considerably, though both groups say they are fighting for a fairer 
share of the financial pie. 
</P>
<P>
	Siebert says she's no longer the only woman at important  
meetings, she said, nor do the meetings seem to be all-white any 
longer. 
</P>
<P>
	``But (women) don't have our share of positions that make the  
big dollar,'' Siebert said. Nor are there any women in Wall 
Street's top executive suites, home to the chairman, president and 
vice chairman, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	At a conference Thursday given by the National Association of  
Securities Professionals, some Wall Street veterans talked about 
their beginnings in an industry traditionally dominated by white 
men. 
</P>
<P>
	NASP, which represents 1,100 minorities and women on Wall  
Street, also honored the Jackie Robinsons of the financial 
community as part of its daylong conference. The group inducted 
four business leaders into the NASP-NY Wall Street Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	Charter members include Russell L. Goings Jr., who ventured onto  
Wall Street in 1960, when the only blacks there, he said, were 
shining shoes and delivering coffee. He went on to become chief 
executive officer of First Harlem Securities, the second 
black-owned firm to hold a seat on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, 169 women own seats at the NYSE; the exchange says it has  
no figures on the number of seats owned by minorities. In major 
financial firms across the country, 5 percent of the employees are 
minorities and more than a third are women, according to the 
Securities Industry Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Siebert said the industry's lag in hiring minorities and women  
isn't based on hatred. ``It's a culture,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Siebert said a similar bias prevents Wall Street leaders from  
targeting female and minority investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a long way to go,'' she said, acknowledging that Wall  
Street execs are ``intelligent enough to know we have a lot of 
money, that minorities have a lot of money. It's just good 
business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Goings, new Hall of Fame members are Travers  
Bell, chairman and chief executive of the first African-American 
firm to buy a seat on the NYSE; William H. Hayden, a senior 
managing director at Bear Stearns &AMP; Co., and Denise L. Nappier, the 
first black woman state treasurer of Connecticut.

<HEADLINE> Judge Slams Attempt at Removing Her </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) -- Judge Susan Scolaro laughed when she heard  
that her opponent in last year's primary was questioning her 
eligibility to run for office. 
</P>
<P>
	Her rival, Bob Jones, claimed that a leave of absence she took  
to spend time with her two children left her 15 days short of the 
required four continuous years of legal practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Scolaro won the Republican primary anyway and was elected  
unopposed. But she isn't laughing anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Bill McCoy ruled this month that Ms. Scolaro was  
ineligible when she was elected Nov. 3 and should step down. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Scolaro sees her case as part of something larger, and she  
isn't leaving -- despite a prosecutor's threat to jail her. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an issue that has never been presented to the Texas  
Supreme Court,'' Ms. Scolaro said. ``For the sake of any other 
female attorney that might ever want to take a leave of absence, 
I'm going to see this through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While lawyers don't necessarily have to be working cases to be  
considered active, they must be registered with the state bar. 
</P>
<P>
	The check Ms. Scolaro sent to the bar to return to active status  
shows that she had been reinstated three years and 350 days at the 
time of the election -- 15 days short of four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Scolaro argues that the law shouldn't be interpreted to  
include leaves of absence. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it comes to running for a judgeship, their argument is  
that if you stop practicing law to stay home with children, when 
you come back you will be viewed as a brand-new attorney,'' Ms. 
Scolaro said. 
</P>
<P>
	``To say four continuous years just doesn't make much sense. I  
could have been sick for 15 days. Does that mean I wouldn't be 
eligible?'' she said. ``What if I missed two days ... would I then 
be ineligible?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ector County District Attorney John Smith, serving as an  
independent prosecutor in the case, argues that what Ms. Scolaro 
was doing or how long she was inactive doesn't matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith has filed a motion to find Ms. Scolaro in contempt for  
continuing to preside in the Lubbock County Court, where she 
typically hears divorce and custody cases. Smith also wants Ms. 
Scolaro to be fined and jailed. 
</P>
<P>
	McCoy has yet to rule on the motion.  
</P>
<P>
	``The people have a right to have the laws upheld strictly when  
it comes to their elected officials,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan Kennady, president of the Texas Federation of Women, said  
laws should be more accommodating for mothers' leaves of absence, 
but Ms. Scolaro should step down if her check wasn't received by 
the right time. 
</P>
<P>
	If Ms. Scolaro is removed, it would be up to Lubbock County  
commissioners to appoint a replacement to serve the rest of her 
term. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones isn't commenting on the matter these days, but in October  
he said he was unsure whether he would seek the possible vacancy. 
``The important thing isn't who gets the seat, but that the law is 
upheld,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Detroit School Plan Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- For years, the Detroit school district has been  
like the straight-D student who always promises to do better on the 
next homework assignment, then turns it in late and half-done. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Gov. John Engler is vowing to change that by asking the  
Legislature to abolish the elected school board and give Mayor 
Dennis Archer the power to appoint a new one. 
</P>
<P>
	Though a poll shows about half the city's residents support the  
idea, the plan has outraged many in Detroit who see a white 
governor and mostly white Legislature trying to oust people elected 
by a predominantly black city. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of parents have shown up at community forums and  
committee hearings to oppose the plan. The local NAACP has come out 
against it. 
</P>
<P>
	``How dare you take away our rights as black people to vote,''  
Helen Moore, a Detroit parent and school activist, told a state 
Senate committee Wednesday. ``We can solve our own problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Caught in the middle is Archer, a black man who has been accused  
by some residents over the years of not being ``black enough'' and 
of working too closely with interests outside the city. 
</P>
<P>
	He has said that he doesn't like the governor's idea but that it  
will probably happen anyway, and he will do what he can to shape 
the legislation so that it accomplishes such things as reducing 
class size and bringing back summer school. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will insist that the terms of the legislation go far beyond  
the political substitution of one board for another. I will insist 
on real change and real benefits for the children of Detroit,'' 
Archer, himself a former teacher, said recently. 
</P>
<P>
	No one disputes that the schools in this impoverished city of 1  
million people, three-quarters of them black, have problems. The 
dropout rate was 26.4 percent in 1997, the four-year graduation 
rate a dismal 29.7 percent. The district has 180,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who manage to graduate often don't have much to show for  
it. One Detroit job training program, Focus:HOPE, said two out of 
three graduates of Detroit high schools who took an entrance exam 
for one program could not read or do math at an eighth-grade level. 
</P>
<P>
	Engler's proposal is similar what has been done in Chicago,  
Cleveland and elsewhere. The appointed board would run the schools 
for at least five years, at which point the public could hold a 
referendum on the setup. 
</P>
<P>
	``Time and again, I was told: `Butt out, send more money, wait  
until we implement our new plan, just give us a little more time.' 
The bottom line: eight years of excuses to me, preceded by decades 
of excuses to the people of Detroit,'' the governor said recently. 
</P>
<P>
	Engler said an appointed board could make the hard decisions an  
elected school board cannot: ``You need a board that puts kids 
first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He has said among other things that he wants the school system  
to take the ``fluff'' out of the curriculum and get back to basics. 
</P>
<P>
	Some residents are deeply distrustful. They see Engler's plan as  
an attempt not only to run the education of their children but to 
take over a business with 20,000 jobs and billions to spend. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all know racism is alive and well, and it is definitely  
alive in that state Legislature,'' said Marie Thornton, a parent. 
``This has nothing to do with the education of little black kids. 
This is about revenue. They're just using our kids for excuses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Engler said there is no racism behind the plan, and noted that  
real control of the schools would be in the hands of Detroit's 
mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	The elected school board is, of course, deeply opposed. It has  
come up with its own set of ideas, such as establishing 20 schools 
just for troublemakers, asking parents to volunteer a half-day per 
month, requiring school uniforms, and using students to clean 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	``At any point you can recall us and throw us out,'' Board  
President Darryl Redmond said at a recent meeting. ``We don't need 
anybody to come in here and tell us what to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Willam Beckham, the head of a panel that spent four months  
analyzing the district, said Engler's plan could remove many 
distractions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every two years, there's a political trauma'' because of the  
elections, Beckham said, and the result is a cycle: ideas are 
debated, half-used, then thrown out by a new board two years later. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can a publicly elected board really sustain reform? I haven't  
seen it yet,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Giants Catcher Job Still Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- Last fall, Scott Servais and Brent  
Mayne were in opposing dugouts when the Chicago Cubs defeated the 
San Francisco Giants in a one-game playoff for the NL wild-card 
spot. 
</P>
<P>
	This spring, Servais and Mayne will be competing for the Giants'  
starting job at catcher -- or perhaps sharing the position in a 
platoon. 
</P>
<P>
	With Brian Johnson gone, catcher is one of only two non-pitching  
positions -- center field is the other -- that is not settled as the 
Giants open spring training camp. Pitchers and catchers had their 
first workout Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayne appeared in 94 games for the Giants last year, starting 72  
-- nearly half of those starts coming when Johnson had a pair of 
stints on the disabled list. He also has played for Oakland, the 
New York Mets and Kansas City in a major league career that began 
in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Servais has been in the majors since 1991, first with Houston  
and then with the Cubs. He caught at least 113 games each of the 
last three seasons as the Cubs' starting catcher. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'd prefer to go with one guy if you had Mike Piazza or  
Pudge Rodriguez, but there aren't too many guys like that around,'' 
Giants manager Dusty Baker said. ``Sure, you wish you had Johnny 
Bench and you could put him out there every day and he'd hit 40 
home runs. But that's why Johnny Bench is in the Hall of Fame.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So Baker may end up platooning the left-handed Mayne and the  
right-handed Servais, who platooned early in his career with the 
Astros. 
</P>
<P>
	In any case, both Mayne and Servais said it's important to avoid  
forcing one guy to face the exhausting prospect of playing day 
games after night games too often. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd say you need two solid catchers on a team,'' Mayne said.  
``But guys can go a whole season, and I feel I'm able to do that, 
if that's what happens. Obviously you want to get as many at-bats 
and play in as many games as you can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After an unsettling offseason in which he tested the free agent  
market, Servais signed a minor-league contract with the Giants on 
Jan. 17. Though he's an excellent defensive catcher, teams were 
scared away by his .222 average last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw this as a good chance to jump start my career, a fresh  
start,'' Servais said. ``Any player, as you get into your career, 
you get more concerned with winning. This is a team that has won 
the last few years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Servais said he also was interested in playing for Baker. Last  
season, Cubs reliever Rod Beck -- who had spent several years 
playing for Baker in San Francisco -- told Servais how much he 
enjoyed playing for the Giants' skipper. 
</P>
<P>
	Going to a new club and a new pitching staff gives a catcher new  
perspective and a chance to give some different feedback to the 
staff, Servais said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good not only for me, but for those guys, too,'' he said.  
``I know Shawn Estes had a great year (in 1997) and then a bad year 
last year. Why?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mayne has a year of experience with a Giants staff that is  
largely unchanged, except for the departure of Orel Hershiser. And 
he knows this is an opportunity for him to become an everyday 
catcher and play in more than 100 games for the first time since 
1995 in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is probably the best opportunity I've had since I've been  
playing,'' he said, polishing off a stack of fan mail. ``And you 
get a lot more attention here. It's a lot different than Kansas 
City or Oakland.''

<HEADLINE> Man Who Killed Over Rap Gets Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT PIERCE, Fla. (AP) -- A man was sentenced Friday to life in  
prison for beating an 81-year-old woman to death after she 
criticized his rap music. 
</P>
<P>
	Victor Brancaccio's lawyers had argued that he suffers from  
brain damage caused by a premature birth and a near-drowning as a 
toddler, and that the antidepressant Zoloft left him involuntarily 
intoxicated. 
</P>
<P>
	Brancaccio, 22, was only 16 in 1993 when he crossed paths with  
Mollie Mae Frazier as she was out for a stroll. Brancaccio told 
police he was singing aloud to Dr. Dre's ``Stranded on Death Row'' 
when Mrs. Frazier scolded him for the profanity. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Frazier's badly beaten body was found a day later,  
partially charred and covered in red paint -- Brancaccio's attempts 
to cover his fingerprints. 
</P>
<P>
	Brancaccio was convicted Jan. 22 of first-degree murder and  
kidnapping. He showed no emotion as Senior Circuit Judge C. 
Pfeiffer Trowbridge exceeded state guidelines when he sentenced him 
to life with no possibility for parole.

<HEADLINE> Jazz Look To Pay Back Sonics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- John Stockton is getting tired of seeing  
the Utah Jazz play the way they did against the Seattle SuperSonics 
in their last meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't compete at all,'' Stockton said of the 71-56 loss  
Tuesday that ended the Jazz's perfect season. ``It's something you 
hope your team will never do, but we just came out and let them do 
whatever they wanted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Utah gets a chance to avenge that humiliation Saturday when the  
Jazz entertain the Pacific Division-leading Sonics. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle held the Jazz to a franchise-low regular-season point  
total, blitzing their previous mark by 12 points. Utah managed only 
54 points in Game 3 of the NBA Finals last season and 64 points in 
a loss to San Antonio in the conference semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	That's three disastrous offensive games in Utah's last 20  
outings. For the Jazz, who have been among the NBA's 
highest-scoring teams during most of the 1990s, it's a baffling 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some games you've just got to forget about and move on,''  
Bryon Russell said. ``We don't want to forget losing to Seattle, 
(but) we've got to forget about how bad we played.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the Seattle debacle and a week of less-than-inspired  
play, the Jazz have the league's best record at 7-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Although they've made the best start in franchise history, the  
Jazz are hardly on a roll. They sandwiched their horrible outing at 
Seattle between two mediocre home wins over Sacramento and Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Against the Kings Monday, Utah needed five clutch free throws by  
Karl Malone and a missed wide-open layup by the Kings' Lawrence 
Funderburke in the final minute of regulation to force overtime, 
where the Jazz won 120-112. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah wasn't much better against Denver Thursday, making 17  
turnovers and allowing the team with the NBA's second-worst record 
to hang around until the closing minutes of the Jazz's 97-86 win. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to play well (against Seattle), not play angry,''  
Stockton said. ``If we don't come to play again, maybe we won't be 
as fortunate as we were against the Nuggets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before Tuesday's game, Utah and Seattle were the last undefeated  
teams in the league. The Sonics lost their perfect mark Wednesday 
night to the Kings, and they haven't played since. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Payton had 17 points and 11 rebounds in the Sonics' win  
over Utah. He also made Stockton look bad while trying to defend 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah coach Jerry Sloan said he will consider throwing several  
defenders and double-teams at Payton in an effort to control the 
league's fourth-leading scorer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kings worked at keeping the ball out of Payton's hands on  
Wednesday, and the strategy worked in Sacramento's 109-106 overtime 
win. That loss also exposed offensive cracks in a Sonics team with 
a 6-1 record but just two victories over teams with winning 
records. 
</P>
<P>
	Forwards Detlef Schrempf and Vin Baker are both off to slow  
starts for Seattle. Schrempf is shooting 35 percent from the field, 
while Baker is a comical 1-for-20 from the foul line and is 
averaging only 11 points per game. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, Utah's forwards are playing well. Malone is off to  
another strong start despite only 14 points against the Nuggets, 
while Russell followed up his career-high 25 points against the 
Kings with a team-high 21 in the Denver game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just had to get this (Nuggets) game out of the way, and now  
it's all about payback,'' Russell said. ``We weren't ready to play 
the Sonics before, but we'll be ready Saturday.''

<HEADLINE> Owners Lead 7-2 in Arbitration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Roger Clemens wasn't the only big news for the New York Yankees  
on the first day of spring training workouts: Mariano Rivera became 
the second player in three days to beat the team in salary 
arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivera was awarded a $4.5 million salary Thursday by arbitrator  
James Duff, who rejected the team's offer of $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Combined with the $5 million Derek Jeter won Tuesday and  
Thursday's acquisition of Clemens, the Yankees' payroll increased 
to $86,715,000 for 21 signed players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm surprised, only in the fact that our number made Mariano  
the highest-paid three-plus closer (with less than four years' 
experience) in the history of the game by $750,000,'' Yankees 
general manager Brian Cashman said. ``If that's not fair, I don't 
know what is. What are you going to do?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Major league owners are 7-2 in arbitration this year, losing  
only to Rivera and to Jeter, who was offered $3.2 million by the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a wild week,'' Cashman said. ``From a personal  
standpoint, Brian Cashman alone, it was a bad week for the 
arbitration situation. It's hard for me to swallow because I'm a 
competitive person. You get paid to make decisions and you live by 
them and held accountable for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rivera was 3-0 with a 1.91 ERA and 36 saves in 41 chances last  
season, when he made $750,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Cashman said he would examine the roster to see if the payroll  
can be cut. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there's something that makes sense, I'll have to consider  
it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the final three cases were argued Thursday, with  
Baltimore catcher Charles Johnson and Cincinnati pitcher John Hudek 
going before three-man panels. 
</P>
<P>
	Hudek lost today and was awarded $800,000 rather than $1.3  
million by a three-man arbitration panel. Hudek was 5-6 with a 3.09 
ERA in 58 relief appearances for the New York Mets and the Reds 
last year, and made $499,000. He struck out 68 in 64 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who won in arbitration last year, asked arbitrators for  
a raise from $3.3 million to $5.1 million, with the Orioles 
offering $3.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The catcher hit .218 for Florida and Los Angeles last season  
with 19 homers and 58 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	The final case, involving Minnesota outfielder Matt Lawton, was  
argued today. Lawton asked arbitrators for a raise from $215,000 to 
$2.4 million after hitting .278 last season with 21 homers, 77 RBIs 
and 16 steals. The Twins argued for $1.7 million.

<HEADLINE> Miss. Official Resigns Over Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- Several months after Molotov cocktails  
exploded in his newspaper's offices, Charles Tisdale told a special 
commission that the government conspired to firebomb the 
black-owned weekly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe sinister forces are at work in this community and  
involve members of the FBI and other agencies,'' the publisher of 
the Jackson Advocate said last May. ``They are a clear and present 
danger to the black community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But on Friday, the president of the Jackson City Council  
resigned after federal prosecutors accused him of arranging the 
attack. The president, Louis Armstrong, is black. 
</P>
<P>
	Tisdale described the allegation as ``another enigma to the  
whole puzzle'' and said people should withhold judgment until the 
investigation is concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	According to prosecutors, Armstrong moved against the weekly  
newspaper because he was upset with articles and editorials Tisdale 
had written about him. 
</P>
<P>
	No charges were filed against Armstrong, who this week pleaded  
guilty in an unrelated bribery case. Instead, the allegations were 
contained in charges read in court Friday against Clinton Moses, a 
former Armstrong aide. 
</P>
<P>
	Moses pleaded guilty to the bombing and to bank robbery.  
According to the charges drawn up by prosecutors, Armstrong paid 
Moses $500 to carry out the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	As for whether Armstrong will be charged, U.S. Attorney Brad  
Pigott said only that other charges in the firebombing are likely. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jan. 26, 1998, bombing left the newsroom a charred shell.  
Flames melted computers and destroyed cameras, books and art. The 
damage, mostly limited to the first floor, was estimated at 
$100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack also scarred the racial politics of Jackson, with  
Tisdale and others accusing investigators of mishandling the case. 
</P>
<P>
	A special task force of civil rights leaders was formed to look  
into the attack. The group, led by Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., 
and the Rev. Joseph Lowery, former head of the Southern Christian 
Leadership Conference, held a hearing at the state Capitol on the 
four-month anniversary of the arson. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission issued a stinging condemnation of the  
investigation and demanded that Attorney General Janet Reno declare 
the attack a hate crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our failure to arrest and prosecute the terrorists who have  
burned our churches and bombed our newspapers threatens all 
liberties and freedoms upon which this great nation was founded,'' 
the commission said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal investigators rejected the accusations of foot-dragging  
and called Tisdale's conspiracy theory a ``crock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This conspiracy is totally unfounded and absolutely  
mistaken,'' FBI agent James Frier said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	But suspicions about a larger plot didn't go away with Friday's  
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I can tell you is that if people expect us to believe the  
conspiracy to cover the Advocate firebombing ends with Clinton 
Moses ... then they expect us to believe that James Earl Ray acted 
alone to kill Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.,'' said Stephanie 
Parker-Weaver, executive secretary of the Mississippi Southern 
Christian Leadership Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Parker-Weaver said she hopes the FBI will find others behind the  
bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong had been City Council president for two years and a  
council member for 14. He pleaded guilty Tuesday to conspiring to 
extort $28,500 from a topless-bar owner in exchange for a favorable 
zoning vote. He could get 30 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Moses told prosecutors he offered his services to Armstrong  
after the councilman confided he was upset about being criticized 
in the paper. Moses said he waited until Armstrong was out of town 
to carry out the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong was at Moses' hearing Friday but refused to comment.

<HEADLINE> Man Sentenced in Armstrong Assault </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- A man convicted last week of attempting to  
run down world cycling champion Lance Armstrong with his pickup 
truck has been sentenced to 13 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Carl Michael Carter II, 37, received 10 years Thursday for  
aggravated assault in the Armstrong case and three years for injury 
to a child. He pleaded guilty to the latter charge for a 1996 
incident in which he repeatedly slapped his 6-year-old daughter in 
the face, causing bruises and a split lip. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter also will begin serving a concurrent 10-year sentence  
that he received after his December conviction for raping his 
estranged wife. In addition, he will serve concurrently the 
one-year sentence he received for misdemeanor deadly conduct 
against cyclist David Averill, who was biking with Armstrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Until he was convicted in the Armstrong case, Carter was free on  
bond while appealing the rape conviction and awaiting trial for 
injury to his daughter. Armstrong and Averill said Carter tried to 
hit them with his truck in Travis County last March. 
</P>
<P>
	After state District Judge Jon Wisser approved the assault  
sentence Thursday, Carter dropped the rape appeal and waived his 
right to future appeals of any of the convictions. He must serve at 
least half the 13 years before being eligible for parole.

<HEADLINE> Ford Fills 2 High Jobs From Outside </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. has filled two more top jobs with  
executives from consumer products companies as part of President 
Jac Nasser's campaign to make the No. 2 automaker more responsive 
to its customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford today named Louise Goeser vice president for quality.  
Goeser comes from Whirlpool Corp., where she was vice president for 
corporate quality and general manager of the refrigerator product 
team. Her appointment came one day after Ford named General 
Electric Co. executive George Murphy as general marketing manager 
for the Ford division. 
</P>
<P>
	Goeser, 45, becomes the third female vice president at Ford. She  
replaces Ken Dabrowski, who retired in October. In the interim, the 
responsibility for quality issues was handled by Richard 
Parry-Jones, vice president for product development. Before joining 
Whirlpool, Goeser was an executive with Westinghouse Electric Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy, 43, is vice president of worldwide product management  
for GE Lighting in Cleveland and previously worked for Coca-Cola 
Co. At Ford, he will replace Darryl Hazel, who was named executive 
director of the Ford customer service division of North America. 
</P>
<P>
	The appointments of Goeser and Murphy are effective March 1.  
</P>
<P>
	Ford has been the most aggressive of the Detroit automakers in  
going outside the company and, in some cases, outside the 
traditionally insular industry for executive talent. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasser, who took over as president and chief executive at the  
start of the year, has said he wants to take Ford beyond just 
engineering and manufacturing vehicles and place more emphasis on 
satisfying customers and anticipating their needs. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of that shift is seen in Ford's moves in the past year to  
consolidate some of its dealerships and form the Ford Retail 
Network, which is giving the manufacturer a more direct role in 
selling and servicing cars and trucks in some cities. Ford also 
owns the Hertz rental car agency and is looking at expanding its 
role in other vehicle-related businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's those types of activities where we get a closer link to  
the customer and a connection with the marketplace and an insight 
into what matters to consumers,'' Nasser said in a recent 
interview.

<HEADLINE> First Lady Discusses Senate Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton and her advisers  
are contacting dozens of political consultants, Democratic donors 
and election law attorneys in a rapidly growing effort to determine 
whether she will run for the Senate in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady did some of her own research Friday, meeting  
privately in the White House with retiring New York Sen. Daniel 
Patrick Moynihan, a session that press secretary Marsha Berry 
called ``an opportunity to explore thoughts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several of Mrs. Clinton's advisers say she is increasingly  
warming to the notion of running. Yet they caution that her 
decision could be weeks or months away. The advisers, contacted by 
telephone in recent days, all spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	One longtime ally says Mrs. Clinton likely will wait until April  
or May to make up her mind. A second said it could be longer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I truly believe she will be thorough and methodical and it  
will take awhile,'' said Mandy Grunwald, a consultant in Bill 
Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign who remains close to Mrs. 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry said the decision-making process will be ``like watching  
grass grow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore, after addressing the AFL-CIO executive  
committee in Florida on Friday, told reporters, ``If she chooses to 
run for the Senate, I predict she will win and be a great 
senator.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, who is running for president, was asked if he would  
consider her as a vice presidential candidate. He chuckled and 
said, ``You'll have to hold off on questions like that until she 
can make her decision and I have the privilege'' of winning the 
nomination and choosing a running mate. 
</P>
<P>
	The possibility of a lengthy exploratory period worries New York  
Democrats who have little hope of fielding quality candidates until 
Mrs. Clinton gets in or out. Polls show New York Mayor Rudolph 
Giuliani, often mentioned as a possible GOP nominee, leads all 
potential Democratic candidates with the exception of Mrs. Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Close friends say her decision hinges mostly on personal issues,  
because she is already convinced she can raise enough money and 
build a strong enough political operation to mount a credible 
campaign. They say it boils down to this: Does she want to be a 
junior senator? And can she overcome her visceral distrust of the 
media and accept the scrutiny a campaign would bring? 
</P>
<P>
	Two friends who talked to her recently say Mrs. Clinton has  
suggested that, of all the options open to her, seeking the New 
York seat may be the most compelling. ``The Senate ranks very 
high,'' said one friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Those sentiments surprise many other close friends and allies  
who remain convinced she will eventually decide against running. 
Some cite the family's multimillion-dollar legal bills and her need 
to make money after leaving the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	At her direction, these supporters have sounded out scores of  
political operatives from across the country, some of whom would be 
in line for campaign jobs if she runs. Bill Carrick and David Doak, 
both of whom have ties to New York, received calls recently. 
</P>
<P>
	After Mrs. Clinton's meeting Friday with Moynihan, whose  
retirement will open the New York seat, the senator said they 
discussed his state's voting patterns and demographics. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're more complex than you might think,'' he said, adding  
that the numbers ``look very good for her, but New York is a big 
demographic problem.'' He said he did not advise her on whether she 
should run, but ``of course I'd support her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton met previously with Moynihan's wife, Elizabeth;  
Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.; Senate Democratic campaign committee 
chairman Sen. Robert Torricelli of New Jersey and a few female 
senators, including Barbara Boxer, D-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	She meets next week with AFL-CIO President John Sweeney.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton has not raised money or commissioned polling and  
there are no plans to do so, advisers say. She did have operatives 
contact lawyers versed in campaign laws to ensure she stays within 
legal bounds during this exploratory stage. They also are examining 
complicated questions that would be raised in the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Stung by years of investigations in the White House, Mrs.  
Clinton is said to fear her every move will be studied while she 
explores the Senate option. Questions already have been raised 
about who should pay for her travel as first lady if she seeks the 
Senate seat. 
</P>
<P>
	Harold Ickes, a former White House chief of staff and longtime  
ally of Mrs. Clinton, plans to meet with lawyers next week, sources 
say. 
</P>
<P>
	She could form an exploratory committee before making a final  
decision, allowing her to raise and spend money in the interim. But 
advisers said that is not under serious consideration now. 
</P>
<P>
	The prospect of nominating a sitting first lady with a huge  
fund-raising base and a strong following excites party activists. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would love to see her run,'' said Sandra Feldman, president  
of the American Federation of Teachers attending the four-day 
AFL-CIO convention in Florida that ended Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton was the hot topic among labor bosses and Democratic  
operatives here. Ickes cornered union leaders for their views on 
the potential candidacy. Sweeney said she would be a good 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile in Washington, anti-abortion leaders announced plans  
to field protesters at every campaign event Mrs. Clinton might 
hold. ``We will have signs, we will ask questions,'' said the Rev. 
Patrick Mahoney, director of the Christian Defense Coalition.

<HEADLINE> Phillies' Schilling Predicts Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEARWATER, Fla. (AP) -- The National League's version of the  
Rocket might be headed to a new team, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia Phillies right-hander Curt Schilling reiterated  
Friday that he's willing to waive his no-trade clause to play for a 
contender and predicted he'll be dealt by the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said it before and I'll say it again,'' said Schilling, who  
last year became the fifth pitcher to strike out 300 or more in 
consecutive seasons. ``I want to be here and contend on this club. 
If that's not going to happen in the immediate future and they move 
me to a club that is contending, then I would see if we can work 
something out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling led the majors in complete games and innings pitched  
last year while going 15-14 with a 3.25 ERA and an NL-best 300 
strikeouts. But the Phillies, in the third year of a youth 
movement, have had only one winning season since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking after the team's first workout for pitchers and  
catchers, Schilling was asked if he would be surprised if he was 
still with the Phillies after the 1999 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes,'' he replied.  
</P>
<P>
	The list of teams Schilling would consider includes Cleveland  
and Baltimore, but not the New York Yankees or Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not a big fan of New York,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Schilling said the Yankees' acquisition of Roger Clemens from  
Toronto might pave the way for a deal involving him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe the Clemens situation makes some teams a little more  
urgent to do some things,'' Schilling said. ``I think for the right 
price, the Phillies will move me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillies general manager Ed Wade, repeating a stance he's taken  
the entire offseason, said Schilling isn't on the trading block and 
will pitch April 5 against Atlanta on opening day. 
</P>
<P>
	``Curt's got a right to express his opinion, and I would have  
been surprised if at some point he didn't express his opinion,'' 
Wade said. ``But it doesn't change my opinion that we're better 
with him here and he's our opening day starter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand a lot of the reasons why he would think the grass  
is greener someplace else,'' Wade added. ``That said, our position 
is that he's here. I've told people we're not moving him. For the 
whole season? I can't answer that, but our desire is to build 
around him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling thinks the situation could change if the Phillies are  
out of the playoff chase by the July 31 trade deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the right package of players came up, why wouldn't they  
move me?'' Schilling asked. ``They're putting a team on the field 
now that is close to being set with a couple pieces missing. If 
they can fill those couple pieces by dealing me, then maybe they'll 
do it. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a situation would present itself where I would go to a team  
that had a real legitimate chance to play in October -- and it 
wasn't this club -- then I would listen.''

<HEADLINE> Moderate May Fill Gingrich Seat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROSWELL, Ga. (AP) -- Newt Gingrich's Republican heir apparent in  
Congress is considered less combative than the former House speaker 
and a consensus builder who some think is practically a Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	Former state lawmaker Johnny Isakson, 54, is considered the  
front-runner in Tuesday's special election to replace the 
pugnacious Gingrich, who resigned from Congress after his party's 
poor showing in the November elections. 
</P>
<P>
	The race in the staunchly Republican 6th Congressional District  
features eight candidates but no experienced Democrats, though many 
see Isakson as a candidate who could bridge the gap by virtue of 
what he isn't -- another Gingrich. 
</P>
<P>
	``Isakson is a type of Republican Democrats can work with,''  
said Merle Black, a political science professor at Emory 
University. ``He's not a Gingrich.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even Georgia's former Gov. Zell Miller, a Democrat, once needed  
someone to quell a conflict between the state's first GOP schools 
superintendent and the Democratic-appointed school board. Miller 
chose Isakson, whom he had defeated in the 1990 gubernatorial 
election, to serve as board chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's in some ways a conservative Southern Democrat,'' said  
University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock. 
``If you like Sam Nunn, you could probably find something you like 
about Johnny Isakson.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Green, 50, of Marietta is among the voters in the northern  
Atlanta district who gave Gingrich 71 percent of the vote last 
fall. Now he thinks the state needs someone like Isakson. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need someone who is more persuasive, not more demanding.  
Newt was demanding,'' Green said. ``I think instead of using a 
hammer and a blowtorch, Isakson would use a match.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Isakson's only opponent with name recognition is Christina  
Jeffrey, a Kennesaw State University political science professor 
who was a colleague of Gingrich when he taught a course there. The 
state Board of Regents has since banned politicians from teaching 
at public colleges. 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich hired Ms. Jeffrey as House historian in 1995, then  
fired her after it was learned that she once said a Holocaust 
course should have included the Nazi point of view. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jeffrey insisted her comments were mischaracterized. The  
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, which attacked her at the 
time, has since become an ally in her drive to reclaim her 
reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jeffrey has courted the conservative GOP vote, labeling  
Isakson's views as too liberal for most district voters and 
accusing him of supporting tax increases when he was in the 
Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is campaigning as a Reagan conservative, but he really has  
a record of a tax-spending liberal,'' said Tom Campbell, her 
campaign manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Isakson dismissed the accusations, saying he voted against  
increases in sales and gas taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1996 Senate primary, Isakson touted his abortion-rights  
stand and lost in a runoff. This time, he is stressing his 
opposition to a specific kind of late-term abortion and support of 
parental notification for minors wanting to end a pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the fact that voters sent me over and over again to  
the Legislature or the Senate, that's a ratification that I have a 
solid Republican background,'' Isakson said.

<HEADLINE>  Steinbrenner Did Love David Wells </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Boss is not crazy, just fickle.  
</P>
<P>
	George Steinbrenner really did love David Wells. It's just that  
he loved Roger Clemens more. And the New York Yankees most of all. 
</P>
<P>
	There is not another owner in sports self-assured enough to do  
what Steinbrenner did. It was like sitting at a blackjack table 
holding 18 and saying ``hit me'' when the cards come around. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrenner already had the best team in baseball. Then he  
found a way to make them just a little bit better. 
</P>
<P>
	At this point, most owners would pause and ask themselves: How  
much better, really, does a team that won 125 games and swept the 
World Series have to be? 
</P>
<P>
	The book says stay pat. Instead, George answered the way he  
always has: Hit me. 
</P>
<P>
	Naturally, not everybody was as comfortable with the decision as  
the decision-maker. 
</P>
<P>
	``Give me a couple of days,'' Wells said. ``It's a little tough  
right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Small wonder. In the span of a Thursday morning meeting when  
Steinbrenner told Wells in person that the deal had been made, the 
wacky left-hander went from being the toast of New York to just 
toast. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Joe Torre couldn't have felt much better. Getting  
Clemens, a five-time Cy Young award-winner, can hardly be called a 
consolation prize. But replacing Wells in the clubhouse might turn 
out to be tougher than it is on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's some shock in that room right now,'' Torre said with a  
nod toward the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	But he could have been talking about his office, too. For all  
the attention that's focused on Wells, Torre knows it won't be easy 
replacing the other two ex-Yankees on their way to Toronto: Graeme 
Lloyd, who developed into a solid left-handed reliever; and Homer 
Bush, a backup infielder whose speed and defense made him a 
valuable late-inning replacement. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something you have to get used to,'' Torre added. ``That  
is what the game is all about. There are going to be changes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But this is a change almost no one saw coming.  
</P>
<P>
	Wells, after all, seemed so much like George's kind of guy. He  
pitched a perfect game, won 18 in all and never, ever ducked 
responsibility. Only last October, before one of the biggest games 
of the postseason, the two sat side-by-side in the clubhouse an 
hour before the game, bonding while the music of Metallica pounded 
in the background. 
</P>
<P>
	They might have seemed like an unlikely pair at that moment, the  
owner in his blazer and white turtleneck, the, potbellied, goateed 
pitcher in a cutoff T-shirt. But what they had in common was more 
important -- a desire to bring New York back a world championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years ago, Steinbrenner felt the same way about Clemens.  
So much so that when Clemens went on the free-agent market, the 
owner made a trip to Texas to convince him to move to New York. To 
prove his sincerity, Steinbrenner even lifted weights with the 
Rocket in his home gym. They didn't come to terms then, but clearly 
were impressed with each other's work ethic. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that they're partners, they had better make sure the rest of  
New York feels the same way when next fall rolls around. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's going to be a lot of bars going out of business in New  
York,'' predicted David Cone, who often followed Wells in the 
pitching rotation and in clubhouse antics. 
</P>
<P>
	``He won't be forgotten. I'm sure there are mixed emotions among  
the fans. As soon as Rocket throws his first 15-strikeout night at 
Yankee Stadium people will be oohing and wowing, saying what a 
catch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It would be nice if things work out that way. Success too often  
is a sedative for championship teams. The Florida Marlins won one 
championship, then fired just about everybody who made it happen. 
The Chicago Bulls won six in the NBA during the past decade, then 
simply let everybody walk away. 
</P>
<P>
	George may be meddling, but give him credit for this much: At  
least he's trying. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
	The book says stay pat. Instead, George answered the way he  
always has: Hit me. 
</P>
<P>
	Naturally, not everybody was as comfortable with the decision as  
the decision-maker. 
</P>
<P>
	``Give me a couple of days,'' Wells said. ``It's a little tough  
right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Small wonder. In the span of a Thursday morning meeting when  
Steinbrenner told Wells in person that the deal had been made, the 
wacky left-hander went from being the toast of New York to just 
toast. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Joe Torre couldn't have felt much better. Getting  
Clemens, a five-time Cy Young award-winner, can hardly be called a 
consolation prize. But replacing Wells in the clubhouse might turn 
out to be tougher than it is on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's some shock in that room right now,'' Torre said with a  
nod toward the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	But he could have been talking about his office, too. For all  
the attention that's focused on Wells, Torre knows it won't be easy 
replacing the other two ex-Yankees on their way to Toronto: Graeme 
Lloyd, who developed into a solid left-handed reliever; and Homer 
Bush, a backup infielder whose speed and defense made him a 
valuable late-inning replacement. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something you have to get used to,'' Torre added. ``That  
is what the game is all about. There are going to be changes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But this is a change almost no one saw coming.  
</P>
<P>
	Wells, after all, seemed so much like George's kind of guy. He  
pitched a perfect game, won 18 in all and never, ever ducked 
responsibility. Only last October, before one of the biggest games 
of the postseason, the two sat side-by-side in the clubhouse an 
hour before the game, bonding while the music of Metallica pounded 
in the background. 
</P>
<P>
	They might have seemed like an unlikely pair at that moment, the  
owner in his blazer and white turtleneck, the, potbellied, goateed 
pitcher in a cutoff T-shirt. But what they had in common was more 
important -- a desire to bring New York back a world championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years ago, Steinbrenner felt the same way about Clemens.  
So much so that when Clemens went on the free-agent market, the 
owner made a trip to Texas to convince him to move to New York. To 
prove his sincerity, Steinbrenner even lifted weights with the 
Rocket in his home gym. They didn't come to terms then, but clearly 
were impressed with each other's work ethic. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that they're partners, they had better make sure the rest of  
New York feels the same way when next fall rolls around. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's going to be a lot of bars going out of business in New  
York,'' predicted David Cone, who often followed Wells in the 
pitching rotation and in clubhouse antics. 
</P>
<P>
	``He won't be forgotten. I'm sure there are mixed emotions among  
the fans. As soon as Rocket throws his first 15-strikeout night at 
Yankee Stadium people will be oohing and wowing, saying what a 
catch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It would be nice if things work out that way. Success too often  
is a sedative for championship teams. The Florida Marlins won one 
championship, then fired just about everybody who made it happen. 
The Chicago Bulls won six in the NBA during the past decade, then 
simply let everybody walk away. 
</P>
<P>
	George may be meddling, but give him credit for this much: At  
least he's trying. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Dollar Higher, Tokyo Shares Lower / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Fresh comments from Japanese officials in favor of  
a weaker yen pushed the dollar higher ahead of a meeting of major 
industrialized nations over the weekend. Tokyo share prices closed 
lower. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.06 yen in late afternoon trading, up 1.38  
yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and also above its late New York 
level of 119.81 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 48.75 points,  
or 0.34 percent, closing the week at 14,098.04 points. On Thursday, 
the index slipped 11.88 points, or 0.08 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The greenback was buoyed by remarks from senior Japanese  
officials which signaled support for the U.S. currency's recent 
surge against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said today that Japan has no  
plans to discuss the dollar-yen rate a meeting this weekend of 
finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of Seven 
nations, or G-7. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't intend to bring it up,'' Miyazawa told Dow Jones  
Newswires. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Eisuke Sakakibara, vice finance minister and a chief  
currency market troubleshooter dubbed ``Mr. Yen,'' said Japan 
accepted a weaker yen and that the Bank of Japan would likely move 
to ease monetary policy further. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar moved as high as 120.75 yen in early trading, but  
profit-taking and selling by Japanese life insurance companies 
trimmed some of its initial gains, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``People aren't sure what's coming out of the G-7 meeting, so  
it's only natural that they'll want to pocket their profits now,'' 
said Hirokazu Note, chief foreign exchange dealer at Sumitomo Bank 
Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar's strength followed its rise in New York, where it  
briefly broke through 120 yen for the first time since Dec. 8. 
</P>
<P>
	The greenback has been steadily rising against the yen this week  
following various moves by Japan's financial authorities to lower 
long-term interest rates, which had soared in recent trading and 
threatened to choke off an economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. funds led a dollar-buying spree today after the Japanese  
Finance Ministry's Trust Fund Bureau purchased $831 million in 
government bonds outright, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchase had been expected. It was part of the Finance  
Ministry's package of steps unveiled Tuesday to ease pressure on 
the bond market. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar fell as low 119.42 yen and rose as high as 120.75 yen  
in today's trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 134.17 yen, up form  
133.81 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, investors were reluctant to trade  
ahead of the G-7 meeting over the weekend and prior to the book 
closing for many Japanese companies at the end of the fiscal year 
on March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated at 402 million shares changed hands on the  
exchange's first section, up from Thursday's 348 million shares. 
Decliners outnumbered advancers 719 to 401, with 171 issues closing 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section fell 0.77 points, or 0.07 percent, to 1,094.50. The 
TOPIX had shed 1.81 points, or 0.16 percent, the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.760 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.875 
percent, driving its price up to 100.32 yen from 99.40 yen.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Affects Cable Car Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- Deployment for a possible military  
strike on Kosovo disrupted the court-martial Friday of a Marine 
pilot whose jet cut an Italian ski gondola cable and killed 20 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	Six members of Capt. Richard Ashby's squadron -- scheduled to  
testify next week as defense witnesses -- were called out of turn 
because the squadron was ordered to Europe for duty over Kosovo, a 
Serbian province. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Michael Recce, a pilot, said he watched Ashby's crew  
discuss a 1,000-foot altitude restriction for the low-level 
training flight the day of the accident, Feb. 3, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Recce said none of the squadron members knew of the 2,000-foot  
restriction imposed the previous October. The radar-jamming Prowler 
hit the gondola cable at about 360 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby is charged with 20 counts of involuntary manslaughter and  
other charges. If convicted, he faces more than 200 years in 
prison. The navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, 31, faces the same 
charges next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors allege Ashby, 31, was flying too low and too fast.  
His lawyers said the ski lift wasn't on Ashby's map, his radar 
altimeter malfunctioned and an optical illusion made him think he 
was flying higher than he really was. 
</P>
<P>
	Another squadron member testified Friday that Ashby was a top  
pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	``He worked as hard as any other pilot, and his stick and  
throttle are above most others,'' testified Capt. Clay Ogden, who 
flew with Ashby 40 to 50 times.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Higher; Dow Up 41.32 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose Friday, but finished sharply below  
the day's highs after a late burst of selling. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrials ended the day up 41.32 at 9,339.95.  
But between 3:45 p.m. EST and the closing bell at 4 p.m., a 
97-point gain dwindled to zero before the blue-chip index climbed 
back up again. For the week, the Dow gained 65.06 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The late retreat came as President Clinton reiterated at a White  
House news conference that U.S. warplanes were ready to assist NATO 
troops in Kosovo if Serbian leaders failed to reach agreement on a 
peace plan with ethnic Albanians by a 6 a.m. EST Saturday deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite index gained 23.05 to 2,283.60, and the  
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 composite added 1.94 to 1,239.22. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of soft drink and drug companies, which are steady  
performers regardless of how the economy fares, did well. But so 
did manufacturing stocks, which are more sensitive to changes in 
the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	PepsiCo Inc. rose 1 5/8 to 39 3/16, after the company predicted  
higher soft drink and snack food sales. Dow member Coca-Cola, which 
is introducing its first brand of bottled water in the United 
States, rose 1 1/8 to 65 3/4. United Technologies advanced 2 3/8 to 125 
7/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial services stocks rose, despite a dip in bond prices  
that nudged interest rates higher in credit markets. Citigroup's 
shares rose 1 1/4 to 54 3/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the late flurry of activity tied to global developments,  
the market lacked direction for most of the session. Decliners 
outnumbered advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange, 
despite the gain in the Dow. Volume was a modest 856.46 million 
shares, down from Thursday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some event is going to have to come along and turn the fence  
sitters into buyers or sellers,'' said Hugh Johnson, market 
strategist at First Albany Corp. ``It could be anything,'' he said, 
from a negative event, such as a further rise in interest rates, to 
positive economic developments in Japan and throughout Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've seen a lot of activity over there, and that could  
improve the prospect of economic recovery'' that could boost the 
shares of U.S.-based global companies that do business there, 
Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's lower house of parliament passed a budget Friday that  
includes massive spending hikes and tax cuts, although doubts 
remained about whether that would be sufficient stimulus for 
Japan's troubled economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, technology stocks, which have been battered in recent  
weeks, rose for the second straight day. The Nasdaq composite 
gained 15 percent in January, but most of those gains were lost 
amid a steep selloff in technology shares this month. The Nasdaq is 
now up just 4 percent for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Fueling Friday's gains in the technology sector was CIBC  
Oppenheimer analyst Henry Blodget's prediction that Internet stocks 
would hit new highs this year. Among the stocks he thought would do 
especially well were Amazon.com and Yahoo!. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com gained 12 3/8 to 101 7/8, and Yahoo! climbed 6 7/16 to 135  
5/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Blodget gained investors' attention in December after he sharply  
increased his price projection for Amazon.com. to $400 a share, 
prior to its 3-to-1 stock split. Once it surpassed that level, he 
refused to raise his price target again, which put pressure on the 
entire Internet sector. 
</P>
<P>
	There was little reaction in the market to a Labor Department  
report that consumer prices rose a tiny 0.1 percent in January. The 
smaller-than-expected increase failed to calm investors' fears that 
the Federal Reserve would soon raise interest rates to cool the 
U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	In other market activity, the NYSE composite index rose 0.10 to  
586.56, and the American Stock Exchange composite index rose 2.75 
to 692.57. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 1.21 to 392.30.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.34 percent,  
Germany's DAX index fell 1 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 fell 0.7 
percent, and France's CAC-40 rose 1.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Steel Exports Jump 17 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Led by a sharp rise in shipments to the United  
States, Japan's overall steel exports jumped 17.6 percent last year 
to 27.65 million metric tons, according to an industry report 
published Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second straight year of growth in steel export  
volume. The amount of steel sold abroad jumped 14.2 percent in 
1997, said Yoshihisa Hino, spokesman for the Japan Iron and Steel 
Federation. 
</P>
<P>
	In terms of value, however, steel exports fell 8.6 percent on a  
dollar basis to $15.76 billion and 0.3 percent on a yen basis to 
2.073 trillion yen, the federation said. 
</P>
<P>
	Exports to the U.S. market more than doubled in terms of volume,  
increasing 160 percent to 7.02 million metric tons from 1997 
levels. Wide strip hot-rolled coil exports to the United States 
rose 288 percent to 2.25 million metric tons, the federation said. 
</P>
<P>
	Total ordinary steel exports to the United States surged 188  
percent to 5.39 million tons, while specialty steel exports rose 
48.4 percent to 814,587 metric tons. 
</P>
<P>
	The federation's annual report came as Japanese exports of steel  
to the United States have become a major trade issue between the 
two nations. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, major U.S. steelmakers and the United Steelworkers  
Union filed import complaints, accusing Japan and seven other 
nations of selling cut-to-length steel in the U.S. market at less 
than production costs and home market prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the U.S. government said it had evidence that Japan  
and Brazil had illegally dumped hot-rolled steel. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese steelmakers have said Japan's sharp rise in exports  
last year came largely at the request of the U.S. steelmakers 
themselves and steel users to meet a domestic supply shortage.

<HEADLINE> Boxer Berbick Wanted by Fla. Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) -- Trevor Berbick is in more trouble  
with the law. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadian heavyweight boxing champion is wanted by  
authorities in Florida for allegedly breaking the conditions of his 
1994 parole on convictions of rape, theft and misdemeanor assault. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a fugitive,'' Debbie Buchanan, a public affairs officer  
for the Florida State Corrections Service, said Friday. ``If he 
ever returns to Florida he will be arrested.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan said a Florida judge issued a warrant for Berbick last  
September, unaware that the former world champion was living in 
Canada and in trouble with immigration officials who have ordered 
him deported to his native Jamaica. 
</P>
<P>
	She said Berbick's arrest was ordered because he failed to make  
financial restitution to his victims. Berbick, also required to 
meet regularly with a parole officer in Florida, is on probation 
until August 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Contacted at his home in Montreal by The Canadian Press, an  
agitated Berbick said he was aware of the arrest warrant but denied 
breaking probation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did everything,'' he said in a rambling,  
often-unintelligible interview that became increasingly distraught. 
``All this is untrue. It is a misunderstanding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berbick said he was ordered to pay $95,000 -- the amount he stole  
by forging his ex-wife's signature to get a mortgage on his Florida 
home. He said he paid back the money in full and has receipts. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida corrections officials were stunned to learn of Berbick's  
whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's in Canada?'' an incredulous Buchanan said before  
beginning to laugh. ``Guess what, he's supposed to be in Florida. 
He's still on probation. Do you know where he is?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan said it's unlikely Florida would try to extradite  
Berbick for violating probation and leaving the state without 
permission. He would be at risk of arrest if he returns to his 
former U.S. home. 
</P>
<P>
	Berbick said he returned freely to Canada about two weeks after  
his release from prison. He originally immigrated to the country 
after fighting for Jamaica at the 1976 Olympics in Montreal. He 
lived in the Halifax for a few years before moving to the Miami 
area after his boxing career took off with wins over John Tate and 
Muhammad Ali. 
</P>
<P>
	Berbick, who briefly held the WBC world title in 1986, won the  
Canadian championship Feb. 6 in Montreal with a 12-round knockout 
of Shane Sutcliffe of Nanaimo, B.C. 
</P>
<P>
	It turns out Berbick was ineligible to fight for the title  
because he was stripped of his status as a landed immigrant last 
summer when he was ordered deported. Berbick has appealed the 
ruling and has permission to remain in the country until a 
deportation hearing March 8 in Halifax. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Hayter, president of the Canadian Professional Boxing  
Federation, said earlier this week he would await the outcome of 
Berbick's deportation appeal before deciding on whether to strip 
him of the title. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Heisler of Citizenship and Immigration Canada said Friday  
that Berbick returned to Canada legally. He was admitted as a 
permanent resident, but his status was revoked after authorities 
learned of his record.

<HEADLINE> FEC Withdraws Suit Against Forbes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Election Commission has decided  
not to go court against publisher Steve Forbes over whether his 
magazine column was an illegal contribution to his 1996 
presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission submitted papers on Thursday in U.S. District  
Court in New York City dismissing the suit it had filed last 
September. Four of the six commissioners had voted Dec. 9 to 
withdraw the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reasoning that led to the Forbes suit holds that once you  
declare as a candidate for office, you leave your First Amendment 
rights behind,'' said David Mason, a Republican commissioner who 
voted to drop the suit. ``A substantially new set of commissioners 
has rejected that reasoning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But FEC Chairman Scott Thomas, a Democrat who voted against  
dismissing the lawsuit, said Forbes should have reported the value 
of his Forbes magazine columns as a contribution to his campaign. 
The suit charged Forbes Inc. with making illegal corporate 
contributions and Forbes' presidential campaign with failing to 
report the donations. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my view, when you've got a press entity that is completely  
controlled by a federal candidate, the statute suggests that these 
kinds of commentaries are to be treated as an in-kind contribution 
by the entity to the candidate,'' Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes, who is expected to run again in 2000, spent $38 million  
of his own money on the 1996 campaign. The FEC valued the columns 
at $94,900. 
</P>
<P>
	He took a leave of absence from his magazine, where he is  
president and editor in chief, during the campaign. He said 
Thursday that his columns did not specifically urge a vote for or 
against any candidate, including himself, and therefore could not 
be regulated by the FEC. Among the topics discussed were abortion, 
taxes and term limits. 
</P>
<P>
	``This case represents precisely the kind of government  
intrusion the First Amendment strictly prohibits,'' Forbes said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company issued its own statement Thursday praising the FEC's  
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``We vehemently objected to the FEC's assertions that we  
violated the federal election laws and feel vindicated that the 
commissioners have terminated this matter in our favor,'' the 
company said.

<HEADLINE> Ploy Used To Free Death Row Inmate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A private investigator praised for his role in  
freeing a death-row inmate insisted that the end justified his 
means -- including using a phony eyewitness account to elicit a 
confession from another man. 
</P>
<P>
	The disclosure that Paul Ciolino staged the statement prompted  
prosecutors to ask for more time to examine the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``This new piece of information demands some investigation,''  
prosecutor Thomas Gainer said Friday following a hearing on erasing 
the 1982 murder conviction of Anthony Porter. No decision was made 
at the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter, 43, was released on bail two weeks ago after Milwaukee  
laborer Alstory Simon made a videotape in which he said he killed 
two people in self defense in a dispute over drug money. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter had been on death row 17 years for the killings.  
</P>
<P>
	Simon, 48, made the tape at the urging of Ciolino, the private  
investigator who was working for Northwestern University journalism 
professor David Protess and his investigative reporting class. 
</P>
<P>
	The journalism students have been widely applauded for tracking  
down Simon and gathering preliminary information that led to his 
admission. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ciolino went by himself to the interview at which Simon  
admitted to the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	Ciolino said at the time that he appealed to Simon's conscience  
and warned him that witnesses were recanting their testimony 
against Porter. He said Simon became more worried when his 
estranged wife appeared in a national television interview talking 
about the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Ciolino's attorney told prosecutors on Monday that the  
investigator had played Simon a videotape of an actor hired to 
pretend he witnessed the shooting, Gainer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor would not comment later on whether the use of the  
phony eyewitness statement would make Simon's confession 
inadmissible in court. But he said it didn't reflect on Porter's 
innocence.

	Ciolino said false eyewitness accounts are legitimate ways for  
investigators to press suspects for information. And he said the 
confession came after Simon saw his estranged wife talking about 
the case -- not after the statement of the phony eyewitness.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon OKs Avondale Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- The Pentagon signed off Friday on the  
proposed $470 million merger between Newport News Shipbuilding and 
Avondale Industries. 
</P>
<P>
	The Defense Department said it notified the Justice Department's  
antitrust division that the merger ``would not have an adverse 
impact on competition to build and repair Navy ships.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The department said its announcement was unrelated to General  
Dynamics proposed $1.36 billion cash takeover of Newport News 
Shipbuilding, made late Thursday afternoon. The Pentagon said it is 
evaluating that offer as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's business as usual with this Avondale-Newport merger,''  
said Avondale spokesman Ed Winter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Avondale-Newport News deal would reduce the Navy's pool of  
primary contractors for ships to three: the new company; General 
Dynamics, which owns Electric Boat, Bath Iron Works, and National 
Steel and Shipbuilding Co.; and Litton Industries, parent of 
Ingalls Shipbuilding. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger would create a company with estimated 1999 revenues  
of $2.6 billion. The combined company would be capable of building 
any warship in the Navy's fleet, from behemoth nuclear-powered 
aircraft carriers to fast-moving amphibious landers. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport News Shipbuilding builds all the Navy's aircraft  
carriers and many of its submarines, and it repairs and performs 
maintenance on various types of Navy ships. 
</P>
<P>
	Avondale designs, builds and overhauls Navy surface ships as  
well as commercial vessels. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport News Shipbuilding was a division of Tenneco Inc. until  
December 1996, when it became an independent company.

<HEADLINE> Jury Awards $58.5M in Air Bag Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler vowed to appeal a $58.5  
million verdict in a class-action lawsuit filed by a woman whose 
hand was burned when her car's air bag inflated in an accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``Holding DaimlerChrysler liable in this case is like holding  
the manufacturer of a bulletproof vest responsible because their 
product saved someone's life but resulted in a few bruised ribs,'' 
Karl Lukens, an attorney for the automaker, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Court of Common Pleas jury awarded $730 to each of 75,000  
plaintiffs from Pennsylvania. The amount represents the cost of 
buying safer air bags. The jury also awarded $3.8 million in 
punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
	The damages cover late 1988, 1989 and 1990 Chrysler vehicles  
that have driver's-side air bags with vents, which release hot gas 
to allow the air bag to deflate rapidly after it inflates. 
</P>
<P>
	Plaintiffs' attorney Martin D'Urso said the vents were placed  
too close to the normal hand positions on the steering wheel. 
</P>
<P>
	``The steering wheel induces the driver to put his or her hands  
in the precise location that they are most likely to be burned in 
the event of an air bag deployment,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Lukens said none of DaimlerChrysler's tests or tests by  
the air bag maker revealed any problems with the location of the 
vents. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 14 of the 75,000 people had experiences similar to Louise  
Crawley, whose 1992 accident in a 1989 Chrysler LeBaron initiated 
the lawsuit, Lukens said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ten years ago, we would have received a thank-you note from a  
customer for the air bag having saved her life,'' he said. ``Today, 
we get slapped with a multimillion-dollar verdict. That is the 
nature of our out-of-control legal system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Daniel Hensell, who treated Mrs. Crawley, testified that she  
suffered a second-degree burn on her left wrist. 
</P>
<P>
	The judgment was just the latest against the company involving  
air bags. A federal jury in New York in December ordered 
DaimlerChrysler to pay $750,000 to a family of a 5-year-old boy 
killed by an air bag. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to the company's merger in November with Daimler-Benz AG,  
Chrysler and the parents of a 5-year-old Nashville, Tenn., girl 
killed when a minivan air bag deployed reached an out-of-court 
settlement.

<HEADLINE> Biletnikoff Murder Suspect Charged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REDWOOD CITY, Calif. (AP) -- The man accused of killing the  
daughter of NFL Hall of Famer Fred Biletnikoff was arraigned on one 
murder count Friday after his former probation officer said a judge 
went too easy on him years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Mohammed Haroon Ali appeared briefly in court to hear the charge  
against him. Ali said nothing and was scheduled to return to court 
March 11 to enter a plea. 
</P>
<P>
	Tracey Biletnikoff was found dead Tuesday, as she lay near a  
parking lot at Canada College. The San Mateo County coroner's 
office said Biletnikoff, 20, had apparently been strangled. Ali was 
her boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
	The county's chief probation officer, Amos Dana, said his agency  
knew Ali was dangerous to the community and recommended he be sent 
to prison in 1995 for kidnapping and severely beating a previous 
girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
	Ali faced a nine-year prison term for the assault, but presiding  
Judge John Schwartz sentenced him to one year in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Following his release, Ali was sent to a drug rehabilitation  
program in 1996 after he was arrested for cocaine and marijuana 
use. Ali received a six-month jail sentence for the violation. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was sent to my courtroom on a probation violation for  
having a single dirty chemical test,'' Judge Margaret Kemp told the 
San Francisco Chronicle. ``And that's not what I consider a major 
probation violation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ali was arrested the day Biletnikoff's body was found.  
Immigration agents at San Ysidro ran a random check of the license 
number and ``came up with a hit,'' said Immigration and 
Naturalization spokesman Bill Strassberger. 
</P>
<P>
	Ali allegedly drove Ms. Biletnikoff's car into Mexico and was  
caught coming back into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Biletnikoff had been living with her father in San Ramon and  
worked as a counselor at a San Mateo drug and alcohol 
rehabilitation center. 
</P>
<P>
	Fred Biletnikoff was the Oakland Raider's all-time leading  
receiver with 589 catches until Tim Brown broke that mark two years 
ago.

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler May Cut Bonuses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler AG estimates 1998 profit-sharing  
checks will fall short of expectations, despite record earnings for 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The German automaker estimates 1998 profit-sharing payments for  
U.S. hourly employees next week will average $6,800 to $7,300, 
which is higher than 1997 checks but below 1994's record of $8,000, 
The Detroit News reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	United Auto Workers President Stephen Yokich and Vice President  
Jack Laskowski told delegates at a meeting last week that 
profit-sharing checks won't be as high as hoped because more 
employees will get some of the money, and because cash rebates were 
higher, cutting profits. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler is scheduled to release its preliminary year-end  
financial figures Feb. 24.

<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The Baltimore Orioles might consider wearing  
name tags in the clubhouse during spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	Introductions, after all, are in order for a team that has  
undergone radical changes since last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Newcomers include outfielder Albert Belle, first baseman Will  
Clark, second baseman Delino DeShields, utility man Rich Amaral and 
new starting catcher, Charles Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Rafael Palmeiro, Roberto Alomar and Eric Davis, meanwhile, are  
among those who exited via free agency. Pitchers Jimmy Key, Armando 
Benitez and Doug Drabek are gone, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Ray Miller hopes the new blend of Orioles will band  
together to erase memories of last year's horrid 79-83 season. 
Baltimore had more than a dozen potential free agents in training 
camp last season, and now Miller has a more stable mixture with 
which to create a little positive chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel a little better about the makeup of this team than I  
did last year,'' Miller said. ``I knew that if those 14 free agents 
didn't get signed during the season that there would be a problem, 
and I think that's what happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller got his first look at some of the members of the new team  
Friday, when pitchers and catchers reported to camp in Fort 
Lauderdale, Fla. to begin a six-week stay. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the changes on the field, a revamped bullpen will  
be working with a new pitching coach, Bruce Kison. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles will miss Palmeiro's bat, Alomar's defense and  
Davis' presence in the clubhouse. But Belle and Clark bring two 
items sorely lacking last year: offense and leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before we knew who we were going to lose, I told (general  
manager) Frank Wren and (owner) Peter Angelos that I wanted guys 
who came to the ballpark with fire and intensity,'' Miller said. 
``The people we got all fit into that category.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Belle and Clark are not scheduled to show up until next week,  
but their reputations precede them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the veterans we brought in are well recognized and  
have a lot of respect from the players on this team, so they should 
fit right in,'' shortstop Mike Bordick said. ``We know what they 
can do. Now it's a matter of getting guys on the same page right 
out of the shoot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bordick and third baseman Cal Ripken will again cover the right  
side of the infield, but the double-play combination will now 
include DeShields and Clark. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken longs for the days when the Orioles' roster varied only  
slightly from one year to the next. Instead, he's grown accustomed 
to meeting a variety of new teammates every February. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would prefer the stability of having the same team back, but  
at this level talent dominates,'' Ripken said. ``We do have a 
fairly big changeover in talent, but the common thread each year is 
that it's good talent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Veteran talent, too. Potential major leaguers Calvin Pickering,  
Chris Fussell, Ryan Minor and Jerry Hairston Jr. will see plenty of 
action in exhibition games, but the focus of this spring training 
is for the over-30 crowd to get to know one another while building 
a winning attitude. 
</P>
<P>
	``From what I've heard, the guys we got are anxious to win and  
want to be part of a winner,'' Bordick said. ``The guys who were 
already here remember how frustrating last season was and want to 
prove we can be successful.''

	Milosevic Shuns U.S. Peace Bid  
</P>
<P>
	RAMBOUILLET, France (AP) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic  
today defied international pressure, saying he won't give up Kosovo 
province even at the price of NATO airstrikes. With NATO preparing 
to attack Serbia if no Kosovo deal is reached by noon tomorrow (6 
a.m. EST), the hard-line Yugoslav president refused to meet U.S. 
envoy Christopher Hill. He had traveled to Belgrade to make a 
last-ditch attempt to urge him to accept the Kosovo peace plan. 
That plan calls for NATO troops to enforce it, something Serbia 
staunchly opposes. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton Warns Serbia on Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today warned that Serbia  
will be ``held accountable'' if peace talks on Kosovo fail. At a 
White House news conference with French President Jacques Chirac, 
Clinton said: ``I have ordered our aircraft to be ready to act as 
part of the NATO operation.'' He praised ethnic Albanians for 
having ``shown courage'' at the talks. Chirac said Milosevic 
``holds the key'' to what happens next. ``We want our continent to 
be at peace,'' he said. 

</P>

	First Lady Mulls Senate Race  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Several of first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's  
advisers say she is increasingly warming to the notion of running 
for the Senate in New York. Yet they caution that her decision 
could be weeks or months away. She met privately in the White House 
today with retiring New York Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a 
session that press secretary Marsha Berry called ``an opportunity 
to explore thoughts.'' 

</P>
<P>
	Gore Seeks Bonds With Labor Groups  
</P>
<P>
	MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore, trying to seal  
up a critical Democratic constituency, sought organized labor's 
support today while papering over their differences concerning his 
free-trade policies. ``You better believe if ... I run for the 
presidency in 2000, I would certainly want the support of organized 
labor,'' said Gore, who has not yet formally announced his 
intention to seek his party's nomination. He made the remarks on 
the final day of a four-day AFL-CIO convention.

	New Workplace Safety Rules Unveiled  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Preventing on-the-job injuries to the neck,  
back and wrist should be the employers' responsibility, a federal 
agency concluded today in unveiling a draft of national standards 
for industry. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration 
outlined ``ergonomics'' standards that would require employers to 
alter work stations, redesign facilities or change tools to reduce 
the risk to workers.

	U.S. Trade Deficit Hits New High  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. trade deficit surged to an all-time  
high of $168.6 billion last year as the global financial crisis 
battered American manufacturers and farmers, triggering the first 
decline in exports in 13 years. The Commerce Department reported 
today that last year's deficit jumped 53 percent from a 1997 
imbalance of $110.2 billion, surpassing the old record of $153.4 
billion set in 1987.

	NEC To Cut 15,000 Jobs

<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- NEC, Japan's biggest computer maker, will cut  
15,000 jobs, or nearly 10 percent of its work force, over three 
years. It is struggling to recover from slumping sales and massive 
losses at its Packard Bell unit in the United States. About 6,000 
of the job cuts are outside Japan. NEC didn't say how many will hit 
its 7,000 U.S. workers.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock indexes ended the day higher but pulled  
back from even bigger gains in the final 15 minutes of trading 
today after President Clinton reiterated that Serbia will be ``held 
accountable'' if peace talks on Kosovo collapse and a NATO bombing 
campaign is needed. The Dow Jones industrials ended the day up 
41.32 at 9,339.95. On the NYSE, losers led gainers 1,535-1,396. The 
Nasdaq gained 22.89 at 2,283.44.

	ATLANTA (AP) -- Some 113 years after Coca-Cola began selling the  
sweetened, carbonated brown water that became the world's most 
popular soft drink, it's going to market its own brand of bottled 
water. The water, called Dasani, is expected to be available 
nationwide and in Canada before this summer.

</P>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The U.S. Olympic Committee might reopen an  
investigation into Atlanta's bid for the 1996 Games because IOC 
members received gifts that possibly were too expensive. Dick 
Schultz, executive director of the USOC, said he plans to send a 
letter to the International Olympic Committee next week about the 
developments.

<HEADLINE> Rain Delays Rockingham Qualifying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKINGHAM, N.C. (AP) -- North Carolina Speedway is a track where  
qualifying can have a direct relationship to a driver's chance of 
winning, or even finishing, on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1.017-mile oval has only 31 pit positions on the front  
straightaway, meaning that 13 starters in the Dura-Lube/Big Kmart 
400 will have to pit on the backstretch. That's a big disadvantage, 
particularly on yellow flag stops when the drivers up front often 
are getting done with their stops by the time those in the back are 
reaching their pits. 
</P>
<P>
	The only driver to win at The Rock from the back pits in 67  
races was Neil Bonnett in 1988. He started 30th when only 21 
drivers pitted on the front straight. 
</P>
<P>
	With rain washing away top 25 qualifying Friday, the entire  
field will be determined Saturday in a single round of time trials, 
putting even more pressure on everyone. 
</P>
<P>
	``With two pit roads at Rockingham, you want to avoid that back  
pit like the plague,'' Jeremy Mayfield said. ``The guys who usually 
end up on the front are probably going to end up in front anyway. 
The guys who usually end up on the back are probably going to end 
up on the back. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tough situation is where you end up with just a little  
practice time Saturday. You're trying to set up for the race and 
set up for qualifying at the same time. You have to focus on 
qualifying to get one of these frontstretch pits, but you have to 
work on the race as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Andrews, Mayfield's crew chief, looked at the rain and  
said, ``No matter what the weather, some weeks 30 minutes of 
practice is more than enough. Other weeks, you can't get enough no 
matter how many hours you have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Winston Cup drivers did get in their full two hours of  
practice before the rain began Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayfield, who finished 20th in the season-opening Daytona 500,  
was fastest at 156.965 mph, followed by Mike Skinner at 156.870, 
Daytona winner Jeff Gordon at 156.743, Ward Burton at 156.075, Dale 
Jarrett at 155.962, Sterling Marlin at 155.895 and Mark Martin at 
155.836. 
</P>
<P>
	John Andretti, whose engine failure relegated him to last place  
at Daytona, was frustrated after posting a speed of 154.618. 
</P>
<P>
	``With so little practice time, you don't have much time to  
experiment,'' he said. ``You have to go with what you think is 
going to work, and it's going to be tough to experiment a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robbie Loomis, Andretti's crew chief, tried to be philosophical.  
</P>
<P>
	``Over the years, we've been through rain, sleet, snow, high  
temperatures, unbearable humidity, hurricanes twice. Until they 
start building these race tracks in climate-controlled, enclosed 
buildings, that's just another one of the factors we face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The forecast called for the rain and accompanying snow flurries  
to end by midmorning Saturday, with only the cold temperatures -- 
highs in the low 40s -- remaining.

<HEADLINE> First Union May Cut 7,150 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- In yet another sign that U.S. banks are  
anticipating slower growth, First Union Corp. confirmed Friday it 
may eliminate as many as 7,150 jobs, or 10 percent of its work 
force, to cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
	First Union spokesman Jeep Bryant said the bank, the nation's  
sixth-largest, should officially decide on the number of job losses 
by mid-March. 
</P>
<P>
	The moves come at a time when bank profits are expected to slow  
after several years of strong growth. 
</P>
<P>
	``While I wouldn't ever say layoffs are a good thing, it's  
always a good idea to do a better job of managing your expenses,'' 
said analyst Tom McCandless of CIBC Oppenheimer in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	On the news, First Union stock edged up 6 1/4 cents to close at  
$52.31 1/4 a share on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	First Union executives told Wall Street analysts Thursday that  
it would begin cutting jobs following a detailed assessment of its 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	McCandless, who listened in on the briefing, said he has argued  
for months that First Union was facing an expense problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``They seem to have stumbled on it in the last three weeks,'' he  
said. ``They are now targeting non-revenue producing units and 
non-strategic areas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts expect the job cuts to be concentrated in units that  
generate little revenue but have become more costly to operate 
after a series of recent mergers. Many branch employees could lose 
jobs, for example, as more and more transactions are handled by 
automatic teller machines. 
</P>
<P>
	First Union employs 71,490 people nationwide. As early as Feb.  
5, the bank said it was planning job cuts companywide and seeking 
other ways to trim expenses. It isn't the only large bank faced 
with the problem of declining profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the San Francisco Chronicle reported BankAmerica  
planned to reduce its global work force by about 10 percent, or 
18,000 positions, over the next three or four years. The bank has 
refused to confirm the number of jobs it expects to cut. 
</P>
<P>
	BankAmerica, which is the largest bank in the U.S., is also  
based in Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had several fat years now, and the last wave of brutal  
cost-cutting ended in 1995,'' Sean Ryan, a banking analyst at Bear, 
Stearns &AMP; Co., told The Wall Street Journal in a story published 
Friday. ``It's probably time for a number of banks to circle back 
and look at their cost structures.''

<HEADLINE>  Walker Says He May Leave Rockies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Larry Walker had everybody's attention  
Friday, and it had nothing to do with his early spring-training 
arrival aboard a purple Harley-Davidson that could be heard five 
blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker, the reigning NL batting champion, said he won't hesitate  
to leave Colorado if the Rockies don't sign him to a long-term 
contract consistent with baseball's spiraling salary scale. 
</P>
<P>
	It doesn't help matters that Walker feels Colorado ownership is  
being critical of him despite a two-year span that has seen him win 
two Gold Gloves, the batting title and the National League MVP 
award. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now in my mind, with the things that have been said  
about me, I don't see myself in this clubhouse next year,'' he 
said. ``This is my last year as far as the way I see it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I get told things that are said about me. I don't have to hear  
them from the goat's mouth. ... That's the way the saying goes. I'm 
not calling (the Rockies) a goat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully something will get done. It's not like I'm throwing  
an ultimatum at them: Get it done by spring training or else I'm 
leaving. That's not the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walker, who will make $5.075 million in the final year of a  
five-year contract, said he is disappointed in both his agents and 
the owners for not getting a deal done sooner. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he will break off contract talks if an agreement is  
not finalized by Colorado's season-opener on April 4. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been here four years now and I like it here,'' he said.  
``That hasn't changed at all. But I'm capable of playing elsewhere. 
I can hit (outside) Coors Field. I've hit at other places, and I've 
proven that, so I'm not afraid to go anywhere else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado owner Jerry McMorris could not be immediately reached  
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he would not mention specific numbers, the 32-year-old  
Walker said he wants to play until he's 40, and he would like this 
to be the last contract of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Given that mathematical outline, the Rockies likely will have to  
be somewhere in the neighborhood of the six-year, $80 million 
contract the Anaheim Angels gave free-agent first baseman Mo Vaughn 
or the seven-year, $91 million deal the New York Mets needed to 
re-sign catcher Mike Piazza. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a professional and it's his time,'' Rockies manager Jim  
Leyland said. ``It's his time to take advantage of all the great 
things he's done on the baseball field. That's the way the system 
is. More power to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walker, who arrived at spring training five days early, followed  
his 1997 MVP season by hitting .366 with 23 homers and 67 RBIs last 
year. He also won his fourth career Gold Glove and played in his 
third All-Star Game. 
</P>
<P>
	The strong numbers prompted the Rockies to offer Walker a  
four-year, $32 million extension in November, but Walker declined. 
He then watched as Vaughn, Piazza and Dodgers pitcher Kevin Brown 
set a gaudy new precedent. Brown received a seven-year, $105 
million contract that included charter flights for his family to 
fly from Georgia to Los Angeles during the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Making $5 million this year is a lot of money right now,''  
Walker said. ``The minimum's a lot of money. Guys making $200,000. 
You ask any family in the country and the majority of them are 
going to say that's ridiculous. That's three, four, five years work 
for some people. Other people, it's more. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a market that's been set for somebody of my standard.  
We all know where that's at. We've seen it with the contracts that 
have been going out this year. It's not something I have to really 
spell out. You look in the paper. You look at other contracts and 
you figure out where I'm at. We have yet to get there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The swelling free-agent market is just one bargaining chip in  
Walker's favor. Taking a page from former Montreal teammate Tim 
Wallach, Walker worked out fastidiously this winter and appears 
leaner and stronger than in previous years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess I don't want to read about how I'm a big fat tub of  
goo lying around doing nothing,'' Walker said. ``It was fun working 
out. You feel better about yourself. I don't think it's something I 
have to do, but it's something that's fun and it's good for me, so 
why not do it?''

<HEADLINE> NEC To Cut 15,000 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- NEC Corp., Japan's biggest computer maker, will cut  
15,000 jobs, or 9.7 percent of its work force, over the next three 
years as it struggles to recover from slumping sales and massive 
losses at its Packard Bell division. About 6,000 of the job cuts 
will be outside Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	NEC also disclosed today it expects to lose $1.25 billion this  
year and that it was cutting executives' salaries and reducing 
spending on research and development. 
</P>
<P>
	President Hisashi Kaneko will step down, though he denied his  
resignation was an admission of responsibility for the poor 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Koji Nishigaki, currently a managing director, will take over as  
president on March 26. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's prolonged recession, a rising yen and Asia's economic  
crisis have battered NEC's profits. A $500 million loss at NEC's 
Packard Bell division in 1998 was also a huge blow. 
</P>
<P>
	NEC said it expects a group net loss of 150 billion yen, or  
$1.25 billion, this year compared to its previous forecast of a net 
loss of 35 billion yen, or $292 million. NEC earned 40.51 billion 
yen last year. 
</P>
<P>
	NEC group companies will cut 9,000 jobs in Japan over the next  
three years and 6,000 jobs overseas. NEC and its 130 subsidiaries 
employ 155,000 people worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The company will reduce executives' salaries by between 10  
percent and 20 percent, trim capital spending by 20 percent and cut 
its research and development budget by 10 percent. NEC will also 
sell real estate to pay off debt. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said Packard Bell NEC is expected to post an $80  
million loss before taxes this fiscal year because of ``intense 
price competition'' in the U.S. PC market. NEC predicted the 
division will earn a profit in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, Toshiba Corp. said a rising yen and a slump in sales  
have hurt earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	A rising yen makes Japanese products less competitive overseas.  
</P>
<P>
	Toshiba said it expects a net loss of 20 billion yen, or $167  
million, this year for its parent company, compared to an earlier 
estimate of a profit of 12 billion yen, or $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss would be the first in 48 years for the parent company,  
which doesn't include Toshiba's subsidiaries.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Redress Office Closes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government paid $1.6 billion to more than  
82,000 people of Japanese ancestry who were interned during World 
War II, the Justice Department said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The redress program was established by the Civil Liberties Act  
of 1988 to make restitution for the fundamental injustice of the 
evacuation, relocation and internment of Japanese-Americans during 
the war. The department's 10-year-old Office of Redress 
Administration closed Feb. 5. Final figures were released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a tragic chapter in the history of our nation,''  
Attorney General Janet Reno said in a statement. ``The U.S. 
government recognized the injustice of its actions during the war 
and provided a presidential apology and compensation. It was a time 
when we took away the liberty of an entire community of 
Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The office provided the full $20,000 in redress payments to  
82,219 eligible claimants, totaling more than $1.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	To be eligible, applicants had to have been alive on Aug. 10,  
1988; U.S. citizens or permanent resident aliens during internment, 
which lasted from Dec. 7, 1941 through June 30, 1946; and interned 
or otherwise deprived of liberty and property based solely on their 
Japanese ancestry. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Lann Lee, acting assistant attorney general for civil  
rights, said the department believes it located 99 percent of 
eligible claimants. 
</P>
<P>
	The 82,219 who received the full payment include 189 Japanese  
Latin Americans who had residency or citizenship in the United 
States here during the internment period. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the 82,219 individuals, the office paid $5,000  
apiece to 145 Japanese Latin Americans who were deported from their 
homes in Latin America during World War II to internment camps in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department said that if Congress approves its  
request for additional funds, the government will make payments to 
nearly 400 more Japanese Latin Americans who qualify for the 
smaller awards and to any remaining people eligible for the full 
restitution.

<HEADLINE> Jury Awards $58.5M in Air Bag Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler vowed to appeal a $58.5  
million verdict in a class-action lawsuit filed by a woman whose 
hand was burned when her car's air bag inflated in an accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``Holding DaimlerChrysler liable in this case is like holding  
the manufacturer of a bulletproof vest responsible because their 
product saved someone's life but resulted in a few bruised ribs,'' 
Karl Lukens, an attorney for the automaker, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Court of Common Pleas jury awarded $730 to each of 75,000  
plaintiffs from Pennsylvania. The amount represents the cost of 
buying safer air bags. The jury also awarded $3.8 million in 
punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
	The damages cover late 1988, 1989 and 1990 Chrysler vehicles  
that have driver's-side air bags with vents, which release hot gas 
to allow the air bag to deflate rapidly after it inflates. 
</P>
<P>
	Plaintiffs' attorney Martin D'Urso said the vents were placed  
too close to the normal hand positions on the steering wheel. 
</P>
<P>
	``The steering wheel induces the driver to put his or her hands  
in the precise location that they are most likely to be burned in 
the event of an air bag deployment,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Lukens said none of DaimlerChrysler's tests or tests by  
the air bag maker revealed any problems with the location of the 
vents. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 14 of the 75,000 people had experiences similar to Louise  
Crawley, whose 1992 accident in a 1989 Chrysler LeBaron initiated 
the lawsuit, Lukens said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ten years ago, we would have received a thank-you note from a  
customer for the air bag having saved her life,'' he said. ``Today, 
we get slapped with a multimillion-dollar verdict. That is the 
nature of our out-of-control legal system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Daniel Hensell, who treated Mrs. Crawley, testified that she  
suffered a second-degree burn on her left wrist. 
</P>
<P>
	The judgment was just the latest against the company involving  
air bags. A federal jury in New York in December ordered 
DaimlerChrysler to pay $750,000 to a family of a 5-year-old boy 
killed by an air bag. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to the company's merger in November with Daimler-Benz AG,  
Chrysler and the parents of a 5-year-old Nashville, Tenn., girl 
killed when a minivan air bag deployed reached an out-of-court 
settlement.

<TEXT>
<P>
	Now that Roger Clemens is with the Yankees, Curt Schilling says  
he wouldn't be surprised if he's the next strikeout king on the 
move. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to be here and contend on this club,'' the Philadelphia  
Phillies pitcher said. ``If that's not going to happen in the 
immediate future and they move me to a club that is contending, 
then I would see if we can work something out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling, who last year became only the fifth pitcher with 300  
strikeouts in consecutive seasons, said he doesn't expect to remain 
with the Phillies for the entire season and that he would consider 
waiving his no-trade clause. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand a lot of the reasons why he would think the grass  
is greener someplace else,'' general manager Ed Wade said. ``That 
said, our position is that he's here. I've told people we're not 
moving him. For the whole season? I can't answer that, but our 
desire is to build around him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling thinks the situation could change as the July 31 trade  
deadline approaches. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the right package of players came up, why wouldn't they  
move me?'' he asked. ``They're putting a team on the field now that 
is close to being set with a couple pieces missing. If they can 
fill those couple pieces by dealing me, then maybe they'll do it. 
If a situation would present itself where I would go to a team that 
had a real legitimate chance to play in October -- and it wasn't 
this club -- then I would listen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone already has worked out the  
playoff picture and the first Yankees-Dodgers World Series since 
1981. 
</P>
<P>
	``They'll need Roger when they play us in the Fall Classic in  
October,'' Malone said. ``It'll be fun. It will be nice to see 
Kevin Brown and Roger Clemens matched up in October.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With much of baseball focusing on Brown and his record $105  
million, seven-year contract, the pitcher worked out at spring 
training with the Dodgers for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't made a lot of friends and I don't think people are  
going to take it easy on us,'' Malone said. ``We'll have to step it 
up a notch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moises Alou, however, will be taking it slow. The Astros left  
fielder injured a knee while working out in the Dominican Republic 
and will have an MRI performed in Houston on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There doesn't appear to be any structural damage, which is  
good news, but we don't know the extent of it until he gets the 
tests,'' general manager Gerry Hunsicker said. ``He can put weight 
on it, which is also a good sign.'' 
</P>

	-- Blue Jays pitcher Paul Quantrill, who injured himself  
snowmobiling, reworked his contract, which called for a $1.4 
million salary. The guarantee was reduced to $500,000, but he can 
earn the entire amount depending on when he's back on the active 
25-man roster. There are also performance bonuses and options for 
2000 (about $1.8 million) and 2001 ($2.1 million) that become 
guaranteed depending on how many games he pitches. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Rockies have signed pitcher Jamey Wright and shortstop  
Neifi Perez to one-year contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright, 24, received a 56 percent raise from $240,000 in 1998 to  
$375,000 in 1999. Terms of Perez's contract were not disclosed.

<HEADLINE> Gore Seeks Bonds With Labor Groups </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore, trying to seal  
up a critical Democratic constituency, sought organized labor's 
support Friday while papering over their differences concerning his 
free-trade policies. 
</P>
<P>
	``You better believe if ... I run for the presidency in 2000, I  
would certainly want the support of organized labor,'' said Gore, 
who has not yet formally announced his intention to seek his 
party's nomination. He made the remarks on the final day of a 
four-day AFL-CIO convention in a resort here. 
</P>
<P>
	Federation President John Sweeney called Gore ``a friend for  
working people'' at a joint news conference with the vice 
president. Sweeney did not host a similar event when Gore's only 
announced rival, former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, addressed 
the group Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley had hoped to take advantage of disagreements between  
Gore and some AFL-CIO affiliates, particularly steel workers and 
other industrial unions, over his free-trade and global warming 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Bradley left some union bosses impressed, many party and  
union officials say they believe Gore will eventually get the 
AFL-CIO endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Friday, the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce  
addressed the AFL-CIO for the first time, saying unions and 
business should unite against excessive environmental rules that 
``spell disaster for good-paying American manufacturing jobs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There is much that binds employers and employees together,''  
Thomas J. Donohue told the AFL-CIO executive committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wall Street and Main Street are becoming the same street,'' he  
said in a text of his speech delivered behind closed doors. The 
Associated Press obtained a copy of his remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	Donohue said the chamber will continue to clash with unions over  
many issues but also will look for common ground on issues such as 
transportation, health care, pensions and national security. 
Business and labor could fight together against the global warming 
treaty and excessive environmental regulations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	His comments underscore a division between Gore and the  
otherwise friendly labor group. Some AFL-CIO affiliates are 
concerned about Gore's environmental record and the global warming 
treaty, while others disagree with his trade policies. 
</P>
<P>
	In his news conference, Gore offered little to his free-trade  
critics, saying he would never ask labor to sacrifice its 
principles, and ``I know they would not ask me to do that either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He strongly embraced the AFL-CIO's top issue of the year:  
protecting the rights of workers to unionize. He promised ``to 
strengthen the rights of workers in America, which is basically a 
fundamental human right,'' and reiterated the administration's 
promise to veto ``anti-worker legislation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Gore did not provide specifics about what laws or rules need  
to be changed to crack down on businesses that retaliate against 
workers who unionize. 
</P>
<P>
	He also promised to join with the unions to work on issues they  
share with the Clinton administration, including raising the 
minimum wage, improving health-care coverage, saving Social 
Security, and increasing the budgets of the National Labor 
Relations Board and the Occupational Health and Safety 
Administration.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Would Lead Any NATO Airstrike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. military would take the lead in any  
initial NATO airstrikes on Serb targets in and around Kosovo, 
battering air defense sites, radar facilities and command posts 
with up to 80 sea-launched Tomahawk cruise missiles, Pentagon 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	The allies were giving a defiant Yugoslav President Slobodan  
Milosevic one last chance today to make peace with ethnic Albanians 
and avoid military action by agreeing to self-rule for the Serb 
province and accepting 28,000 NATO peacekeeping troops, including 
up to 4,000 Americans, to enforce the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton said Friday he had ordered U.S. planes to be  
ready for military action, and Army Gen. Wesley Clark, the supreme 
NATO commander in Europe, suggested that Serb targets already were 
in sight. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are many different assets in Yugoslavia which are  
vulnerable,'' Clark told CNN. ``We're very much aware of what these 
assets are and where they are.'' He would not identify the targets. 
</P>
<P>
	If there is an agreement, 1,855 Marines would join a  
7,000-strong NATO enabling force that would move through Greece and 
Macedonia into Kosovo almost immediately, U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Within a few weeks or months, about 4,000 U.S. Army troops would  
replace the Marines as the NATO peacekeeping force grows to about 
28,000, with Britain contributing up to 8,000. France, Germany and 
Italy also would patrol sectors of Kosovo with troops. 
</P>
<P>
	If military action is required, there is enough NATO firepower --  
460 aircraft -- in place for a broad attack. But only a limited 
first strike is planned -- Tomahawks fired from the USS Enterprise 
and other ships moving from the Mediterranean toward the Aegean 
Sea, Pentagon officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack would most likely come at night, when the missiles  
are harder to see, although they can be launched in daylight 
without risk to U.S. forces because the missiles' range is about 
700 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	After Serb air defense missile batteries, radar sites, command  
and control centers and key barracks are smashed, a second wave 
would target airfields, military warehouses and tank depots, said 
Pentagon officials, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Six B-52 bombers, among more than 50 U.S. warplanes ordered  
deployed to the region this weekend, were to leave their Louisiana 
base this afternoon for London. 
</P>
<P>
	Several C-17 cargo planes left Friday for the region, carrying  
pilots and support personnel for 12 radar-evading F-117 stealth 
fighters. The F-117s were to fly to Europe over the weekend, as 
were more than two dozen refueling tankers.

<HEADLINE> First Union May Cut 7,150 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- In yet another sign that U.S. banks are  
anticipating slower growth, First Union Corp. confirmed Friday it 
may eliminate as many as 7,150 jobs, or 10 percent of its work 
force, to cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
	First Union spokesman Jeep Bryant said the bank, the nation's  
sixth-largest, should officially decide on the number of job losses 
by mid-March. 
</P>
<P>
	The moves come at a time when bank profits are expected to slow  
after several years of strong growth. 
</P>
<P>
	``While I wouldn't ever say layoffs are a good thing, it's  
always a good idea to do a better job of managing your expenses,'' 
said analyst Tom McCandless of CIBC Oppenheimer in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	On the news, First Union stock edged up 6 1/4 cents to close at  
$52.31 1/4 a share on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	First Union executives told Wall Street analysts Thursday that  
it would begin cutting jobs following a detailed assessment of its 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	McCandless, who listened in on the briefing, said he has argued  
for months that First Union was facing an expense problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``They seem to have stumbled on it in the last three weeks,'' he  
said. ``They are now targeting non-revenue producing units and 
non-strategic areas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts expect the job cuts to be concentrated in units that  
generate little revenue but have become more costly to operate 
after a series of recent mergers. Many branch employees could lose 
jobs, for example, as more and more transactions are handled by 
automatic teller machines. 
</P>
<P>
	First Union employs 71,490 people nationwide. As early as Feb.  
5, the bank said it was planning job cuts companywide and seeking 
other ways to trim expenses. It isn't the only large bank faced 
with the problem of declining profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the San Francisco Chronicle reported BankAmerica  
planned to reduce its global work force by about 10 percent, or 
18,000 positions, over the next three or four years. The bank has 
refused to confirm the number of jobs it expects to cut. 
</P>
<P>
	BankAmerica, which is the largest bank in the U.S., is also  
based in Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had several fat years now, and the last wave of brutal  
cost-cutting ended in 1995,'' Sean Ryan, a banking analyst at Bear, 
Stearns &AMP; Co., told The Wall Street Journal in a story published 
Friday. ``It's probably time for a number of banks to circle back 
and look at their cost structures.''

<HEADLINE> Yanks Make Steal of a Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Sports Analysis    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The loudest complaints came from New Yorkers.  
</P>
<P>
	``I HATE the trade,'' shouted one caller to WFAN, the city's  
all-sports radio station. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why do we need him?'' demanded another.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm ashamed to be a Yankees fan,'' snapped a third.  
</P>
<P>
	OK, try to forget that Roger Clemens just won his record fifth  
Cy Young Award. Or that he's the first pitcher to lead the league 
in wins, ERA and strikeouts for two straight years since Lefty 
Grove in 1930-31. Or that he's the next Nolan Ryan, a physical 
marvel who seemed to get better with age. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the trade that sent Clemens from the Toronto Blue Jays  
to the World Series champions is not about The Rocket. Maybe it is 
outside New York, where most fans think it's unfair that the 
fat-cat Yankees were able to land him. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, it's about David Wells.  
</P>
<P>
	He was their very own, highly imperfect Mr. Perfection.  
</P>
<P>
	He was the guy who once wore a Babe Ruth cap to the mound. The  
tattooed brawler who threatened to knock out George Steinbrenner. 
The ace who embraced Yankees tradition by day. The big boy with the 
big gut who got toasted on the town by night. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the pinstriped fabric, for sure.  
</P>
<P>
	To his fans, Boomer was a role model, a roly-poly one at that.  
</P>
<P>
	And that's why in New York, at least, this trade will be debated  
with hearts not heads. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens is better, no doubt. A first-ballot Hall of Famer, still  
one of the greatest pitchers in history. 
</P>
<P>
	But Wells, coming off the greatest season of his life, was one  
of them, someone a fan from the Bronx sitting in the upper deck 
could identify with -- a regular guy, albeit a millionaire. And 
there aren't many like him. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there's this stat that his supporters point to: Wells is  
8-1 in 10 career postseason starts; Clemens is 1-2 in nine. 
</P>
<P>
	Truth is, the Yankees didn't really need either one of them to  
make it back to the playoffs this season. 
</P>
<P>
	But there's an old axiom in baseball, and it's correct: Better  
to trade a player one year early rather than one year late. 
</P>
<P>
	Privately, the Yankees were worried that Wells might never have  
another season like 1998. He was a constant irritant to manager Joe 
Torre. And, turning 36 in May, was not in tiptop condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens, who turns 37 in August, is one of the best-conditioned  
athletes in sports. A power pitcher, there's always a risk he could 
blow out his arm throwing a 97 mph heater -- that's what happened to 
Ryan, though not until he was 46. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens also brings with him a competitive nature that rivals  
the one that burns inside the Boss. And that attracted Steinbrenner 
even more than the stats as he tinkered with a team that won 125 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I met my match in a guy who wants to win,'' Clemens said.  
``This guy, he settles for nothing less. I enjoy that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For all he's done in his career, all Clemens wants now is a  
championship ring. He might be fired up even more if he watched the 
Super Bowl last month. John Elway was 37, too, when he won his 
first of two in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens says he's always admired the Yankees -- he often scoops a  
handful of dirt from the mound after pitching in the House that 
Ruth Built. Yet he wasn't afraid to touch off a beanbrawl with them 
last September by drilling Scott Brosius in the back. 
</P>
<P>
	It might take Yankees fans time to appreciate that, and they may  
never revel in his accomplishments as they did with Wells. Breaking 
up one of the greatest teams in baseball history is never fun -- 
remember, in fact, how long it took for New Yorkers to warm up to 
Tino Martinez after he replaced Don Mattingly. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Yankees made a steal of a deal with that one.  
</P>
<P>
	This time, they paid Clemens' price and made sure Cleveland, the  
Mets and the other contenders did not get him. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yanks will still need a lefty reliever to replace Graeme  
Lloyd, though they were able to make the trade and protect prize 
prospect Alfonso Soriano. 
</P>
<P>
	And if it's all not clear right now, it will be by Oct. 23.  
Chances are, that's the night he'll walk to the mound to start Game 
1 of the World Series. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Ratings Up for Clooney's 'ER' Exit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Actor George Clooney's low-key exit from the  
ensemble crew of ``ER'' on Thursday drew an estimated 36 million 
viewers, or roughly 15 percent more than the normal audience for 
television's top-rated program. 
</P>
<P>
	Clooney's character, Doug Ross, resigned from Chicago's Cook  
County General Hospital and said he was moving to the Pacific 
Northwest. In real life, Clooney's leaving the show to further his 
movie career but has promised to make occasional guest appearances 
on ``ER.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``ER'' had a 23.8 rating and 37 audience share, the biggest  
audience for an episode of any regular entertainment series this 
season. It was the highest-rated ``ER'' episode since the special 
live show in September 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's aggressive promotion department intentionally held down  
the pre-show hype for Thursday's episode to give viewers the 
message that the show will remain strong without Clooney. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, ``ER'' didn't get the one-time ratings jump that  
ABC's ``NYPD Blue'' did in November when actor Jimmy Smits left. 
The Nov. 24 episode where Smits died saw a 34 percent ratings 
increase over a typical first-run ``NYPD Blue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's ``ER'' script even played down Clooney's departure,  
barely featuring him in the first half and instead focusing on the 
fast-moving action of an accident scene. 
</P>
<P>
	``Keeping it low key was better for the long-term viewers of the  
series,'' said Marc Berman, an analyst for the ad buying firm 
Seltel. ``I think it was a good idea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, Fox's much-advertised claim that a two-part episode  
of ``The X-Files'' this month would reveal many of the show's 
secrets may be damaging, he said. The shows' audiences were not 
much higher than normal, and the promotion campaign may dissuade 
viewers from watching in the future, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The audience for ``ER'' is down about 9 percent this season, so  
Clooney's departure ``might have brought back some of the viewers 
who haven't been watching this year,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday night, which also featured the conclusion of the  
Stephen King miniseries, ``Storm of the Century,'' on ABC and 
``World's Most Shocking Medical Videos'' on Fox, was a good night 
for television in general. Viewership of CBS, NBC, ABC, Fox, UPN 
and the WB was up 33 percent over a typical Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the middle of television's ``sweeps'' period, where  
viewership is watched closely to set local advertising rates.

<HEADLINE> GoTo.com Files Trademark Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Search engine company GoTo.com filed a trademark  
infringement suit Thursday against Walt Disney Co. and Infoseek 
Corp., saying the new Go Network logo bears ``striking similarity'' 
to its own logo. 
</P>
<P>
	In its suit, filed in the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles,  
GoTo.com, a Pasadena, Calif.-based company which launched its 
service in December 1997, wants the court to order that the Go 
Network stop using the logo because they look similar. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although GoTo.com is a small company without the financial  
might of a company like Disney, we've invested millions of dollars 
and thousands of hours throughout the past year to get our 
trademark in front of consumers and to build brand awareness,'' 
said Jeffrey Brewer, president and CEO, in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Both companies have logos that consist of green circles on a  
yellow background with white lettering. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit was filed after discussions among the companies failed  
to secure an agreement, GoTo.com said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Go Network, a joint venture between Infoseek and Disney  
launched last month, is an Internet gateway, offering personalized 
news, entertainment and services. Using Infoseek's search 
technology, visitors will be able to search the Net as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen for Infoseek and Disney said they hadn't seen the  
complaint yet, but called it ``baseless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Disney has secured the rights to the Go Network logo, and we  
will defend our rights vigorously,'' said Rebecca Anderson, a 
spokeswoman for Disney.

<HEADLINE> Drug Prices Up for Insured Patients </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Patients and insurance companies are facing  
sticker shock as the nation's bill for prescription drugs rapidly 
jumps -- one new arthritis medicine just debuted with a 
$12,000-a-year price tag. 
</P>
<P>
	Double-digit increases in drug spending are hitting even those  
with insurance, as managed-care companies hunt ways to offset 
pricey prescriptions. One new trend: Patients who pay $5 for a 
generic drug and $10 for an older brand name are about to be 
charged $25, $30, even $50 if they want the newest, costliest 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Drugs are a hot issue for Congress, where lawmakers are  
struggling to find ways for the elderly dependent on Medicare, 
which does not pay for drugs, to get proper care. 
</P>
<P>
	But the tab affects young patients too, and it is stirring a new  
kind of drug war as insurance companies, politicians and consumers 
all demand affordable drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Spending for prescription drugs has passed $80 billion annually,  
increasing by 11 percent to 14 percent every year since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``That type of cost increase is unsustainable,'' warns Dr.  
Nicholas Hanchak of the giant insurer Aetna-U.S. Healthcare. 
</P>
<P>
	Why it is happening is complex:  
</P>
<P>
	--For some drugs, it is the genetics revolution. New therapies  
significantly are helping patients, and biotechnology is expected 
to produce up to half of new drugs in coming years. But genetically 
engineering drugs or growing them from living organisms takes more 
time, money and expertise -- even revamped factories -- than 
old-fashioned chemical drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some real hard decisions yet to be made. We can do  
more (scientifically) than perhaps we can afford,'' said David 
Kreling, a University of Wisconsin pharmacist who is studying drug 
spending for the Kaiser Family Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look at where the science is. ... This country has to figure a  
way for most people to gain access to these developments,'' added 
Peggy Phillips of Immunex Corp., which created Enbrel for 
rheumatoid arthritis and defends its $12,000 price tag because it 
is expensive to make and helps patients who failed alternative 
therapies. 
</P>
<P>
	--Increased consumer use is fueling spending. Managed care  
actually gave more patients access to drugs, which are cheaper than 
surgery or hospitalization. An aging population uses more medicine, 
and more new drugs are hitting the market, always pricier because 
they have no generic competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Plus, insurers complain that drug makers' $1.3 billion in flashy  
advertising is prompting unprecedented consumer demand for new 
brands that often work no better than older, cheaper drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	--For other drugs, consumer advocates cry price-gouging. Rep. Tom  
Allen, D-Maine, found that uninsured senior citizens pay over twice 
as much for prescriptions than ``bulk buyers'' such as the 
Veterans' Administration or HMOs -- or even Canadians. Indeed, 
seniors in Maine and Minnesota regularly travel to Canada by the 
busload to fill prescriptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Take a month's supply of cholesterol-lowering Zocor. HMOs and  
the VA pay $43; Canada's retail price is $44; but full retail price 
for uninsured Americans is $104. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen this week proposed legislation to let Medicare patients  
buy drugs at the government's ``bulk buyer'' price. 
</P>
<P>
	Why, asks the advocacy group Public Citizen, are U.S. prices  
often twice as high as drugs in Britain and Europe? The average 
retail price of the antidepressant Prozac abroad is $34 a month, 
but $72 here; the antipsychotic Clozaril is $111 abroad but $317 
here. 
</P>
<P>
	Those countries impose price controls, which drug makers here  
fight strenuously. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the drug industry is among the world's most profitable.  
Large companies have profit margins well over 30 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But it also is risky: Four of every five experimental drugs  
tested in humans fail. It takes new companies years to begin 
earning profits -- Immunex has not yet. 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 percent of pharmaceutical revenue is reinvested toward  
new medicines, well above the average 4 percent returned to 
research and development by all other industries, said industry 
spokesman Jeff Trewhitt. This year, such R&AMP;D will hit $24 billion, 
higher than the entire budget of the National Institutes of Health. 
</P>
<P>
	Any legislation curbing prices -- like Allen's -- also would curb  
vital research, Trewhitt contends. His bottom line: Prices 
``reflect the cost of new, cutting-edge technology.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So what is next? Expect insurance companies to raise co-payments  
for new, pricey drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Drug makers are providing some free or subsidized medicine to  
the uninsured poor. Immunex, for instance, has donated $7 million 
of Enbrel. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors and insurers will become more choosy about which  
patients really need super-expensive drugs: Give a generic 
painkiller that costs pennies-a-pill to most arthritis patients, 
for example, but let those with ulcers try a new $2.40-a-pill 
medicine that is supposed to be more stomach-friendly.

<HEADLINE> NASCAR Rockingham Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKINGHAM, N.C. (AP) -- The big controversy that came out of the  
season-opening Daytona 500 was whether Kenny Irwin hit teammate 
Dale Jarrett before Jarrett spun and ignited a 13-car crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Irwin went on to a third-place finish, while Jarrett wound up  
37th. 
</P>
<P>
	After the race, Jarrett became irate when reporters repeatedly  
asked him if there was contact between the two Robert Yates Fords. 
Irwin was apologetic, but said he was uncertain if he had hit his 
teammate or simply taken the air off his rear spoiler, making 
Jarrett's car harder to handle. 
</P>
<P>
	``The worst thing about the whole situation is Kenny is not  
getting to enjoy his best run as a Winston Cup driver,'' said 
Jarrett, considerably calmer on Friday at North Carolina Speedway. 
``He did a tremendous job and put himself in a position to win the 
Daytona 500 and people aren't letting him enjoy that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett was relaxing in his motorhome while rain fell outside  
that postponed the opening round of time trials for Sunday's 
Dura-Lube/Big Kmart 400 until Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did touch, yes, that did happen,'' Jarrett said. ``But it  
was racing and it's as much my fault as anybody's. I put myself in 
a position for something like that to happen, so everything is fine 
between Kenny and me. 
</P>
<P>
	``He called me Monday to see if I was all right and to talk  
about it. I was fine with everything. I knew I had gotten tapped, 
but he just happened to be the one that was there and it was going 
to happen whoever was there.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	REAL RACING: As much as Jeff Gordon enjoyed his victory in the  
Daytona 500, even the two-time defending Winston Cup champion 
admits that running well at Daytona International Speedway has 
little to do with how well you'll do at Rockingham or most of the 
other tracks in the stock car series. 
</P>
<P>
	NASCAR requires a carburetor restrictor plate be used on the  
cars in Daytona and Talladega, its longest and fastest ovals. The 
plate saps horsepower and the teams make the cars as slippery, 
aerodynamically, as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't judge anything off of Daytona,'' Gordon said.  
``You're restrictor-plate racing, you've got a superspeedway car 
and downforce means nothing compared to most of the other tracks. 
This week, downforce will mean a whole lot more for getting through 
the corners.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	SPONSOR UPDATE: Randy LaJoie's victory in the Busch Series  
season-opener last Saturday in Daytona has apparently paid off with 
a new sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Evans Restaurants, which had a one-race deal in Daytona,  
announced Friday it will become the primary sponsor for LaJoie's 
Phoenix Racing Chevrolet for the balance of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We tested the water in Daytona and found it was to our  
liking,'' said Roy Getz, vice president of marketing for the 
restaurant chain. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Bob Evans will also sponsor Shawna Robinson in the ARCA  
stock car race at Atlanta Motor Speedway on Oct. 16. Robinson drove 
a Phoenix entry in the ARCA race on Feb. 7 in Daytona, finishing 
second. 
</P>
<P>
	LaJoie, in his first season with the team owned by James Finch,  
is a two-time Busch Series champion. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	SPARKPLUGS: Jeff Gordon's accomplishments in just over six  
seasons of Winston Cup racing now include 43 victories in 190 
starts for a .226 winning percentage -- better than one of every 
five races. That's easily the best among active drivers. ... Gary 
DeHart has been named race team coordinator for Morgan-McClure 
Racing, which fields Chevys for Bobby Hamilton. DeHart, who was 
crew chief for Terry Labonte during his championship 1996 season, 
will assume those responsibilities until a crew chief is hired. 
Hamilton's former crew chief, Charley Pressley, has been released. 
... Safety equipment and apparel maker Simpson and DuPont, the 
research and technology giant, are getting together. The companies 
have combined to develop and manufacture performance apparel 
products for motorsports using a combination of Kapton, Nomex and 
Kevlar, all materials noted for their heat resistance or 
lightweight density.

<HEADLINE> Atlanta Signs Former Brave Hunter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KISSIMMEE, Fla. (AP) -- The Atlanta Braves on Friday signed first  
baseman Brian Hunter and invited him to their major league spring 
training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter, who played for the Braves from 1991-93, and the other  
position players are scheduled to report Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter, 30, batted .205 with four home runs and 13 RBIs in 62  
games for the St. Louis Cardinals last year before being released 
Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Originally selected by the Braves in the eighth round of the  
1987 June draft, Hunter also has played for the Pittsburgh Pirates, 
Cincinnati Reds and Seattle Mariners. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the Braves announced that first baseman and cleanup  
hitter Andres Galarraga will miss the season because of a cancerous 
tumor in his back.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Slow Light To a Crawl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A moonbeam zips to Earth in little more than a  
second. Scientists have managed to slow the speed of light to a 
leisurely 38 mph, a pace that would get a highway motorist pulled 
over for driving too slow. 
</P>
<P>
	Light normally moves through a vacuum at about 186,000 miles per  
second. Nothing in the universe moves faster, and Albert Einstein 
theorized that nothing ever will. But a Danish physicist and her 
collaborators trimmed that speed by a factor of 20 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have really created an optical medium with crazy, bizarre  
properties,'' said Lene Vestergaard Hau, whose team accomplished 
the feat in slowness by shooting a laser through extremely cold 
sodium atoms, which worked like ``optical molasses'' to slow the 
light. 
</P>
<P>
	While slow-speed light now is just a laboratory plaything for  
top physicists, Hau believes practical applications are not too far 
in the future. She envisions improved communications technology, 
television displays, even night-vision devices. 
</P>
<P>
	The research, conducted at the Rowland Institute for Science in  
Cambridge and Harvard University and described in Thursday's issue 
of the journal Nature, isn't something that can be replicated in a 
home workshop. 
</P>
<P>
	The laggard laser moves through a high density group of atoms  
called a Bose-Einstein condensate, created when matter is cooled 
almost to absolute zero, the lowest temperature theoretically 
possible. That is 459.67 degrees below zero. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that the scientists have reduced the speed of light to 38  
mph, they believe it's possible to slow it 1,000 times further -- to 
a crawl. 
</P>
<P>
	``A human could move faster than that,'' said Stanford  
University's Steve Harris, who participated in the project. ``But a 
human couldn't move through a Bose-Einstein condensate, I'll tell 
you that.''

<HEADLINE> Ohio Set To Carry Out Execution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LUCASVILLE, Ohio (AP) -- A killer dubbed The Volunteer because of  
his desire to die rather than face life in prison awaited lethal 
injection Friday night in Ohio's first execution since 1963. 
</P>
<P>
	In the afternoon, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected an appeal from  
36-year-old Wilford Lee Berry Jr., who refused to participate in 
his lawyers' efforts to save his life. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeal, filed on behalf of his mother and sister, claimed  
that Berry is too mentally ill to decide to drop his legal 
defenses. His lawyers cited a history of suicide attempts since he 
was 9 and head injuries suffered during a beating by fellow inmates 
in a 1997 prison riot. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're obviously very disappointed that the court decided not  
to take the case,'' lawyer Jon Woodman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry was convicted with a cohort of shooting to death a  
Cleveland baker in a 1989 robbery. Berry had been hired to work as 
a handyman at the shop a few days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio, one of 38 states that have the death penalty, reinstated  
capital punishment in 1981. Since 1976, when the Supreme Court 
reauthorized the death penalty, there have been 518 executions, 18 
of them this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry was turned down for clemency Thursday by Gov. Bob Taft. He  
retained the right to change his mind up to the last minute, which 
would allow him to begin an appeal process. However, he told a 
lawyer for the governor this week that he still wished to die.

<HEADLINE> Detroit School Plan Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- For years, the Detroit school district has been  
like the straight-D student who always promises to do better on the 
next homework assignment, then turns it in late and half-done. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Gov. John Engler is vowing to change that by asking the  
Legislature to abolish the elected school board and give Mayor 
Dennis Archer the power to appoint a new one. 
</P>
<P>
	Though a poll shows about half the city's residents support the  
idea, the plan has outraged many in Detroit who see a white 
governor and mostly white Legislature trying to oust people elected 
by a predominantly black city. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of parents have shown up at community forums and  
committee hearings to oppose the plan. The local NAACP has come out 
against it. 
</P>
<P>
	``How dare you take away our rights as black people to vote,''  
Helen Moore, a Detroit parent and school activist, told a state 
Senate committee Wednesday. ``We can solve our own problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Caught in the middle is Archer, a black man who has been accused  
by some residents over the years of not being ``black enough'' and 
of working too closely with interests outside the city. 
</P>
<P>
	He has said that he doesn't like the governor's idea but that it  
will probably happen anyway, and he will do what he can to shape 
the legislation so that it accomplishes such things as reducing 
class size and bringing back summer school. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will insist that the terms of the legislation go far beyond  
the political substitution of one board for another. I will insist 
on real change and real benefits for the children of Detroit,'' 
Archer, himself a former teacher, said recently. 
</P>
<P>
	No one disputes that the schools in this impoverished city of 1  
million people, three-quarters of them black, have problems. The 
dropout rate was 26.4 percent in 1997, the four-year graduation 
rate a dismal 29.7 percent. The district has 180,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who manage to graduate often don't have much to show for  
it. One Detroit job training program, Focus:HOPE, said two out of 
three graduates of Detroit high schools who took an entrance exam 
for one program could not read or do math at an eighth-grade level. 
</P>
<P>
	Engler's proposal is similar what has been done in Chicago,  
Cleveland and elsewhere. The appointed board would run the schools 
for at least five years, at which point the public could hold a 
referendum on the setup. 
</P>
<P>
	``Time and again, I was told: `Butt out, send more money, wait  
until we implement our new plan, just give us a little more time.' 
The bottom line: eight years of excuses to me, preceded by decades 
of excuses to the people of Detroit,'' the governor said recently. 
</P>
<P>
	Engler said an appointed board could make the hard decisions an  
elected school board cannot: ``You need a board that puts kids 
first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He has said among other things that he wants the school system  
to take the ``fluff'' out of the curriculum and get back to basics. 
</P>
<P>
	Some residents are deeply distrustful. They see Engler's plan as  
an attempt not only to run the education of their children but to 
take over a business with 20,000 jobs and billions to spend. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all know racism is alive and well, and it is definitely  
alive in that state Legislature,'' said Marie Thornton, a parent. 
``This has nothing to do with the education of little black kids. 
This is about revenue. They're just using our kids for excuses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Engler said there is no racism behind the plan, and noted that  
real control of the schools would be in the hands of Detroit's 
mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	The elected school board is, of course, deeply opposed. It has  
come up with its own set of ideas, such as establishing 20 schools 
just for troublemakers, asking parents to volunteer a half-day per 
month, requiring school uniforms, and using students to clean 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	``At any point you can recall us and throw us out,'' Board  
President Darryl Redmond said at a recent meeting. ``We don't need 
anybody to come in here and tell us what to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	William Beckham, the head of a panel that spent four months  
analyzing the district, said Engler's plan could remove many 
distractions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every two years, there's a political trauma'' because of the  
elections, Beckham said, and the result is a cycle: ideas are 
debated, half-used, then thrown out by a new board two years later. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can a publicly elected board really sustain reform? I haven't  
seen it yet,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Weak Demand Hurts Wheat, Soybeans  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Soybean futures prices fell to new lows Friday on the Chicago  
Board of Trade, joining wheat in what has been an extended decline 
tied to weak export business and rising world inventories. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, orange juice and silver futures rose sharply.  
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans fell to their lowest since October 1986 on expectations  
Brazil will harvest a near-record crop, bringing competing supplies 
to market at a time when demand for vegetable oils has sunk to new 
lows. Soybeans are processed into soybean oil and soybean meal. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean exports last week were nearly 50 percent below levels of  
the year ago, according to the latest government figures, as demand 
from the important Asian region shows no signs of improving. 
</P>
<P>
	Market participants are especially concerned about predictions  
U.S. farmers this spring, faced with few choices in what to plant, 
will add to record acreage that produced a huge crop last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat remained under pressure from weak demand for U.S. grain,  
which has caused inventories to jump to their highest in nearly 12 
years. Investors believe prices must go lower to make the grain 
more competitive against Australian and European supplies and more 
attractive as an animal feed. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for March delivery fell 3 1/4 cents to $2.54 3/4 a bushel; March  
soybeans fell 3 3/4 cents to $4.78 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Frozen, concentrated orange juice futures staged a technical  
recovery on the Board of Trade of the City of New York after days 
of losses tied to the government's unexpected increase last week in 
the size of the Florida crop. 
</P>
<P>
	Mild winter weather boosted the size of that state's crop, which  
accounts for about 90 percent of the nation's production. But 
market participants bid futures prices up on Friday after the 
National Weather Service predicted Florida would experience a mild 
cold snap. 
</P>
<P>
	March orange juice rose 4.5 cents to 90.75 cents a gallon.  
</P>
<P>
	Silver futures jumped on the New York Mercantile Exchange amid  
heavy dealer buying during a time when inventories appear to be 
dwindling. 
</P>
<P>
	March silver rose 12 cents to $5.60 an ounce.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Pardons First Black Cadet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton posthumously pardoned on  
Friday the first black graduate of West Point, whose military 
career was tarnished by a racially motivated discharge. 
</P>
<P>
	``This good man has now completely recovered his good name,''  
Clinton said during a ceremony with 17 descendants of Henry O. 
Flipper in the Roosevelt Room of the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	The president lamented that the pardon was a century overdue,  
and said, ``The special quality of American freedom isn't always 
extended to all Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he urged Flipper's family and a group of past and present  
military leaders, including retired Gen. Colin Powell, to take 
heart in Flipper's story. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a day of affirmation,'' Clinton said. ``It teaches us  
that although the wheels of justice turn slowly at times, still 
they turn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. William C. King, Flipper's great-nephew, told the president  
that his family harbored no rancor for the system that took 117 
years to clear his ancestor's good name. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been a long journey. And I don't think you can find a  
bit of anger in anyone in the family,'' King said. ``We learned, as 
was painfully revealed to Lieutenant Flipper, that anger would not 
gain you anything, that you needed to persevere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, the descendants of Flipper, who died in 1940, gathered  
at the Pentagon for a ceremony in honor of him. ``We are grateful 
to God that this day has come,'' said Robert Alexander Jr., 
Flipper's great-grandnephew. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's pardon reversed an 1882 decision by President Chester  
A. Arthur to give Flipper the high punishment of a dishonorable 
discharge. Flipper was convicted of conduct unbecoming an officer, 
but the Army's judge advocate general later concluded he had been 
singled out because of his race. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the pardon was a long time in coming, Flipper has been  
lionized for years. In 1977, his remains were reburied with full 
military honors in Thomasville, Ga., where he was born a slave, and 
Powell kept a photo of him on his wall while serving as chairman of 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like the rest of the family, I'm relieved that this has come  
full circle,'' said King. King's mother, Irsle Flipper King, was 
instrumental in beginning the push for Flipper's pardon in the 
1950s. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very exciting because he's finally getting the honor he  
deserves,'' said one of Flipper's youngest relatives, his 
great-great-grandniece Blake Alexander, 9. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are all very happy and very proud,'' said William Davis, a  
great-grandnephew. Flipper never married and had no children. 
</P>
<P>
	Flipper entered West Point in 1873. Ostracized by white cadets,  
he dedicated himself to hard work, graduating 50th in a class of 
76. The first black commissioned officer in the regular U.S. Army, 
Flipper was assigned to Fort Sill, Okla., to the 10th Cavalry, the 
``Buffalo Soldiers,'' one of only two all-black units in the Army. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1881, his commanding officer at Fort Davis in Texas accused  
Flipper of failing to account properly for commissary money 
entrusted to him. A general court-martial acquitted Flipper of 
embezzlement but convicted him of conduct unbecoming an officer -- 
in a case the judge advocate general later concluded was racially 
motivated. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1976, the Army granted Flipper an honorable discharge, but  
only Clinton could formally overturn Arthur's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Flipper's memory is honored in his hometown, where the U.S. Post  
Office branch was recently named for him. 
</P>
<P>
	His family has no intention of moving Flipper's remains to  
Arlington National Cemetery now that he qualifies for burial there, 
said King.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton posthumously pardoned on  
Friday the first black graduate of West Point, whose military 
career was tarnished by a racially motivated discharge. 
</P>
<P>
	``This good man has now completely recovered his good name,''  
Clinton said during a ceremony with 17 descendants of Henry O. 
Flipper in the Roosevelt Room of the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	The president lamented that the pardon was a century overdue,  
and said, ``The special quality of American freedom isn't always 
extended to all Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he urged Flipper's family and a group of past and present  
military leaders, including retired Gen. Colin Powell, to take 
heart in Flipper's story. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a day of affirmation,'' Clinton said. ``It teaches us  
that although the wheels of justice turn slowly at times, still 
they turn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. William C. King, Flipper's great-nephew, told the president  
that his family harbored no rancor for the system that took 117 
years to clear his ancestor's good name. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been a long journey. And I don't think you can find a  
bit of anger in anyone in the family,'' King said. ``We learned, as 
was painfully revealed to Lieutenant Flipper, that anger would not 
gain you anything, that you needed to persevere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, the descendants of Flipper, who died in 1940, gathered  
at the Pentagon for a ceremony in honor of him. ``We are grateful 
to God that this day has come,'' said Robert Alexander Jr., 
Flipper's great-grandnephew. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's pardon reversed an 1882 decision by President Chester  
A. Arthur to give Flipper the high punishment of a dishonorable 
discharge. Flipper was convicted of conduct unbecoming an officer, 
but the Army's judge advocate general later concluded he had been 
singled out because of his race. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the pardon was a long time in coming, Flipper has been  
lionized for years. In 1977, his remains were reburied with full 
military honors in Thomasville, Ga., where he was born a slave, and 
Powell kept a photo of him on his wall while serving as chairman of 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like the rest of the family, I'm relieved that this has come  
full circle,'' said King. King's mother, Irsle Flipper King, was 
instrumental in beginning the push for Flipper's pardon in the 
1950s. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very exciting because he's finally getting the honor he  
deserves,'' said one of Flipper's youngest relatives, his 
great-great-grandniece Blake Alexander, 9. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are all very happy and very proud,'' said William Davis, a  
great-grandnephew. Flipper never married and had no children. 
</P>
<P>
	Flipper entered West Point in 1873. Ostracized by white cadets,  
he dedicated himself to hard work, graduating 50th in a class of 
76. The first black commissioned officer in the regular U.S. Army, 
Flipper was assigned to Fort Sill, Okla., to the 10th Cavalry, the 
``Buffalo Soldiers,'' one of only two all-black units in the Army. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1881, his commanding officer at Fort Davis in Texas accused  
Flipper of failing to account properly for commissary money 
entrusted to him. A general court-martial acquitted Flipper of 
embezzlement but convicted him of conduct unbecoming an officer -- 
in a case the judge advocate general later concluded was racially 
motivated. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1976, the Army granted Flipper an honorable discharge, but  
only Clinton could formally overturn Arthur's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Flipper's memory is honored in his hometown, where the U.S. Post  
Office branch was recently named for him. 
</P>
<P>
	His family has no intention of moving Flipper's remains to  
Arlington National Cemetery now that he qualifies for burial there, 
said King.

	Lawyers: DNA Links King to Killing  
</P>
<P>
	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- A stain on a shirt found in the apartment  
of dragging-death defendant John William King is the blood of 
victim James Byrd Jr., an FBI analyst testified today. The stain 
was one of several DNA samples prosecutors say link King to the 
death of Byrd, a 49-year-old black man whose body was found in 
pieces along an east Texas road last June. King, 24, faces life in 
prison or execution if convicted of murder. Shawn Berry, 24, and 
Lawrence Brewer, 31, are to be tried later.

	No Charges in Driver's Suffocation  
</P>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- No federal civil rights charges will be filed  
in the suffocation of a black motorist during a 1995 fight with 
white police from suburban Pittsburgh, a prosecutor said today. 
There was not enough evidence to support charges that officers used 
unreasonable force to subdue Jonny Gammage after a traffic stop in 
October 1995, said Bill Lan Lee, acting assistant attorney general 
for civil rights in the U.S. Justice Department.

	Disabled Allegedly Cajoled Into Sex  
</P>
<P>
	BEAUMONT, Texas (AP) -- Seven staffers at a home for the mentally  
retarded were fired after two residents in their care allegedly 
were cajoled into having sex so the workers could watch and laugh. 
The Texas Department of Human Services and the attorney general's 
office are investigating the charges at the 130-bed Beaumont Living 
Center. Officials said the seven staff members, both male and 
female, were fired when a co-worker who heard about the Feb. 6 
incident reported it.

	Milosevic Rebuffs U.S. Mediator  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan  
Milosevic has declared he would not surrender Kosovo ``even at the 
price of bombing.'' Milosevic refused to meet today with a U.S. 
envoy sent to urge him to accept NATO troops as part of a peace 
accord with ethnic Albanians. NATO has threatened to launch 
airstrikes if Serbs and ethnic Albanians fail to accept an 
internationally-sponsored peace plan by noon tomorrow (6 a.m. EST). 
Milosevic's refusal to meet Hill makes attacks more likely.

<P>
	MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton and her advisers  
are contacting dozens of political consultants, Democratic donors 
and election law attorneys in a rapidly growing effort to determine 
whether she will run for the Senate in New York. The first lady did 
some of her own research today, meeting privately in the White 
House with retiring New York Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a 
session that press secretary Marsha Berry called ``an opportunity 
to explore thoughts.''

	New Workplace Safety Rules Unveiled  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal agency has concluded that it is  
employers' responsibility to prevent on-the-job injuries to the 
neck, back and wrist. The Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration outlined ``ergonomic'' standards that would require 
employers to alter work stations, redesign facilities or change 
tools to reduce the risk of workers being injured on the job. OSHA 
says more than 647,000 Americans suffer serious injuries and 
illnesses due to musculoskeletal disorders from their jobs.

<P>
	DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -- Israel's seizure of a village in southern  
Lebanon was ``an aggressive step'' that could raise tension in the 
Middle East, a Syrian government newspaper said today. Israel 
seized the village of Arnoun late Wednesday on the edge of the 
border strip it occupies in southern Lebanon, claiming that it 
wanted to expand its self-styled ``security zone.''

	JUPITER, Fla. (AP) -- Mark McGwire will have bodyguards at spring  
training to escort him each time he goes from the clubhouse to a 
practice field. McGwire, who hit a record 70 homers last season, is 
expected to arrive late Tuesday by private jet from his home in 
California. Following his initial workout Wednesday morning, he 
will have his first news conference of the spring.

	Chirac, Clinton To Discuss Economy  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- French President Jacques Chirac is exchanging  
ideas with President Clinton at the White House on financial and 
military matters. The two leaders were meeting late this morning 
before joining officials from their governments at lunch. They 
planned a mid-afternoon news conference, Clinton's first since his 
acquittal on impeachment charges. Chirac's objective is to assure 
Clinton that even though there are disagreements between the two 
old allies on some issues, such as Iraq, they can reconcile 
differences in other areas.

	Albright To Join Kosovo Talks  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright plans to  
join Kosovo negotiations in France only hours before tommorow's 
deadline for a settlement to the yearlong war in the Serbian 
province. All week, Albright has been threatening Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic with NATO bombardment if he holds out 
against a six-nation plan for ethnic Albanian self-rule in Kosovo 
or continues his refusal to let NATO deploy peacekeepers to ensure 
the plan, once agreed to, is carried out.

	New Workplace Safety Rules Unveiled  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Later today, the Occupational Safety and  
Health Administration is expected to propose standards that could 
force employers to alter workstations, redesign facilities or 
change tools to help reduce repetitive-motion injuries and back 
strain in the workplace. The rules are intended to curb stress 
trauma cases such as carpal tunnel syndrome. According to the 
agency, more than 647,000 Americans suffer serious injuries and 
illnesses each year due to overexertion or repetitive stress on the 
job.

	Japanese Parliament OKs 1999 Budget

<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The lower house of parliament approved Japan's 1999  
national budget today, boosting spending by 5.4 percent and cutting 
taxes in hopes of jolting the economy out of its worst recession in 
decades. The $682.5 billion plan, which now goes to the upper house 
for a vote, is packaged with legislation cutting taxes by more than 
$75 billion. The plan is aimed at pumping more money into Japan's 
moribund economy, which is suffering from anemic consumer spending, 
a record-high unemployment rate and a hobbled financial system.

	New Fighting in Colombia Kills 12  
</P>
<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- At least 12 soldiers and an undetermined  
number of leftist rebels died in the first major engagement between 
government forces and Colombia's largest guerrilla band since peace 
talks began last month. Counterinsurgency troops were trying to 
locate Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) camps near the 
Venezuelan border when the fighting broke out yesterday, said the 
army's deputy commander. FARC claims it suffered 30 dead and said 
it would produce a videotape today proving the rebel death toll.

	Scientists Slow Light To a Crawl  
</P>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Scientists have managed to slow the speed of light  
to a leisurely 38 mph, a pace that would get a highway motorist 
pulled over for driving too slow. Light normally moves through a 
vacuum at about 186,000 miles per second. Nothing in the universe 
moves faster, and Albert Einstein theorized that nothing ever will. 
But a Danish physicist and her collaborators trimmed that speed by 
a factor of 20 million. The research, described in the journal 
Nature, isn't something that can be replicated in a home workshop.

	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stock prices closed lower in light trading

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Already enmeshed in a million-dollar bribery  
scandal, the group that won the 2002 Winter Olympics for Utah's 
capital was accused yesterday of failing to come up with $3 million 
in promised training assistance for U.S. winter sports athletes 
over the last decade. ``As I see it, the athletes were robbed,'' 
former U.S. Ski Association executive director Howard Peterson 
said. Peterson, part of the U.S. Olympic Committee's site-selection 
task force that reviewed American bidders in 1989, said he would 
ask the USOC to pressure Salt Lake City to pay the money now.

nation's top amateur athlete, Chamique Holdsclaw scored 25 points 
and 12 rebounds to lead No. 1 Tennessee to a 89-53 victory over 
Vanderbilt last night. Earlier in the day, Holdsclaw became the 
first female basketball player to receive the prestigious Sullivan 
Award. Holdsclaw scored 13 of the Lady Vols' first 22 points and 
had 20 by halftime as Tennessee (25-1, 13-0 Southeastern 
Conference) cruised past intrastate rival Vanderbilt (13-12, 6-7).

<HEADLINE>  Trinidad To Face Whitaker Saturday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Felix Trinidad's only appearance in Madison  
Square Garden amounted to a cameo experience that did nothing to 
enhance his reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday night, however, the unbeaten IBF welterweight  
champion gets a real opportunity to showcase his talents because 
the opponent will be Pernell Whitaker, a former champion in four 
weight divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	There are the questions of how drug and alcohol problems and a  
16-month layoff will affect the 35-year-old Whitaker. However, 
there is no question he will provide stiffer opposition than that 
put up by Troy Waters, who lasted 2:50 against Trinidad in the 
Garden in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	There also is the question of how making the 147-pound limit  
will affect Trinidad. He weighed himself at the Garden before 
Friday's weigh-in, then left to run around the arena. Trinidad 
weighed in 22 minutes after his name had been called and made the 
weight limit. Earlier, Whitaker weighed in at 147 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad's weight problem would be more serious if the weigh-in  
were the day of the fight. In this era of weighing in the day 
before the bout, boxers enter the ring several pounds above the 
limit. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of the best training camps I've ever hand,'' said  
Whitaker, who declines to discuss the problems that forced him into 
drug and alcohol rehabilitation and have kept him from fighting 
since he outpointed Andre Pestriaev on Oct. 17, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``He still a good boxer, but the drugs and alcohol have taken  
their toll,'' said Trinidad's father, also his trainer and manager. 
``But he still has pride.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whitaker is left-handed but Trinidad expects no problem.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've fought left-handers before,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Trainer Tommy Brooks thinks Whitaker has a lot more left than  
pride. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'd never think he'd been out of the gym,'' Brooks said.  
``Trinidad has a surprise coming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I would not be surprised if he comes right after me,'' said  
the 26-year-old Trinidad, a 5-1 favorite in Las Vegas. ``If he 
does, I'll be ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because of age and possible ring rust -- and Whitaker insists  
there is none -- it will be interesting to see how he holds up in 
the later rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	But that could be a bigger problem for Trinidad, who has gone  
past the fifth round only once (into the eight against Oba Carr in 
1994) since outpointing Hector Camacho in 12 rounds on Jan. 29, 
1994. He also has not fought since he knocked out Mahenge Zulu last 
April 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad's record is 33-0, with 29 knockouts. Whitaker is  
41-2-1, with 17 knockouts. 
</P>
<P>
	This will be Whitaker's third Garden appearance and his first  
since he won the WBC welterweight title on points over James 
``Buddy'' McGirt on March 6, 1993. He lost that title on a disputed 
decision to Oscar De La Hoya on April 12, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The replay of De La Hoya's split-decision win over Ike Quartey  
last Saturday will open the HBO telecast at 9:30 p.m. EST. The 
Trinidad-Whitaker fight should start between 10:30 p.m. and 10:45 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	In a fight that will not be televised, Vince Phillips (39-3, 28  
knockouts), 140 pounds, will defend the IBF junior welterweight 
title against Terronn Millett (20-1-1, 15 knockouts), 140 pounds.

<HEADLINE> Miss. Official Resigns Over Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- The City Council president resigned Friday  
after federal prosecutors accused him of arranging the firebombing 
last year of a weekly newspaper that had criticized him. 
</P>
<P>
	No immediate charges were filed against the politician, Louis  
Armstrong, who this week pleaded guilty in an unrelated bribery 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the firebombing allegations were contained in the  
criminal charges read in court Friday against Clinton Moses, the 
former Armstrong aide. 
</P>
<P>
	Moses pleaded guilty to bank robbery and to bombing the Jackson  
Advocate in January 1998. According to the charges drawn up by 
prosecutors, Armstrong paid Moses $500 to carry out the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	As for whether Armstrong will be charged, U.S. Attorney Brad  
Pigott said only that other charges in the firebombing are likely. 
</P>
<P>
	The Advocate had run stories and editorials criticizing  
Armstrong and other public officials, largely over how the council 
awarded the city's legal notices to another weekly paper. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper office was gutted when two gasoline bombs were  
thrown through a plate-glass window before dawn. The paper was 
closed and no one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Moses told prosecutors he offered his services to Armstrong  
after the councilman confided he was upset about being criticized 
in the paper. Moses said he waited until Armstrong was out of town 
to carry out the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong had been City Council president for two years and a  
council member for 14. He pleaded guilty Tuesday to conspiring to 
extort $28,500 from a topless-bar owner in exchange for a favorable 
zoning vote. He could get 30 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	He was at Moses' hearing Friday but refused to comment.

<HEADLINE> Mets Manager Looks to World Series </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. (AP) -- Bobby Valentine took one look at his  
revamped roster and set the New York Mets' objective for 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no goal to make the playoffs, I have a goal to make the  
World Series,'' the manager said Friday as the Mets welcomed 
pitchers and catchers to spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you were to ask me right now who made the playoffs last  
year I couldn't tell you, and I'm a pretty good baseball fan,'' 
Valentine said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets were one of the teams that did not make the playoffs.  
But with a club bolstered by star players, Valentine doesn't 
believe that will be the case this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that when I was hired here we weren't very good and  
they wanted to be better,'' said Valentine, entering his fourth 
season with the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the team that has been assembled and the money that's  
been spent on this team demands higher expectations and that we be 
the best team we can be. Hopefully that will be the best team that 
there is,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of that money went to securing the services of catcher Mike  
Piazza, third baseman Robin Ventura, left fielder Rickey Henderson 
and right fielder Bobby Bonilla. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlos Baerga, Bernard Gilkey and Butch Huskey, all in last  
year's opening day lineup, have been traded. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would not say that Carlos Baerga was a bad player for us,''  
Valentine said. ``I had great expectations for him this time last 
year, as I did for the left fielder (Gilkey) and the right fielder 
(Huskey).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pitchers and catchers for the Mets begin working out Saturday  
morning. Position players are scheduled to report by Feb. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	The only player absent from camp now is pitcher Jae Weong Seo.  
He is having problems obtaining a visa, general manager Steve 
Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	Seo, a Korean national, pitched 15 2-3 innings in last season's  
Florida State League playoffs and allowed just one hit in leading 
the St. Lucie Mets to the league championship. He is a spring 
training invitee for the second year. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Jae Seo was here I'd be even more excited,'' Valentine  
said. ``That's based on the playoffs, the Asian Games and his 
talent.''

<HEADLINE> Volcanic Ash May Cause Lung Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- British researchers say that ash spewing from  
a volcano on the Caribbean island of Montserrat may contain a fine 
mineral that could put residents there at a high risk of silicosis, 
a serious lung disease. 
</P>
<P>
	In a study published today in the journal Science, the  
researchers said that the ash from Montserrat's Soufriere Hills 
volcano contains harmful levels of critobalite, a silica mineral 
that is small enough to lodge in the smallest air passages of the 
lungs. 
</P>
<P>
	An accumulation of the mineral can cause thickening and  
scarring, leading to silicosis, a disease that reduces the lungs' 
ability to supply oxygen to the blood, the researchers say in the 
study. 
</P>
<P>
	Soufriere Hills volcano erupted in 1995, forcing evacuation of  
most of the 11,000 residents on the 39-square-mile island. Many 
people, however, moved to the northern part of Montserrat, an area 
relatively free of ash. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 3 1/2 years since the volcano came to life, there have been  
periods of quiet between eruptions and many people returned to 
check on property near Soufriere Hills. More than a dozen people 
who had returned to a danger area were killed in 1997 when the 
volcano suddenly erupted. 
</P>
<P>
	The study in Science suggests that even those who remained in  
the northern part of the island may suffer long-term health effects 
from the volcano's ash flows because of harmful levels of 
cristobalite. 
</P>
<P>
	Cristobalite forms inside the volcano dome, the researchers  
found, and then becomes concentrated in ash eruptions. The ash 
falls in clumps and can be sent back into the air by human 
activities, such as driving or sweeping. This increases the risk 
that residents will inhale the small cristobalite particles, the 
study found. 
</P>
<P>
	``The period after the eruption might not seem like the most  
dangerous, especially because you can't see the ash suspended in 
the air, but it does hang around for quite a long time,'' Bristol 
University researcher Stephen Sparks said in a statement. Sparks is 
a co-author of the study.

<HEADLINE> Jury Awards $58.5M in Air Bag Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler vowed to appeal a $58.5  
million verdict in a class-action lawsuit filed by a woman whose 
hand was burned when her car's air bag inflated in an accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``Holding DaimlerChrysler liable in this case is like holding  
the manufacturer of a bulletproof vest responsible because their 
product saved someone's life but resulted in a few bruised ribs,'' 
Karl Lukens, an attorney for the automaker, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Court of Common Pleas jury awarded $730 to each of 75,000  
plaintiffs from Pennsylvania. The amount represents the cost of 
buying safer air bags. The jury also awarded $3.8 million in 
punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
	The damages cover late 1988, 1989 and 1990 Chrysler vehicles  
that have driver's-side air bags with vents, which release hot gas 
to allow the air bag to deflate rapidly after it inflates. 
</P>
<P>
	Plaintiffs' attorney Martin D'Urso said the vents were placed  
too close to the normal hand positions on the steering wheel. 
</P>
<P>
	``The steering wheel induces the driver to put his or her hands  
in the precise location that they are most likely to be burned in 
the event of an air bag deployment,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Lukens said none of DaimlerChrysler's tests or tests by  
the air bag maker revealed any problems with the location of the 
vents. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 14 of the 75,000 people had experiences similar to Louise  
Crawley, whose 1992 accident in a 1989 Chrysler LeBaron initiated 
the lawsuit, Lukens said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ten years ago, we would have received a thank-you note from a  
customer for the air bag having saved her life,'' he said. ``Today, 
we get slapped with a multimillion-dollar verdict. That is the 
nature of our out-of-control legal system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Daniel Hensell, who treated Mrs. Crawley, testified that she  
suffered a second-degree burn on her left wrist. 
</P>
<P>
	The judgment was just the latest against the company involving  
air bags. A federal jury in New York in December ordered 
DaimlerChrysler to pay $750,000 to a family of a 5-year-old boy 
killed by an air bag. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to the company's merger in November with Daimler-Benz AG,  
Chrysler and the parents of a 5-year-old Nashville, Tenn., girl 
killed when a minivan air bag deployed reached an out-of-court 
settlement.

<HEADLINE> Analysis: Tax Cut To Benefit Rich </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- People with earnings above $100,000 a year  
would get over half the benefits of the Republican proposal to cut 
all income tax rates by 10 percent, according to a nonpartisan 
congressional analysis released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Joint Committee on Taxation study was circulated by  
Democrats to buttress their claim that the proposal introduced by 
House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio, is tilted too 
heavily toward the wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this is an across-the-board tax cut, then the board must  
have a lot of knotholes in it,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., 
senior Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The analysis says that in 2001, the first full year the rate cut  
would be in effect, 52.5 percent of the dollars would go to 
taxpayers with incomes over $100,000. People making between $50,000 
and $100,000 would get almost 31 percent of the tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, 48 million taxpayers -- three-quarters of them  
earning less than $20,000 a year -- would get no tax cut. However, 
most of these people now pay no federal income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Further, the 8 percent of taxpayers with incomes above $100,000  
pay two-thirds of all income taxes, an average of $41,600 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of an anticipated budget surplus estimated at $2.6  
trillion over the next decade, Republicans argue it is appropriate 
to return a portion of the money in tax cuts to the people who paid 
it. They contend Democrats are engaging in political class warfare 
to portray the cut as skewed to the rich. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the Republican Party ought to be about the  
redistribution of wealth,'' Kasich said in a telephone interview 
Friday from Iowa, where he was exploring a bid for the 2000 GOP 
presidential nomination. ``Liberals are about the redistribution of 
wealth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich added that a broad tax cut would help the U.S. economy  
continue growing while preventing use of the surplus to create more 
government programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``People shouldn't be punished for working and trying to get  
ahead. They should be rewarded for it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats such as Rangel contend that a dollar means much  
more to the people on the lower income rungs and that targeted tax 
breaks reach them best. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats also note that the working poor still pay federal  
payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare and deserve relief 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like these people do not exist to the Republicans,''  
Rangel said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Joint Committee on Taxation analysis pegs the 10-year cost  
of Kasich's tax cut at $775.7 billion. President Clinton and GOP 
leaders have agreed that 62 percent of the surplus should be 
reserved until Social Security is saved, but the president opposes 
use of so large a chunk of the remainder for a broad tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Republicans are also questioning the wisdom of pushing the  
10 percent tax rate cut, given Clinton's opposition and the charges 
that it benefits the wealthy. Many are pushing alternatives, such 
as relief from the marriage penalty, in which many two-earner 
couples pay more than if they were single. 
</P>
<P>
	The study indicates that 91.8 million taxpayers would see some  
tax reduction under the proposal, but 24.7 million would get less 
than the 10 percent promised. 
</P>
<P>
	Another 177,000 would actually see a tax increase, mainly  
because they would be subject to the alternative minimum tax 
intended to prevent taxpayers from escaping Uncle Sam because of 
deductions and credits.

<HEADLINE> New Fee Shows Up on Phone Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumers are getting hit with another new fee  
on their monthly phone bills. This one pays for the costs of 
letting customers keep their local telephone numbers after they 
switch carriers -- even though many don't have that choice now. 
</P>
<P>
	The charge, typically 50 cents a month for each phone line, pays  
for local phone companies' costs of complying with a provision in a 
1996 law. Some local phone companies began billing for the new fees 
in February, while others plan to do so over the next several 
months. Businesses also will pay a fee, which can vary by the 
services they get. 
</P>
<P>
	The charge covers the companies' cost for technical changes they  
must make that allow consumers to keep their phone numbers when 
they switch to a new local phone provider. Those changes could cost 
the industry $3 billion over five years, under one phone company 
estimate. 
</P>
<P>
	The concept of portable phone numbers is not new. For years,  
long-distance customers have been able to change their 
long-distance carriers without getting a new phone number. 
</P>
<P>
	The rationale: Consumers would be less inclined to switch to a  
new carrier -- local or long-distance -- if they had to get a new 
phone number each time. That would thwart the goal of competition. 
</P>
<P>
	But most residential customers do not have a choice of local  
telephone providers. Local phone competition that has evolved since 
the 1996 law mainly focuses on lucrative, high-volume business 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem with this charge is it's making all consumers pay  
a price for something that most of them do not have and the vast 
majority probably will not get: That is -- a choice of local phone 
companies,'' said Gene Kimmelman, co-director of the Consumers 
Union Washington office. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC views it as a ``chicken and egg'' argument about what  
should come first, said spokeswoman Liz Rose, adding that the 
agency believes local competition will eventually come to 
consumers. The bottom line: ``Owning your own telephone number is 
the key to customer choice,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications Commission last year gave phone  
companies permission to charge the new fees to recover their costs 
of providing ``number portability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At that time, the FCC said the charge could start no earlier  
than Feb. 1, 1999, and last no longer than five years. 
</P>
<P>
	New monthly fees last year began popping up on consumers' phone  
bills. Those charges came from a 1997 government overhaul of phone 
fees and from itemized charges for government-ordered subsidies 
once included in rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Like those fees, the newest charges are broken out in phone  
bills, under different names. They come in addition to the 
multitude of existing charges for federal, state or local taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Ameritech, the main local phone provider in five Midwestern  
states, is charging customers a 41 cent ``number portability 
surcharge'' per month for each line, said spokesman Marvin Wamble. 
</P>
<P>
	SBC Communications' Southwestern Bell, the main provider of  
local phone service in Texas, Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma and 
Arkansas, is charging 48 cents a line per month. SBC's local phone 
businesses serving California and Nevada are charging 50 cents a 
month per line, said SBC spokesman Selim Bingol. 
</P>
<P>
	US West plans to charge customers in its 14-state local phone  
territory 53 cents a line per month, beginning in the March billing 
cycle, said spokesman David Beigie. US West's charge reflects the 
company's technical changes to its network, which spans many rural 
areas in the West and Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC, however, is reviewing this fee to determine whether it  
is justified. 
</P>
<P>
	GTE, which provides local service in 28 states, will charge  
customers 43 cents a line. The fee will appear in bills after March 
10, and is called the ``service provider number portability fee,'' 
GTE spokesman Bob Bishop said. 
</P>
<P>
	BellSouth has not set its monthly fee yet, but spokesman Bill  
McCloskey said the company expects it to ``come in well under 50 
cents per line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic, which provides local phone service from Maine to  
Virginia, also has not determined its charges, said spokeswoman 
Susan Butta. Neither has SBC-owned Southern New England 
Telecommunications, which provides local service in Connecticut.

<HEADLINE> Confined Lobbyist Fights To Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Bruce Bereano spent his days at the Statehouse,  
lobbying lawmakers on behalf of such clients as Comcast Cablevision 
and supermarket giant Safeway. He spent his nights serving out a 
fraud conviction in a halfway house. 
</P>
<P>
	That arrangement worked for Bereano for a week -- after all, it  
allowed him to stay on the job that once earned him $1 million a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	But last week, his probation officer said letting Bereano lobby  
as part of his work-release sent the wrong message to other 
lobbyists. The officer, Renata Ramsburg, confined Bereano to the 
halfway house. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the halfway house were expected to decide Friday  
whether Bereano broke the rules of his confinement by traveling to 
the state capital to meet with lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bereano says he plans to fight the restriction.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's a lobbyist. That's what he does,'' said his lawyer,  
Joshua Treem. 
</P>
<P>
	Treem also questioned whether Ms. Ramsburg had the authority to  
impose the restriction. He said U.S. District Judge William 
Nickerson had approved Bereano's lobbying. 
</P>
<P>
	Bereano, once the highest-paid lobbyist in the state, was  
convicted in 1994 of mail fraud for sending $16,000 in phony bills 
to his lobbying clients. Many of Bereano's clients testified on his 
behalf, asking that he not be sent to prison, and stuck with him 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors also said he funneled the money through employees  
and family members to legislative candidates during the 1990 
elections, but he was never charged because the statute of 
limitations expired. 
</P>
<P>
	Nickerson originally sentenced Bereano to five years' probation.  
Bereano appealed, hoping to get the conviction overturned, but 
instead the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals ordered Nickerson to 
impose a tougher sentence, saying the judge did not follow federal 
guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, Nickerson sentenced Bereano to five months in a  
halfway house, followed by five months of home detention and three 
years probation. Now Bereano is appealing to the U.S. Supreme 
Court.

<HEADLINE>  GM Predicts Dodgers-Yankees Matchup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VERO BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Kevin Malone had a bold prediction  
Friday: the first Yankees-Dodgers World Series since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	``They'll need Roger when they play us in the Fall Classic in  
October,'' the Los Angeles general manager said. ``It'll be fun. It 
will be nice to see Kevin Brown and Roger Clemens matched up in 
October.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With much of baseball focusing on Brown and his record $105  
million, seven-year contract, the pitcher worked out at spring 
training with the Dodgers for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't made a lot of friends and I don't think people are  
going to take it easy on us,'' Malone said. ``We'll have to step it 
up a notch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Malone spent the first day of camp discussing his team's high  
hopes and responding to criticism of Brown's contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, who turns 34 next month, went 18-7 with a 2.38 ERA with  
257 strikeouts in 257 innings for San Diego last year. He is 51-26 
with a 2.33 ERA during he past three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dodgers expect Brown's work ethic and World Series  
experience to help improve the mental toughness of the team's other 
pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
	``My role hasn't changed, it's to go out and do what I can on  
the field,'' he said. ``As far as the clubhouse ... guys learn from 
each other. Everybody's got something to bring to the table.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said he's not worried about the pressure caused by the  
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always said I'm my own worst critic,'' Brown said. ``I  
don't need the press or anyone to push me. I'll do it myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As soon as Brown's signing was announced in December, executives  
throughout the sport ripped the Dodgers for becoming the first team 
ever to pay someone $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expected it, but not to that degree,'' Malone said. ``We  
didn't realize people would be so jealous and envious, and that 
they'd be so public about it. ... We were criticized for making the 
team better. Some people who criticize, they're trying to put their 
own inadequacies and shortcomings on someone else. I didn't take it 
personally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown heads a starting rotation that also will include four of  
the following five: left-hander Carlos Perez and right-handers Chan 
Ho Park, Ismael Valdes, Darren Dreifort and Dave Mlicki. 
</P>
<P>
	After watching each of those starters work briefly Friday, new  
Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said this rotation potentially could 
develop into the best he's ever managed. 
</P>
<P>
	When Johnson won a World Series with the New York Mets in 1986,  
starters Dwight Gooden, Ron Darling, Bobby Ojeda and Sid Fernandez 
combined to go 66-23. 
</P>
<P>
	Right-hander Luke Prokopec and closer Jeff Shaw were the only  
pitchers not in camp Friday. Prokopec was still in Australia 
working out some visa problems and may arrive Saturday. Shaw is 
working out in his home at Washington Court House, Ohio, while his 
wife, Julie, is expecting a baby any day.

<HEADLINE>  GM Predicts Dodgers-Yankees Matchup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VERO BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Kevin Malone had a bold prediction  
Friday: the first Yankees-Dodgers World Series since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	``They'll need Roger when they play us in the Fall Classic in  
October,'' the Los Angeles general manager said. ``It'll be fun. It 
will be nice to see Kevin Brown and Roger Clemens matched up in 
October.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With much of baseball focusing on Brown and his record $105  
million, seven-year contract, the pitcher worked out at spring 
training with the Dodgers for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't made a lot of friends and I don't think people are  
going to take it easy on us,'' Malone said. ``We'll have to step it 
up a notch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Malone spent the first day of camp discussing his team's high  
hopes and responding to criticism of Brown's contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, who turns 34 next month, went 18-7 with a 2.38 ERA with  
257 strikeouts in 257 innings for San Diego last year. He is 51-26 
with a 2.33 ERA during he past three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dodgers expect Brown's work ethic and World Series  
experience to help improve the mental toughness of the team's other 
pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
	``My role hasn't changed, it's to go out and do what I can on  
the field,'' he said. ``As far as the clubhouse ... guys learn from 
each other. Everybody's got something to bring to the table.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Welfare Concentrated in Big Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With welfare rolls declining, the nation's  
largest and oldest urban areas are home to an increasing portion of 
the nation's welfare families. 
</P>
<P>
	It is an important trend for state officials, after four years  
of unprecedented reductions in welfare recipients, as they now 
focus on those who remain on the rolls. The cities also also home 
to a host of social problems including deep poverty and isolation 
from suburban jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is ultimately where welfare reform succeeds or fails at  
the end of the day,'' said Bruce Katz of the Brookings 
Institution's Center on Urban and Metropolitan Policy, which 
released the study Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Welfare caseloads are dropping inside and outside of cities, but  
they are dropping most slowly in the nation's largest and oldest 
urban areas, particularly in the Northeast, Midwest and South, the 
study said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Caseload decline does not tell the whole story of welfare  
reform in America,'' the report said. ``The largest American cities 
are becoming home to a larger and larger share of the national 
welfare burden.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers say that has implications for local, state and  
federal governments, suggesting they must develop new ways to get 
people in cities to jobs in the suburbs and must address the 
hard-core problems of deep poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 1994 and 1998, welfare rolls fell 35 percent in the  
counties that contain the nation's 30 largest cities. That compares 
with a 44 percent drop nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	A third of the nation's welfare families lived in these counties  
in 1994. That rose to 40 percent by last year, but these counties 
are home to just 20 percent of the total population. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia, for example, housed 38.5 percent of Pennsylvania's  
welfare population in 1994; in 1998, 47 percent of the state's 
welfare cases lived there. 
</P>
<P>
	The study found cities with a growing portion of the welfare  
population shared some characteristics: They were likely to be in 
the South, Northeast and Midwest; they were likely to have higher 
unemployment rates; and they were more likely to have high rates of 
concentrated poverty -- meaning areas where at least 40 percent of 
the people are poor. 
</P>
<P>
	Concentrated poverty is associated with a host of other problems  
that make it tough to get off welfare: illiteracy, drug and alcohol 
abuse, school dropouts, teen pregnancy and out-of-wedlock births. 
</P>
<P>
	Some state officials say they are trying to address the  
problems, most notably lack of transportation to get people to 
suburban jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no countywide transportation system'' in the Detroit  
area, said Karen Smith, spokeswoman for Michigan's welfare 
department. ``It is very difficult for people who do not own their 
own vehicles to get from where they live to where a job might 
exist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit houses 48 percent of Michigan's welfare families, up  
from 42 percent in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	In Maryland, 56 percent of welfare families live in Baltimore,  
up from 48 percent in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``The jobs are in the outlying counties, and we've got to create  
some kind of mechanism to get people out to where the jobs are,'' 
said Connie Tolbert, a policy specialist for Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	But other states say they are not focusing on the cities in  
particular but are trying to serve all people who face unusual 
barriers to getting to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``We provide services uniformly across the state,'' said  
Patricia Harris-Morehead, spokeswoman for Tennessee's welfare 
department. 
</P>
<P>
	The study found of the nation's 30 largest cities:  
</P>
<P>
	--14 saw their caseloads drop more slowly than their state's  
caseload. 
</P>
<P>
	--In six, the declines were about even with the state.  
</P>
<P>
	--In nine, welfare rolls fell faster in the city than in the rest  
of the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington, D.C., one of the 30 cities, is not in a state.

<HEADLINE> Scary Spice Gives Birth to Girl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Scary Spice Mel Brown has beaten her bandmate Posh  
Spice Victoria Adams to the maternity ward, giving birth Friday 
evening to a 5.5-pound daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Phoenix Chi was born at 6:42 p.m. (1:42 p.m. EST) at a London  
hospital three weeks before her due date of March 10. Mother and 
child were doing well, said her husband, dancer Jimmy Gulzar. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am very happy to announce that I have a beautiful  
daughter,'' said Gulzar. Asked how his wife was, he said, ``She is 
wicked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Edwards, spokesman for Mel B, emerged from the hospital to  
say that Scary Spice was sitting up in bed sipping champagne. 
</P>
<P>
	The other three Spices, who were in the next room when Scary  
Space was in labor, issued a joint statement saying they were proud 
of their bandmate. ``It was true Girl Power. We are all Spice 
Aunties now,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards said Phoenix meant fire and Chi meant aura.  
</P>
<P>
	Before the birth, the star had said the child's name would begin  
with a P. When they married, Mel and her husband had tattoos on 
their fingers of each of their initials and the letter P. 
</P>
<P>
	As the news spread Friday afternoon that 23-year-old Mel B had  
gone into labor, press photographers and fans gathered outside the 
hospital in anticipation of the birth. 
</P>
<P>
	Scary Spice announced her pregnancy in August, within days of  
the news that Adams was also expecting. Adams is due to give birth 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, ex-Spice Girl Geri Halliwell said Friday she is  
writing her autobiography and will publish it later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The 26-year-old former pop icon turned U.N. goodwill ambassador  
is considering publishers' bids but has yet to sign a contract, her 
publicists' office said. 
</P>
<P>
	It said she will write about her time with the Spice Girls, but  
not to expose their secrets or settle any scores.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Kings Owner Pleads Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Former Los Angeles Kings owner Jeffrey  
Sudikoff pleaded guilty Friday to federal insider trading charges 
and failing to file a form the Security Exchange Commission 
requires. 
</P>
<P>
	Sudikoff, the former chair of IDB Communications Group, was  
scheduled to stand trial starting Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Sudikoff lied in public documents about the  
company's income in the first quarter of 1994 to inflate the value 
of IDB stock. When IDB's actual income was disclosed, the company's 
stock lost half its value. 
</P>
<P>
	Sudikoff, 43, pleaded guilty to two insider trading counts and  
one count of failing to report to the SEC that he was trading in 
stock of his own company before U.S. District Judge Dean D. 
Pregerson, who scheduled a July 12 sentencing hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange, the government dropped charges accusing him of  
conspiracy, forgery, lying to auditors and investors, and issuing 
false press releases and fraudulent SEC filings. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the outset, the heart of the government's 4 1/2-year  
investigation and prosecution has been allegations that Jeffrey 
Sudikoff forged documents and falsely inflated IDB's earnings,'' 
defense lawyer Brad Bryan said. ``Mr. Sudikoff has consistently 
denied those allegations, and we are very glad those charges are 
being dismissed.''

<HEADLINE> Caldera Suit Vs. Microsoft Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The trial of Caldera Inc.'s antitrust  
lawsuit against Microsoft Corp. has been postponed from June until 
next January. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Dee Benson on Thursday postponed the trial  
until Jan. 17 after Microsoft said its key attorneys were enmeshed 
in the federal antitrust action against Microsoft in Washington, 
D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Microsoft has launched a new attack, arguing Caldera  
has not uncovered evidence to support its claims that Microsoft has 
used illegal marketing and licensing tactics. 
</P>
<P>
	Caldera, a small firm based in Orem, contends Microsoft  
deliberately destroyed the public's demand for DR-DOS, a program 
that enables computers to perform basic functions. One of Caldera's 
expert witnesses calculated the company's damages at $1.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	New Microsoft filings allege internal memos show DR-DOS's own  
developers knew they had a flawed product and poor technical 
support for frustrated consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now we are Microsoft's biggest endorser,'' a DR-DOS  
adviser wrote in 1992. ``(The) majority of all the irate 
individuals I speak with say that they are going back to Microsoft 
because at least they provide support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The filings are aimed at sharply limiting Caldera's claims at  
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Caldera President Bryan Sparks said Caldera's response to  
Microsoft's arguments will be filed next month. ``We feel we have 
evidence to refute every one of them,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In court Thursday, Caldera attorney Stephen J. Hill asked Benson  
to go forward with the trial in June, or postpone it only until 
August. 
</P>
<P>
	For Caldera to sue Microsoft is ``a David vs. Goliath  
situation,'' Hill said. ``The longer (the litigation) goes, the 
more it costs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft attorney James Jardine says key Microsoft lawyers will  
need time to prepare for the Caldera trial once the federal 
antitrust case concludes. 
</P>
<P>
	Rulings on Microsoft's new filings likely will require written  
opinions and will determine the scope of the trial, Benson said. 
Those decisions will not be completed until May, only weeks before 
the scheduled trial, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
	DR-DOS was created by Digital Research Inc. and later purchased  
by Novell Inc., which halted the program's development in 1994. 
Caldera acquired DR-DOS in 1996, along with the right to sue over 
Microsoft's alleged efforts to quash it. 
</P>
<P>
	DR-DOS competed with Microsoft's MS-DOS.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Speaks at NAACP Dinner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton asked civil rights leaders  
Friday night to support his education and neighborhood investment 
initiatives, saying they would help close the gaps in opportunity 
and give all Americans a ``chance to live their dreams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, helping the NAACP celebrate its 90th anniversary,  
warned against falling into the lull of economic prosperity or 
becoming too complacent with the gains already made in furthering 
equality for all. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in a lot better shape than we used to be in, but we're  
nowhere near where we ought to be,'' Clinton told the annual 
meeting of the nation's largest civil rights organization. 
</P>
<P>
	As evidence that lingering racial inequality, Clinton pointed to  
incidents of qualified African-Americans being turned away for home 
loans or of being stopped in their cars without cause. He lamented 
the state of African-American children in failing schools, who are 
blocked from reaching their full potential. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been successes, such as decreased crime in  
neighborhoods and more educational opportunities, ``but it takes 
time to get it all fixed,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the nation's current prosperity provides the best  
backdrop to push plans aimed at ending racial and ethnic 
disparities. 
</P>
<P>
	Highlighting his education initiatives, Clinton said ending  
social promotion, hiring new teachers and modernizing classrooms 
would help give students of all backgrounds the chance to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also asked for support in pushing through a plan he  
touted on Wall Street last month aimed at spurring $15 billion in 
private investment in neglected urban and rural communities. 
</P>
<P>
	Noting that some neighborhoods have not had enjoyed the fruits  
of the booming economy, Clinton said his plan would encourage 
corporations and investment groups to reach out to untapped 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	If the country doesn't do it now, ``we will never get around to  
doing the job,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Julian Bond, president of the National Association for the  
Advancement of Colored People, praised Clinton for his commitment 
to civil rights and his support for affirmative action and 
increased trade with Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	To the cheers of the 350 people gathered at the dinner, Bond  
also credited Clinton for being well-versed in song. 
</P>
<P>
	``This president can sing hymns,'' said Bond. ``And he doesn't  
need the hymn book.''

<HEADLINE> Butler Reaches Out to Galarraga </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- As Andres Galarraga begins the battle against  
cancer, Brett Butler knows how the Big Cat must be feeling. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first thing you think about is, `I'm going to die,'''  
Butler said Friday. ``Then the ol' mind monster starts, and you 
don't know how bad it is or what you're going to go through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Butler began his own struggle with the disease in 1996, when a  
cancerous tumor was discovered in his tonsils. He underwent 
excruciating surgery and six weeks of radiation treatments, but 
recovered to play another full season before retiring. 
</P>
<P>
	If Galarraga wants ``to talk to someone in the cancer family,''  
Butler said he is only a phone call away. Nearly three years after 
his initial diagnosis, there is no sign of a recurrence. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has become a ministry for me,'' said Butler, who lives in  
the Atlanta suburb of Duluth. ``I want to encourage and give people 
some insight on the positive side of what they're going through, 
because initially I was scared to death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Galarraga, cleanup hitter and first baseman for the Braves, has  
a tumor lodged on a bone at the base of his spinal column, 
according to Dr. Charles Henderson, an oncologist at Piedmont 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson said Friday the tumor is stage 2 -- stage 4 being the  
most advanced -- and will be treated with five months of 
chemotherapy and one month of radiation. Galarraga will miss this 
season, but doctors are optimistic of a full recovery and his 
playing career resuming in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is in the best physical shape of all the patient I have  
seen,'' Henderson said. ``That will definitely help in his 
recovery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Butler, who relied on both conventional and alternative  
treatments after his diagnosis, encouraged Galarraga to keep a 
positive attitude and gather as much information as possible about 
possible treatments. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ultimately, he has to make the final choice,'' Butler said.  
``My advice to him is to listen to everything, then make the best 
decision that he is comfortable with, not what somebody told him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 37-year-old Galarraga, who hit .305 with 44 homers and 121  
RBIs last season, underwent an MRI and then a biopsy because of 
persistent pain in his back, initially injured near the end of 
season. The cancer was discovered Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your back is not the best place, obviously, to have  
lymphoma,'' Henderson. ``But with it being in his back, it helped 
with the detection because it caused irritation. If it had been any 
lower down, he may not have noticed it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves, going through their second day of spring training  
workouts in Kissimmee, Fla., were slowly coming to grips with the 
prospect of not having their best hitter and unifying presence in 
the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a big hit to this team to lose a guy like him, but I  
think it would be a little selfish to worry about the team as 
opposed to him right now,'' pitcher Kevin Millwood said. 
</P>
<P>
	Galarraga, a native of Venezuela, was one of the leaders of the  
team's large Latin contingent, a gentle, cheery man who bridged the 
cultural barrier with the American-born players. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I heard about it, I felt like it was me who had cancer,''  
catcher Javy Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves, seeking their eighth straight postseason appearance,  
intend to dedicate their season to Galarraga, who is expected to be 
released from Piedmont Hospital on Saturday and begin treatment 
near his home in West Palm Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is going to be a great motivation for the team,'' Lopez  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Baylor was Galarraga's manager for five years in Colorado.  
Now the Braves hitting coach, Baylor was shaken by the news, having 
lost his mother to cancer when she was 59. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time you hear about the `Big C,' everybody thinks the  
worse,'' Baylor said. ``It's happened at a time of spring training 
where guys can deal with it early.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though no one is likely to replace Galarraga's offensive numbers  
-- he was eclipsed 40 homers in three straight seasons and 100 RBIs 
the last four years -- the Braves are one of the few teams that 
seems equipped to deal with such a blow. 
</P>
<P>
	Left fielder Ryan Klesko, who seemed expendable when Atlanta  
signed Otis Nixon, now moves to first base, the position he played 
in the minor leagues. While Klesko struggled last season (.274, 18 
homers, 70 RBIs), he is only 27 and hit a career-high 34 homers in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Nixon, who batted .297 with 37 stolen bases for Minnesota,  
provides speed at the top of the order, a key element that was 
missing for the 1998 Braves. Two other offseason acquisitions, 
outfielder Brian Jordan (.316, 25 homers, 91 RBIs) and Bret Boone 
(.266, 24, 95), will help compensate for Galarraga's power numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	The projected everyday starters combined for 167 homers last  
season, which seems a good starting point to at least approach the 
franchise record of 215 homers with Galarraga in the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	No hitter should try to replace Galarraga's numbers all by  
himself, Baylor said. 
</P>
<P>
	``So many times when you lose a valuable player like Andres,  
everyone says, `Now, I have to do more,''' the hitting coach said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bret Boone, just do the same things. Brian Jordan, just do the  
same thing that got you here and not that superhuman thing you want 
to take on. Let's not pressure ourselves to where we get ... off to 
a bad start.''

<HEADLINE>  DNA Link Found in Dragging Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- Items found in the apartment of an alleged  
white supremacist had stains of blood from a black man dragged to 
his death behind a pickup truck, according to a DNA analyst for the 
FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Baechtel, an FBI forensics examiner, testified Friday that  
clothes seized from John King's apartment were splashed with blood 
from James Byrd Jr., the 49-year-old man killed last June when he 
was chained to the truck and dragged for three miles. 
</P>
<P>
	King, 24, is the first of three white men on trial for the  
murder, which prosecutors have said was intended as an initiation 
rite for a white supremacist gang being formed by King. 
</P>
<P>
	Shawn Berry, 24, and Lawrence Brewer, 31, are to be tried later.  
They all face life in prison or death by injection if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd's DNA also was found on shoes worn by each of the  
defendants, as well as on tires from the truck authorities said was 
used in the dragging, Baechtel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Altogether, 13 pieces of evidence, including a shoe, a boot and  
a sandal were found to contain Byrd's DNA. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Haden Cribbs declined to comment outside court.  
</P>
<P>
	In other testimony Friday, a Houston expert on gangs said his  
examination of King's writings indicated the convicted burglar 
wanted to create a white supremacist group and needed to commit a 
crime to establish credibility. 
</P>
<P>
	William Knox said he was interested by the fact that Byrd's  
headless torso was dumped on a road between a black cemetery and 
church. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's plenty of places here to hide a body and leave it  
undiscovered for long period of time,'' Knox said. ``In this case, 
it was a public place. This was designed to strike terror in the 
community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys contend King adopted a racist agenda as the  
result of an assault and to help him cope with black inmates in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Two witnesses, including Berry's brother, Louis, testified that  
King was especially proud of a tattoo on his arm depicting the 
silhouette of a black man hanging from a tree. King called it ``my 
little hanging nigger,'' Louis Berry said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it should happen to anybody, the way this  
happened,'' he said. ``All of it. I don't agree with it. People I 
associate with, friends and family, they don't agree with it 
either.''

<HEADLINE> Help Offered to Stiffed Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Donations from across the country are pouring in  
to help 51 of the nation's top students who were stiffed by a 
Houston company that had promised them $10,000 college 
scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
	Many students still might have to transfer to less-expensive  
schools unless they scrape up enough money to fill the void left by 
AdamsVision USA. The company's owner, Val Adams, a convicted 
bogus-check writer, insisted he is still trying to raise the money. 
</P>
<P>
	Melissa Bowlin of Palmer, Alaska, was counting on the  
AdamsVision scholarship to help pay the $30,000 annual tuition and 
board at Cornell University. This week, an Alaska woman anonymously 
donated $1,000 to help Ms. Bowlin, a biology major who hopes to 
study endangered birds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could probably stay for another year, but beyond that we're  
really worried,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, AdamsVision promised the scholarships, $10,000 a  
year, renewable for four years, to one student from each state and 
Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	The winners, many of them National Merit Scholars who had  
graduated first in their class, had to have at least a 3.0 
grade-point average and a combined SAT score of 1160 or higher. 
Some students lost out on other scholarships after winning one so 
large. 
</P>
<P>
	But in January, the company sent letters to each student saying  
it would ``not be financially capable'' of honoring the 
scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
	Adams has said the scholarship effort was on the level. He noted  
that the students were not asked to pay an application fee or 
provide any money, something the students and their parents 
confirm. 
</P>
<P>
	After reading an Associated Press story about the students'  
plight, Rick Latman, president of Seattle-based Microworkz Computer 
Corp., offered computers to each of the 51 students. ``I just 
wanted to do something,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one donor has offered housing to a student. And Long  
Island University's C.W. Post campus offered to match the 
scholarship for any student who transfers to the school. 
</P>
<P>
	In Texas, former Gov. Dolph Briscoe and H-E-B Grocery Co. each  
pledged to pay the entire $40,000 scholarship for Justin Burt, a 
freshman at Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
	The Montana recipient, Kendra Young, is getting some help from  
her school, Grinnell College in Iowa, which has contributed $7,500. 
</P>
<P>
	``If my school had not pulled through, I would have had to  
withdraw,'' Ms. Young said. ``This does definitely help with my 
situation, but there are 50 other kids. What I'm still hoping is 
someone will step up and take care of the full amount for myself 
and for every student.''

<HEADLINE> Women Makes Plea in Murder Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- A woman accused of luring a pregnant woman  
to her death by promising free diapers and baby furniture has 
pleaded innocent to murder charges that carry a possible death 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Margarita Flores, who was more than 8 months pregnant, was last  
seen leaving her home Sept. 14 with a woman posing as a charity 
worker. 
</P>
<P>
	Josefina Sonia Saldana, 40, was arrested a few days later when  
police learned she brought a dead fetus to a hospital. She claimed 
the baby was hers, but tests revealed she had not recently given 
birth. 
</P>
<P>
	She was held for investigation of kidnapping and charged with  
murder when parts of Ms. Flores' body turned up in trash in 
Tijuana, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Under state law, the special circumstances of the killing --  
alleged kidnapping -- mean conviction could bring the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Saldana entered her plea Thursday, which would have been Ms.  
Flores' 41st birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's difficult because today is a very special day for my  
family,'' said Ms. Flores' husband, Heliodoro Cruz. ``We would have 
sang her a happy birthday song, make her a cake and have a little 
family get-together. ... We'll just pray for her instead.''

<HEADLINE> Hurricane's Names Retired </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Georges and Mitch, hurricanes that battered  
the Gulf of Mexico and Central America last year, are about to have 
their jerseys retired. 
</P>
<P>
	When a hurricane has a devastating impact on a country its name  
is dropped from use, explained Arthur J. Dania, director of the 
weather service of Netherlands Antilles and Aruba. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pretty sure two names, Georges and Mitch, from last year  
will be retired,'' he said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	That would bring the total of names retired over the years to  
49, beginning with Carol, which battered North Carolina, New York 
and parts of New England in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitch certainly qualifies as devastating, claiming thousands of  
lives in Central America when it stalled last October, pouring 
record rains on Honduras and Nicaragua. The resulting floods were 
so powerful that maps are having to be redrawn to reflect the new 
contours of the land. 
</P>
<P>
	Georges blasted across parts of the Caribbean in September,  
striking Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and Cuba before crossing 
the Florida Straits to Key West. It then skirted the west coast of 
Florida before making landfall near Biloxi, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	Replacement names will be chosen at the end of March at a  
meeting of the hurricane committee of the World Meteorological 
Organization's Regional Association IV, Dania said. 
</P>
<P>
	The regional Association, which he heads, represents 25  
countries ranging from Canada to Colombia and Venezuela and 
including the nations of the Caribbean and Central America. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane naming is but a small part of the association's work,  
Dania stressed, noting it helps national weather services share 
information and forecasts and issue warnings to protect people. 
</P>
<P>
	But storm names are usually the first contact with hurricanes  
for ordinary people, who hear the name on radio or television or 
read it in a newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	For the Atlantic Basin six sets of names are used in rotation.  
That means Mitch and Georges would be returning in 2004 if they 
were not retired and replaced. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's tropical storms will reuse the list from 1993,  
beginning with Arlene and, if there are enough storms, running 
through Wilma. 
</P>
<P>
	Infamous retired hurricane names include Hazel, 1954; Camille,  
1969; Agnes, 1972; Frederic, 1979; Hugo, 1989; Bob, 1991; Andrew, 
1992 and, most recently, Hortense, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricanes, technically known as tropical cyclones, are given  
names to prevent confusion when more than one storm is under way. 
</P>
<P>
	This was first done by an Australian forecaster, who used the  
names of politicians early in this century. That provided the 
opportunity for such weather reports as ``Jones causing great 
distress'' or ``Smith wandering aimlessly in the ocean.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Military forecasters took over the naming in World War II,  
usually using the names of their wives or girlfriends. For two 
years the military phonetic alphabet was used -- Able, Baker, 
Charlie etc. -- but in 1953 the U.S. Weather Bureau went back to 
women's names. 
</P>
<P>
	After women began complaining about the practice, the list of  
names was changed in 1979 to alternate male and female names. 
</P>
<P>
	While Dania said he has heard no proposals to change the current  
practice in this region, countries of the Western North Pacific and 
South China Sea are taking a new approach starting in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The 14 countries in that region have approved a new list of  
tropical storm names, 10 from each country, to be coordinated by 
the Hong Kong Observatory. 
</P>
<P>
	The names cover a wide range including Nakri, a type of flower  
in Cambodia; Haishen, a Chinese sea god; Kai Tak, the former Hong 
Kong airport; Pabuk, a big freshwater fish in Laos; Parma, a dish 
of ham, liver and mushrooms popular in Macao; Ewinlar, a Chuuk 
storm god in Micronesia; Cimaron, a Philippine wild ox; Durian, a 
Thai fruit; and Conson, a mountain in northern Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Allies Evacuate Some Embassies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Western embassies began evacuating  
staff and NATO troops stood poised at Yugoslavia's border today, 
ready to pull international monitors to safety as the deadline 
approached for a peace agreement for Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Hopes for a last-minute breakthrough were dealt a blow as  
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic insisted he would not back 
down over the province even if NATO goes through with promised 
airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	The American mediator for the talks in France, Christopher Hill,  
arrived in the Yugoslav capital for talks with Milosevic in a 
last-ditch bid to strike a deal before the Saturday noon deadlline. 
</P>
<P>
	With NATO threatening airstrikes should the deadline pass  
without an accord between Serbs and ethnic Albanians, some 
residents of Kosovo's provincial capital, Pristina, started 
stocking up on food, fearful of both airstrikes and retaliatory 
attacks by Serb forces. 
</P>
<P>
	About 2,000 people have died and hundreds of thousands been  
driven from their homes in a year of conflict in Kosovo. Ethnic 
Albanians make up 90 percent of the province, and most want 
independence from Serbia, Yugoslavia's main republic. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana refused to say how soon  
airstrikes would come if the deadline passed with no deal, ``but 
let me say this would be soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Solana spoke Thursday from neighboring Macedonia, where he was  
simultaneously overseeing plans for either deployment of peace 
troops to enforce any peace accord or for an ``extraction force'' 
that would help evacuate 1,300 international monitors ahead of NATO 
bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslavia has vehemently rejected the deployment of a NATO  
peacekeeping force, which the United States and its European allies 
say is vital to enforce any peace deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly before Hill's arrival, Milosevic defiantly rejected the  
NATO force, even in the face airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will not give away Kosovo, not even at the price of  
bombing,'' he said, quoted by the official Tanjug news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Milan Milutinovic, the president of Serbia warned that Western  
threats ``can only distance'' the negotiations from reaching a 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	With the deadline looming, Western embassies in the Yugoslav  
capital, Belgrade, prepared to send nonessential staff and 
dependents out of the country. Canadian diplomatic families were 
seen packing into cars today and heading out for the Hungarian 
capital Budapest. Staff in the Dutch Embassy were also departing. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, the Foreign Office said the families of British  
diplomats planned to leave today. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials said the American Embassy was operating normally  
with full staff. 
</P>
<P>
	In Pristina, Col. Mike Philips said the monitors who are in  
Kosovo to oversee an earlier cease-fire were preparing for a quick 
evacuation if necessary. But he said the force remains in place 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Serb military convoys were on the move across  
southern Kosovo, in what monitors from the Organization for 
Security and Cooperation in Europe suspected might be a show of 
force ahead of the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanks, armored personnel carriers and artillery rolled along the  
main roads, in lines up to 30 vehicles long. The government in 
Yugoslavia's other republic, Montenegro, was reportedly calling up 
reservists; similar mobilizations were rumored to be taking place 
in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Kosovo's outnumbered Serbs, resistance only hardened with  
each passing hour. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Americans ask too much, so what the hell,'' said Dragan, a  
25-year-old Serb in Kosovo Polje, a Serb-dominated town outside 
Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they bomb, we'll just finish off the rebels, and that'll be  
it,'' said Dragan, who would give only his first name. 
</P>
<P>
	In Pristina itself, some started buying supplies as a  
precaution. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has to be some agreement,'' said Esat Dauti, talking  
with a friend on an icy street. ``There's no other way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On a front line in the north, Kosovo Albanian guerrillas kept  
government forces in their rifle sights, fully expecting imminent 
bloodshed across the province, including Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they start to bomb Serbia, the police and army will burn  
the whole place,'' said one rebel commander stationed at an outpost 
600 yards from a Serb tank that stood sentry on a snowy hill.

<HEADLINE> Jazz Look To Pay Back Sonics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- John Stockton is getting tired of seeing  
the Utah Jazz play the way they did against the Seattle SuperSonics 
in their last meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't compete at all,'' Stockton said of the 71-56 loss  
Tuesday that ended the Jazz's perfect season. ``It's something you 
hope your team will never do, but we just came out and let them do 
whatever they wanted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Utah gets a chance to avenge that humiliation Saturday when the  
Jazz entertain the Pacific Division-leading Sonics. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle held the Jazz to a franchise-low regular-season point  
total, blitzing their previous mark by 12 points. Utah managed only 
54 points in Game 3 of the NBA Finals last season and 64 points in 
a loss to San Antonio in the conference semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	That's three disastrous offensive games in Utah's last 20  
outings. For the Jazz, who have been among the NBA's 
highest-scoring teams during most of the 1990s, it's a baffling 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some games you've just got to forget about and move on,''  
Bryon Russell said. ``We don't want to forget losing to Seattle, 
(but) we've got to forget about how bad we played.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the Seattle debacle and a week of less-than-inspired  
play, the Jazz have the league's best record at 7-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Although they've made the best start in franchise history, the  
Jazz are hardly on a roll. They sandwiched their horrible outing at 
Seattle between two mediocre home wins over Sacramento and Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Against the Kings Monday, Utah needed five clutch free throws by  
Karl Malone and a missed wide-open layup by the Kings' Lawrence 
Funderburke in the final minute of regulation to force overtime, 
where the Jazz won 120-112. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah wasn't much better against Denver Thursday, making 17  
turnovers and allowing the team with the NBA's second-worst record 
to hang around until the closing minutes of the Jazz's 97-86 win. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to play well (against Seattle), not play angry,''  
Stockton said. ``If we don't come to play again, maybe we won't be 
as fortunate as we were against the Nuggets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before Tuesday's game, Utah and Seattle were the last undefeated  
teams in the league. The Sonics lost their perfect mark Wednesday 
night to the Kings, and they haven't played since. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Payton had 17 points and 11 rebounds in the Sonics' win  
over Utah. He also made Stockton look bad while trying to defend 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah coach Jerry Sloan said he will consider throwing several  
defenders and double-teams at Payton in an effort to control the 
league's fourth-leading scorer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kings worked at keeping the ball out of Payton's hands on  
Wednesday, and the strategy worked in Sacramento's 109-106 overtime 
win. That loss also exposed offensive cracks in a Sonics team with 
a 6-1 record but just two victories over teams with winning 
records. 
</P>
<P>
	Forwards Detlef Schrempf and Vin Baker are both off to slow  
starts for Seattle. Schrempf is shooting 35 percent from the field, 
while Baker is a comical 1-for-20 from the foul line and is 
averaging only 11 points per game. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, Utah's forwards are playing well. Malone is off to  
another strong start despite only 14 points against the Nuggets, 
while Russell followed up his career-high 25 points against the 
Kings with a team-high 21 in the Denver game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just had to get this (Nuggets) game out of the way, and now  
it's all about payback,'' Russell said. ``We weren't ready to play 
the Sonics before, but we'll be ready Saturday.''

<HEADLINE> Trinidad To Face Whitaker Saturday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Felix Trinidad's only appearance in Madison  
Square Garden amounted to a cameo experience that did nothing to 
enhance his reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday night, however, the unbeaten IBF welterweight  
champion gets a real opportunity to showcase his talents because 
the opponent will be Pernell Whitaker, a former champion in four 
weight divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	There are the questions of how drug and alcohol problems and a  
16-month layoff will affect the 35-year-old Whitaker. However, 
there is no question he will provide stiffer opposition than that 
put up by Troy Waters, who lasted 2:50 against Trinidad in the 
Garden in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	There also is the question of how making the 147-pound limit  
will affect Trinidad. He weighed himself at the Garden before 
Friday's weigh-in, then left to run around the arena. Trinidad 
weighed in 22 minutes after his name had been called and made the 
weight limit. Earlier, Whitaker weighed in at 147 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad's weight problem would be more serious if the weigh-in  
were the day of the fight. In this era of weighing in the day 
before the bout, boxers enter the ring several pounds above the 
limit. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of the best training camps I've ever hand,'' said  
Whitaker, who declines to discuss the problems that forced him into 
drug and alcohol rehabilitation and have kept him from fighting 
since he outpointed Andre Pestriaev on Oct. 17, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``He still a good boxer, but the drugs and alcohol have taken  
their toll,'' said Trinidad's father, also his trainer and manager. 
``But he still has pride.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whitaker is left-handed but Trinidad expects no problem.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've fought left-handers before,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Trainer Tommy Brooks thinks Whitaker has a lot more left than  
pride. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'd never think he'd been out of the gym,'' Brooks said.  
``Trinidad has a surprise coming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I would not be surprised if he comes right after me,'' said  
the 26-year-old Trinidad, a 5-1 favorite in Las Vegas. ``If he 
does, I'll be ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because of age and possible ring rust -- and Whitaker insists  
there is none -- it will be interesting to see how he holds up in 
the later rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	But that could be a bigger problem for Trinidad, who has gone  
past the fifth round only once (into the eight against Oba Carr in 
1994) since outpointing Hector Camacho in 12 rounds on Jan. 29, 
1994. He also has not fought since he knocked out Mahenge Zulu last 
April 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad's record is 33-0, with 29 knockouts. Whitaker is  
41-2-1, with 17 knockouts. 
</P>
<P>
	This will be Whitaker's third Garden appearance and his first  
since he won the WBC welterweight title on points over James 
``Buddy'' McGirt on March 6, 1993. He lost that title on a disputed 
decision to Oscar De La Hoya on April 12, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The replay of De La Hoya's split-decision win over Ike Quartey  
last Saturday will open the HBO telecast at 9:30 p.m. EST. The 
Trinidad-Whitaker fight should start between 10:30 p.m. and 10:45 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	In a fight that will not be televised, Vince Phillips (39-3, 28  
knockouts), 140 pounds, will defend the IBF junior welterweight 
title against Terronn Millett (20-1-1, 15 knockouts), 140 pounds.

<HEADLINE> Lyons' Aide Testifies About Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARGO, Fla. (AP) -- The co-defendant in a swindling case  
involving the National Baptist Convention USA told jurors she was 
``like a little kid in a candy store,'' buying diamond jewelry, 
clothing and a home with the black church leader. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bernice Edwards told jurors that she and the Rev. Henry  
Lyons earned the more than $1 million from companies doing business 
with the church and didn't cheat anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made the money. I bought what I wanted,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Edwards, testifying for the second day in her and Lyons'  
racketeering trial, also told the jury that she and Lyons, who is 
married, only had a professional relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say Ms. Edwards, a convicted embezzler and the  
convention's former public relations director, was Lyons' 
girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons and Ms. Edwards are accused of swindling more than $4  
million from companies seeking to market life insurance policies, 
cemetery products and credit cards to members of the black church 
organization. Prosecutors say they duped the companies with the 
promise of an 8.5 million-member mailing list that never existed. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Edwards' lawyer has said she was brought along as ``window  
dressing'' by prosecutors seeking to convict Lyons. His lawyers say 
his failed business deals are not criminal matters. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Edwards testified she received almost $400,000 for her work  
on one project and she and Lyons shared $1 million from another 
company -- money she never reported as required under the terms of 
her three-year probation for embezzling funds from a Milwaukee 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't report it because I didn't want it to stop. I felt  
good about it,'' she said. ``I didn't want anyone to halt it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She told the jury she wasn't in on any of the marketing deals  
with Globe Life Insurance Co. or the Loewen Group, a funeral home 
company. But she said that in 1995, Globe executives knew no 
membership list existed and asked her to help compile one. 
</P>
<P>
	She eventually received between $350,000 and $400,000 from  
Globe, she testified, saying the money was to reimburse her 
expenses and pay her for her work. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Edwards also worked with Loewen officials, she said, but  
denied she and Lyons said they could help investigate a huge civil 
verdict against the Loewen in Mississippi, as company officials 
testified earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	But, she said, Loewen paid her and Lyons $1 million for  
defending them against bad publicity from the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Edwards, who earlier described herself to jurors as the  
youngest of 17 children and a struggling single mother of three, 
said she spent the windfall on jewelry, a $700,000 waterfront home 
she purchased with Lyons and other expensive items. 
</P>
<P>
	``I bought these things because I worked hard to earn that  
money. It was my chance to buy some things I always wanted,'' she 
said. ``I was like a little kid in a candy store.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons also is charged with grand theft, accused of stealing  
almost $250,000 from the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith 
intended to rebuild burned black churches in the South. 
</P>
<P>
	He faces federal trial in April on 54 counts of bank fraud, wire  
fraud, extortion and money laundering.

<HEADLINE> G7 Industrial Nations Meet Saturday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BONN, Germany (AP) -- Finance officials from the world's  
wealthiest countries are expected to back modest steps to prevent 
future crises at a meeting here Saturday, leaving Germany largely 
isolated with a more ambitious campaign to control exchange rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States opposes the proposal by Germany's left-leaning  
finance minister Oskar Lafontaine to limit fluctuations among the 
world's three main currencies, the dollar, the euro and the 
Japanese yen. Germany has gained support from Japan, but even its 
main European ally, France, has been cool to the idea. 
</P>
<P>
	Lafontaine's spokesman muted expectations Friday for the one-day  
meeting of Group of Seven finance ministers and central bankers in 
Bonn, to which Russia is also sending envoys. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect to take stock of the discussion of the international  
financial system and how the G-7 views the crises in the world 
economy,'' the spokesman, Torsten Albig, said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another dispute emerged over how to reflect the European Union's  
clout now that it has a single currency. Eleven European nations 
adopted the euro at the beginning of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Stymied by resistance from Washington and Tokyo, the European  
Union on Thursday scrapped plans to send its own representative to 
the Group of Seven meeting for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	But the most controversial agenda item was likely to be a  
proposal to stabilize exchange rates, an idea pushed to the fore in 
the last two years by financial collapses in Asia and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Lafontaine has proposed setting trading ``bands'' for major  
currencies, which would call for central banks to buy and sell 
their own currency on the open market in order to limit 
fluctuations against other currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	But U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said this week that the  
idea of creating more stability between the U.S. dollar, the 
Japanese yen and the euro had ``enormous'' practical problems. 
</P>
<P>
	France appeared to be somewhere in between the two positions,  
stopping short of calling for formal target zones. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must adopt a veritable 'highway code' for capital flows, a  
code that applies to all, including hedge funds and offshore 
establishments,'' French President Jacques Chirac said Thursday 
during a visit to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite ``disagreements'' over currency alignment proposals,  
Rubin said the Group of Seven -- the United States, Japan, Germany, 
France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- was committed to overhauling 
the global financial architecture to prevent more currency crises. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Bonn meeting, Germany's influential central bank  
president Hans Tietmeyer was to present a report outlining ideas 
for policymakers to improve coordination in the surveillance of 
financial markets in order to provide earlier warning of developing 
crises. 
</P>
<P>
	Participants in Bonn are expected to approve the report, which  
the G-7 asked Tietmeyer to prepare last autumn. 
</P>
<P>
	The main recommendation calls for setting up an international  
forum of 40-45 officials from governments and international 
financial institutions that would meet about twice a year, said 
officials who have seen the report. The forum would be created 
under the auspices of the Bank for International Settlements in 
Switzerland, a coordination body for the world's major central 
banks.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- The WNBA will play its first All-Star Game in  
Madison Square Garden on July 14, with the game set to be televised

<HEADLINE> Kaiser Permanente's Losses Widen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Kaiser Permanente's losses widened last year to  
$288 million, as the nation's largest health maintenance 
organization struggled with rising medical costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaiser, a not-for-profit health plan with 8.6 million members in  
17 states, raised premiums between 10 percent and 20 percent this 
year to help improve its financial condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials predict the rate hikes and other cost-cutting  
moves will restore Kaiser to profitablity this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, 1998 was a bad year for Kaiser,'' said Dr. David  
Lawrence, chairman and chief executive of Kaiser Foundation Health 
Plan and Hospitals. ``But it was consistent with our expectations 
and our turnaround plans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kaiser's difficulties mirror those throughout the HMO industry.  
Most health plans have raised premiums between 5 percent to 10 
percent in 1999 to help deal with years of financial losses and the 
recent surge in medical costs. Like other HMOs, Kaiser says rising 
drug costs is one of its biggest problems. 
</P>
<P>
	But unlike a number of large plans, such as Aetna-U.S.  
Healthcare and United HealthCare, Kaiser officials say they have no 
plans to reduce coverage for Medicare beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-thirds of Kaiser members live in California. The plan's  
membership increased by 5 percent in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Kaiser lost $266 million on $14.2 billion in operating  
revenues. Revenues increased to $15.5 billion in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaiser, also an owner of hospitals and medical clinics, said it  
is delaying buying new equipment and information technology. Kaiser 
sold health plans in Texas and in Charlotte, N.C., in recent 
months, and is considering leaving other unprofitable markets.

<HEADLINE> No Charges in Driver's Suffocation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- No federal civil rights charges will be filed  
in the suffocation of a black motorist during a 1995 fight with 
white police from suburban Pittsburgh, a prosecutor said today. 
</P>
<P>
	There was not enough evidence to support charges that officers  
used unreasonable force to subdue Jonny Gammage after a traffic 
stop in October 1995, said Bill Lan Lee, acting assistant attorney 
general for civil rights in the U.S. Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not suggesting that Mr. Gammage's death was  
justified,'' Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Lt. Milton Mulholland stopped Gammage in suburban  
Brentwood because Gammage was tapping his brakes late at night in a 
luxury sedan. The car was owned by Gammage's cousin, former 
Pittsburgh Steelers defensive lineman Ray Seals. Gammage, 31, of 
Syracuse, N.Y., ran Seals' sportswear business. 
</P>
<P>
	Other officers were summoned to help. A fight started, and  
police restrained Gammage face down, suffocating him on the 
pavement. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers said his death was an accident. The Rev. Jesse  
Jackson called it a ``lynching.'' Lee said he came to Pittsburgh to 
assure black leaders that the investigation was thorough. 
</P>
<P>
	Mulholland and Brentwood Officer Michael Albert were charged in  
state court with involuntary manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Their first trial ended in a mistrial after Coroner Cyril Wecht  
testified improperly that Albert should explain his actions to a 
jury. Defendants are not required to testify. 
</P>
<P>
	In the second trial, jurors were unable to reach a verdict.  
Eleven white jurors favored acquittals and the lone black juror 
held out for convictions. A judge later ruled out a third trial, 
citing errors made during the second trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Another officer, John Vojtas, was acquitted in a separate trial.  
Two other officers who fought Gammage were not charged.

<HEADLINE> Italy Ends Elect4ricity Monopoly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- The state-controlled electric utility ENEL's 37-year  
monopoly would end under legislation approved today by the Italian 
government to comply with the European Union's privatization 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new bill, 30 percent of Italy's electricity market  
will be opened to competition in coming months, and 40 percent by 
the year 2002, going even farther than the EU-mandated 33 percent 
by 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	The reform ``will encourage a new season of investments and  
create new movement in the sector,'' Industry Minister Pierluigi 
Bersani said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The law also ends ENEL's 37-year monopoly on electricity imports  
and sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The reforms mean that independent power producers like Edison  
and Sondel, which now produce 27 percent of Italy's electricity, 
will now be able to sell directly to industrial clients. Until now, 
they could only sell to ENEL.

	Clinton Expects 'Two Good Years'  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said at the White House  
today that he expects ``two good years here.'' But the president 
acknowledged that America probably paid a price for his impeachment 
ordeal. He also said it has been ``a very exhausting year'' for his 
wife. At a news conference, the president said he hoped the 
presidency had not been harmed by his experience, which provoked 
bitter battles in the courts and in Congress. He added, ``I think 
the Constitution has been in effect re-ratified.'' 

</P>
<P>
	U.S. Mounts Kosovo Diplomacy  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton warned Yugoslav President  
Slobodan Milosevic today that he would be ``held accountable'' and 
face NATO airstrikes if he refuses to accept a peace accord with 
ethnic Albanians and allow NATO peacekeeping troops into Kosovo. 
Clinton sent Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to peace talks 
in France for a down-to-the-wire diplomatic bid to seal a deal by a 
Saturday deadline. The president said the time limit was firm, and 
he had ordered U.S. warplanes ``to be ready'' to attack Serb 
targets. 

</P>
<P>
	Serbia Rejects Peace Envoy  
</P>
<P>
	RAMBOUILLET, France (AP) -- Hopes for a Kosovo peace deal  
appeared all but dead today after Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic defied international pressure, saying he won't give up 
the troubled province even at the price of NATO airstrikes. With 
NATO preparing to attack Serbia if no Kosovo deal is reached by 
noon Saturday (6 a.m. EST), the hard-line Yugoslav president 
refused to meet U.S. envoy Christopher Hill. Hill had traveled to 
Belgrade to make a last-ditch attempt to urge Milosevic to accept 
the Kosovo peace plan. That plan calls for NATO troops to enforce 
it, something Serbia staunchly opposes. 

</P>
<P>
	US, France Plan Balkans Initiative  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP ) -- President Clinton and French President  
Jacques Chirac covered a wide range of issues in talks today, 
including NATO's future and a new initiative to increase stability 
in the Balkans. Clinton said the Kosovo conflict underlined the 
problem of instability in the Balkans. ``The United States and 
France will pursue a new initiative to increase cooperation with 
nations in southeast Europe on security issues,'' Clinton said. He 
gave no details. 

</P>
<P>
	U.S. Fights Strain Injuries  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Employers should take steps to prevent certain  
on-the-job stress injuries, such as carpal-tunnel syndrome and back 
strains, a federal agency said today in proposed industry 
standards. If approved, the standards could force certain employers 
-- mainly in the industrial sector -- to alter work stations, 
redesign facilities or change tools and equipment. Setting a 
national standard would alleviate the burden on multistate 
businesses from complying with ``a patchwork quilt of different 
ergonomics rules in different states,'' Occupational Safety and 
Health Administration Administrator Charles N. Jeffress said. 

</P>
<P>
	U.S. Trade Deficit Hits New High  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. trade deficit surged to an all-time  
high of $168.6 billion last year as the global financial crisis 
battered American manufacturers and farmers, triggering the first 
decline in exports in 13 years. The Commerce Department reported 
today that last year's deficit jumped 53 percent from a 1997 
imbalance of $110.2 billion, surpassing the old record of $153.4 
billion set in 1987. 

</P>
<P>
	NEC To Cut 15,000 Jobs  
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- NEC, Japan's biggest computer maker, will cut  
15,000 jobs, or nearly 10 percent of its work force, over three 
years. It is struggling to recover from slumping sales and massive 
losses at its Packard Bell unit in the United States. About 6,000 
of the job cuts are outside Japan. NEC didn't say how many will hit 
its 7,000 U.S. workers.

	Dow Ends 41.32 Higher  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock indexes ended the day higher but pulled  
back from even bigger gains in the final 15 minutes of trading 
today after President Clinton reiterated that Serbia will be ``held 
accountable'' if peace talks on Kosovo collapse and a NATO bombing 
campaign is needed. The Dow Jones industrials ended the day up 
41.32 at 9,339.95. On the NYSE, losers led gainers 1,535-1,396. The 
Nasdaq gained 23.05 to 2,283.60.

	Rodman Still Undecided on NBA  
</P>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Dennis Rodman, appearing on ESPN's ``Up  
Close,'' said he still hasn't made a definite decision as to 
whether he's going to play in the NBA this season or not. ``If I 
play basketball, it will be between two teams, the (Los Angeles) 
Lakers or Miami, and the odds are that's going to happen within the 
next 48 hours,'' Rodman said. He had been quoted by the Chicago 
Sun-Times in Thursday's editions as saying he would sign with the 
Lakers either Thursday or Friday.

<HEADLINE> Nets' Center a Stand-Up in Low Post </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- A little more than an hour before  
the New Jersey Nets were to play the Houston Rockets, Jayson 
Williams walked out the trainer's room and sat at his locker. 
</P>
<P>
	Ankles and wrist taped, Williams looked up and saw a crowd  
around him. Like almost every night, it was now showtime for 
possibly the NBA's funniest man. 
</P>
<P>
	All are fair game in his routine: teammate Keith Van Horn, union  
leader Billy Hunter, Yankees owner George Steinbrenner and even 
comic Bill Cosby. 
</P>
<P>
	When told Cosby, who recently purchased a small piece of the  
Nets, was outside the locker room, Williams got rolling. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe he's going to give me my damn check,'' Williams chirped,  
letting everyone know he still hasn't been paid since signing a 
seven-year, $100 million contract. ``Damn, I'm just beating the dog 
to the garbage can. Are they going to pay me this year?'' 
</P>
<P>
	After a split second of silence, he adds: ``Maybe not.''  
</P>
<P>
	Laughing loudly, Williams kept right on going.  
</P>
<P>
	``With Bill Cosby in the building, he's still the second  
funniest guy in the building,'' Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	He then turned to a picture in his locker of Cosby and him  
laughing hysterically. After telling everyone the picture was taken 
three years ago, the center said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just telling him how much he was going to have to pay me  
in three years,'' Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reminded of the Nets' new community-orientated policy, Williams  
said the team has to start winning after a slow start. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want the kids in the Nets' hats getting beaten up  
going to school,'' he said. ``We don't want to be doing child abuse 
commercials and contradicting ourselves. We have to win and save 
the world second.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just as he finished, Hunter walked into the locker room.  
Williams had criticized Hunter during the six-month NBA lockout, 
telling the executive director of the NBA players' union to reach a 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter and Williams hugged and then Williams went at it --  
showing everyone how Hunter was pointing at him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somebody get my vest,'' Williams said. ``Hey, Gat (Chris  
Gatling) that's not vengeance is it?''. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter then told Williams he was going to make him the poster  
boy for all the people who said there wouldn't be any more $100 
million contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not the one (poster) you have on the back of your door  
with darts in it?'' Williams asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Enough of Hunter. Williams moved on to Rockets coach Rudy  
Tomjanovich, the U.S. basketball coach for 1999. That means he will 
probably coach the United States in the 2000 Olympics. Williams 
would love to represent his country. 
</P>
<P>
	But first he's got something to say to his good friend.  
</P>
<P>
	``Hey, Keith, can you come here for one second,'' Williams  
called across the room to Van Horn. Van Horn walked over and 
Williams looked up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe you can give me just one pass a half,'' said Williams,  
breaking up everyone around him. ``That way I'll get four shots. I 
know I can count on you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Next up is Steinbrenner. Williams has a few things to say on the  
trade that sent David Wells and two teammates to Toronto for Roger 
Clemens. 
</P>
<P>
	``George wants a lot of the limelight and maybe David was  
stealing that from him,'' Williams said. ``I don't know, maybe it 
was purely a decision to make the Yankees better. I figure: `How 
much better can you make them.'''

<HEADLINE> Index Funds Not Simple As They Seem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Any time you go shopping for a stock-index  
mutual fund, don't limit your search to funds based on the Standard 
&AMP; Poor's 500 composite. 
</P>
<P>
	These days, there are many other types of index funds to choose  
among. In the eyes of a growing number of analysts, some of the 
alternatives offer greater diversification and less risk than the 
hyper-popular S&AMP;P 500 funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Since it began to gain momentum about 20 years ago, the index  
investing movement has largely focused on the S&AMP;P 500 because that 
was the standard against which professional investors measured 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last few years, S&AMP;P 500 funds have attracted extra  
attention because they have achieved outstanding results, racking 
up better returns than a vast majority of the managed funds against 
which they compete. 
</P>
<P>
	Along the way, the character of the S&AMP;P 500 itself, which gives  
greatest weight to its component stocks with the largest market 
values, has changed. As the shares of a few dozen big growth 
companies soared, some observers said, the S&AMP;P 500 owed more and 
more of its cachet to fewer and fewer stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the S&AMP;P 500 climbed more than 26 percent, notes Tom  
Bellhy, president of the Pittsburgh investment advisory firm of 
Fort Pitt Capital Group. But if you excluded the top 20 performers 
among its component stocks, he says, the index's gain shrank to 
barely more than 7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The funny thing is, S&AMP;P 500 funds, set up as a way to escape the  
high-cost, high-risk performance derby among stock-fund managers, 
have themselves become a worshipped icon in the cult of 
performance. All too often, history teaches, fund investors who 
chase performance wind up with severe disappointment instead. 
</P>
<P>
	But if S&AMP;P 500 investing has changed, the basic principles of  
index investing haven't. Practiced right, it still offers a handy 
way to invest in a broadly diversified stock portfolio at low cost, 
avoiding all the research and trading expenses that arise in an 
actively managed fund. 
</P>
<P>
	To get away from the S&AMP;P 500 hubbub, you can simply look at  
funds based on other, broader market indexes. Vanguard Group, which 
sponsors by far the biggest, best-known 500 fund, also runs about 
two dozen other stock-index portfolios. 
</P>
<P>
	One noteworthy offering in this category: The Vanguard Total  
Stock Market Index fund, designed to track the Wilshire 5,000 
index, which contains some 7,200 stocks, or more than 14 times as 
many as the S&AMP;P 500. Wilshire Associates, the Santa Monica, Calif., 
firm that calculates that index, has itself just launched a 
competing Wilshire 5,000 Index fund. 
</P>
<P>
	If you're thinking global, despite the troubles in many foreign  
stock markets over the past few years, you can opt for an 
international or worldwide index fund like the Schwab International 
Index fund, managed by Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	New variations on the index theme appear all the time. The  
Moneypaper, a firm based in Mamaroneck, N.Y., has just started the 
MP63 fund, including the 63 stocks that make up its index of 
companies offering low- or no-cost dividend reinvestment plans. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, Guinness Flight Investment Management introduced  
the Guinness Flight Wired Index fund, embracing the 40 ``new blue 
chips'' in an index put together by Wired magazine. When Wired 
introduced the index last year, it said it was designed to ``track 
the growth of the companies that are building the new economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of these funds are narrower and more speculative than  
others. They all demonstrate, however, that the idea of index 
investing can have as many different applications as there are 
indexes to measure any or all parts of the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	S&AMP;P 500 funds represent just one of these possibilities, and are  
by no means the last word. As analyst David Wright at the 
newsletter Dow Theory Forecasts in Hammond, Ind., puts it: ``It is 
hard to argue with the success of Vanguard 500 Index. But the 
Vanguard 500 Index is not a foolproof way to spread your money. 
</P>
<P>
	``The S&AMP;P 500's huge advance has been driven by strong results  
at a surprisingly short list of big fast-growing companies. A 
portfolio entirely in the Vanguard 500 Index fund is not truly 
diversified.''

<HEADLINE> McGwire Will Have Bodyguards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JUPITER, Fla. (AP) -- Like a chief of state, Mark McGwire will  
have bodyguards this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	A Jupiter police officer will shadow the home run king this  
spring each time he goes from the clubhouse to a practice field. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, officials at Roger Dean Stadium, which the  
Cardinals share with the Montreal Expos, have promised that fans 
seeking autographs and photographs will have better access to 
players than last year. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, who hit a record 70 homers last season, is expected to  
arrive late Tuesday by private jet from his home in California. 
Following his initial workout Wednesday morning, he will have his 
first news conference of the spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Police may be in uniform or in plain clothes. But Jupiter Police  
Chief Richard Westgate said the security for McGwire will be 
nowhere near what his department provided when President Clinton 
visited a local elementary school in October 1997. The duty will be 
rotated among three officers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We won't have Secret Service up on rooftops. This is baseball.  
People will still get to see McGwire,'' Westgate said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want people to feel like it's Fort Knox out here,''  
stadium general manager Rob Rabeneker said. ``We want to be 
prepared but we are not going to restrict people from getting 
autographs and photographs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire won't be staying at the Cardinals' team hotel.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't where he will be and I don't want to know,'' team  
spokesman Brian Bartow said. ``That way, I can honestly say I don't 
know.''

<HEADLINE> Teen Convicted in Rival's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LYONS, N.Y. (AP) -- A teen-ager sobbed quietly as she was  
convicted of manslaughter for using her car to run over a romantic 
rival. 
</P>
<P>
	Polly Smith, 18, knocked down Amanda Leoni, also 18, on a street  
in this Erie Canal village last August. She then hit the brake, 
turned the steering wheel and drove over her, three witnesses 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury found her guilty Friday of first-degree manslaughter and  
reckless driving but acquitted her of second-degree murder. 
Sentencing was set for April 13. 
</P>
<P>
	The women had vied all summer for the affections of a young man.  
Several witnesses testified Ms. Smith made it clear she intended to 
kill Ms. Leoni, though Ms. Smith told police she meant only to 
scare her. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyer John Parrinello dismissed the threats as ``trash  
talk,'' saying Ms. Smith had jumped out of her car after the 
collision and screamed ``Oh my God, I didn't mean to hit her, I'm 
sorry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Is that the way a person behaves if her conscious objective is  
to intentionally kill a person?'' he asked during closing arguments 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	But prosecutor Richard Healy argued that Ms. Smith deliberately  
hit the other girl ``in a fit of jealous rage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Smith had been dating Justin Smith, 20, on and off for over  
a year when Ms. Leoni, returning home from her first year in 
college in Philadelphia, began seeing him. 
</P>
<P>
	After months of trying to scare her off, allegedly kicking and  
punching her on one occasion, Ms. Smith forced a showdown the night 
of Aug. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	The women had an argument during which Justin Smith told Ms.  
Leoni he was finished with her. As Ms. Leoni walked away, Ms. Smith 
hit the accelerator and struck her from behind. 
</P>
<P>
	The circumstances of Ms. Leoni's death bore similarities to  
another lethal love triangle involving her 15 months earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	In May 1997, her boyfriend died of a knife wound to the heart  
during a fight with another teen-ager who was courting the girl.

<HEADLINE> Compaq Denies Giving Microsoft Info </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The world's largest computer maker denies it  
passed secret information to Microsoft Corp. about an upstart 
rival, disputing a sensational charge raised in Microsoft's 
antitrust trial. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for Compaq Computer Corp. acknowledged that the company  
had apologized to Be Inc. of Menlo Park, Calif., for inadvertently 
disclosing to Microsoft that Compaq was talking with Be about its 
technology. But he said Compaq never passed details of that 
technology to Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	``It had nothing to do with the transmittal of proprietary  
information,'' Compaq attorney Tom Siekman said Friday, calling it 
an ``inadvertent ... business mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Be, founded in 1990, makes a niche computer operating system.  
Microsoft has invoked Be's product several times at trial -- even 
showing slides to the judge -- to argue that Microsoft is not a 
monopolist and faces competition even with its dominant Windows 
operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	Be's chief executive officer, Jean-Louis Gassee, said Friday he  
could not confirm or challenge Compaq's explanation. He said he was 
not told the nature of the disclosure, but was told it came in an 
e-mail exchange between Compaq and Microsoft officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had inadvertently broken our nondisclosure agreement,''  
Gassee said. ``I do not know exactly the extent of the inadvertent 
disclosure; as a result, it is hard for me to challenge statements 
from a Compaq attorney without independent access to the data. We 
have to take it on good faith.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyer David Boies raised the charge in  
trying to discredit testimony by a senior Compaq executive, John T. 
Rose, who is appearing on behalf of Microsoft. Boies asked Rose 
whether he was aware that ``Compaq took information supplied to it 
by Be ... and in violation of the nondisclosure agreement 
transmitted it to Microsoft.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rose replied that he did not know anything about it.  
</P>
<P>
	The government alleges in its antitrust case that Microsoft  
illegally wields its influence to discourage companies that rely on 
Windows from dealing with its software rivals, such as Netscape 
Communications Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rose testified Friday that Compaq was pressured against  
distributing Netscape's rival Internet software, not by Microsoft 
but by America Online Inc., which wanted Compaq to promote its 
online service. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a 1995 agreement, AOL was paying Compaq roughly $6.4  
million a year to feature its software prominently on its Presario 
line of personal computers. Microsoft showed a June 1996 letter 
from an AOL executive who called it ``frankly unacceptable'' that 
Compaq also was distributing Netscape's browser as prominently as 
AOL's own software. 
</P>
<P>
	``To my knowledge, Microsoft never objected'' to Compaq  
distributing software for both AOL and Netscape with its computers, 
Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
	Netscape's chief executive officer, James Barksdale, charged  
earlier that Microsoft intimidated Compaq into dropping plans to 
distribute his company's software. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft also used a sworn statement by a former Compaq  
executive, Celeste Dunn, who acknowledged that the company's 
contracts with Microsoft ``didn't limit us'' from distributing 
Netscape's software. 
</P>
<P>
	But the government later showed a letter Ms. Dunn wrote to  
Microsoft complaining that its contracts ``may prevent us from 
featuring the Netscape browser, all with no replacement for the 
revenue lost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq expected to earn $2.6 million from Netscape for  
distributing its browser during the last half of 1996, according to 
documents.

<HEADLINE> Mom of Bitten Girl Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- A woman was sentenced to three years  
in prison for allowing someone to repeatedly bite her infant 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl was 10 months old when she was taken to the hospital  
July 8. She had bite marks on her cheeks, chest, buttocks, legs and 
the bottom of one foot. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the marks had healed, but some were fresh. The child had  
pneumonia, two skull fractures and every major bone in her body had 
been broken. She is now in foster care. 
</P>
<P>
	Dental tests ruled out the mother, Majorca King, 20. Most of the  
injuries were at least a month old when the baby was hospitalized, 
Assistant State Attorney Terri Phillips said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. King told relatives the child had been bitten by a young  
relative in Adel, Ga., where Ms. King lived before moving to 
Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. King pleaded guilty to second-degree child neglect with  
great bodily harm. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said a warrant has been issued in Georgia for the  
arrest of King's boyfriend, the child's father, charging him with 
child abuse.

<HEADLINE> Aetna Boss Apologizes for Remark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Aetna's chief executive has sent an  
apology to a woman he described as a ``weeping widow'' after her 
$120.5 million judgment against a California subsidiary of the 
health insurer. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after the verdict last month, Aetna Chairman Richard L.  
Huber had said the cash award was the work of a ``skillful 
ambulance-chasing lawyer, a politically motivated judge and a 
weeping widow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teresa Goodrich, who had sued Aetna U.S. Healthcare after her  
husband died of cancer in 1995, received a personal note of apology 
this week from Huber about his recent comments. 
</P>
<P>
	In the note, Huber said: ``I want to assure you that I did not  
intend for the comment to minimize in any way the devastation you 
feel at the loss of a loved one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goodrich said Thursday she appreciates Huber's note but that  
``he did not apologize for what Aetna did to my husband, and that 
is really what I would like to have an apology for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aetna spokeswoman Joyce Oberdorf said Huber's apology to Teresa  
Goodrich ``is truly heartfelt'' and noted the company did not 
release it or seek publicity about it. 
</P>
<P>
	``He misspoke. He regrets his words,'' Oberdorf said. ``He has  
no excuse for them and can offer nothing other than an apology.''

<HEADLINE>  Spring Training Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	How was that for a first day of spring training?  
</P>
<P>
	On the day workouts for the 1999 season officially began, two  
stories that will have a profound effect on the two best teams in 
the game shook up baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Yankees completed their winter-long courtship of  
Roger Clemens, acquiring the five-time Cy Young Award winner from 
Toronto for David Wells, Graeme Lloyd and Homer Bush on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just another indication of how the business of baseball  
is these days,'' pitcher Mike Stanton said. ``We won 125 games, but 
you're still always looking to make yourself better. What can you 
say? It's one of those things that happens in baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta Braves were dealt a serious blow when doctors  
announced that first baseman Andres Galarraga has a cancerous tumor 
in his back and will miss the 1999 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the potential for his recovery is very good with  
successful treatment,'' Dr. Lee Kelley said. ``There's no 
widespread involvement, so the outlook is very good. I think 
there's a good possibility that he can look forward to playing in 
2000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Galarraga, 37, will undergo six months of treatment, which will  
include chemotherapy followed by radiation. He is the fourth 
prominent baseball player since 1996 to be stricken with cancer, 
following Brett Butler, Eric Davis and Darryl Strawberry. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sad that he's out for the season, but it's a relief to  
know the cancer hasn't spread,'' manager Bobby Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan Klesko is expected to replace Galarraga, who hit .305 with  
44 homers and 121 RBIs last season. Otis Nixon and Gerald Williams 
are expected to share time in left field in place of Klesko. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our offense will be potent, but obviously not as potent  
without Andres,'' Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens, coming off consecutive Cy Youngs, will report to the  
Yankees on Saturday. He went 20-6 last season, leading the AL in 
ERA (2.65) and strikeouts (271), and tying for the lead in wins. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a group of warriors here and we're getting a very  
big warrior,'' owner George Steinbrenner said. ``He's a monster. 
He's just, `Give me the ball' -- a real competitor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens, who was also sought by Texas, Cleveland and Houston,  
has always been one of Steinbrenner's favorite players, and is the 
only five-time Cy Young winner in baseball history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I met my match in a guy who wants to win,'' Clemens said after  
speaking with The Boss. ``This guy, he settles for nothing less. I 
enjoy that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto had wanted several young prospects from teams when it  
shopped Clemens in December, but the Yankees were able to hold onto 
some of the players the Blue Jays coveted most: outfielder Ricky 
Ledee and pitcher Ramiro Mendoza. 
</P>
<P>
	Wells, a quirky left-hander known as ``Boomer,'' was the toast  
of New York after pitching a perfect game against the Minnesota 
Twins on May 17. He was one of the team's most effective pitchers 
with an 18-4 record and a 3.49 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	Lloyd, a 31-year-old left-hander from Australia, was 3-0 with a  
1.67 ERA in 50 relief appearances last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, a 26-year-old who plays primarily at second base, hit .380  
in 71 at-bats for the Yankees, but was considered expendable 
because New York has Chuck Knoblauch. 
</P>
<P>
	In other baseball news:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Mariano Rivera made it 2-0 for Yankees players in salary  
arbitration when he was awarded $4.25 million rather than the 
team's $3 million offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners are 6-2 in arbitration this year, losing only to Rivera  
and to Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter, who will get $5 million this 
year instead of the team's $3.2 million offer. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Cleveland shortstop Omar Vizquel abandoned the idea of staying  
away from spring training to prod the Indians to improve his $21 
million, seven-year contract.

	``It's safe to say that I'll be there on time,'' said Vizquel,  
who is expected to report Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Randy Johnson said he's much more at ease in his first spring  
training with Arizona than he was the last two years with Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, he was coming off back surgery and was dealing with all  
the doubts about whether he would return to his old intimidating 
form. Last year, he was in a sour mood after the Mariners' decided 
against extending his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is probably going to be one of my better spring  
trainings,'' Johnson said after his first workout with the 
Diamondbacks. ``Last year, I had to deal with a lot of contract 
stuff and I'm really glad it's over and behind me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Right-hander Ben McDonald, sidelined nearly two years because  
of shoulder problems, agreed to a minor league contract with Tampa 
Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	The Devil Rays also learned outfielder Quinton McCracken has a  
sprained right knee that will sideline him 4-6 weeks.

<HEADLINE> Compaq Denies Giving Microsoft Info </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The world's largest computer maker on Friday  
denied that it passed secret information about an upstart software 
company to Microsoft, refuting a sensational charge raised in 
Microsoft's antitrust trial. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for Compaq Computer Corp. acknowledged that the company  
had apologized to Be Inc. of Menlo Park, Calif., for inadvertently 
disclosing to Microsoft that Compaq was talking with Be about its 
technology. But he said Compaq never passed details of that 
technology to Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	``It had nothing to do with the transmittal of proprietary  
information,'' Compaq attorney Tom Siekman said, calling it an 
``inadvertent ... business mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Be, founded in 1990, makes a niche computer operating system.  
Microsoft has invoked Be's product several times at trial -- even 
showing slides to the judge -- to argue that Microsoft is not a 
monpolist and faces competition even with its dominant Windows 
operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	Be's chief executive officer, Jean-Louis Gassee, said Friday he  
couldn't confirm or challenge Compaq's explanation. He said he 
wasn't told the nature of the disclosure, but was told it came in 
an e-mail exchange between Compaq and Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had inadvertently broken our nondisclosure agreement,''  
Gassee said. ``I do not know exactly the extent of the inadvertent 
disclosure; as a result, it is hard for me to challenge statements 
from a Compaq attorney without independent access to the data. We 
have to take it on good faith.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyer David Boies raised the charge Thursday  
trying to discredit testimony from a senior Compaq executive, John 
T. Rose, who is appearing on behalf of Microsoft. Boies asked Rose 
whether he was aware that ``Compaq took information supplied to it 
by Be ... and in violation of the nondisclosure agreement 
transmitted it to Microsoft.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rose answered that he didn't know anything about it.  
</P>
<P>
	The government alleges in its antitrust case that Microsoft  
illegally wields its influence to discourage companies that rely on 
Windows from dealing with its software rivals, such as Netscape 
Communications Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rose testified Friday that Compaq was pressured against  
distributing Netscape's rival Internet software not by Microsoft 
but by America Online Inc., which wanted Compaq to promote its 
online service. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a 1995 agreement, AOL was paying Compaq roughly $6.4  
million a year to feature its software prominently on its Presario 
line of personal computers. Microsoft showed a June 1996 letter 
from an AOL executive who called it ``frankly unacceptable'' that 
Compaq also was distributing Netscape's browser as prominently as 
AOL's own software. 
</P>
<P>
	``To my knowledge, Microsoft never objected'' to Compaq  
distributing software for both AOL and Netscape with its computers, 
Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
	Netscape's chief executive officer, James Barksdale, earlier  
charged that Microsoft intimidated Compaq into dropping plans to 
distribute his company's software. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft also used the sworn statement by a former Compaq  
executive, Celeste Dunn, who acknowledged that the company's 
contracts with Microsoft ``didn't limit us'' from distributing 
Netscape's software. 
</P>
<P>
	But the government later showed a letter Ms. Dunn wrote to  
Microsoft complaining that its contracts ``may prevent us from 
featuring the Netscape browser, all with no replacement for the 
revenue lost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq expected to earn $2.6 million from Netscape for  
distributing its browser during the last half of 1996, according to 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq's witness also sought Friday to explain a key piece of  
evidence, which the judge openly questioned a day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson said a disparity  
over dates in a particular contract with Microsoft ``makes no sense 
at all if this was a genuine agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson noted that the agreement in question was dated August  
1995 but was not signed or executed until June 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose explained that the contract formalized an agreement reached  
in 1995, and was drafted because Microsoft's accountants needed a 
contract in writing to close their fiscal year.

	New Fee Shows Up on Phone Bills  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumers are getting hit with another new fee  
on their monthly phone bills. This one pays for the costs of 
letting customers keep their local telephone numbers after they 
switch carriers -- even though many don't have that choice now. The 
charge, typically 50 cents a month for each phone line, pays for 
local phone companies' costs of complying with a provision in a 
1996 law. Some local phone companies began billing for the new fees 
in February, while others plan to do so over the next several 
months. Businesses also will pay a fee, which can vary by the 
services they get. The charge covers the companies' cost for 
technical changes they must make that allow consumers to keep their 
phone numbers when they switch to a new local phone provider.

	US Trade Deficit Hits New High  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. trade deficit surged to an all-time  
high of $168.6 billion last year as the global financial crisis 
battered American manufacturers and farmers, triggering the first 
decline in exports in 13 years. The Commerce Department reported 
today that last year's deficit jumped 53 percent from a 1997 
imbalance of $110.2 billion, surpassing the old record of $153.4 
billion set in 1987. The deficit in December narrowed unexpectedly 
to $13.8 billion, down 10 percent from November, but analysts saw 
that as a momentary respite from what is likely to be more bad news 
in 1999. 

</P>
<P>
	Consumer Prices Rise Slightly  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans paid more for oranges, airline  
tickets and cigarettes in January but declining prices for pork, 
clothing and used cars helped keep overall inflation mild. The 
Consumer Price Index rose a seasonally adjusted 0.1 percent last 
month following an identical increase in December, the Labor 
Department said today.

NATO bombing campaign is needed there. The Dow Jones industrials 
ended the day up 41.32 at 9,339.95, but a 97-point gain at 3:45

	AmWest Shares Soar on Bid Report

<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Shares in America West Airlines were up today on  
a report that the parent of United Airlines has made a cash offer 
for the low-cost carrier and on expectations that will lead to a 
bidding war. The gain came after The Wall Street Journal reported 
UAL Corp., which controls the nation's largest airline, had moved 
beyond talking in its bid to acquire the ninth-largest airline. UAL 
climbed 25 cents to $59.50 on the NYSE. The Journal, citing people 
familiar with the situation, said America West's board has two 
weeks to respond to UAL. The report did not specify the amount of 
the bid. UAL stock UAL rose 1/4 to 59 1/2; America West rose 2 3/4 to 22 3/4

investors lose money in such schemes. The Securities and Exchange 
Commission will continue to make its enforcement actions against 
small-stock fraud a top priority, SEC officials said at an open 
meeting. The new rules are designed to increase the amount of 
information on small companies available to investors and to make 
it harder for people to fraudulently promote stocks.

isolated with a more ambitious campaign to control exchange rates. 
The United States opposes the proposal by Germany's left-leaning

Division of the company -- which is overseen by the Federal 
Communications Commission -- did not have a breakdown of how many

sweetened, carbonated brown water that became the world's most 
popular soft drink, it's going to market its own brand of the real 
thing. Coke announced it will sell its first bottled water in the 
United States. Dasani is the name. The water, to be sold in a light 
blue plastic bottle, is expected to be available nationwide and in 
Canada before this summer. The name, developed over months, doesn't 
derive from any specific origin but is meant to convey ``a clean, 
fresh taste,'' Coke spokesman Scott Jacobson said. (It is 
pronounced duh-SAW'-nee.)

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Employers should take steps to prevent certain  
on-the-job stress injuries, such as carpal-tunnel syndrome and back 
strains, a federal agency said today in proposed industry 
standards. If approved, the standards could force certain employers 
-- mainly in the industrial sector -- to alter work stations, 
redesign facilities or change tools and equipment. Setting a 
national standard would alleviate the burden on multistate 
businesses from complying with ``a patchwork quilt of different 
ergonomics rules in different states,'' Occupational Safety and 
Health Administration Administrator Charles N. Jeffress said. 
Business groups voiced opposition.

<HEADLINE>  Trinidad To Face Whitaker Saturday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Felix Trinidad's only appearance in Madison  
Square Garden amounted to a cameo experience that did nothing to 
enhance his reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday night, however, the unbeaten IBF welterweight  
champion gets a real opportunity to showcase his talents because 
the opponent will be Pernell Whitaker, a former champion in four 
weight divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	There are the questions of how drug and alcohol problems and a  
16-month layoff will affect the 35-year-old Whitaker. However, 
there is no question he will provide stiffer opposition than that 
put up by Troy Waters, who lasted 2:50 against Trinidad in the 
Garden in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	There also is the question of how making the 147-pound limit  
will affect Trinidad. He weighed himself at the Garden before 
Friday's weigh-in, then left to run around the arena. Trinidad 
weighed in 22 minutes after his name had been called and made the 
weight limit. Earlier, Whitaker weighed in at 147 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad's weight problem would be more serious if the weigh-in  
were the day of the fight. In this era of weighing in the day 
before the bout, boxers enter the ring several pounds above the 
limit. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of the best training camps I've ever hand,'' said  
Whitaker, who declines to discuss the problems that forced him into 
drug and alcohol rehabilitation and have kept him from fighting 
since he outpointed Andre Pestriaev on Oct. 17, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``He still a good boxer, but the drugs and alcohol have taken  
their toll,'' said Trinidad's father, also his trainer and manager. 
``But he still has pride.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whitaker is left-handed but Trinidad expects no problem.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've fought left-handers before,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Trainer Tommy Brooks thinks Whitaker has a lot more left than  
pride. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'd never think he'd been out of the gym,'' Brooks said.  
``Trinidad has a surprise coming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I would not be surprised if he comes right after me,'' said  
the 26-year-old Trinidad, a 5-1 favorite in Las Vegas. ``If he 
does, I'll be ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because of age and possible ring rust -- and Whitaker insists  
there is none -- it will be interesting to see how he holds up in 
the later rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	But that could be a bigger problem for Trinidad, who has gone  
past the fifth round only once (into the eight against Oba Carr in 
1994) since outpointing Hector Camacho in 12 rounds on Jan. 29, 
1994. He also has not fought since he knocked out Mahenge Zulu last 
April 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad's record is 33-0, with 29 knockouts. Whitaker is  
41-2-1, with 17 knockouts. 
</P>
<P>
	This will be Whitaker's third Garden appearance and his first  
since he won the WBC welterweight title on points over James 
``Buddy'' McGirt on March 6, 1993. He lost that title on a disputed 
decision to Oscar De La Hoya on April 12, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The replay of De La Hoya's split-decision win over Ike Quartey  
last Saturday will open the HBO telecast at 9:30 p.m. EST. The 
Trinidad-Whitaker fight should start between 10:30 p.m. and 10:45 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	In a fight that will not be televised, Vince Phillips (39-3, 28  
knockouts), 140 pounds, will defend the IBF junior welterweight 
title against Terronn Millett (20-1-1, 15 knockouts), 140 pounds.

<HEADLINE> Study: Pesticides Too High for Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Parents face a surprising new warning: Beware of  
feeding your kids too many peaches, apples, pears and spinach. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the conclusion of a Consumer Reports study released  
Thursday that claims these healthy foods also contain pesticide 
residues that could be unsafe for young children -- and that the 
government is not doing enough about it. 
</P>
<P>
	Children subjected to the pesticides may be vulnerable to  
neurological damage, according to the findings, which offered no 
clinical proof of such harm. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, published in the March issue, also adds winter squash  
and green beans to the top of a list rating foods for their 
pesticide residue. 
</P>
<P>
	Some scientists were quick to discredit the study.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is nonsense,'' said Bruce Ames, professor of biochemistry  
at the University of California in Berkeley. Focusing on 
``minuscule'' levels of pesticide residues ``is a distraction from 
something far more important -- feeding kids fruits and vegetables 
that prevent cancer and other diseases,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Edward Groth, an environmental biologist at Consumers Union,  
said the findings don't mean parents should stop giving their 
children produce. 
</P>
<P>
	But they ``might want to be careful about the amounts and types  
of fruits and vegetables they serve their children,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer Reports relied on data collected by the U.S. Department  
of Agriculture, focusing on 27,000 samples of 27 food categories 
tested from 1994 to 1997, both domestic and imported. The effects 
of various chemicals were assessed on how they would affect a 
44-pound child, usually an average 5-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
	Virtually all the foods fell within legal limits for pesticide  
residue. However, the government has stricter recommendations for 
what is officially defined as safe -- without appreciable health 
risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Under those standards, U.S.-grown peaches in the study contained  
up to 125 times the levels of the farm chemical methyl parathion 
than the government deems safe for a 44-pound child. The law allows 
twice that amount. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal Environmental Protection Agency is now implementing  
the 1996 Food Quality Protection Act, which requires it to 
reexamine all pesticides and tighten exposure limits to make them 
safer for younger children. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, parents should avoid giving their children large  
amounts of the foods with the highest toxicity scores, Groth said.

<HEADLINE> Charges Dropped in Ariz Prison Plot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- A judge dismissed charges against three men who  
allegedly plotted to kill the Arizona prison director after the 
main witness refused to answer questions during cross-examination. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked about killings he committed while a member of the  
Mexican Mafia prison gang, the witness refused to testify Thursday 
unless he was granted immunity. Prosecutors denied the request and 
had no other evidence to present, so Judge Gregory Martin dismissed 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The witness, Carlos Velez, claimed he and defendant John Alday  
twice were within moments of gunning down Corrections Department 
Director Terry Stewart last summer at a Phoenix restaurant in a 
plot directed by the other defendants, Michael Garcia and Raymond 
Llamas. 
</P>
<P>
	Prison gangs allegedly wanted Stewart dead because his policy of  
locking their leaders in solitary confinement was cutting into 
their control over inmates. 
</P>
<P>
	The three defendants were arrested in December.  
</P>
<P>
	Their attorneys said they didn't believe the assassination plot  
existed and doubted that Velez ever was a member of the prison 
gang. Instead, they said, Velez made up his story to get a reduced 
sentence for more than 10 unrelated crimes, including armed robbery 
and marijuana possession. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is nothing to indicate he was a member of the new  
Mexican Mafia. He has no tattoos, and no one came forward to say he 
was a member. He didn't meet any criteria for what to look for in a 
gang member,'' said Dan Raynak, Garcia's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill FitzGerald, a spokesman for the Maricopa County Attorney's  
Office, said Velez's story and gang membership had been 
corroborated by police and witness testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel very certain that Mr. Stewart's life was in danger and  
may still be in danger,'' FitzGerald said. 
</P>
<P>
	FitzGerald said that in a plea agreement with prosecutors, Velez  
pleaded guilty to a weapons charge and two counts of armed robbery. 
All other charges were dropped, and Velez faces five to 10 years in 
prison.

<HEADLINE> Ark. Woman Claims Clinton Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the first published account of her story,  
an Arkansas woman claims she was sexually assaulted by Bill Clinton 
20 years ago while he was the state's attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
	Juanita Broaddrick's account of the alleged attack by Clinton  
appeared in Friday's op-ed pages of The Wall Street Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart was dismissive of the story.  
</P>
<P>
	``I spend very little time reading the Wall Street Journal  
editorial page,'' Lockhart told reporters. ``They lost me after 
they accused the president of being a drug smuggler and a 
murderer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The story of the alleged attack on Mrs. Broaddrick has been  
circulating for years. She has refused to comment until now. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Mrs. Broaddrick, she first met Clinton when he  
visited the nursing home she ran in 1978. He was running for 
governor at the time; she was a campaign worker. Clinton invited 
her to visit him sometime at campaign headquarters in Little Rock, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Broaddrick said she was in Little Rock for a nursing home  
seminar the next week and called campaign headquarters and arranged 
to meet him for coffee at the hotel where she was staying. Clinton 
suggested they have coffee in her room, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the hotel room, Clinton forced her to have sex, Mrs.  
Broaddrick told the Journal in a detailed account. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was sexually assaulted by Bill Clinton,'' Mrs. Broaddrick  
told The Associated Press in a brief interview Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the AP interview, she said she did not go to the police at  
the time ``because of the mentality of the '70s. There I was, I was 
married, I was also in a relationship with another man, and ... I 
was there alone in a hotel room with the attorney general and I 
didn't think anyone would possibly believe me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why she was telling her story now, she said she was  
countering rumors that she had been bribed and intimidated to stay 
quiet. She also did an interview with NBC that has not been 
broadcast. Mrs. Broaddick said she felt NBC had let her ``hang out 
to dry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NBC spokeswoman Alex Constantinople said, ``We don't comment on  
our news gathering.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for Clinton, Mrs. Broaddrick said, ``I don't have an agenda  
where he is concerned. I could care less what happens to the man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Broaddrick's name first came to light in the 1992  
presidential campaign, when a friend to whom she had confided wrote 
a letter recounting her story. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Paula Jones subpoenaed her and obtained an affidavit  
in which she denied that the president made ``unwelcome sexual 
advances toward me in the late seventies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, during Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's  
investigation of the Monica Lewinsky matter, Mrs. Broaddrick told 
investigators that the affidavit was false, according to a written 
summary of their interview with her. Starr sent some materials 
relating to Mrs. Broaddrick to the House of Representatives, where 
they were available for members to review before voting on 
impeachment.

<HEADLINE> USOC May Reopen Atlanta Bid Inquiry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The U.S. Olympic Committee might take a second  
look at Atlanta's bid for the 1996 Games because IOC members 
received gifts that possibly were too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Schultz, executive director of the USOC, said Friday a  
response to the IOC's request for information about the Atlanta bid 
was due to go out early next week, but that the letter might be 
delayed as investigators might ask further questions of local 
Olympic organizers. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlie Battle, the former vice president for international  
relations for the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games, was 
quoted in Friday's Washington Post as saying the Atlanta bid 
committee ignored the IOC's gift limit. 
</P>
<P>
	The limit at the time for IOC members was $200 but has since  
been reduced to $150. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Associated Press on Friday, Battle  
acknowledged the gifts, which included golf clubs, first-class 
airline tickets and clothing. But he said they were ``pertinent, 
appropriate and were not lavish or out of line in any way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schultz said the investigators most likely will want to question  
Battle further. 
</P>
<P>
	``They'll probably want to know to what extent this went to, and  
that will go into the report to the IOC,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Battle: ``We'll acknowledge what we did and confirm  
everything we did was proper. We've been ready to respond for a 
while, but they've asked us to delay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to WSB-TV, former Atlanta mayor Andy Young, who was  
also a member of the bid committee, defended the gifts as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we exceeded the guidelines, it was in the spirit of  
generosity, not out of any sense of bribing people,'' Young said. 
``Remember, we did not have any money and not a lot of time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC is investigating the Olympic bid process after last  
December's revelations that Salt Lake Olympic officials provided 
college scholarships, free health care and other expensive gifts to 
IOC members and their families while securing the 2002 Winter 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-four IOC members, more than one-fifth the membership,  
have been implicated in the worst corruption scandal in Olympic 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Pound, who is leading the IOC's investigation, has  
requested all bid cities dating to the 1996 Games review their 
dealings with IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound was traveling Friday and unavailable for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Battle said there was ``never any effort or intent to abuse the  
process or to do anything which we felt was not the right thing to 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Battle, a lawyer who now runs an Atlanta development group,  
insisted there was no wrongdoing. He contends IOC rules were vague, 
other bid cities were also lavishing IOC members with travel and 
gifts and Atlanta organizers ``stayed within the spirit of the 
relevant guidelines and accepted practices at that time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An IOC panel this weekend will discuss the bribery scandal. IOC  
spokesman Franklin Servan-Schreiber on Friday said the committee 
has solicited responses from those members implicated in a report 
issued this month by a Salt Lake ethics committee. 
</P>
<P>
	That report cited 10 additional IOC members who were not  
included in the list of 14 implicated earlier during the IOC's 
internal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Any additional expulsions will be submitted to the full general  
assembly at the March 17-18 emergency session in Lausanne, 
Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	In another matter, IOC executive board member Jacques Rogge said  
the games are unlikely to lose their major sponsors, a group that 
includes Coca-Cola, IBM, Kodak and McDonald's. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Rogge, all the major sponsors for the 2000 Games in  
Sydney, Australia, and 2004 Games in Athens, Greece, are standing 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
	But the scandal clearly could hurt the bottom line for host  
cities. The chief executive of the Sydney Games, Sandy Hollway, 
said Thursday his group faces a $130 million shortfall in the 
sponsorship budget. 
</P>
<P>
	John Hancock, another major sponsor, has canceled negotiations  
with NBC for $20 million in ads to protest the IOC's handling of 
the scandal.

<HEADLINE> Ex-GMs Named to Olympic Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Former general managers Pat Gillick, Bob Watson  
and Frank Robinson were appointed Friday to an eight-man steering 
committee that will pick the manager and coaches for the U.S. 
baseball team that will go to the Pan Am Games this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillick, former GM of the Baltimore Orioles and Toronto Blue  
Jays, will chair the committee and Watson, former GM of the New 
York Yankees and Houston Astros, will be the vice chairman. 
Robinson, the former GM of the Orioles, will join them along with 
current GMs Bill Bavasi (Anaheim Angels), Brian Cashman (Yankees), 
Dave Dombrowski (Florida Marlins) and Kevin Towers (San Diego 
Padres). Dan O'Brien of the U.S. Baseball Federation is the final 
member. 
</P>
<P>
	Professionals are allowed in the Olympic baseball tournament for  
the first time, and major league teams will make available any 
players not on their 40-man rosters, meaning mostly players from 
Double-A and Triple-A. The Pan Am baseball tournament, scheduled 
for July 24-Aug. 2 at Winnipeg, Manitoba, serves as the Olympic 
qualifying tournament for the U.S. region. 
</P>
<P>
	The eight-man panel, in addition to picking the manager and  
coaches, will oversee a selection committee that will pick the 
players.

	Juanita Broaddrick's account of the alleged attack by Clinton

</P>
<P>
	Clinton's personal attorney, David Kendall, denied Mrs.  
Broaddrick's account of the events. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any allegation that the president assaulted Mrs. Broaddrick  
more than 20 years ago is absolutely false,'' Kendall said. 
``Beyond that, we're not going to comment.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Walker Says He May Leave Rockies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Larry Walker had everybody's attention  
Friday, and it had nothing to do with his early spring-training 
arrival aboard a purple Harley-Davidson that could be heard five 
blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker, the reigning NL batting champion, said he won't hesitate  
to leave Colorado if the Rockies don't sign him to a long-term 
contract consistent with baseball's spiraling salary scale. 
</P>
<P>
	It doesn't help matters that Walker feels Colorado ownership is  
being critical of him despite a two-year span that has seen him win 
two Gold Gloves, the batting title and the National League MVP 
award. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now in my mind, with the things that have been said  
about me, I don't see myself in this clubhouse next year,'' he 
said. ``This is my last year as far as the way I see it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I get told things that are said about me. I don't have to hear  
them from the goat's mouth. ... That's the way the saying goes. I'm 
not calling (the Rockies) a goat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully something will get done. It's not like I'm throwing  
an ultimatum at them: Get it done by spring training or else I'm 
leaving. That's not the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walker, who will make $5.075 million in the final year of a  
five-year contract, said he is disappointed in both his agents and 
the owners for not getting a deal done sooner. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he will break off contract talks if an agreement is  
not finalized by Colorado's season-opener on April 4. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been here four years now and I like it here,'' he said.  
``That hasn't changed at all. But I'm capable of playing elsewhere. 
I can hit (outside) Coors Field. I've hit at other places, and I've 
proven that, so I'm not afraid to go anywhere else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado owner Jerry McMorris could not be immediately reached  
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he would not mention specific numbers, the 32-year-old  
Walker said he wants to play until he's 40, and he would like this 
to be the last contract of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Given that mathematical outline, the Rockies likely will have to  
be somewhere in the neighborhood of the six-year, $80 million 
contract the Anaheim Angels gave free-agent first baseman Mo Vaughn 
or the seven-year, $91 million deal the New York Mets needed to 
re-sign catcher Mike Piazza. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a professional and it's his time,'' Rockies manager Jim  
Leyland said. ``It's his time to take advantage of all the great 
things he's done on the baseball field. That's the way the system 
is. More power to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walker, who arrived at spring training five days early, followed  
his 1997 MVP season by hitting .366 with 23 homers and 67 RBIs last 
year. He also won his fourth career Gold Glove and played in his 
third All-Star Game. 
</P>
<P>
	The strong numbers prompted the Rockies to offer Walker a  
four-year, $32 million extension in November, but Walker declined. 
He then watched as Vaughn, Piazza and Dodgers pitcher Kevin Brown 
set a gaudy new precedent. Brown received a seven-year, $105 
million contract that included charter flights for his family to 
fly from Georgia to Los Angeles during the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Making $5 million this year is a lot of money right now,''  
Walker said. ``The minimum's a lot of money. Guys making $200,000. 
You ask any family in the country and the majority of them are 
going to say that's ridiculous. That's three, four, five years work 
for some people. Other people, it's more. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a market that's been set for somebody of my standard.  
We all know where that's at. We've seen it with the contracts that 
have been going out this year. It's not something I have to really 
spell out. You look in the paper. You look at other contracts and 
you figure out where I'm at. We have yet to get there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The swelling free-agent market is just one bargaining chip in  
Walker's favor. Taking a page from former Montreal teammate Tim 
Wallach, Walker worked out fastidiously this winter and appears 
leaner and stronger than in previous years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess I don't want to read about how I'm a big fat tub of  
goo lying around doing nothing,'' Walker said. ``It was fun working 
out. You feel better about yourself. I don't think it's something I 
have to do, but it's something that's fun and it's good for me, so 
why not do it?''

<HEADLINE> Magic Johnson Angered by Rodman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- An exasperated Magic Johnson says  
Dennis Rodman is ``trying to hold us hostage,'' and the Los Angeles 
Lakers should forget about signing him. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said the uncertainty surrounding Rodman's situation has  
damaged the image of the team he led to five NBA championships 
during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	And that uncertainty continued Friday as Rodman, appearing on  
ESPN's ``Up Close,'' said he still hasn't made a definite decision 
as to whether he's going to play this season or not. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I play basketball, it will be between two teams, the Lakers  
or Miami, and the odds are that's going to happen within the next 
48 hours,'' Rodman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman said he would announce a decision by Monday at the  
latest, but that might not mean much, since he was quoted by the 
Chicago Sun-Times in Thursday's editions as saying he would sign 
with the Lakers either Thursday or Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	And he reportedly decided a week ago to play for the Lakers.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm tired of this. I am,'' Johnson, a part-owner and vice  
president of the Lakers, said on David Letterman's show Thursday 
night. ``I'm going to say this tonight and I've been holding it. 
It's like a circus now. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are a first-class organization. We do things the right way,  
and right now, he's like trying to hold us hostage. ... He's 
driving me crazy because he's hurting the team, he's hurting the 
organization, so I would love us just to say forget it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, that hasn't been the case. Team spokesman John Black  
said Thursday the Lakers weren't ready to issue an ultimatum to the 
flamboyant seven-time rebounding champion, who met with team owner 
Jerry Buss on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers can sign Rodman only for the veteran minimum of $1  
million, prorated to $600,000 for the shortened season and 
diminishing further with each game he misses. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Rodman will receive $3 million in a deal with Converse  
if he plays in Los Angeles, Chicago or New York. 
</P>
<P>
	At a shootaround Friday, several hours before the Lakers faced  
the San Antonio Spurs at the Forum, Black said he didn't expect any 
action Friday on Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry West, the team's vice president of basketball operations,  
said he knew of no developments and was tired of talking about it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers first expressed interest in Rodman more than two  
weeks ago, and it was reported last weekend he had decided to play 
for them. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, who turns 38 in May, played on championship teams in  
Chicago the last three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman told ``Up Close'' host Gary Miller he was the most  
popular and recognized individual in the world today besides former 
teammate Michael Jordan, who announced his retirement last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman also said he believed Jordan ``understands who Dennis  
Rodman really is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman also acknowledged that he has had differences with Lakers  
star Shaquille O'Neal, but that it wouldn't make any difference if 
he joined the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had words, we've bashed each other here and there,''  
Rodman said. ``Like I said in Chicago with Michael and Scottie 
(Pippen), I don't give a damn if these guys like me or not. I'm 
here to do a job. When the game is over, we go our separate ways.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers certainly could use Rodman. Power forward Robert  
Horry, diagnosed with an irregular heartbeat last Sunday, didn't 
play against the Spurs and will miss at least three more games. 
</P>
<P>
	Black said Horry will wear a monitor Monday and Tuesday before  
being evaluated, meaning the earliest he could return is Thursday 
night against the Los Angeles Clippers. The Lakers play at Seattle 
on Sunday, at Denver on Monday night, and at Vancouver on Tuesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers reached the 12-player limit Friday by placing rookies  
Sam Jacobson and Tyronn Lue on the injured list. Jacobson broke his 
left ring finger during pregame warmups Wednesday night; Lue has 
back spasms.

<HEADLINE> Herpes Virus Said Killing Elephants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- At least 10 elephants living in U.S. zoos have  
died after being infected with a previously unknown form of the 
herpes virus, researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	In a study published today in the journal Science, scientists at  
Johns Hopkins in Baltimore and at the National Zoo in Washington 
report that they have isolated and identified a lethal virus that 
apparently can jump from African elephants to Asian elephants. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is very troubling because these are endangered species  
and also because there may still be carrier African elephants in 
the zoos,'' Johns Hopkins researcher and study co-author Gary 
Hayward said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The study found that seven of the of 34 elephants born in U.S.  
and Canadian zoos between 1983 and 1996 died from the virus. Study 
of stored tissue shows that three animals earlier died of the 
virus, and two others may have died of the disease, the researchers 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the dead animals, all but two were Asian elephants.  
</P>
<P>
	Although they closely resemble each other, Asian and African  
elephants are distinctly different. The Asian elephant is the one 
most frequently bred in captivity and used as a working animal. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers said the herpes virus attacks the blood vessels  
of the heart, liver and other organs in the elephants and can cause 
death with only a few days. 
</P>
<P>
	Laboratory studies uncovered the herpes virus, which had not  
been previously identified. The researchers then tested blood and 
tissue samples from healthy African elephants living in the wild 
and found that they had a herpes virus that was identical to the 
virus that killed the zoo animals. The virus usually is not deadly 
for the African elephants. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers said it appears that the Asian elephants were  
infected when they came in contact with African elephants in zoos. 
</P>
<P>
	One elephant in Florida was cured of the infection when it was  
treated with famciclovir, an antiviral drug developed to treat 
herpes in humans. 
</P>
<P>
	The elephant herpes is similar to a virus that causes cold sores  
and painful genital sores in humans.

<HEADLINE> UMass-Amherst Alters Admissions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The University of Massachusetts at Amherst  
announced Friday it will change its admissions and financial aid 
affirmative action practices to rely less on race and more on 
social class. 
</P>
<P>
	School administrators expect the change will result in a drop of  
minority representation in the campus' freshman class from 19 to 20 
percent to as low as 13 percent, UMass spokeswoman Kay Scanlan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The campus is really committed to diversity and now we're  
struggling to find out how we can maintain our goals in the new 
legal environment,'' Scanlan said, citing cases in which 
affirmative action policies were struck down in Washington, Texas 
and California. 
</P>
<P>
	About 19 percent of the 3,800 students in the freshman class at  
UMass-Amherst this year are members of minority groups, which is 
about the same percentage of minorities in the graduating classes 
of Massachusetts high schools. 
</P>
<P>
	UMass-Amherst plans to broaden its diversity definition away  
from race and ethnicity to include age, gender, family income and 
whether the applicant would be the first generation in his or her 
family to attend college.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Trade Deficit Hits New High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The economic crisis that has pushed one-third  
of the globe into recession caused U.S. exports to drop for the 
first time in 13 years in 1998 and sent the nation's trade deficit 
to its highest level in history. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department reported Friday that the imbalance  
between what America imports and what it sells abroad soared to 
$168.8 billion last year, 53 percent above the 1997 level and 
topping the old record of $153.3 billion set in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	While the year managed to end on a slightly positive note with a  
lower-than-expected December deficit of $13.8 billion, economists 
warned that the trade gap will widen further this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no way that you can conclude the worst is over,''  
said Lawrence Chimerine, chief economist at the Economic Strategy 
Institute, a Washington think tank. ``The deficit was up $58 
billion last year and we could easily see another $40 billion to 
$50 billion increase this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The latest worry is Latin America, a region that accounts for  
one-fifth of U.S. export sales. Brazil, the region's largest 
economy, was forced to devalue its currency last month and the fear 
is that a recession there will quickly spread to other nations in 
the region. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have Japan, Southeast Asia and Russia already in  
recessions, Latin America probably going into a recession and 
Europe slowing down,'' said Gordon Richards, chief economist at the 
National Association of Manufacturers. ``That doesn't add up to an 
optimistic forecast on trade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	American exports fell by 0.7 percent in 1998, the first annual  
decline since 1985, as sales of everything from soybeans to autos 
slumped. The global slowdown translated into the worst year for 
farmers in a decade and contributed to a loss of 234,000 
manufacturing jobs last year. 
</P>
<P>
	But despite those negative impacts, the overall U.S. economy  
continued to power ahead as strong domestic demand offset the loss 
of overseas sales. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the lower-than-expected trade gap in December probably  
means that the government will revise up its estimate of overall 
economic growth from October through December from a sizzling 5.6 
percent to an even faster 6 percent pace, many analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	But growth is expected to slow markedly this year, reflecting  
less consumer demand and continuing troubles in the trade sector. 
Most economists aren't expecting a recession unless renewed global 
turbulence causes a big tumble in American markets that makes 
consumers fearful. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration, worried that the record trade  
deficits will cause a backlash against its free trade policies, has 
been stressing with repeated urgency the need for Japan, the 
world's second largest economy, to pull out of its worst recession 
in 50 years and for Europe to do more to buy imports from crisis 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Japan and Europe must move forward to ... help promote  
economic stability and growth in emerging economies,'' Commerce 
Secretary William Daley said in commenting on the latest trade 
figures. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin was expected to make the 
same point during meetings of major industrial countries in Bonn, 
Germany on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	In other economic news Friday, the Labor Department reported  
that inflation remained tame with consumer prices rising a barely 
perceptible 0.1 percent in January as higher costs for oranges, 
airline tickets and cigarettes were offset by price declines 
elsewhere, including the biggest one-month drop in clothing costs 
in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	The politically sensitive trade deficits with both Japan and  
China widened last year. The imbalance with China rose 15 percent 
to a record $56.9 billion, the highest ever for any country other 
than Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	America's deficit with Japan rose 14 percent to $64.1 billion,  
the second worst showing on record, surpassed only by a $65.7 
billion deficit with Japan in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. deficit with all Pacific Rim countries, the hardest hit  
region from the global crisis, rose 33 percent in 1998 to $160.4 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	These increases are coming as Clinton, who took office vowing to  
open markets for U.S. industries, is under increased pressure to 
erect protectionist barriers. The steel industry has filed a number 
of cases petitioning the government to impose punitive tariffs and 
other industries from machine tools to textiles are considering 
filing their own cases. 
</P>
<P>
	For 1998, total exports dropped 0.7 percent to $931.3 billion,  
the first setback since 1985. Before last year, big annual gains in 
exports have supplied fully one-third of total economic growth for 
a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Imports last year jumped 5 percent to a record $1.10 trillion.  
The increase would have been even larger except that falling world 
energy demand pushed down the price of imported oil to a 
24-year-low of $11.52 per barrel.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Prices Rise Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans paid more for oranges, airline  
tickets and cigarettes in January but declining prices for pork, 
clothing and used cars helped keep overall inflation mild. 
</P>
<P>
	The Consumer Price Index rose a seasonally adjusted 0.1 percent  
last month following an identical increase in December, the Labor 
Department said today. 
</P>
<P>
	A substantial 0.5 percent rise in January prices charged by  
producers such as factories, reported Thursday, apparently was not 
passed on to retail shoppers. 
</P>

down by a seasonally adjusted 1.1 percent, the largest one-month 
drop in a decade.

<HEADLINE> Ford Fills 2 High Jobs From Outside </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. has filled two more top jobs with  
executives from consumer products companies as part of President 
Jac Nasser's campaign to make the No. 2 automaker more responsive 
to its customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford today named Louise Goeser vice president for quality.  
Goeser comes from Whirlpool Corp., where she was vice president for 
corporate quality and general manager of the refrigerator product 
team. Her appointment came one day after Ford named General 
Electric Co. executive George Murphy as general marketing manager 
for the Ford division. 
</P>
<P>
	Goeser, 45, becomes the third female vice president at Ford. She  
replaces Ken Dabrowski, who retired in October. In the interim, the 
responsibility for quality issues was handled by Richard 
Parry-Jones, vice president for product development. Before joining 
Whirlpool, Goeser was an executive with Westinghouse Electric Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy, 43, is vice president of worldwide product management  
for GE Lighting in Cleveland and previously worked for Coca-Cola 
Co. At Ford, he will replace Darryl Hazel, who was named executive 
director of the Ford customer service division of North America. 
</P>
<P>
	The appointments of Goeser and Murphy are effective March 1.  
</P>
<P>
	Ford has been the most aggressive of the Detroit automakers in  
going outside the company and, in some cases, outside the 
traditionally insular industry for executive talent. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasser, who took over as president and chief executive at the  
start of the year, has said he wants to take Ford beyond just 
engineering and manufacturing vehicles and place more emphasis on 
satisfying customers and anticipating their needs. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of that shift is seen in Ford's moves in the past year to  
consolidate some of its dealerships and form the Ford Retail 
Network, which is giving the manufacturer a more direct role in 
selling and servicing cars and trucks in some cities. Ford also 
owns the Hertz rental car agency and is looking at expanding its 
role in other vehicle-related businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's those types of activities where we get a closer link to  
the customer and a connection with the marketplace and an insight 
into what matters to consumers,'' Nasser said in a recent 
interview.

<HEADLINE> Comedy Central Names New CEO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Comedy Central, home of the irreverent ``South  
Park,'' has appointed its top advertising executive Larry Divney as 
its new president and CEO. 
</P>
<P>
	Divney replaces Doug Herzog, who left late last year to become  
the top programmer at Fox. He was selected over several bigger 
media names, including former NBC Entertainment chief Warren 
Littlefield, former Spy and New York magazine editor Kurt Andersen, 
former David Letterman producer Robert Morton and Jeff Ross, 
executive producer of ``Late Night with Conan O'Brien.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Due largely to the popularity of the foul-mouthed cartoon  
cutouts of ``South Park,'' Comedy Central is among the most 
profitable cable networks, beating its ad sales projections last 
year by more than $30 million. It is owned jointly by Time Warner 
and Viacom. 
</P>
<P>
	The growing network, seen now in 58 million homes, also  
telecasts ``The Daily Show'' with comedian Jon Stewart, the game 
show ``Win Ben Stein's Money'' and the cartoon, ``Dr. Katz: 
Professional Therapist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Divney has directed Comedy Central's advertising sales since the  
network's inception in 1991, and has worked at CNN, MTV and the A&AMP;E 
Network. Before getting into television, he managed ABC radio 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
	Divney said he wants to convince Comedy Central's corporate  
parents to spend more of the network's profits in marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to let people know what's on the air,'' he said. ``The  
most important thing is to build the asset.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Comedy Central has a handful of new shows in development. Two  
that will start this year are ``Strangers With Candy,'' a comedy 
about a 47-year-old dropout who returns to high school, and ``The 
Man Show,'' described as an unapologetic look at what men do.

<HEADLINE> Rogan Shrugs Off Democrats' Threats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- A feisty James Rogan returned to his  
congressional district, dismissing challenges by Democrats who vow 
to unseat him because of his role in President Clinton's 
impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll wear that bull's eye proudly,'' he said Thursday. ``Let  
them go ahead and make an issue of it because I might just end up 
jamming it down their throat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rogan, among the most visible House impeachment managers, toured  
his 27th Congressional District for the first time since Clinton's 
acquittal on obstruction of justice and perjury charges a week ago. 
No one but reporters asked him about the impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The Glendale Republican was re-elected in November by a bare 51  
percent to 46 percent and is considered vulnerable in the 2000 
election. His district, once a conservative stronghold, has become 
more moderate with an increase in black, Hispanic and 
Asian-American voters. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Municipal Court judge and deputy district attorney  
said he was proud of serving on the House Judiciary Committee and 
was ready to face any challenges. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let (Democrats) go out and explain why sexual harassment laws  
and civil rights laws are only applicable as long as it isn't their 
guy who's violating them,'' he said. ``That's a debate I look 
forward to engaging in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rogan said he's ready to move on to other issues, but some of  
his constituents said the impeachment saga may take time to 
overcome. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got some fences to mend around here,'' said David Rose, a  
44-year-old Democrat who voted for Rogan in the November election. 
</P>
<P>
	Has his opinion of the congressman changed since the trial? ``A  
lot less positive,'' Rose answered. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogan does have devoted supporters, including South Pasadena  
resident Ralph Rivet, 81. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll just have to work to overcome'' the impeachment fallout,  
he said. ``People are going to have strong feelings about that. 
What we have to do is turn the focus to the good work Rogan does in 
Congress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rogan began the day with an appearance at a Glendale elementary  
school, telling a classroom of fifth-graders about the dangers of 
drugs. A picture of a smiling Bill Clinton hung in the corner of 
the room. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are you going to run for governor or president?'' one boy  
asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``From what they tell me in the newspapers, I'll be lucky to run  
for Congress,'' he replied amid laughter from teachers and 
reporters.

<HEADLINE> Wis Governor Handicaps GOP Hopefuls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, regularly listed  
among the Republicans who have a legitimate shot at the presidency 
in 2000, has offered his impressions on the prospects of the GOP 
hopefuls. 
</P>
<P>
	During an interview Thursday on WTMJ radio, Thompson was asked  
to handicap the Republican contenders. 
</P>
<P>
	On Texas Gov. George W. Bush: ``He hasn't really done much as a  
governor in regards of doing anything new or innovative.'' But 
Thompson said Bush is articulate, has a ``great name'' and comes 
from a wealthy state. 
</P>
<P>
	On Elizabeth Dole: ``A wonderful lady, very smart, very  
photogenic, very articulate. ... Her weaknesses are she's never 
been elected. I just don't think the presidency should be an 
entry-level job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On publisher Steve Forbes: ``Very conservative, very principled,  
very intelligent. ... The negative is, he's never run for office 
and he also is super-rich.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On former Vice President Dan Quayle: ``Dan Quayle is a very nice  
man and knows the issues, and he's very principled and I like Dan. 
... I just think he's always going to be looked at as the 
individual who added the `e' to `potato.''' 
</P>
<P>
	On former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander: ``His problem is, he's  
not electrifying. ... He's just not inspiring, but he's a 
wonderful, wonderful person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, 58, who won a fourth term as Wisconsin's governor in  
November, was considered by Bob Dole as a potential running mate in 
1996. He said expects to make a decision on running this summer.

<HEADLINE> Judge Slams Attempt at Removing Her </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) -- A Texas judge who laughed when a campaign  
opponent criticized leave she took to spend time with her children 
was ineligible for last fall's election and should step down, a 
judge has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	Lubbock County Court at Law Judge Susan Scolaro was elected  
unopposed Nov. 3. Her rival in the Republican primary, Bob Jones, 
had said a leave of absence she took to spend time with her two 
children left her 15 days short of the required four continuous 
years of legal practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Bill McCoy ruled this month that Ms. Scolaro wasn't an  
eligible candidate and should resign. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Scolaro isn't leaving, despite a prosecutor's threat to jail  
her. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an issue that has never been presented to the Texas  
Supreme Court,'' Ms. Scolaro said. ``For the sake of any other 
female attorney that might ever want to take a leave of absence, 
I'm going to see this through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While lawyers don't necessarily have to be working cases to be  
considered active, they must be registered with the state bar. 
</P>
<P>
	The check Ms. Scolaro sent to the bar to return to active status  
shows that she had been reinstated three years and 350 days at the 
time of the election -- 15 days short of four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Scolaro argues that the law shouldn't be interpreted to  
include leaves of absence. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it comes to running for a judgeship, their argument is  
that if you stop practicing law to stay home with children, when 
you come back you will be viewed as a brand-new attorney,'' Ms. 
Scolaro said this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``To say four continuous years just doesn't make much sense. I  
could have been sick for 15 days. Does that mean I wouldn't be 
eligible?'' she said. ``What if I missed two days ... would I then 
be ineligible?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ector County District Attorney John Smith, serving as an  
independent prosecutor in the case, argues that what Ms. Scolaro 
was doing or how long she was inactive doesn't matter.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An educator who has worked to reform each of  
the 163 schools in the Memphis, Tenn., district was named the 1999 
superintendent of the year Friday by the American Association of 
School Administrators. 
</P>
<P>
	Naomi Geraldine ``Gerry'' House, superintendent of the  
112,000-student district, received the honor at the organization's 
national conference in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	House said in her application that educators must try innovative  
ways to reach a new generation of students. Her nearly seven-year 
tenure includes such innovations as Saturday ``academies'' in math, 
science and technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today's kindergartners come to school with years of exposure  
to ... home computers, and high-tech movies,'' said House. ``It is 
unrealistic to expect these same `surround sound' children to ... 
sit quietly and passively for six or seven hours a day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House, 51, was named Tennessee's top superintendent last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Pounding rebel bases in northern Iraq and  
hunting fighters in their mountain hideouts, Turkey's army is 
bearing down hard on a Kurdish guerrilla group following the 
capture of its leader. 
</P>
<P>
	The Turkish military released no casualty figures from the  
fighting in northern Iraq against Kurdish rebels loyal to Abdullah 
Ocalan, who was abducted by Turkish commandos in Kenya on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	With Ocalan's rebel Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, apparently  
leaderless, the military kept up its latest incursion into 
neighboring northern Iraq in pursuit of guerrillas who have bases 
there. Iraq denies harboring the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kurd rebels, who want to carve out an autonomous homeland in  
southeast Turkey, have offered to negotiate, but Turkey has 
rejected the offer and is pressing forward with a military 
solution. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkish newspapers said that about 10,000 soldiers had stormed  
into northern Iraq. Baghdad has strongly denounced the incursion 
and has demanded that Turkey withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
	In southern Turkey, meanwhile, pro-Kurd demonstrators protesting  
the capture of Ocalan (pronounced OH'-jah-lahn) fired on police 
Thursday, wounding three officers and a protester, the official 
Anatolia news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The clash in Ceyhan, 330 miles south of Ankara, was the first  
violent confrontation between Kurds and police since Ocalan's 
capture. 
</P>
<P>
	Turks have been celebrating since the capture of Ocalan, and  
many hope that his trial will help lead to an end to the conflict. 
Some 37,000 people have died since fighting erupted in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said the government would renew a  
call to rebels to surrender, assuring them that parliament would 
pass a law providing lenient punishment after elections in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecevit also hinted that Turkey received outside help in  
capturing Ocalan, a newspaper said today. He was quoted by national 
daily Hurriyet as saying that the decision to capture Ocalan was 
made after Turkey received information about his whereabouts 
earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked whether assistance from the United States or any  
other country helped Turkey locate Ocalan in Kenya, Ecevit said: 
``I can't reveal that. I can't give country name. But you can make 
your own guess.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reports said that the intelligence agencies of the United States  
or Israel had a hand in Ocalan's capture. Israel denied a role, and 
Washington said it did not have a hand in the rebel leader's 
capture or transfer to Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
	Fallout was heavy after the Turkish commando operation that  
snatched Ocalan from Greek diplomatic hands in Nairobi, Kenya on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Greek Cabinet ministers, including the foreign minister,  
were forced to resign, and in Nairobi, the Cabinet was reshuffled. 
</P>
<P>
	The capture of Ocalan fueled Kurdish protests in Europe for the  
third day on Thursday, particularly in Germany, where it was feared 
the Kurdish conflict would spill over onto its soil. 
</P>
<P>
	In Germany, home to Western Europe's largest Kurdish community,  
Kurds attacked eateries run by Turks in Heilbronn and Muenster, 
beating six people. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Kurds were shot to death by Israeli guards Wednesday as  
they tried to storm the Israeli consulate in Berlin, after reports 
Israel helped Turkey track down Ocalan. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkish prosecutors began their interrogation of Ocalan on  
Thursday, traveling to the tiny prison-island of Imrali, off the 
coast of Istanbul. 
</P>
<P>
	The military released videotapes Thursday showing Ocalan  
drenched in sweat and looking uncomfortable, standing between two 
red Turkish flags at the prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkish stations ran the footage with a caption reading: ``This  
is the image Turkey has been waiting for for the past 15 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan is expected to be formally charged next week.  
</P>
<P>
	In a separate matter, Ocalan's Dutch lawyers say they have been  
put under extra police protection after calls from Turkey's Foreign 
Ministry to protest their activities, according to Ocalan's chief 
attorney Britta Boehler. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were advised by the (Dutch) interior and justice ministries  
to take on extra protection and the police have stepped up 
surveillance of the building,'' Boehler said from her office in 
Amsterdam.

<HEADLINE> Historic Black Church To Be Saved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HANOVER, Ind. (AP) -- They came to church every other Sunday,  
four ladies perched like bookends in the wooden pews. They stayed 
even when the roof leaked, the plumbing didn't work -- and no one 
else was there. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the place where they had exchanged wedding vows,  
baptized children, celebrated Easter. This was their house of 
worship, but over the years it had become so much more. 
</P>
<P>
	So when St. Stephen's African Methodist Episcopal Church began  
crumbling, when old folks died and young ones moved away, the 
ladies -- all past age 65 -- held on. Decade after decade, as their 
gait slowed, as their eyesight dimmed, they came to pray. 
</P>
<P>
	But no church can stay alive with just four members. So when  
word came from the minister last year that St. Stephen's -- a 
95-year-old building founded by descendants of slaves -- couldn't go 
on this way much longer, it seemed a piece of history was about to 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
	That's when a younger woman from another church stepped in.  
</P>
<P>
	Sue Livers, 49, who grew up in this Ohio River town, joined the  
ladies to save St. Stephen's. It was her tribute to a generation of 
women who had raised families even as they scrubbed floors as 
maids, raised other people's children and survived the indignities 
of segregated schools, movie houses and lunch counters. 
</P>
<P>
	She knew what the church meant to them.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is where you came to be rejuvenated,'' she says. ``When  
nobody else wanted you, when you couldn't go to the store, when you 
had to ride at the back of the bus, when you had to walk because 
there wasn't a cab for you and the schools didn't want you, you 
knew your church was your home. It was your sanctuary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Or as Miss Josephine Whittaker, the 84-year-old  
great-grandmother and backbone of the church, summed it up before 
her death Feb. 8: 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like your right arm.''  
</P>
<P>
	To stay open, St. Stephen's needs dollars and members -- not many  
of either, but enough to restore the white, wood-frame church, pay 
assessments and the preacher, who now volunteers his services, and 
fill 16 whitewashed pews. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, more than more $21,000 has been raised of the nearly  
$57,000 that architects estimate it will take to repair just the 
outside of the sagging building. 
</P>
<P>
	The church, though, needs a total facelift. The paint is  
peeling, part of the rotting roof is covered with a blue plastic 
tarp, there is no water or bathroom, the pale-green ceiling is 
stained brown from water leaks, the piano is out of tune. 
</P>
<P>
	But on the back wall is a faded sign: ``God Answers Prayers.''  
And hope always has prevailed here. 
</P>
<P>
	In its glory days, St. Stephen's was a gathering spot for the  
town's small black community. Prayer groups met, children clustered 
in the Sunday school, and young women could eye the pool of 
potential husbands when they dished out homemade ice cream and 
blackberry cobbler from picnic tables on the lawn during August 
``homecomings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the ladies, life's biggest celebrations revolved around St.  
Stephen's. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Josephine came here first as a little girl, when Model Ts  
and horse-drawn buggies traveled along muddy roads and church 
ladies carrying towels escorted her through the winding hills to be 
baptized in the chilly waters of the Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	She was married in the church in 1942, decked out that day in  
pink and navy. She taught Sunday school, as had her mother, Miss 
Jane. ``Miss'' is a term of respect still used around here. 
</P>
<P>
	Until she became too ill, Miss Josephine would pad across the  
street from her house every other Sunday morning, unlock the door, 
turn on the heat and prepare for Communion, pouring homemade wine 
into tiny plastic glasses. 
</P>
<P>
	Then she'd wait to greet the minister, imported from a nearby  
town. When the other ladies arrived, they'd all take their favorite 
seats -- at each end of two pews. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without the church, I don't think you'd have too much,'' Miss  
Josephine said weeks before she died, her voice decimated by 
chemotherapy to a ragged rasp. ``It was something to do. It was the 
right thing to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She was thinking of St. Stephen's, too, in her final days,  
telling Mrs. Livers in their last conversation: ``I don't want the 
church to go to ruins. I want to make sure that you keep it 
going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davidteen Watson, 66, shares her loyalty, having attended the  
church since her parents brought her here as child. One Sunday 
nearly a half century ago, she and her husband-to-be, Leon, who was 
heading off to the Korean War, walked down the narrow aisle, 
interrupted the sermon and asked to be married. They were. Then the 
service continued. 
</P>
<P>
	It seemed nothing could stop the church, not even a cross  
burning on the lawn outside remembered by Miss Leatha Davis, who 
was baptized, married and raised four children there. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Leatha, who still rises before dawn to bake fruit pies at  
age 85, dug plumbing lines for St. Stephen's. Her father, the son 
of slaves, and her husband helped put up the building, nailing 
together lumber salvaged from a nearby church. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Stephen's is in Jefferson County, an area linked to one of  
the major routes of the Underground Railroad, the secret movement 
that helped Southern slaves escape to the free North. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Livers hopes the church's historical links will help earn  
it a spot on the registry of national landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
	And Anna Davis Jones, the fourth member of the church and Miss  
Leatha's 68-year-old stepdaughter, says preserving the past and 
passing on a legacy is what this rescue mission is all about. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is for the young people,'' she says. ``They need to know  
how the older people paved the way so they could have a place to 
worship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one appreciates their devotion more than Pastor Leonard Miles  
Sr. who has ministered to the ladies for about four years, driving 
66 miles every other Sunday to preach. The alternate-week services 
are due to the small membership. 
</P>
<P>
	Miles also throws $40 of his own money into the collection plate  
at the end of each sermon to help the ladies, who have, on a few 
occasions, dug into their own pocketbooks to pay the church's water 
or electricity bills. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a bond between them and me,'' he says, standing at the  
pulpit as worshippers arrive. ``I love them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he knows St. Stephen's can't survive on the shoulders of a  
few determined widows. ``It's going to take other people to have 
the same desires they have,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	And that word has spread.  
</P>
<P>
	One recent Sunday, nearly two dozen folks worshipped at St.  
Stephen's, including some of the ladies' grandchildren and 
great-grandchildren, 
</P>
<P>
	Some old-timers also have returned, including Estelle Holloway,  
a 71-year-old retired teacher, who sang hymns with her husband, 
Clem, from worn red-leather Bibles in the same room they were wed. 
</P>
<P>
	After more than 30 years away, they heard about the church's  
predicament and now drive three hours round-trip from their 
Louisville, Ky., home for services. 
</P>
<P>
	``The church back then was the only place we could go to enjoy  
ourselves ... the only place where we could free safe and free,'' 
she says wistfully. ``It feels great to be back. Was it Thomas 
Wolfe who said you can't go home again? Well, I feel like I can.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Atlanta Hawks released center Scot Pollard  
and guard Shammond Williams on Friday to reach the 12-man roster 
limit. 
</P>
<P>
	Pollard began the season on the injured list and was activated  
for two games, but didn't play. The second-year player was acquired 
prior to the season from Detroit in a trade for Christian Laettner. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, a second-round draft pick from North Carolina,  
impressed the Hawks during training camp but played only four 
minutes in two games once the season began. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition of Anthony Johnson ended any hope of Williams  
getting significant playing time at point guard, where Mookie 
Blaylock is the starter. 
</P>
<P>
	After the lockout, teams were allowed to carry 14 players on  
their active roster until Friday. The Hawks made their cuts shortly 
before playing the Orlando Magic.

	BEAUMONT, Texas (AP) -- Seven staffers at a home for the mentally

were cajoled into having sex so the workers could watch and laugh. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas Department of Human Services and the attorney

appointed a trustee to oversee the 130-bed Beaumont Living Center. 
No charges have been filed.

manages the home, said the seven staff members, both male and 
female, were immediately fired Feb. 11 when authorities told 
management about it. 
</P>
<P>
	A co-worker who heard about the Feb. 6 incident reported it.  
</P>
<P>
	The staffers allegedly set up the sexual encounter between a  
47-year-old woman and a 50-year-old man for their entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, a staff member allegedly tried to force sexual  
intercourse between a 47-year-old woman and a 50-year-old man. The 
woman apparently had been offered a cigarette to participate.

outside the bedroom with the door partially open, watching and 
laughing,'' according to court papers filed the state.

<HEADLINE> Giants Sign Collins; Release Kanell </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Two seasons ago, quarterback Kerry  
Collins had the expansion Carolina Panthers 60 minutes from the 
Super Bowl in just his second year in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	But when the 1999 season opens, Collins will be on the bench for  
the New York Giants, coach Jim Fassel said Friday after the team 
signed the troubled free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kent Graham is our starter,'' Fassel said, asserting there  
would be no open competition in training camp. ``Kent has earned 
that right by what he did last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Fassel insisted that Collins has a  
``major-league arm'' and the potential to take the New York Giants 
``to the next level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team on Friday also released quarterback Danny Kanell,  
stunning the former starter. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins, whose recent difficulties include a drunken driving  
arrest, issued a statement saying, ``A great deal has happened in 
my life over the past year or so, and I am looking forward to a 
fresh start with the Giants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fassel, a former quarterback coach, admitted he was eager to  
rehabilitate Collins, who Fassel said needs to make playing 
quarterback ``the complete focus of his life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fassel said Collins will be at Giants Stadium the entire  
offseason, lifting weights, watching tapes and preparing to work on 
his fundamentals. 
</P>
<P>
	``If handled right and developed ... you see a very, very big  
upside,'' Fassel said, noting that Collins, at 6-foot-5 and 240 
pounds, can be a big, physical player. 
</P>
<P>
	A meeting with Collins this week persuaded Fassel that the  
quarterback is ready to work. ``He said all the right things, and 
in a convincing way,'' Fassel said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Graham said he expects to be the starter. ``Jim  
gave me a job to do at the end of last year, win games, and we went 
5-1. I feel I had earned the right to start the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Collins struggled last season with Carolina, who made him the  
fifth overall pick in the 1995 draft out of Penn State. He was 
released on Oct. 13 after reportedly telling then-Panthers coach 
Dom Capers that he didn't have the heart for pro football. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins was signed by New Orleans, and returned with the Saints  
to play the Panthers two weeks later. He was arrested about nine 
hours later in Charlotte, N.C., on drunken driving charges. A 
hearing earlier this week on the case was adjourned, and no new 
date was set. 
</P>
<P>
	He was waived after the season by the Saints, for whom he was  
94-for-191 passing for 1,202 yards with four touchdowns and 10 
interceptions. Overall, he was 170-for-353 for 2,213 yards and 12 
TDs with 15 interceptions 
</P>
<P>
	The Daily News reported Friday that Collins agreed to a  
four-year, $16 million deal, including a signing bonus of almost $5 
million. With a minimum salary of $400,000, he would count $1.6 
million against the 1999 salary cap. Kanell's release clears $2 
million from the salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Post said Collins is expected to receive a  
four-year deal for slightly more that $16 million, with a $4 
million signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	Kanell figured he would have to take a pay cut, because of cap  
concerns, but did not expect to be cut. 
</P>
<P>
	``I kind of think I got a quick hook. But that's the business,''  
Kanell said from Florida. ``No team has ever cut me before. It will 
be a motivating factor for me, pushing me to work harder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kanell, a three-year Giant, said he learned of the deal Thursday  
night, and is already looking for a new team. 
</P>
<P>
	Kanell admitted being a little bitter at the Giants, calling his  
release a ``mistake,'' but he acknowledged his performance in 1998 
did not compare to 1997, when he led the team to the NFC East 
title. 
</P>
<P>
	The 25-year-old Kanell rarely displayed consistency this past  
season, posting a 3-7 record, completing 160 of 299 passes for 
1,603 yards, 11 TDs and 10 interceptions. He seemed to lose his 
confidence as the team lost three straight before he was benched 
for Graham. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe I shouldn't have played after I had surgery. Maybe I  
shouldn't have played when my back hurt,'' Kanell said. ``But I'm 
not one to make excuses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graham led New York to five wins in the last six games,  
including a stunning 20-16 decision on Dec. 13 that ended Denver's 
hopes for a perfect season.

<HEADLINE> Clemens Trade Another Hit on Bosox </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	There are people all around New England convinced the Boston Red  
Sox exist for no other reason than to provide endless amusement for 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	From Babe to Bucky, from Buckner to Boggs, the Red Sox have  
become a consistent punchline for New York baseball fans. 
</P>
<P>
	And now, one final laugh at Boston's expense: Roger Clemens is  
pitching for the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Red Sox fans aren't fooled. To them, the Clemens trade is not  
about improving a team that won 125 games last season. Instead, the 
deal is nothing more than one more poke in the Red Sox pin cushion. 
</P>
<P>
	And this one was applied with a harpoon.  
</P>
<P>
	Yankee Stadium will never be mistaken for ``Rick's Cafe  
Americain,'' but of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the 
world, Clemens suddenly shows up in the South Bronx. 
</P>
<P>
	This is hostile territory for Boston fans. Twenty-four World  
Series banners belong to this team, all of them won since 1923 -- 
five years after the Red Sox last captured one. 
</P>
<P>
	So why couldn't Clemens settle someplace less offensive? Houston  
would have been fine. Texas would have been OK. Both were in the 
running for the Rocket. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he winds up in New York. For Boston fans, that's like  
Bucky Dent hitting the home run all over again or Bill Buckner 
booting that easy ground ball one more time. 
</P>
<P>
	But this is not Sparky Lyle going from Boston to New York in an  
ill-conceived trade for Danny Cater and winning a Cy Young Award. 
This is not Luis Tiant making the same move and inflicting some 
psychological punishment on a franchise that hardly needed another 
dose. This is not perennial batting champion Wade Boggs turning his 
back on Boston to sign with the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	This is bigger.  
</P>
<P>
	This is Clemens, symbol of the Red Sox for so many years,  
equipped with five Cy Young Awards, 233 lifetime wins, a pair of 
record 20-strikeout games and a one-way ticket to Cooperstown. 
</P>
<P>
	Which is also in New York, by the way.  
</P>
<P>
	This is the sale of Babe Ruth reincarnated. This time, the Red  
Sox can plead innocence -- or maybe ignorance. They were 
enthusiastic participants when Ruth was sold to New York in 1920, 
but merely interested bystanders to the trade of Clemens, whom they 
sent away two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rocket pitching in Toronto was difficult for the Fenway Park  
faithful to endure, but not nearly as troublesome as having him 
parading around in pinstripes. 
</P>
<P>
	This is almost as bad as dyed-in-the-wool Red Sox fan Bill  
Parcells skipping out on the New England Patriots to coach the New 
York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees manager Joe Torre gets it. He has decided that when New  
York visits Fenway for the first time this summer, coach Don 
Zimmer, a symbol of past Red Sox failures -- he managed the Boston 
team that blew a 14-game lead to New York in 1978 -- will walk the 
lineup card up to home plate. It's too bad David Wells took his 
Babe Ruth cap with him to Toronto. Zimmer would have looked swell 
wearing it for the ceremonial exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	When Torre manages the American League All-Stars at Fenway on  
July 13, he'll could use Clemens as the AL's starting pitcher. And 
bat Red Sox expatriate Mo Vaughn cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens is the latest exclamation point for the Yankees, a  
marquee addition for the World Series champions. Boston's big 
offseason acquisition was free agent infielder Jose Offerman, who 
got a $26 million contract as a reward for a journeyman career. 
</P>
<P>
	This is why rooting for the Red Sox requires the patience of  
Job, who was prominently mentioned in this week's ABC miniseries by 
Stephen King. 
</P>
<P>
	King, of course, is a horror novelist. And, naturally, a  
big-time Red Sox fan.

<HEADLINE> Wells Depressed After Yankees Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- David Wells needed to get away. So after  
pacing around his Palm Harbor, Fla. home, Wells traveled to Miami 
for a weekend of golf. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never seen him so down ... beyond depressed,'' New York  
Yankees pitcher David Cone said Friday, a day after Wells was dealt 
to Toronto along with Graeme Lloyd and Homer Bush for Roger 
Clemens. ``I've never seen anybody so stunned by a trade ... 
confused and stunned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cone spent four hours at Wells' home on Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's (normally) so upbeat. He was pacing around and couldn't  
sit down,'' Cone said. ``He was at a loss for words. He just had to 
get away. I don't think it has sunken in yet. He probably feels 
rejected and needs somebody to want him. He was very disappointed. 
He truly loved playing for the Yankees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wells became the toast of New York after pitching a perfect game  
against Minnesota last May. Fans loved him for his biker and beer 
image. Yankees owner George Steinbrenner became fond of Wells, even 
tolerating the pitcher's love of heavy metal music. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think our friendship will continue,'' Steinbrenner said.  
``It was tough yesterday. I think David knows how I feel about 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrenner wasn't upset that some Yankees fans didn't like the  
trade. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fan reaction is important, but it's not the final grade,'' he  
said. ``I learned a long time ago from (former Yankees general 
manager) Gabe Paul, who was one of the smartest men I ever met in 
baseball, you can not make a move and have it judged by the fan 
reaction. You let the results speak for themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York sportsradio was abuzz with negative reaction.  
</P>
<P>
	``People love him just because of the way he is,'' Yankees  
manager Joe Torre said. ``Boomer is a character. The whole thing on 
and off the field, I think endeared him to the New York people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some in baseball said the trade was just another example of how  
baseball's rich get richer. The arrival of Clemens boosted the 
Yankees' payroll to $86.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really resent people making this a fiscal deal. I'm tired of  
hearing people saying, `Oh, the Yankees can do this, the Yankees 
can do that,' '' Steinbrenner said. ``This was a trade ... people 
have seem to forgotten that. If our guys made a better trade than 
somebody else, so be it. Don't let them start saying we're doing 
all this because we've got the money. That didn't come to bear 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team was anticipating the arrival of Clemens on Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	``He'll fit in the with group ... he's a Yankee now,''  
Steinbrenner said. ``He's bigger than life almost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cone wants to learn from his former rival.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm anxious to see that legendary game-day preparation. It's  
very intense,'' Cone said. ``I'd like to talk with him and compare 
notes on American League hitters.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Yankees closer Mariano Rivera is ready to move on after  
winning a $4.25 million arbitration ruling on Thursday. ``We went 
through the process, we fought and we won,'' Rivera said. ... With 
the departure of Graeme Lloyd, the Yankees have just one 
left-hander, Mike Stanton in the bullpen. ``Having two lefties was 
a luxury,'' Torre said. ``Still, you always keep your eyes open for 
a left-hander. I would like to find out what we have in camp.'' 
Non-roster invitees David Carroll and Ed Yarnall are only two 
left-handed bullpen candidates in camp. ... Darryl Strawberry, 
still recovering from colon cancer surgery, intends to call Atlanta 
first baseman Andres Galarraga, who will miss this season because 
of a cancerous tumor in a bone in his back. ``I want to try to 
encourage him,'' Strawberry said. ``I want to try and let him know 
about the road ahead.'' Strawberry said prior to his surgery, he 
benefited from talking with Baltimore outfielder Eric Davis, who 
had also had colon cancer. ``It's a tough situation,'' Strawberry 
said. ``People that have been through it know more about it than 
anybody.''

<HEADLINE> Consumer Prices Rise Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Inflation remained near zero in January, but  
blame the U.S. Postal Service, freezing weather in California and 
tobacco taxes for what little cost pressure did surface. 
</P>
<P>
	The Consumer Price Index rose a seasonally adjusted 0.1 percent  
last month following an identical increase in December, the Labor 
Department said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Inflation ... remains well contained,'' said economist Maureen  
Maitland of Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. 
</P>
<P>
	The core rate of inflation -- which excludes the volatile food  
and energy components -- also was up only 0.1 percent. The biggest 
monthly decline in clothing costs in a decade, 1.1 percent, and 
drops for pork and used cars helped offset the few trouble spots. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco, which increased 18.5 percent in December, rose 6.6  
percent, reflecting a 50-cent-a-pack tax increase in California. It 
cost nearly 40 percent more to smoke in January than a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Oranges soared 24.1 percent, the biggest increase in eight  
years. Prices of fresh fruit rose 3.7 percent; dairy products, 2.3 
percent, and food, overall, 0.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of a first-class letter rose from 32 cents to 33  
cents, part of a 3 percent rise in postage costs. Airline fares 
rose 1.8 percent and hospital services were up 0.6 percent, the 
most in 2 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
	On the bright side for buyers, energy costs edged 0.2 percent  
lower in January as seasonally adjusted declines for fuel oil, 
electricity and natural gas offset a slight 0.1 percent rise in 
gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
	Hotel and motel bills fell 1.8 percent and used cars and trucks  
decreased 1.6 percent. Computer hardware fell 4.4 percent to a 
level nearly 37 percent cheaper than a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, consumer inflation hit a 12-year low of 1.6 percent  
and economists are looking for a modest acceleration to between 2 
percent and 2.5 percent this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're talking about ... a number that we once would have  
viewed as nirvana, but now we say, `Oh, geez, it's up some,''' said 
economist Robert Dederick of Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy prices, which plunged 8.8 percent in 1998, probably won't  
fall much more, analysts said. Prices of imported goods, depressed 
by the recession gripping a third of the world's economies, could 
start to firm too. 
</P>
<P>
	But statistical changes instituted by the Bureau of Labor  
Statistics with Friday's report should shave about 0.2 percentage 
points from the 1999 rate. The changes account for shifts shoppers 
make in response to price increases -- buying iceberg lettuce, for 
instance, if the price of romaine goes up. 
</P>
<P>
	If prices behave as expected, economists said there should be  
little reason for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``As I survey the inflation horizon, I can't see the enemy out  
there,'' said economist Stuart G. Hoffman of PNC Bank Corp. ``I 
think that leaves the Fed ... leaving well enough alone.''

<HEADLINE> Drs., Businessmen Debate HMO Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Business and doctor groups, deeply divided  
over proposals to regulate HMOs, met this week in a high-powered 
session looking for large-scale solutions to reform the health 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	Heavy hitters from each camp spent much of the week at a Palm  
Beach, Fla., resort, talking about long-term solutions to the 
problems of the uninsured and how to finance health care. The 
meeting was not assembled to debate the HMO question, but 
participants said it inevitably moved to the proposals pending in 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	No breakthrough was achieved, but both sides said the groundwork  
may be in place for a deal down the road. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have had the opportunity to clarify some areas where we had  
extraordinarily different perspectives,'' said Dr. Nancy Dickey, 
president of the American Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Even without a breakthrough, the meeting -- convened by the AMA  
and the United States Chamber of Commerce -- was an extraordinary 
assembly of players in HMO debate. 
</P>
<P>
	The AMA brought its top lobbyists. And the chamber brought the  
heads of Washington's insurance associations, including the trade 
group for HMOs, along with several of its own lobbyists. 
Altogether, about 25 participants spent two days in talks that 
ended Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting featured a series of speakers about the nation's  
health care system and ideas for improving it, along with time for 
participants to trade ideas. The group agreed to meet again. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all would believe that, despite some areas of disagreement,  
we could better come up with solutions than the politicians,'' said 
Bruce Josten of the chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	Josten said much of the discussion involved how to get health  
insurance to some 43 million uninsured Americans. Participants 
considered various changes to the tax code -- an idea that is also 
being widely discussed on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	The group hopes that, at some point, it can agree on a set of  
recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got the people that pay, the people that put the plans  
together and the people that provide the care,'' he said. ``That's 
an awfully powerful coalition of health care people in this 
country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only major group missing from the meeting was consumer  
advocates, although the AMA said it was speaking on behalf of 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
	In part, the meeting was meant to bring the business community  
and the medical community -- traditional allies -- closer after a 
couple of years of fighting over federal mandates. 
</P>
<P>
	Business opposes new rules, fearing they will drive up costs,  
while doctors want more control over a health system that is now 
ruled largely by insurance companies with the power to deny access 
and treatment they believe is not necessary.

<HEADLINE> Dispute Over Social Security Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton says his Social Security  
rescue plan will ensure that the retirement program can pay its 
bills for another 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	But Republican lawmakers contend the plan is just tricky  
accounting that won't truly ease the burden of paying Social 
Security benefits to the huge generation of aging baby boomers. 
</P>
<P>
	Who's right?  
</P>
<P>
	It's true that Clinton's plan relies on complex accounting. But  
Social Security financing always has. The fundamental disagreement 
between Democrats and Republicans is more of an ideological one 
over how best to ensure the nation can afford to support the baby 
boomers in old age. 
</P>
<P>
	What most people don't realize is that Clinton's plan doesn't  
actually put aside any cold, hard cash now for Social Security to 
use later. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has proposed a variety of ideas, including having the  
government invest some Social Security money in the stock market. 
But the key part of his plan would be using about $2 trillion in 
budget surpluses over the next 15 years to pay down the nation's 
public debt. That's debt the government owes to individuals and 
others who have bought Treasury bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Paying off public debt is one of the best ways to give the  
economy a boost and increase the nation's productivity, say many 
economists, including Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. 
</P>
<P>
	If the economy is growing, the government collects more taxes  
from rising household incomes and corporate profits. Clinton's plan 
assumes that, if tax rates aren't slashed and other government 
spending is kept under control, the result would be enough extra 
money to make up for the cash shortfalls expected to face Social 
Security in coming decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans don't dispute that a smaller debt means a better  
economy -- in fact, many themselves advocate using some of the 
expected surplus to reduce the debt. But many think tax cuts could 
also help the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans also argue that the next step of Clinton's plan  
would amount to accounting trickery. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because any future windfall of general tax revenues, such  
as income taxes, would not ordinarily go to Social Security, which 
is now financed exclusively by its own separate tax -- the 6.2 
percent that comes off the top of workers' paychecks and is matched 
by employers. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton would try to ensure that it does by writing an IOU  
to Social Security from the rest of the government. That would 
create an obligation -- on paper at least -- to pay for the program 
from the general Treasury's tax revenues for many years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our plan would put priority on investing for the future,''  
Clinton said in a recent speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans disagree.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's just simply creating more debt,'' says Rep. Clay Shaw,  
R-Fla., chairman of the House Ways and Means subcommittee on Social 
Security. ``Tax dollars have to be increased to pay off those IOUs. 
That's the problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many Republicans -- and some Democrats -- would prefer to keep  
using just the separate Social Security payroll tax system to 
finance the program's benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	They say it's risky to commit those other, general tax revenues  
when a recession or other calamity could dry up government 
surpluses in the future. That's when the nation might have so many 
other priorities -- from military readiness to education -- competing 
for cash. 
</P>
<P>
	``The administration's proposal risks saddling our children with  
more debt,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the Ways 
and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Also potentially at odds with Clinton's plan is the Republican  
desire for big, across-the-board tax cuts. Many GOP lawmakers say 
the financial benefits of a growing economy belong in Americans' 
pockets, not the government's. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a moral issue, these tax cuts,'' said House Budget  
Committee Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio, who has lately been 
road-testing slogans in his bid for the 2000 Republican 
presidential nomination. ``America needs to be run from the bottom 
up, not from the top down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders are preparing to push an alternative to Clinton's  
plan that would try to make up the expected shortfall in Social 
Security payroll taxes by letting individual Americans invest some 
of the dollars the retirement program does have in the stock 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	The expectation is that workers with personal investment  
accounts could grow a bigger retirement nest egg than the 
government now provides with the same money. In the future, Social 
Security checks could be then reduced proportionally. 
</P>
<P>
	At the outset, however, additional government spending would  
likely still be needed to make sure people already too old to 
benefit from the accounts get the Social Security checks already 
promised to them. 
</P>
<P>
	``The surplus is going to have to be used in some way ... but it  
would be strictly transitional,'' Shaw said of Republican plans.

<HEADLINE> $176M Settlement in Drug Price Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Nineteen drug companies will pay more than  
$176 million to settle a class-action lawsuit alleging they 
overcharged for medicine sold at independent pharmacies in 
California, the San Francisco Chronicle reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the companies will have to pay $27 million in fees  
to attorneys who represented the plaintiffs in the suit brought on 
behalf of California's 32 million consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the latest in a series of big settlements in suits  
alleging unfair pricing practices. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies in the California case agreed to furnish $148  
million worth of brand-name drugs to 300 nonprofit medical clinics 
in the state that dispense drugs to the poor. The companies would 
pay $1.6 million to administer the three-year program. 
</P>
<P>
	Merck &AMP; Co. would pay the most, more than $19 million, while  
Carter Wallace would pay the least, at $705,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is set for a final hearing on April 21 before a judge  
in San Francisco Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen at Merck and several other drug companies said today  
they could not immediately confirm the settlement report. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug companies used an unfair, two-tiered system to price  
wholesale drugs, according to the suit filed by the California 
Public Health Association, a group that represents the clinics that 
would receive the free drugs under the settlement. 
</P>

	``It represents a cheap settlement for the drug companies, and  
they'll go on, business as usual, ripping off the public,'' Fred 
Mayer, a Sausalito pharmacist and past president of the 
association, told the Chronicle. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies sold drugs at discounts to health maintenance  
organizations and other big volume buyers like mail order drug 
firms, the suit alleged. However, exorbitant prices were charged 
neighborhood pharmacies and even some drug store chains. 
</P>
<P>
	Druggists claimed they paid up to $28.90 for 100 tablets of a  
synthetic thyroid drug, while HMOs paid as little as $1.43. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past three years, 15 drug companies settled federal  
lawsuits from drug store chains for more than $700 million to end 
claims that the firms conspired to charge pharmacies more for drugs 
than managed care plans had to pay. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, last December, a judge approved a $64.3 million  
settlement between the 10 states and the District of Columbia and 
the world's largest drug companies in a lawsuit that charged the 
manufacturers conspired to destroy competition between retailers 
and health maintenance organizations.

<HEADLINE> Nigerians Prepare for Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) -- Legislative candidates across this  
sprawling West African nation engaged in last-minute campaigning 
Friday as Nigeria prepared to make its next-to-final step in its 
transition to civilian rule. 
</P>
<P>
	With presidential elections just a week away, Saturday's  
national assembly vote could show how much support former military 
ruler Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo -- widely believed to be the 
presidential front-runner -- will get. 
</P>
<P>
	Obasanjo's party, the People's Democratic Party, has won  
substantial victories in local and state elections over the past 
two months. 
</P>
<P>
	But since those elections, Nigeria's two other parties, the  
Alliance for Democracy and the All People's Party, have joined 
forces to field a joint candidate, former Finance Minister Olu 
Falae. 
</P>
<P>
	It is unclear whether that plan will give Falae an edge against  
the political machinery, money and clout of the powerful northern 
military leaders who back Obasanjo. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's elections for 360 seats in the House of  
Representatives and 109 seats in the Senate have been overshadowed 
by the Feb. 27 presidential vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The media are paying scant attention to the campaigning or the  
candidates, but officials from the three parties said candidates 
were on a last-minute search for votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Moyosore Olufunke Taiwo, a People's Democratic Party candidate  
for the House of Representatives, rode in a car behind a jazz band 
marching through the working-class Lagos neighborhood of Mushin as 
hundreds of supporters ran alongside. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want proper electricity supply, proper water supply so  
Nigerians can lead a normal life,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Her platform appeals to the hundreds of thousands in the  
dilapidated neighborhoods of the teeming commercial capital who 
have gone for years without basic infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
	An articulated platform is a surprise. Despite some  
philosophical differences, the three parties have barely attempted 
to differentiate themselves and their programs amount to little 
more than platitudes about seeking a better Nigeria. 
</P>
<P>
	Obasanjo assumed power when military ruler Gen. Murtala Muhammed  
was assassinated in 1976 and made good on the military's promise to 
return the country to civilian rule in October 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Falae, he is a Yoruba from Nigeria's southwest. Both men  
were imprisoned during the rule of the late dictator, Gen. Sani 
Abacha. 
</P>
<P>
	Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation with 110 million people,  
has been ruled by the military for all but 10 years since its 
independence from Britain in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
	Crippled by years of rampant corruption and widespread  
mismanagement, it remains mired in poverty despite earning billions 
of dollars a year from oil revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	For years during Abacha's brutal regime, Nigeria had an abysmal  
human rights record. 
</P>
<P>
	Change has come quickly since Abacha's death. He was succeeded  
by a career soldier, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, who vowed to 
restore pride to Nigeria's long-tainted military and return 
civilian rule.

<HEADLINE> Injured Violinist Recalls Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- About 10 seconds -- that's how long Rachel Barton  
says she stood on a train platform with her shoulder pinned to the 
train door by the strap of her violin case. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the commuter train departed, forever changing the  
prize-winning performer's life. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was in so much pain. I didn't know that much pain could  
exist,'' a sobbing Barton testified Friday. ``It was hard to keep 
my head together. ... All I could see was blood, and my left leg 
was gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The train dragged Barton 366 feet down the tracks, severing her  
leg and the foot on her other leg. She has since had 24 surgeries 
and 223 doctor visits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just one big Frankenstein monster,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Barton, 24, is suing Metra, the suburban commuter rail agency,  
and the Chicago and Northwestern Transportation Co., now owned by 
Union Pacific, for negligence and is seeking compensatory and 
punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Railway lawyers agree that Barton deserves sympathy. But they  
take issue with what she did during the 10 seconds on the platform 
in suburban Winnetka, where she was traveling to teach violin 
lessons in the winter of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton said she thought she got off the train when she heard and  
felt a slight bump. When she realized she was caught, she tried to 
pry open the doors. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was my total belief that the conductor would put his head  
out, open up the doors and I would go on my way,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the railway say Barton could have freed herself from  
the strap and have insinuated that she was more concerned about 
saving her $500,000 Amati violin than herself. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton said she would never risk life or limb for the  
instrument, which she described as a ``Buick'' in a world of 
``Cadillac'' Stradivarius violins. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the end, no matter how pretty they sound or how much money  
they're worth, they are still a material object,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Before she was injured, Barton in 1992 became the first American  
and youngest person ever to win first prize in the Bach Competition 
in Leipzig, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	She has played with the Chicago Civic Orchestra, beginning at  
age 11, and served as its concertmaster for three years. She also 
plays with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and the Chicago Lyric 
Opera Orchestra and has recorded seven compact discs -- six of them 
since she was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``Playing music gives you peace of mind,'' she said Friday.

<HEADLINE> Gene Linked to Defects Identified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Researchers at the University of Texas  
Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas have identified a gene 
thought to be responsible for a common heart and facial birth 
defect. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists report in the journal Science, published today, that  
the gene for DiGeorge syndrome has been isolated. The report is an 
important step toward finding new treatments for the serious 
disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	Babies born with DiGeorge syndrome, also known as chromosome 22  
deletion syndrome, can suffer malformations in the heart, the face 
and the thymus, a gland that is a key part of the immune system. 
</P>
<P>
	A team of UT Southwestern researchers led by Dr. Deepak  
Srivastava found that DiGeorge syndrome could be caused when a 
child lacked one of two genes called UDF1. Genes normally come in 
pairs. The researchers found that of 182 DiGeorge syndrome patients 
examined, all lacked one copy of the UDF1 gene. 
</P>
<P>
	Srivastrava said in a statement that lacking one copy of the  
gene may cause a disruption of the proteins critical for the 
formation of heart and facial structures. 
</P>
<P>
	DiGeorge syndrome affects about one in every 4,000 children. It  
is the second most common genetic cause of congenital heart 
defects.

<HEADLINE> BoSox Optimistic About Veterans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- Who needs Roger Clemens when you have  
Mark Portugal and Pat Rapp? 
</P>
<P>
	And why worry about the loss of Mo Vaughn when you have a  
starting rotation that can get by without his offensive support? 
</P>
<P>
	Boston's pitchers aren't that overpowering, but the staff the  
Red Sox begin spring training with is proven and productive. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the most stable we've been in three years going into  
spring training, as far as having five quality starters,'' said Joe 
Kerrigan, beginning his third season as Boston's pitching coach. 
</P>
<P>
	The rotation has three holdovers -- Pedro Martinez (19-7), Tim  
Wakefield (17-8) and Bret Saberhagen (15-8). The Red Sox shored up 
the fourth and fifth spots by adding Portugal, who was 10-5 in 26 
starts with Philadelphia, and Rapp, who was 12-13 in 32 starts with 
Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's No. 4 and 5 starters had their seasons shortened by  
injury. Butch Henry made just two starts and Brian Rose had eight. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still won 92 games,'' Kerrigan said, ``so this year if we  
keep our guys healthy through the first month we should be stronger 
than last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Portugal had knee problems last season, while Rapp struggled  
with his control. He averaged 5.1 walks and 6.3 strikeouts per nine 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Offensively, the Red Sox haven't replaced the punch they lost  
when Vaughn took his 40 homers, 115 RBIs and .337 batting average 
to Anaheim as a free agent. But diminished support and a slimmer 
margin for error shouldn't change the pitchers' approach. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't have that mindset,'' Kerrigan said. ``You're just  
trying to do the best you can. ``You don't worry about the 
offensive side of things. You've got enough things to worry about 
as a pitching staff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There'd be fewer things to worry about if the Red Sox still had  
Clemens. But he signed as a free agent with Toronto after the 1996 
season then was traded Wednesday to the New York Yankees, Boston's 
fiercest rival. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Red Sox were second only to the Yankees in the  
American League last season in ERA, 4.18, and opponents' batting 
average .255. And they go into spring training with nine spots on 
the pitching staff seemingly set -- the five starters, middle 
relievers Jim Corsi, Derek Lowe and Mark Guthrie and closer Tom 
Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
	That makes it easier for Kerrigan to help them.  
</P>
<P>
	``You have a lot fewer questions outside your staff,'' he said.  
``You're not looking for a fourth or fifth starter. You're not 
looking for two or three guys in the bullpen. That stability helps 
a lot because you can really focus in on the work at hand. You can 
focus in on working and making Rapp a better pitcher. You can focus 
in on Portugal and some of his weaknesses and make him stronger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kerrigan also thinks Martinez and Saberhagen can pitch better.  
Martinez had a 2.89 ERA while coping with his move from Montreal to 
a town with fanatical baseball fans. 
</P>
<P>
	And Saberhagen still had to show he could pitch in a regular  
rotation after undergoing major shoulder surgery in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is miles past where he was at this point last year,''  
Kerrigan said. ``He's stronger. His arm has a little more 
resiliency. We figure we can get another 10 or 12 pitches out of 
him (per start), maybe another 20 innings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While four of Boston's five starters are older than 30, the  
rotation at Triple-A Pawtucket is young and promising with three 
starters, including Rose, having had major league experience. 
</P>
<P>
	And some of them could be ready to produce if injuries strike  
the big-league rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We won 92 games last year,'' Kerrigan said. ``I think we have  
a chance to do that again .''

<HEADLINE> IRS: Electronic Returns Are Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Internal Revenue Service says the number  
of tax returns filed electronically and the amount of the average 
refund are both up compared with last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Through Feb. 12, IRS had received 13.3 million electronic  
returns, an 11 percent increase over the same period last year. The 
number of self-prepared tax returns filed electronically soared 
from 218,000 during the period last year to 624,000 this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Total returns filed so far have topped 23.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	``More than half of the early filers have e-filed by computer or  
by phone,'' IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti said Thursday. 
``These taxpayers appreciate the comfort of having more accurate 
returns and faster refunds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The average refund so far is $1,823, up 14 percent from last  
year. And 9.4 million returns asked for direct deposit of the 
money, an 18.7 percent increase. 
</P>
<P>
	IRS officials say the new child and education tax credits --  
which reduce taxes on a dollar-for-dollar basis -- are the main 
reason for the higher refunds.
