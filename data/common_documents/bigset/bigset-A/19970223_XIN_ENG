<HEADLINE> Oil Workers Grieve Loss of Deng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAQING, February 22 (Xinhua) -- People in China's largest
oilfield, Daqing, have been saddened by the news of the death of
senior leader Deng Xiaoping, who made three inspection tours of
the oilfield in China's northeast province of Heilongjiang.
</P>
<P>
Some workers gathered in one of the offices of the Daqing
Petrochemical factory, where Deng listened to reports when he made
the last visit to the oilfield in 1978, paying tribute to the
legendary leader who passed away in Beijing Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Gao hui, a worker, said, "It has been 18 years since comrade
Xiaoping paid the last visit here, during which our per capita
annual income has risen from 780 yuan in 1978 to 12,000 yuan
(about 1,400 US dollars) today."
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that the manufacturing of synthetic ammonia
and the safe production cycle also have reached the advanced
domestic and international levels, respectively.
</P>
<P>
At a memorial gathering, elderly former model worker Ma Deren
had a vivid recollection of Deng's three visits. "Comrade Xiaoping
paid much attention to the development of Daqing, he showed his
concern to both the output of the oilfield and the lives of
workers each time he visited here," he said, adding that the
oilfield's great achievements should be attributed to Deng's theory
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the reform
and opening up policies.
</P>
<P>
Two drilling teams canceled their holidays upon hearing the
announcement of Deng's death.
</P>
<P>
Ge Zhixuan, the head of one team, said that Deng's concern and
support for them has always inspired them to push forward, and
they would turned their grief into strength to ensure the stable
annual production of 50 million tons of oil by the year 2010.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Trade union members throughout
the country said that Deng Xiaoping was a man who was always
concerned with workers and the issues that affect their lives.
</P>
<P>
Workers throughout China have expressed their sorrow in the
days following Deng's death in Beijing on Wednesday. Many said
that the 93-year-old Deng's famous philosophy of relying
wholeheartedly on the working class must be observed.
</P>
<P>
Gu Dachun, a trade union veteran, said that Deng had placed
great importance on the role of the workers by introducing
democratic management and elections into factories.
</P>
<P>
"Deng had said that the trade union should be an organ that
always speaks for the workers, instead of an instrument used by
some people for selfish purposes. We must thoroughly study this
valuable thought," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kang Yonghe, who had contacts with Deng in the trade union
field, noted that Deng had emphasized that the working class
represents the majority of the people in the reform process. "The
policy has aroused workers' enthusiasm," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yu, a veteran trade union worker, spoke highly of Deng's
policy of organization and system reform. "Deng said that the
working class can play a pioneering role in all these reforms," he
recalled.
</P>
<P>
Many other trade union workers mentioned Deng's efforts to
restore order in the railway sector.
</P>
<P>
"Deng was great. He always made judgments precisely and handled
affairs in a decisive manner," said Jiang Yi, a railway worker.

<P>
BEIJING, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Beijing citizens rushed to buy
pictures of Deng Xiaoping today, three days after the former
leader died of illness at age 93.
</P>
<P>
The first batch of pictures were distributed to hundreds of

In the evening, many people were still lingering around
bookstores, hoping to buy pictures of the legendary figure.

One couple, Zhang Xiaoqiang and Zhan Hongjie, said that they
would hang Deng's picture in their room. "I was from the
countryside. Later I became a university student and now am
working Beijing. Viewing my life, I have seen the great changes
brought by the reform and opening. We will forever remember Deng's
great contributions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Liu Jincheng, 70, said that his family will observe a period of
silence before the picture of Deng in his home. "He was a great
man, his greatest contribution was to improve people's living
standard -- a fact witnessed by all of us," he said.

The People's Fine Arts Publishing House has received some 70
calls from throughout the country for Deng's pictures. Some

<HEADLINE> People In China's Former Revolutionary Bases Mourn Deng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, February 22 (Xinhua) -- People in China's former
revolutionary bases expressed their deep sorrow over the death of
Deng Xiaoping, who passed away Wednesday in Beijing at the age of
93.
</P>
<P>
People in these remote, mountainous areas had supported the
Chinese Communist Party and contributed greatly to the liberation
cause before New China was founded in 1949.
</P>
<P>
In north China's Shanxi Province, Guo Jinmei, 82, who used to
be the wet nurse of Deng's elder son, was so saddened by the news
that she could not fall asleep the night after hearing the
announcement.
</P>
<P>
She cut the the old man's photograph from a newspaper and put
it in a mourning room in her house especially set up for Deng.
</P>
<P>
"Xiaoping, I still remember that you taught us villagers how to
grow rice," she said, crying as she stood before the picture and
placed a bowl of rice beneath it.
</P>
<P>
"Now we are living happy lives and this is the rice we prepared
for you...," she cried out.
</P>
<P>
In the province's Matian Town, where Deng had lived for five
years, people crowded into his former residence, and meticulously
cleaned the rooms as a show of respect.
</P>
<P>
Xi Yuanhua, who is in his 80s and was Deng's former security
guard, also was tearful, saying that he could hardly eat or sleep
when recalling the days he fought side by side the legendary
figure.
</P>
<P>
"Chairman Mao made it possible for us to become masters of our
country, and Deng made it possible for us to enjoy economic
prosperity," said villagers in the province's old liberated areas.
</P>
<P>
The province's Zuoquan County, one of such areas, has been
lifted out of poverty after years' of efforts by its 160,000
people.
</P>
<P>
"We will turn our grief into strength to turn the area into a
more prosperous place," said Lin Yuping, secretary of the County
Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Airlines to Get 16 New Aircraft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Airlines (PAL) will
acquire 16 new aircraft this year as part of its four billion U.S.
dollar refleeting and modernization program, the Philippine News
Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The planes ordered by PAL are new-generation aircraft from
Airbus Industrie of France. Last month, a brand new A340-200
joined PAL's current fleet.
</P>
<P>
Two other long-haul Airbus aircraft are scheduled for delivery
in March and April, according to the agency.
</P>
<P>
PAL's expansion and refleeting program has been reactivated
following the settlement of the capitalization issue and the
recent approval by the airlines' stock-holders of another increase
in its capital from 10 billion pesos (380 million dollars) to 20
billion pesos (760 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
From May to December 1997, the agency said, PAL will get 13
more ultra-long range aircraft -- four A340-300s, five A330-300s,
and four A320-200s.
</P>
<P>
In addition, two more A340-200s acquired on operating lease
from Airbus Leasing Ltd. are due this year, the agency said..
</P>
<P>
The agency said that to complete its modernization plan, PAL
has also ordered eight B-747-400s from the Seattle-based Boeing
Co. The eight planes are scheduled for delivery starting April
1998 up to December 1999.

<HEADLINE> US President Opposes Balanced Budget Amendment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
reiterated today his opposition to the balanced budget amendment,
saying that balancing the budget needs only U.S. Congress' vote
and his signature.
</P>
<P>
"We must balance the budget, but a balanced budget amendment
could cause more harm than good," Clinton said in his weekly radio
address.
</P>
<P>
The president contended that the amendment's limitations would
"prevent us from responding to foreign challenges abroad or
economic trouble at home, if to do so resulted in even a minor
budget deficit".
</P>
<P>
In reiterating his opposition to the amendment, Clinton said
the Treasury Department or even a judge might be forced to slash
Social Security just to keep the budget in line.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Clinton argued the 1.69-trillion-dollar spending plan
for fiscal 1998, which he submitted to the Congress earlier this
month, will balance the U.S. federal budget by 2002.
</P>
<P>
But the Congressional Budget Office has challenged the
assessment, saying that the plan would leave at least a deficit of
49 billion dollars instead of producing a 17-billion-dollar
surplus at the end of 2002.
</P>
<P>
Republican-controlled U.S. Congress has vowed to push the
balanced budget constitutional amendment through the Congress. The
issue could come up for a vote in March in the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
A similar balanced budget amendment was approved by the U.S.
House of Representatives but failed by only one vote two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
A two-thirds majority in each house of the U.S. Congress is
required for passage of a constitutional amendment, followed by
ratification by three-fourths of the states.

<HEADLINE> Belarus Wants Union With Russia to Mirror EU Model </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Belarussian President Alexander
Lukashenko said the European Union (EU) can serve as a model when
his country and Russia push forward a close union.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko said Friday in Minsk that the two countries in their
integration efforts should also draw from success stories of the
former Soviet Union, the Itar-Tass news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Belarussian president added that he would discuss a
possible closer link between the two countries with his Russian
counterpart, Boris Yeltsin, at a summit scheduled for March 7.
</P>
<P>
Belarus signed a treaty with Russia in April, 1996, to form the
Community of Sovereign Republics in a bid to speed up economic and
political integration between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The treaty came after Lukashenko's two-year drive to bring his
country back into a union of some kind with Russia, which supplies
90 percent of its industrial raw materials and buys 86 percent of
its exports.
</P>
<P>
Russia and Belarus will maintain their own sovereignty
separately within the union. But the union will have its own flag
and emblem, a common budget and joint border defense as well as,
in the future, a common currency and a common market.
</P>
<P>
Belarus is a former Soviet republic with a population of 10
million, and neighboring Russia has a population of 150 million.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan and Kyrghizstan have also called for closer links
among former Soviet republics.

The overstocking of maize, peanut and other kinds of farm
produce is mainly due to the lack of buyers' market, the
difficulties in transporting by roads, railways or ports and the
money shortage for the government to purchase grains, he said.
</P>
<P>
The farmers' zeal to produce maize has been affected by the
situation, he noted. enditem

<HEADLINE> Chinese People Recall Deng's Great Contributions (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese people have been
reading a lengthy article issued by Xinhua News Agency on the life
of Deng Xiaoping, recalling his great contributions to the country
and vowing to carry on his will and push socialism forward.
</P>
<P>
From cities to rural areas, many people said that China's
successful reform is closely connected to Deng.
</P>
<P>
In Xiaogang village, known as "the first village of rural
reform," every family has hung up a picture of Deng Xiaoping, who
died Wednesday in Beijing at the age of 93. Farmers placed pine tree
branches in front of Deng's picture, to symbolize their sorrow.
</P>
<P>
Yan Guopin, one of the 18 farmers who first used the household
contract responsibility system with remuneration linked to
output, said that if Deng had not supported the contract system it
would not have been adopted.
</P>
<P>
"My family last year turned out some 150,000 kilograms of
grain, an equivalent of the total output the whole village
registered before the contract system was introduced," he said.
</P>
<P>
Another farmer, Yan Junchang, said, "Deng is our benefactor. We
will remember him forever."
</P>
<P>
In the prosperous Huaxi village of east China's Jiangsu
province, farmers have lowered flags to half-staff. They said that
their financial success is the result of Deng's wise policies.
</P>
<P>
Ji Zhenliang, Party secretary of Doudian village in Beijing's
suburbs, said that Deng is the chief architect of the reform and
opening up -- a movement which first took place in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
When the news of Deng's death reached the Dabie Mountains,
where Deng had fought, Zhen Xianzhi, a senior citizen, said, "My
Jinzai County was a rigid and poor place before the reform. But
now telephone lines and roads have reached every village."
</P>
<P>
He said that his fellow countrymen have a popular saying: "It
is Chairman Mao who liberated us, and it is Deng Xiaoping who made
us become rich."
</P>
<P>
Workers are also recalling Deng, who then introduced reform
into cities after the campaign in rural areas succeeded.
</P>
<P>
In the Shanhai Baoshan Iron and Steel Group Corporation, cadres
and workers watched once agains the 12-part TV documentary "Deng
Xiaoping" which is currently airing for a third time.
</P>
<P>
Li Ming, president of the corporation, said that it was Deng
who supported the construction of the plant at a time when many
people were skeptical about the project.
</P>
<P>
"Deng maintained that China's modernization must include the
modernization of the steel industry," he said, adding that the
workers are turning grief into strength to manufacture more
products as a way of remembering Deng.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Conducts Research on Grape Planting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The Debre Zeit Agricultural
Research Centre of Ethiopia is conducting research on 140 species
of grapes, a report from the Ethiopian News Agency said today.
</P>
<P>
The report said, some grape varieties have been supplied to
the Awash Winery in Addis Ababa for wine making, and several
kinds of wine were made available for sample-testing today after
one-year-long distillation at the factory.
</P>
<P>
The Awash Winery imports about 500 tons of grape annually.
</P>
<P>
As an export commodity, grape holds vast potential to earn the
foreign currency, in addition to saving hard currency spent on the
import of some amount of grape for the nation's wineries, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to the report, a study is under way to
provide incentives to grape growers in a bid to encourage grape
farming in Ethiopia. enditem

Abul'ahat Abdurixit, chairman of the People's government of the
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, said that China has taken the
strategy of opening up all border areas since the Third Plenary
Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, which has opened the
region wider to the outside world. Xinjiang has become a booming
front of the opening drive in the western part of China.
</P>
<P>
Wu Yi, Chinese minister of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation, said that she is grateful for Deng's wisdom when she
thinks about the great development of the country's foreign trade
and the rapid growth of China's comprehensive strength.
</P>
<P>
Deng's idea of regarding science and technology as the most
powerful driving force of social development has spurred the rapid
development of these sectors in the country.
</P>
<P>
Bai Chunli, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences,
said that Deng was devoted to the development of Chinese science
and technology, and was the strongest supporter.
</P>
<P>
Deng entrusted Chinese scientists with the job of securing a
position in the world arena for China's advanced technology, and
the scientists will continue to work to fulfill his wishes.
</P>
<P>
In March of 1986, four Chinese scientists wrote a letter to
Deng, asking for approval to draft China's hi-technology
development plan. He responded quickly, saying it should be
carried out without delay. It was his vision that created the
"863" hi-tech development program.
</P>
<P>
The four scientists believed that China must flourish and
become stronger by developing hi-technology as an industrial
undertaking.

medical treatment," You recalled, adding that she will never
forget Deng's support.
</P>
<P>
The National Bureau of Oceanography faxed word of Deng's
passing to China's Thirteenth Expedition Team at the South Pole on
Thursday morning. Team members and crew alike mourned the loss.
</P>
<P>
"We'll never forget the great man's concern and guidance over
the expedition to the South Pole," they said, adding that they
will remember Deng's encouraging words in 1984 for the country's
first adventure to the region: "Make more contributions to man's
peaceful use of the South Pole."
</P>
<P>
Deng said many times that education is the foundation needed to
foster scientists and technical personnel. People in the education
circles will not forget the outstanding contributions Deng made to
the country's educational development.
</P>
<P>
On October 1, 1984, during the parade to celebrate the 35th
anniversary of the People's Republic of China, students from
China's prestigious Beijing University carried banners on which

Workers in the Daqing Oilfield were deeply saddened upon
hearing the news of Deng's death. They expressed their respect for
his outstanding contributions and remembered clearly his three
visits to the oilfield.
</P>
<P>
Party members and officials of the renowned No. 1205 and 1202
Drilling Teams sacrificed their days off in order to work. "We
will turn grief into strength and dig more oil wells in memory of
Comrade Deng Xiaoping," team leader Ge Zhixian said.
</P>
<P>
Party Secretary Chen Hong said, "When we heard the news of the
death of Deng, all of the workers on the team were very sad that
Comrade Deng Xiaoping could not see with his own eyes the
beautiful oilfield that was built as a result of his instruction."
</P>
<P>
Deng formulated the "three-step" strategy for the country's
development, and people in rural and urban areas who have
prospered are expressing their sorrow over his passing.
</P>
<P>
Song Yupu, an elderly lady from Xinxing Road, of Heping
district in Tianjin, known for its outstanding success in
promoting socialist cultural and ethical progress, said, "I'm 70
years old now, but in the last 20 years life has been improved
greatly," adding that this can be attributed to the policy of
reform and opening up set forth by Deng.
</P>
<P>
"I will expect my children to remember Deng Xiaoping forever,
generation after generation," she said.
</P>
<P>
It was Deng who first put forward the concept of opening up and
building economic zones. People in these areas praised Deng as the
architect of China's reforms and opening up.
</P>
<P>
"His historical achievements will cause his fame to shine on
the pages of Chinese history," they said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the sound development of the special zones, Zhang
Gang, former deputy director of the Office of Special Economic
Zones under the State Council, and Huang Taihe, director of the
Special Economic Zone division, agreed that the development of
special zones could not have been realized without Deng.
</P>
<P>
People throughout China are expressing their sorrow in many
different ways. In an enterprise group in south China's Shenzhen,
they erected a sign that said "Beloved Comrade Deng Xiaoping will
live forever in our hearts."
</P>
<P>
In Pudong, where residents believe Deng contributed greatly to
the construction of the new area, said they will follow the late
leader's instructions to build a more beautiful city.
</P>
<P>
In August of 1986, Deng made an inspection tour of the Tianjin
Economic and Technological Development Zone. One decade later, it
has became a modern industrial center.
</P>
<P>
A businessman from Taiwan said Deng is the architect of China's
reform and opening up and he gave the Taiwanese people
opportunities to do something for the motherland. "We patriots
from Taiwan felt the same grief for Deng's death," the man said.
</P>
<P>
Deng paid close attention to the construction of Hainan and
gave instructions to use foreign investment to build the Yangpu
Economic Zone. Residents in the zone today mourned Deng, and vowed
to improve the development of the area.

<P>
MOGADISHU, February 22 (Xinhua)-- Two young men were shot dead
after having attempted to hijack a passenger vehicle in north
Mogadishu this afternoon, said eyewitnesses.
</P>
<P>
They were caught by armed militiamen supporting the Islamic
Court and then killed by the owner of the vehicle at Fagah bus
station, said the eyewitnesses.
</P>
<P>
Their corpses now are lying in public in Shibbis District for
possible identification.
</P>
<P>
The hijackers were from south Mogadishu controled by
another faction, said a report, adding that if they belonged to
north Mogadishu, they would have had another fate.
</P>
<P>
Five militiamen manning a checkpoint in south Mogadishu were
also killed today in a reportedly retaliatory move because
earlier this week a man was killed at the checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
The security situation of north Mogadishu has been
deteriorating since the political divergence appeared between
faction leader Ali Mahdi Mohamed and strong religious leader
Sheikh Ali Dhere.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Ali Mahdi issued a decree removing Dhere from the
post of the chairman of the Supreme Islamic Court.
</P>
<P>
However, the elders in the city now talk of success in
narrowing their difference as talks between the two leaders
continue in north Mogadishu. enditem

<HEADLINE> Jordan Stock Market Mulls over Sell-Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 22 (Xinhua) - Jordan's stock market, mulling
over the operation of the stock market, is advising the government
to be cautious over plans for a major state sell-off of its
extensive stock portfolio as part of a stepped-up privatization
effort, Jordan times reported today.
</P>
<P>
"The government is now consulting the Amman Financial Market
on technical procedures for unloading further investments... we
will be giving them some ideas,'' Wahib al-Shair, director-general
of the Amman Financial Market (AFM), said.
</P>
<P>
"We also know the government is considering unloading some or
much of its holdings in the market... This ought to provide a
larger float for the interested investors," he added.
</P>
<P>
A key element in Jordan's so far slow privatization effort is
state sell-offs of the government's extensive stock holdings --
nearly 35 percent of the bourse's total market capitalization of
3.5 billion Jordanian dinars (about 5 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Shair said that the AFM would enlist international financial
expertise on ways of offloading sizeable government
holdings.

<HEADLINE> EU Chief Warns Against Euro Delay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 22 (Xinhua) -- European Commission President Jacques
Santer said today in Germany that any delay in the creation of the
planned single European currency would be "risky", because it would
lead to a relaxation in EU members' efforts to meet the convergence
criteria.
</P>
<P>
"I fear postponing the introduction date now will mean postponing a
single currency for an entire generation," Santer told a gathering of
the Christian Democrats -- the major partners in Germany's ruling
coalition -- in the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg.
</P>
<P>
According to German radio reports, Santer also said he believed the
single currency, known as the euro, would be as strong as the German
mark, and would play a larger role than present currencies of the EU
member states.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU) is targeting to launch the euro by January
1, 1999. Under the Maastricht Treaty, a EU member state must meet five
criteria in order to qualify for the euro, one of which is that its
budget deficit and national debt must not exceed 3 and 60 percent
respectively of its gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
Given soaring jobless benefit costs caused by Germany's record
unemployment, there are growing doubts about Bonn's ability to meet
the euro criteria this year. Some analysts have said that the euro
launch may therefore have to be delayed.

<HEADLINE> Jordan, Israel Disagree over Ideas on Joint Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 22 (Xinhua) - Negotiations between Jordan and
Israel on building an airport near the Red Sea coast ran into a
deadlock over Israeli security concerns, Jordan Times reported
today, citing a Jordanian official.
</P>
<P>
"They want a terminal inside Jordanian territory to be under
their control but this is unacceptable (to Jordan), it is not
possible to give up Jordanian territory," said the official close
to the talks held in Jordan's Red Sea port of Aqaba.
</P>
<P>
The joint airport was meant to ease congestion at Israel's
Eilat airport, only a few Kilometers north of Aqaba, and to help
Jordan tap new traffic capabilities.
</P>
<P>
Last July, U.S. company Lockheed Martin completed a feasibility
study for a proposed 80 million U.S. dollars international airport
serving in Jordan and Israel.
</P>
<P>
During the outgoing talks, Israeli officials presented their
Jordanian counterparts with radically modified proposals which
undermined the projects's original principles, Jordan Times said.
</P>
<P>
"They want a solution that solves their technical problems at
our expenses," the Jordanian official, who is not identified,
said.
</P>
<P>
The planned airport is one of several joint projects approved
in the spirit of optimistic cooperation which followed the 1994
peace treaty between Jordan and Israel.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Returns Home From Damascus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
returned home this evening after a brief visit to Damascus where
he discussed the latest development of the Middle East peace
process with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad.
</P>
<P>
The summit coincided with the 38th anniversary of the day of
unity between Egypt and Syria, which lasted from February 22,
1959, to September 5, 1961.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian MENA news agency said Mubarak told a press
conference at the end of their meeting in Damascus that "new
ideas were forwarded" after they exchanged views on the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he warned against the continuation of Jewish
settlement activities, saying that the activities threaten the
peace march and lead the whole peace process to a deadlock.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents stressed the importance of achieving a just
and comprehensive peace in the Middle East on the basis of
relevant U.N. resolutions and the land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
Syria has announced that the Egyptian-Syrian Higher Committee
will be held soon in Cairo to follow the continued dialogue
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The summit, prior to Mubarak's meeting with U.S. President Bill
Clinton in Washington next month, was aimed at unifying Arab

<HEADLINE> Liquefied Gas Plant Goes on Schedule in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's liquefied natural gas
(LNG) project worth 3.8 billion U.S. Dollars is going on schedule
despite the withdrawal of a major purchaser, the News Agency of
Nigeria reported today.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Nigeria LNG Limited today said so
far 30 percent of the work has been done at the plant on Bonney
Island of Rivers State, southern Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the project would supply gas to overseas
buyers from October, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The plant, jointly financed by the Nigerian National Petroleum
Corporation and some foreign firms including Shell, Elf and Agip,
is expected to produce seven billion cubic meters of LNG a year
when completed.
</P>
<P>
All the shareholders of the project have paid their funding
subscriptions, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
However, the ENEL company of Italy, which agreed in 1992 to
buy half of the plant's products, announced in December it could
not fulfill the contract because environmentalists would not
allow it to construct the gas receiving terminal.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, a new manager, Steve Ollerreanshaw, was
named for the company to replace Theo Oerlemans, the head of the
project since it was re-launched in late 1993.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Government Facing Deep Political Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 22 (Xinhua) -- A political storm appears
to be brewing in Israel amid a report that Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu was questioned under caution on a political
scandal.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu was questioned about Roni Bar-On's appointment as
attorney-general by Police Commander Sando Mazor, his deputy
Lt.-Commander. Ya'cov Grossman and Lt.-Commander. Rami Zotler at
his office for four hours Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Channel One of the state-run Israel Television reported Friday
night that Netanyahu told the investigators that he could not
recall many of the details relating to Bar-On's appointment.
</P>
<P>
After 45 minutes, according to the report, the three police
officers issued a caution. Under Israeli law, remarks made when
a person is questioned under caution can be used against the
person in criminal proceedings.
</P>
<P>
If the report proves true, this was the first time that
police had ever questioned an Israeli prime minister under
caution.
</P>
<P>
The investigation began after Channel One reported last month
that Bar-On's appointment was part of a deal in which Shas Party
leader Aryeh Deri was promised a plea bargain by Bar-On, in
exchange for Shas' support for the approval of the Hebron
agreement. Deri, according to the story, threatened to quit the
Likud-led coalition unless Bar-On was appointed.
</P>
<P>
According to Channel One, Netanyahu was pressured, and perhaps
even blackmailed, into appointing Bar-On, despite his advisers'
opposition to the appointment.
</P>
<P>
Bar-On, a member of the Likud Central Committee and a
Jerusalem criminal lawyer, resigned as attorney general within 48
hours as a result of almost unanimous opposition from the
country's legal circle.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister's Office today declined to respond any
aspects of the investigation concerning Netanyahu, said Israel
Television this evening.
</P>
<P>
In its Friday night report, Channel One also claimed that
Justice Minister Tzahi Hanegbi had misled the government on at
least five occasions regarding the Bar-On's appointment. However,
Hanegbi angrily denied the report and demanded an open apology
from the TV.
</P>
<P>
Following the latest revelations in the Bar-On affair,
coalition chairman Michael Eitan expressed shock over the report
that Netanyahu was questioned under caution. However, he said,
he was astonished that such a thing was broadcast without
being verified.
</P>
<P>
Overjoyed over the dramatic development, the opposition Labor
Party said today that it was creating a special committee to
prepare for early elections. Party secretary general Nissim
Zvilli said that the decision was taken as it now seems
increasingly likely that Netanyahu might eventually be forced
out of office due to the scandal.
</P>
<P>
In such an event, Zvilli said, the law states that a
new elections could be held within 60 days, leaving little
time for parties to prepare for the vote.
</P>
<P>
Yossi Sarid, left-wing Meretz Party chairman, called on
Netanyahu to suspend himself until police completes the
investigation. He added that the government can no longer
continue to function if it had, as being suspected, criminal
acts.
</P>
<P>
Labor Member of Knesset Yossi Beilin said today that Deri
should suspend himself from politics until all the allegations
are cleared out. If Deri, who is also Member of knesset,
is really responsible for his political career, he should stay
out of political life for some time. Deri is now on trial
for financial fraud.

<P>
HANOI, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam today protested the
broadcasting of the Radio Free Asia (RFA) again and demanded the
United States to dismantle the radio station.
</P>
<P>
In a commentary, Vietnam's Communist Party newspaper Nhan Dan
blasted recent pleadings by a U.S. State Department spokesman for
the RFA broadcasts amid strong criticisms in Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. radio station, which began operation about five months
ago, was abusing modern broadcasting technologies under the
pretext of "freedom" and "democracy," the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
A handful of U.S. hostile forces have been pursuing "peaceful
evolution" in an attempt to interfere, disstablize and eventually
overthrow other countries' political systems, it said.
</P>
<P>
The United States has been using cultural means as an invasive
instrument, the article said, noting that the RFA is against the
interests of people in Vietnam and other Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
It asserted that the Vietnamese people, who have always been
fighting for national independence and freedom, will continue to
oppose the RFA and take necessary measures to defend their
country.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Cautions Arab World of Population Menace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Egypt said today the growth of
population has become the "toughest and most serious challenge"
facing the Arab world whose population is witnessing the fastest
rise.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Prime Minister Gamal Ganzouri sounded the warning at
the inauguration of the 34th session of the Conference of Chambers
of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture for Arab Countries, a
three-day event attended by 600 Arab businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Ganzouri, in the speech read out by Minister of Trade and Supply
Ahmed Guweili, said the population in the Arab world reached some
253 millions and this figure is expected to be 290 millions by the
year 2000, he said.
</P>
<P>
The 2.5 percent rate of population growth in the Arab countries
is among the highest in the world, compared to an average of 1.8
percent in developing countries and only 0.4 percent in
industrialized states, he said.
</P>
<P>
But at the other hand, Ganzouri said the Arab countries have
the largest 15-65 age bracket in the world, which constitute the
most qualified group to contribute to the economic activity.
</P>
<P>
The Arab labor forces are estimated at 76 millions and this
figure will increase to about 90 million by the advent of the year
2000, he said.
</P>
<P>
The number of those working in the agricultural sector is
decreasing while the number of people working in industry is
surging up, he added.
</P>
<P>
Ganzouri in his speech to the conference said the Arab
countries spend 25 billion dollars on education, representing 5.6
percent of the national domestic product, he said.
</P>
<P>
"This percentage is equal to that in the industrialized
countries and higher than the percentage spent on education in
developing countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister called for overhauling the education and
training system, in order to strike a balance between the
education output and the requirement of the labor market.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait, Iran Work on of Joint Oil Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti and Iranian
officials today formed a committee to look into blueprints of
joint oil projects which would be declared after endorsement by
their governments, Kuwaiti Oil Minister Eisa Al-Mazidi said.
</P>
<P>
Al-Mazidi was making the revelation after talks held with the
visiting Iranian Minister of Petroleum Golam Reza Aqazadeh on
mutual cooperation and planned oil projects.
</P>
<P>
He said the committee was formed to review issues that were
raised during the talks.
</P>
<P>
Aqazadeh arrived in Kuwait earlier today for a two-day
official visit aimed at bolstering bilateral cooperation in the
field of oil.
</P>
<P>
He said upon his arrival that Iran and Kuwait were two
important members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (Opec) and prospects of cooperation between them were
plentiful.
</P>
<P>
He said he was carrying proposals for the Kuwaiti side on
cooperation between the two countries in the field of oil and
that the visit would lay the foundation for an expanded exchange
of information on oil.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait and Iran are two major oil producing countries in the
world. Kuwait has a proven oil reserve of about 80 billion
barrels and its current crude production is 2 million barrels
per day with a daily oil refining capacity of 700,000 barrels.
</P>
<P>
Iran produces some 4 million barrels of oil daily from which
it refines about 1 million barrels. Iran's oil refining capacity
is estimated at 1.24 million barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
Iran also produces about 70 billion cubic meters of gas and
11 million tonnes of chemical by-products.
</P>
<P>
Officials from Kuwait Oil Company had visited Iran on
February 9 for examining possibility of cooperation on oil,
petroleum, gas and petrochemical industries as well as joint
investment.
</P>
<P>
A statement released by the Iranian Embassy here earlier this
month said "Iran is ready to put its oil technics, services,
engineering and experience under Kuwait's disposal."
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries in oil industry have
witnessed remarkable development lately, the statement said,
noting that Iran signed a contract last month to purchase
kerosene and benzin from Kuwait Oil Company, the state-owned
umbrella oil conglomerate in the oil-rich state.
</P>
<P>
Aqazadeh noted that Iran purchased large quantities of
petroleum by-products in the last few years from Kuwait and that
talks on further cooperation would also embrace oil.
</P>
<P>
He said Iran was expected to open within the next few months
a new oil refinery in Hormuz straits with a production capacity
of about 240,000 barrels of oil daily in addition to a new
petrochemical project in the north during February producing
some 350,000 tonnes of petrochemicals and plastics annually.
</P>
<P>
Noting his talks with the Kuwaiti Oil Minister Issa Mohammed
Al-Mazidi were timely ahead of the forthcoming Opec meeting to
coordinate position, Aqazadeh said both Kuwait and Iran were for
the price-fixing and for adherence to Opec decisions.
</P>
<P>
Al-Mazidi indicated that Kuwait and Iran would discuss
coordination to maitain the level of prices of Opec oil
tommorow.
</P>
<P>
Aqazadeh, during his stay here, will also convey a verbal
message from Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani to the Kuwaiti
Amir Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah.

Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma said in a condolence letter

He died of respiratory failure. He was 93 and in the advanced

reforms, Uzbek President Islam Karimov noted that Deng has made
immeasurable contributions to China's modernization.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Deputy Minister of
Agriculture Olivia Muchena today called on commercial banks to
stop discriminating against women, saying it violates the laws of
the country.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the annual general meeting of the Zimbabwe Women
Finance Trust (ZWFT) in Harare, Muchena said the Legal Age of
Majority Act gave women the right to represent themselves even
when borrowing money from banks.
</P>
<P>
"The Legal Age of Majority is not binding when it comes to
money. I challenge ZWFT to stand for women's rights even if it
means taking legal action. You have a right to sign loan
application forms for yourselves because it is a law that was
passed by parliament," she said.
</P>
<P>
She was responding to women at the meeting who complained that
it was difficult for them to get money from banks as they were
not allowed to sign forms. Instead, they were asked to bring in
their husbands to sign on their behalf.
</P>
<P>
ZWFT is aimed at empowering women economically by promoting
the development of micro and small enterprises (SMES). It
provides women owners of the SMES with credit, business
management skills training and vocational training. enditem

<HEADLINE> China Passes Partnership Business Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- A law concerning partnership
businesses, the second passed by China governing the operations of
market components following the corporation law, was passed by
China's top legislature here today.
</P>
<P>
Ensconced in a decree by President Jiang Zemin, the law will
take effect as of August 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Before the draft was put for vote at today's closing ceremony
of the 24th session of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress, which ended today, several last-minute
revisions were made based on suggestions of the legislators at the
session.
</P>
<P>
One was an addition that requires partnership businesses to pay
taxes in accordance with relevant laws and government provisions;
another was an increase in the amount of fines for creating false
documents or using other fraudulent means to get partnership
businesses registered -- to a maximum of 5,000 yuan from the
former 3,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The law, comprising 78 articles in nine chapters, details
matters concerning the establishment of partnership businesses,
their financing, operations, relations with third parties, joining
and/or withdrawing from partnerships, disbanding, clearing
accounts and legal consequences.
</P>
<P>
China published its Corporation Law in 1993. Laws governing
other market components, such as stock-holding enterprises, are
now being drafted.

<HEADLINE> NATO Expansion Costs 35 Bln Dlrs, Report Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- It will cost up to 35
billion U.S. dollars over the next 12 years for the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) to expand into central and Eastern
Europe, a local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The United States, the Washington Post said, will share about
200 U.S. dollars of the total each year.
</P>
<P>
The cost projections are contained in a 31-page European
security strategy study that the Clinton administration is to
submit to Congress Monday, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The 16-nation NATO plans to select at its special summit in
July in Madrid the first group of new members from among 11
central and Eastern European countries that are seeking to join.
Top on the list are Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary.
</P>
<P>
To upgrade their armed forces, integrate them into the NATO
command structure and make them part of NATO's collective air
defense system will cost 2.1 billion to 2.7 billion U.S. dollars a
year, according to the estimate.
</P>
<P>
The document assumes that the new members selected at the
Madrid summit will pay 35 percent of the cost, the 15 European
members of the alliance will pay 50 percent and the U.S. will pay
15 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The cost projections do not include the potential U.S. share
of a joint NATO-Russia peacekeeping brigade, which the United
States offered to create last week in an effort to ease Russian
opposition to NATO expansion," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the cost estimate covers only the first group of
new members while the Clinton administration stresses NATO will
welcome additional candidates.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton vowed to start accepting new
members into NATO by the year 1999 in despite of the strong
opposition from Moscow.

<HEADLINE> Scholar Complains over UN Delaying of Jordan's Deals with Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 23 (Xinhua) - A renowned scholar has complained
over an intent U.N. delaying of Jordan's deals with Iraq, local
English daily Jordan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations Sanctions Committee (practically America
and Britain) approved all food and medicine contracts made by Iraq
with all countries except Jordan, which makes relevant companies
in Jordan suffer great losses," said Doctor Fahed Fanek, a scholar
specialized in economy and politics, in a signed article in the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the article said, some 220 enterprises, which are
based in Jordan doing legal business with Iraq, left Jordan for
Turkey and Dubai, where they can operate freely without the
heavy-handed surveillance by government agencies acting under
U.S. pressure.
</P>
<P>
Fanek's article is publicized against the background that the
U.N. delayed Jordan's deals with Iraq to supply food and
medicine.
</P>
<P>
Due to the delay, some companies concerned can not transport
their products to Iraq and some others stop production with
purchased raw materials stockpiled in factories. This brings
losses to the Jordanian producers and some have to turn to other
countries to strike deals with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
U.N. teams are "still busy inspecting the loads of every ship
calling on (Jordan's) Aqaba port, and examining each lorry leaving
Jordan towards the Iraqi borders," the article said.
</P>
<P>
"This serves as an indication that Jordan could not be trusted
to abide by the United Nations Sanctions Committee, and that the
sanctions are effectively extended to include Jordan, while
leaving other countries surrounding Iraq free to behave as they
like, including Turkey, Iran and Dubai," it added.
</P>
<P>
"This is an obvious humiliation directed to Jordan," Fanek
charged.
</P>
<P>
According to sources who declined to be identified, the Jordanian
government is currently trying to persuade the U.N. to approve its
deals with Iraq as soon as possible, but it has not voiced anger over
the delay officially in public.

<P>
The program spoke highly in particular Deng's contributions to
consolidating the leadership of the Communist Party in China and
ensuring Hong Kong's peaceful return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Hungarian newspaper, Nepszabadsag, called Deng "the father of
China's economic reform" and said that Deng's reform has made
China one of the countries which enjoys the fastest economic
growth in the world.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, a Polish newspaper, Rzeczeospolite, published an
article written by its Beijing correspondent, which called Deng
"the architect of China's reform and opening-up policies."
</P>
<P>
Deng's accomplishments lies not only in that he helped China
to achieve great economic development but also in that he
formulated a pragmatic foreign policy, which has boosted China's
international prestige, the articled said.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia's official news agency, Tanjug, filed a commentary
on Wednesday, saying that Deng, as the father of China's reform
and opening-up to the outside world, would certainly be remembered

have helped China out off the most serious disaster caused by the
"Cultural Revolution," the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
It added that Deng's theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics have given new vitality to socialism. The
returning of Hong Kong to China represented the victory of the
concept of "one country, two systems" initiated by Deng, the
commentary added.

<HEADLINE> Banks Urged to Support Reform of State Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Senior officials of China's
central bank today urged commercial banks to support the reform of
state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"Banks should actively support the efforts of state-owned
enterprises to readjust their structure and shift their
operational mechanisms, and do a better job of providing financial
services and bolstering the management of their creditors'
rights," Chen Yaoxian, deputy governor of the People's Bank of
China, said at a three-day meeting which ended today.
</P>
<P>
The overall strength of China's state-owned firms has increased
along with the ever-improving national economy in recent years,
Chen told the meeting, which was concerned with bankruptcies,
mergers and re-employment.
</P>
<P>
However, the decreasing efficiency of some state-owned
enterprises has become an outstanding problem in China's economic
work, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore the banking sector must have a correct understanding
of the new situation facing the state-owned enterprises and
earnestly support them in mergers, bankruptcies and
re-employment," Chen urged.
</P>
<P>
He added that currently policies on mergers and bankruptcies of
state-owned firms and on re-employment of their redundant workers
can only be implemented in the 110 cities selected by the State
Council, China's cabinet, to optimize the capital structure of
enterprises on a trial basis.
</P>
<P>
"We must guard against false bankruptcies, which are declared
in order to avoid debt," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the financial sector to uphold commercial bank
laws and rules.
</P>
<P>
Dai Xianglong, the central bank governor, called on the banking
sector to use levers such as loans and interest rates to boost the
restructuring of state firms and to curb repetitious construction
programs.

<HEADLINE> Senior Egyptian Official Urges Israel to Abide by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Osama el-Baz, political advisor
to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, reiterated today that Israel
has to implement the agreements signed by its previous government.
</P>
<P>
Baz made the remarks in an interview with "Good Morning Egypt"
TV program. He said that "agreements are signed between countries
and not people."
</P>
<P>
"As long as a certain government signs an agreement with any
party, the government that succeeds it remains committed to that
agreement," he added.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first country to make peace with Israel in 1979, has
held the Likud government responsible for the delay in
implementing the agreements between the former Israeli government
and the Palestinians. It also accuses Israel of backtracking on
the verbal pledges by the Labor government to return occupied
Golan Heights to Syria for peace.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian official said that the new Israeli government has
attempted to reexamine earlier agreements and called for the
introduction of amendments, though it "gave the impression it
would commit itself to earlier agreements when it resumed power in
May."
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question on last June's Cairo Arab summit that
adopted a resolution linking progress on the peace track to
cooperation with Israel, Baz said that the summit was held at a
time when the peace process was stalemated.
</P>
<P>
"The decision came when it remained unclear whether the new
Israeli government would commit itself to the signed agreements or
not," he added.
</P>
<P>
Saying that there has been progress in the peace process ever
since, Baz said no restrictions are imposed on any institution or
organization in contacts with Israel.

<HEADLINE> People in China's Old Revolutionary Bases Remember Deng Xiaoping (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- People in the Taihang and
Dabie Mountains, both of which are old revolutionary bases where
Deng Xiaoping worked for years, mourned the loss of their beloved
leader in a number of ways when they heard he passed away last
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Deng worked at the post of political commissar of the 129th
division of the Eighth Route Army, acting secretary of the North
China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of
China (CPC), and as secretary of the Taihang Sub-bureau of the
North China Bureau for five years. The people of Taihang Mountain
loved him very much and still call him "Old Deng" or Political
Commissar Deng" up to today.
</P>
<P>
Yao Yu'e, an old woman who worked in Deng's house during the
War of Resistance Against Japan, couldn't believe it when she
heard the news of Deng's death and felt a profound sense of grief
when she learned that it was true.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few days, she watched, with tears in her eyes, as
the Party, the military, and the people of various ethnic groups
in China recalled the days with Deng Xiaoping on the television.
</P>
<P>
She recalled the days when Zhuo Lin, Deng's wife, taught her to
read and write three Chinese characters every day when she worked
in Deng's house at the age of 15. Comrade Xiaoping used to come
over and stand behind her to check on whether she was writing
correctly or not.
</P>
<P>
Hao Haiwen, a 76-year-old Party member who served as a security
guard during the Anti-Japanese War, said that Deng used to do
farm work in the fields of the Eighth Route Army headquarters when
he lived in Yuntoudi Village, where Hao was asked to accompany him
across the Zhanghe River. One day, the river had risen, and Hao
insisted on carrying Deng on his back across the river. When Deng
failed in his attempt to dissuade Hao, he obeyed, but promised to
build a bridge across the river after winning the victory. And he
kept his word.
</P>
<P>
Hao's feelings were shared by villagers in Matian Town. A
message of condolence written by town leaders and sent to the CPC
Central Committee said that fundamental changes have taken place
in the town under the policy of reform and opening to the outside
world laid down by comrade Deng Xiaoping. How they wish, it said,
that Deng could have come back to see what had happened
there. They will turn grief into strength and make the village
even better.

<P>
When the news of Deng's death reached Dabie Mountain, where
Deng and Marshal Liu Bocheng led the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan
Field Army against 125,000 enemy troops and built a revolutionary
base in 1947, people were filled with a deep sense of sorrow.
</P>
<P>
Wang Chuanzhen, who was an 18-year-old boatman at the time,
remembered the People's Liberation Army's strict discipline and
that it did not encroach on the people to the slightest degree
when it crossed the Huaihe River.
</P>
<P>
People in Guangshan County, the site of the headquarters of the
troops commanded by Liu and Deng, mourned the loss of Deng with
deep grief during the past few days.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Yueqing, a 74-year-old woman, said Deng was a man of
soldierly bearing at the time and that all his impassioned
speeches were very moving. "Deng and Liu commanded troops to
liberate us. Deng also helped us to get rich. We cried several
times when we learned of his death," she said.
</P>
<P>
Li Zhongyang, secretary of the Party committee of Xinyang
Prefecture, said that Deng had passed through everywhere in
Xinyang during the war, and that people in his prefecture are very
proud of it. With the reforms initiated by Deng, per capita annual
income of the people in rural areas there rose to 1,356 yuan last
year, and the number of people living in poverty in the prefecture
had dropped from 2.57 million to 500,000.
</P>
<P>
There would have been no tremendous changes in the economic and
social development of Xinyang if there had not been the policy of
reform and opening to the outside world laid down by Deng
Xiaoping, Li said.

The Chinese team led the half time 1-0 when Finn Karjalainen
Lasse put the ball into his own net while blocking a shot from
China's Li Ming in the penalty zone at the 16th minute.

After the interval, Finland looked more aggressive,
occasionally testing the Chinese goalkeeper Ou Chuliang but again
the Finns failed to delivery a goal.
</P>
<P>
However, the Finns' effort finally paid off in the 53rd minute
in one of their counter attacks when Chinese teenager Sun Jihai,
trying to clear a shot from Finn Johansson Jonatan at the left
pole, kicked the ball inside China's own net.
</P>
<P>
The goal did not let the Chinese down. They scored their
decisive goal through substitute Hao Haidong in the 56th minute.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's new Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif here today launched a national campaign to
rid the country of growing foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
In a nation-wide televised speech, the prime minister named the
campaign as 'Pay Debts for Country's Health' and said that through
this scheme precious foreign exchange would be collected for which
three different methods have been devised.
</P>
<P>
These methods have been evolved in such a way as to enable the
citizens to participate in the campaign in a positive manner, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said the first method to relieve the county of the
international debt was for the Pakistanis and non resident
Pakistanis to deposit one thousand dollars each or more in the
special account opened for the purpose.
</P>
<P>
The second method, he said, was to donate one thousand dollars
or more to the Government as interest free loan.
</P>
<P>
"Every depositor will be free to maintain the account for two
to five years," said the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
However, he said for the sake of the motherland the people
would not get any interest on the deposited amount for the
duration it is maintained.
</P>
<P>
After two or more years, the depositors would be returned the
amount in the same form in which they deposited the sum, he
stated.

(UNSCOM) Chief Rolf Ekeus said here today that he and the Iraqi
side reached an agreement on removal of the prescribed missile
engines abroad for analysis after three days of talks.
</P>
<P>
At a joint news conference with Iraqi Undersecretary of Foreign
Affairs Zeyad al-Quysi, Ekeus said that "this meeting has
far-reaching significance since an agreement has been reached on
the hottest issue."
</P>
<P>
when asked where the analysis will be carried out, he
said "UNSCOM welcomes all offers from the U.S. and France, and the
laboratories in Russia are also under consideration."
</P>
<P>
Ekeus, who arrived here on February 20 on a bi-monthly visit,
added that it needs further tactical discussions on this issue.
</P>
<P>
The UNSCOM, in charge of disarming Iraq under U.N. resolution
661, wanted to transfer the destroyed Scud missile engines
stockpiled in the UNSCOM offices in Baghdad, the capital of Iraq,
to the United States for analysis. The commission must make sure
the engines are not substitutes of Iraqi-made useless engines.
</P>
<P>
But the Iraqi government first objected to this move and then
offered the proposal that the engines be transferred to Russia
for study from where they were imported.
</P>
<P>
Under U.N. resolution 661, Iraq must destroy all its
weapons of mass destruction, including the missiles with a
range over 150 kilometers and chemical as well as biological
weapons before the U.N.-imposed sanctions imposed on Iraq for its
invasion of Kuwait in 1990 are totally lifted.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Mourn Deng Xiaoping's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The people of Shaoshan, the
hometown of late Chairman Mao Zedong of the Chinese Communist
Party, and those of Tibet and Huangshan, where Deng Xiaoping
visited, have been mourning the death of Deng, who died on
February 19 at the age of 93.
</P>
<P>
In Shaoshan, in central China's Hunan Province, Tang Ruiren,
owner of a restaurant, said about Deng that "China has lost a good
leader."
</P>
<P>
Tang had been encouraged by the reform policy and opened a
snack shop that grew into the restaurant, which became a symbol of
Shaoshan's opening to the outside world and attracted a large
number of Chinese and foreign visitors.
</P>
<P>
Deng was the architect of China's policy of reform and opening
to the outside world which started in 1978.
</P>
<P>
Taking advantage of its having been the home of Mao, the
village, with its 450 households, opened 130 restaurants and 285
souvenir shops. The development of tourism helped it to raise its
per capita annual income from 200 yuan in the late 1970s to last
year's 5,200 yuan.
</P>
<P>
"Shaoshan would not become a prosperous area if there were no
economic reform initiated by Deng Xiaoping," said Mao Shiyou,
owner of another restaurant.
</P>
<P>
People in various parts of southwest China's Tibet Autonomous
Region have held discussions over the past few days of their deep
sorrow over Deng's death. They vowed to turn grief into strength,
to speed up economic and social development in Tibet and to push
ahead with socialism with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
At a service held in the Sera Monastery in the northern suburbs
of Lhasa, the regional capital of Tibet, 800 lamas chanted Buddist
scriptures to pray for Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
Nyima Cering, deputy director of the Democratic Managing
Committee of Johkang Temple, said, "Deng Xiaoping had always been
concerned about the stability and religious affairs of Tibet. We
should hold the banner of loving the motherland and religion high
and contribute to the stability of Tibet and the happiness of
mankind."
</P>
<P>
One retired soldier, who had participated in the battle to
liberate Tibet, took out a photo of him with Deng in 1965 and said
with tears in his eyes that, for the sake of avoiding difficulties
with the local people, after the People's Liberation Army marched
into Tibet, Deng had arranged transport of adequate grain and tea
supplies from interior areas to support the needs of troops
stationed in Tibet. He also paid special attention to training
cadres from ethnic backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
Li Xueshi, a deputy to the Anhui provincial People's Congress,
recalled Deng's visit to Huangshan in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Excited by the beautiful scenery there, Deng insisted on
climbing the mountain by himself, at the age of 75, instead of
being carried, and travelled 38 km in the four days during his
stay there. His willpower deeply impressed the local people.
</P>
<P>
Residents of Huangshan said that they will live up to the
expectations of Deng Xiaoping and develop tourism there.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Angolan president Eduardo Dos
Santos said here Saturday evening that the peace process is
developing smoothly and if this trend keeps going on, the
government of national unity and reconcilication may quite
possibly take office in March this year.
</P>
<P>
The president made this remark to the press circles at the
airport after meeting Namibian president Sam Nujoma who made a
stopover on way back home from Paris. If all the UNITA members
who are going to take part in the new government arrive in Luanda
in Februay, the new government will surely be formed in March, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The president revealed that peace process coordinator Blondin
Beye is doing his best to coordinate the stands of the Angolan
government and the UNITA. The latest information indicates that
the various quarters are discussing the matters concerning which
post UNITA chairman Jonas Savimbi should take -- the biggest
obstacle to the peace process, and are making progress in this
respect. Minor differences centring on this problem will be
solved in a couple of days so long as UNITA does not create new
difficuties, he said.
</P>
<P>
President Nujoma reiterated to the press that Namibia will
continue giving help to Angola in its peace process and urged
Savimbi to enter the government of national unity and
reconciliation as quickly as possible so as to enable Angola and
neighbouring countries to concentrate on national economic
development and promote the prosperity of the southern African
region.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 23 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Pan
Africanist Congress (PAC) committed itself today to national
unity but ruled out the possibility of a merger with the ruling
African National Congress.
</P>
<P>
South African Press Association (SAPA) quoted PAC Deputy
President Motsoko Pheko as saying that his party had made a clear
distinction between the interests of national unity and merger of
political parties.
</P>
<P>
Pheko's remarks was apparently reacting to South African
President Nelson Mandela's January invitation to the PAC to join
his Government of National Unity.
</P>
<P>
Pheko said in the event that the PAC finds it in the interests
of the people to join the Government of National Unity, it
reserves the right to nominate its own candidate.
</P>
<P>
However, Pheko said, "it would not be proper at this time in
the history of the PAC to have its president or deputy president
to hold a cabinet position."
</P>
<P>
He also called for the release of all its former militants who had
been jailed for involving in murders and violent activities, saying
the release of these people would send a very strong signal for
national unity. enditem

<P>
BEIJING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- A number of generals who
accompanied Deng Xiaoping in the days of fighting expressed their
sorrow over his death and recalled Deng's great contribution to
the creation and protection of the People's Republic of China and
the creation and the development of the military.
</P>
<P>
Deng passed away on February 19 at the age of 93.
</P>
<P>
The generals voiced their determination to rally closely round the
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China with Jiang Zemin
at its core and to help with the development of socialist
modernization.
</P>
<P>
Wu Xiuquan, who was present at the Zunyi Meeting with Deng
during the Long March, said with tears in his eyes that Deng was
an outstanding leader who had a great deal of prestige during his
long revolutionary career. "His death is an immeasurable loss
to our Party, our country and the army," he said.
</P>
<P>
Song Renqiong, who was deputy director of the Political
Department of the 129th Division of the Eighth Route Army,
recalled the old days of fighting in the Taihang Mountains under

heart-felt condolences.

thus beginning the nationwide strategic offensive in the People's
War of Liberation.

<HEADLINE> China's HK Representative on Merits Of "One Country, Two Systems" (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The resumption of the exercise
of sovereignty over Hong Kong has long been the aspiration of the
Chinese people, and Comrade Deng Xiaoping, with farsighted wisdom,
set forth the concept of "one country, two systems" to solve the
Hong Kong issue, Lu Ping, director of Hong Kong and Macao Affairs
Office under the State Council, said today.
</P>
<P>
In doing so, Deng laid the foundation for the peaceful
reunification of the motherland and pointed the direction toward
reunification, Lu noted, while recollecting those years when Deng
shaped the concept.
</P>
<P>
Lu became acquainted with the concept of "one country, two
systems" early in his work with Hong Kong and Macao affairs. "As
early as 1979, Comrade Deng Xiaoping had told visiting Hong Kong
Governor Maclehose that China would solve the Hong Kong issue in a
special way, and that the social system and lifestyle of Hong Kong
could remain unchanged," Lu said. These words illustrated the
embryonic form of the 'one country, two systems' concept.
</P>
<P>
Then, to further explore the concept's feasibility, Comrade
Deng personally consulted groups of people from Hong Kong,
listening to their views, offering many significant directives,
and noting that the basic guidelines of the nine-point principle
to solve the Taiwan question could also be applied to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with his directives, a special group was
organized at that time to look into the matter and study it
further. Lu Ping was a member of that group.
</P>
<P>
The group first analyzed various factors for Hong Kong's
economic success and the conditions that supported these factors,
and then considered how these factors could be maintained, and got
positive answers. Based on a large number of investigative
studies, 12 fundamental principles and policies, guided by
the 'one country, two systems' principle, were worked out.
</P>
<P>
In negotiations on the Hong Kong issue at the time, Lu noted,
Britain was not willing to return Hong Kong and insisted that the
three unequal treaties remain in effect. This was met with harsh
rebukes from China. Next, Britain suggested exchanging sovereignty
for governing power, and the negotiations reached a deadlock.
</P>
<P>
With the daring of a revolutionary, Deng said sternly that
sovereignty was not a matter open to negotiation, and that China
had no room for manoeuvre on the matter, and that it should be made
clear that China would resume the exercise of its sovereignty over
Hong Kong in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Lu went on to say that the people who took part in the
negotiations were deeply touched by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's
unyielding attitude on the matter of state sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
"We can say that the successful solution to the Sino-British
problem of the future of Hong Kong was achieved under the personal
guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping, within the timetable set by the
venerable old man," Lu said.

<P>
"I still remember the time when Chinese and British leaders
signed the Sino-British Joint Declaration," Lu recalled. "More
than 100 people from various walks of Hong Kong society at the
ceremony were very excited to see Comrade Deng Xiaoping enter the
Great Hall of the People, because they truly felt that 'one
country, two systems' is a great creation, and the fundamental
guarantee of Hong Kong's magnificent future."
</P>
<P>
He noted that Deng had made a major effort to maintain Hong
Kong's stability and prosperity in the transition period, during
which time, he said, Deng met many times with people from various
walks of Hong Kong society, in Beijing, and repeatedly explained
the Chinese government's principles and policies on Hong Kong,
something that played a key role in reassuring Hong Kong society
and the public.
</P>
<P>
Deng also held many meetings with members of the draft
committee of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region, during the four years and eight months when the law was
being drafted, and gave explicit instructions for the draft work,
he added.
</P>
<P>
"His encouragement and support enabled us and people from Hong
Kong to work out a law that has both historical and international
significance," he said, noting that Deng also gave the useful
advices that during the transition period, Hong Kong should
develop a qualified managerial team whose members love both the
motherland and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"We have always followed his instructions, insisting on the
work principle of 'facing and relying on the people of Hong Kong',
uniting Hong Kong's residents in an extensive way under the banner
of 'loving the motherland and loving Hong Kong', and have
encouraged their active participation in preparing for Hong Kong's
smooth transition, which has greatly helped the smooth formation
of the HKSAR," he said.
</P>
<P>
In looking back on the vicissitudes of Hong Kong's transition
period, he pointed out that, while there were many struggles, Hong
Kong never suffered any major upheavals, and that "this has fully
proven the fact that only by firmly implementing Comrade Deng
Xiaoping's policy of 'one country, two systems', can Hong Kong
maintain its current economic prosperity and public stability, and
be assured that the Chinese government will resume the exercise of
its sovereignty over Hong Kong on schedule."
</P>
<P>
He said that he and his colleagues, who sincerely hoped that
Deng Xiaoping would be able to witness the historic moment when
Hong Kong returns to the motherland, felt a great deal of sorrow
when Deng passed away only 130 days before the event.
</P>
<P>
"We will turn grief into strength, and express our mourning for
Comrade Deng Xiaoping by the practical act of continuing to
implement the 'one country, two systems' policy under the
leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin
at the core," Lu Ping said.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Assures Aquino He'll Step Down in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos today assured former president Corazon Aquino and other key
players in the 1986 EDSA People Power Revolution that he will step
down when his term ends in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The president made the assurance during the presentation of a
special plaque of recognition to Mrs. Aquino for her pivotal role
in the EDSA Revolution which ended the Marcos dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
The presentation, which was made at a private luncheon and
thanks-giving mass held this afternoon in Manila, was part of
activities in commemoration of the four-day People Power
Revolution of 1986.
</P>
<P>
Asked why he specifically mentioned 1998, Ramos replied:
"Because that is the end of my term and also the centennial of
Philippine independence. Beyond that, it's time for others."
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth time in six days that the president squelched
speculations that he was maneuvering to seek re-election or extend
his six-year term through an amendment of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
The president has, on numerous occasions and before various
audiences, made known his decision to step down at the end of his
six-year constitutional term on June 30, 1998.
</P>
<P>
In brief remarks during the luncheon, Aquino said she wished
for Ramos to continue and to achieve all the necessary
accomplishments that the Philippines needs.
</P>
<P>
"I will continue to support you," she said.

HANOI, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is to accelerate the
development of renewable energy in remote regions in a bid to have
70 percent of its population in mountain areas covered by the
national power grid, the official press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The energy sources include solar energy, wind power,
hydro-electricity and gas generated from biological materials.
</P>
<P>
Southern regions in Vietnam have the advantage to develop solar
energy. Cu Chi, in the outskirts of the Ho Chi Minh city, is the
first locality in the country to have used solar power, reports
said.
</P>
<P>
In the north, though the use of solar energy is limited in
winter time, solar energy has been used in water heating for
nurseries, hospitals and families, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, more solar power stations are planned for mountainous
and remote areas where the national power grid cannot reach in the
near future.

<HEADLINE> Deng-"one country, two systems" (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vice premier Qian Qichen, who is in charge of the preparatory
work of the HKSAR, when speaking to reporters, paid tribute to
Comrade Deng Xiaoping in a low voice that reflected his profound
grief, saying, "'One country, two systems" is a key component of
Comrade Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics, and a significant creation of his."
</P>
<P>
In order to reunify the motherland, Qian said, Comrade Xiaoping
put forth the principles of peaceful reunification and 'one
country, two systems', which were based on respecting history and
the current situation and proceeding from specific conditions.
</P>
<P>
"The principles reflect his materialist spirit of seeking truth
from facts, his broad-mindedness as a Marxist, and his inheriting
of traditional Chinese culture that is profound in content and
rich in forgiveness," he added.
</P>
<P>
Expressing the same deep sorrow as Qian, Wang Zhaoguo, vice
chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference and head of the United Front
Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, said that he had had
many opportunities to listen to Deng, which benefitted him a lot.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that Deng first brought up the concept of 'one
country, two systems', which was based on the collective wisdom of
the whole Party and the entire people, as a means of solving the
Taiwan issue, and then successfully applied it in solving the Hong
Kong and Macao problem.
</P>
<P>
"The principles of peaceful reunification and 'one country, two
systems' is the only reasonable, realistic, and feasible way to
solve the Taiwan affair and achieve China's complete
reunification, because they not only safeguard national
sovereignty and territorial integrity, but also take the interests
of various sides into account," he explained.
</P>
<P>
Lu Ping, the director of the State Council's Hong Kong and
Macao Affairs Office, recalled the time that Deng put forth
the 'one country, two systems' concept.
</P>
<P>
"In 1979, Comrade Xiaoping told Hong Kong's Governor Maclehose
that China had a consistent stand on the Hong Kong issue, which
would be solved in a special way. He also asked the Governor to
convey a message to Hong Kong investors that they could have
confidence in Hong Kong's future," Lu recalled, noting that these
words represented an embryo of the 'one country, two systems'
concept.
</P>
<P>
From that time on, he said, Deng personally consulted groups of
people from Hong Kong, listened to their opinions, expressed many
important views, and pointed out that the gist of the nine-point
principle for solving the Taiwan issue could also be applied to
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Lu noted that Deng also put in a great deal of painstaking
efforts in negotiating the Hong Kong issue and in protecting Hong
Kong's stability and prosperity during the transition period.
</P>
<P>
He said that during the four years and eight months of drafting
the Basic Law of the HKSAR, Deng constantly met with members of
the draft committee to give instructions.
</P>
<P>
"Without his instructions and encouragement, it would have been
impossible for us to complete the draft of this law, which has
both historical and international significance, in such a smooth
way," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yunlin, the new director of the State Council's Taiwan
Affairs Office, focused on the outstanding contributions of Deng's
peaceful reunification and 'one country, two systems' principles
to the development of relations across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
"Guided by these principles," he said, "people on both sides of
the straits have put an end to the long-standing situation in
which they had been cut off from each other, and great changes
have taken place in the two sides' relations," and Deng always
firmly opposed any words or actions that attempted to create "two
Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan", or any interference in the
Taiwan issue by any foreign powers.
</P>
<P>
"The policies for the Taiwan issue he personally mapped out are
both highly principled and flexible, and have set us a glorious
example," he commented.
</P>
<P>
Those who witnessed the signing ceremony of the Sino-British
Joint Declaration expressed great sorrow in their mourning. Zhou
Nan, director of the Hong Kong Branch of Xinhua News Agency,
recalled that when Deng Xiaoping entered the Great Hall of the
People to attend the signing ceremony, more than a hundred Hong
Kong delegates present on the scene became excited and welcomed
him with warm applause.
</P>
<P>
"At that moment, it was our common belief that the great
creation of 'one country, two systems' would provide a basic
guarantee for the magnificent future of Hong Kong," Zhou said,
"The scene is as vivid as yesterday, but Comrade Xiaoping has left
us forever."
</P>
<P>
"What we can do now is work even harder, and comfort Comrade
Xiaoping's soul by ensuring Hong Kong's smooth transition and
long-term prosperity and stability," he added.

"I had a chance to talk with Mr. Deng, and felt that it is a
blessing for China and the Chinese people to have such an
outstanding leader," Ann Tse-kai, vice-chairman of the CPPCC
National Committee, said with emotion.
</P>
<P>
"How we wished that he could come to have a look at Hong Kong
when the political power of Hong Kong changed in 1997," the
vice-chairman said.
</P>
<P>
Ma Man-kei, another vice-chairman of the CPPCC National
Committee and president of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce
of Macao, said that the people of Macao would remember Deng
Xiaoping's deeds of merit forever, and said he believes that
Macao's future will be better under the guidance of the 'one
country, two systems' principle.
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Deng met with Nobel-prize winner Lee Yuantseh. In
recalling the moment, Lee said to Taiwanese reporters that the
meeting was still clear in his memory.
</P>
<P>
"Deng Xiaoping was indeed a state leader with extraordinary
bearing and vast field of vision," Lee said, "He was greatly
concerned about the Taiwan question and asked many things about
Taiwan, saying that the Chinese nation has many fine traditions
which should be carried on."
</P>
<P>
Deng is gone, but the concept of 'one country, two systems' has
become part of his legacy for the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Qian Qichen told reporters that although Deng
Xiaoping has passed away, the key policies on Hong Kong's
returning to the motherland have been decided, the preparations
for the HKSAR are well under way, and the main framework of the
HKSAR has been established.
</P>
<P>
"With only a little over a hundred days to the return of Hong
Kong, we will make a concerted effort to prepare for the return,
and doing that well is the best remembrance of Comrade Deng
Xiaoping," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that the Chinese people are able to handle
the steady transition of Hong Kong, the smooth delivery of
political power, and Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and
stability, to realize the complete reunification of the motherland
ultimately, and to accomplish the unfinished cause of Comrade Deng
Xiaoping," Qian said.

Various Hong Kong social groups are also confident about this,
according to Tung Chee Hwa, the first chief executive of HKSAR,
who said, in a message of condolence to the Chinese
leaders: "Mr. Deng is most admired and respected by the Hong Kong
community. With unmatched vigor, he developed the innovative
concept of 'one country, two systems' for Hong Kong to return to
China on July 1, 1997. He also laid a sound foundation for Hong
Kong's long-term stability and development beyond 1997."
</P>
<P>
At this time, he said, the people of Hong Kong "will need to
work even harder and in greater unity to prepare for the
establishment of the HKSAR Government, so as to translate fully
Mr. Deng's 'one country, two systems' into reality."
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong press also say that although Deng has passed
away, the people of Hong Kong firmly believe that China's third
generation of leaders will carry on Deng's cause, and continue
the 'one country, two systems' principle as the best means of
mourning the losss of the great man.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Legislature Reaches Decision on Hongkong Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress (NPC), China's legislature, adopted a
ruling on dealing with Hong Kong's existing laws, in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
"The Decision on Handling Hong Kong's Existing Laws in
accordance with Article 160 of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region" was adopted at the 24th session of
the Eighth NPC Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
The document states that most of the existing laws in Hong Kong
will remain in effect after China resumes the exercise of its
sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1 of this year, and those that
contradict the Basic Law will be revised or rescinded.
</P>
<P>
The Committee also published two appendices giving 14
provisions and auxiliary laws that completely contravene the Basic
law and that will be revoked, and articles in the adopted laws
that will be annulled.
</P>
<P>
Another appendix published today states principles and
guidelines for re-placing terms and expressions that contradict
the Basic Law. The word "royal", for example, will be replaced by
respective organizations of the HKSAR government.
</P>
<P>
The document states that, after ratifying Hong Kong's existing
laws, the NPC Standing Committee will still have the right to
amend or rescind those laws it holds to contradict the Basic Law.

<HEADLINE> Deng Remembered For His Idea Of "One Country. Two Systems" (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Deng Xiaoping died peacefully,
only a hundred-plus days before the return of Hong Kong to the
motherland, leaving one with a feeling of deep regret that he was
not able to fulfill his wish to visit Hong Kong by himself on the
day of the return, even in a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is grief-stricken but remains calm. On February 20, a
list of the names of leading officials nominated by the first
chief executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
Tung Chee-hwa and approved by the central government, was
announced according to schedule.
</P>
<P>
The Hang Seng index surged more than 300 points, indicating
that the people of Hong Kong are full of confidence in the trend
Hong Kong is taking in it's return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Over the past ten years, the region's prosperity and stability
and its people's confidence in their future could be attributed to
Deng Xiaoping's great concept of "one country, two systems," and
to the gradual implementation of the "Hong Kong people governing
Hong Kong" and "high degree of autonomy in Hong Kong" principles.
</P>
<P>
The fact that Hong Kong is able to withstand shocks lies in its
people's full trust in Deng. In mourning Deng's passing, one Hong
Kong newspaper said that "No words of praise can express the
greatness of `one country, two systems.'"
</P>
<P>
The world will remember Deng's "one country, two systems"
concept as having provided a novel method for the international
community to solve problems. China has created a miracle of modern
history in resuming sovereignty over Hong Kong by means of
the 'one country, two systems' idea.
</P>
<P>
Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said at that
time that the unprecedented concept of 'one country, two systems'
provided an imaginative answer to Hong Kong's special historical
environment.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leader's farsightedness eventually led to the
signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, marking a milestone
in the history of international diplomacy. The United Nations
Secretary General praised that measure as an example for other
countries in solving difficult problems.

<HEADLINE> Refugee Transit Centre in Northern Zambia Closed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The refugee transit centre in
Mpulungu in northern Zambia has been closed because of insecurity
to the local community, according to the Zambia Sunday Mail.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper today quoted Albert Kayamba as saying on
Saturday in Kasama refugee camp 200 kilometres from Mpulungu that
it is difficult to confine the Zairean refugees to a community
hall which is used as a transit centre because it is not fenced
off to prevent refugees from mixing with the local people.
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the provincial refugee reception committee
said because of the long-term trade links between Mpulungu and
Kalemi, a port town in Zaire, it is more difficult to distinguish
who are refugees and who are traders.
</P>
<P>
"Because of this we have decided to screen the refugees as
they come off the ships and transport them straight to Natenda
camp in Kasama," said Kayamba.
</P>
<P>
The community hall is already overcrowded with about 300
refugees fleeing the war in eastern Zaire with 500 more expected
when a ship currently marooned on lake Tanganyika docks at
Mpulungu.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. official said it is not safe to keep refugees close to the
border in a war situation.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos today ordered the immediate implementation of two housing
projects comprising an area of 126 hectares in the Autonomous
Region in Muslim Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The two housing projects are part of the various government
programs intended to accelerate the economic development of the
autonomous region areas following the signing of the Mindanao
peace agreement last September.
</P>
<P>
The proposed sites for the housing projects are the Bo Tan
Estate, a 101-hectare property in Indanan, Jolo province, and the
25-hectare Patikul property also in Jolo.
</P>
<P>
The president has mobilized five Cabinet departments, the
autonomous region and several other government agencies to
implement the project on a priority basis.
</P>
<P>
The Bo Tan Estate will be developed to service the housing
needs of members of the Moro National Liberation Front and the
informal settlers in Jolo, particularly those who will be
displaced by government infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
The Patikul property will be developed under a joint venture
scheme with the private sector. It will service the housing
requirement of low-salaried government employees as well as
private sector workers.

KAMPALA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- A high ranking Ugandan
officer appealed the people in western Uganda to be vigilant to
the activities of scattered rebels of Allied Democratic Forces
(ADF).
</P>
<P>
Colonel Peter Kerim, the commander of the second division of
Uganda People's Defence Forces (UPDF), asked the residents in
western Uganda to report the activities of ADF rebels to security
personnel.
</P>
<P>
ADF now are so weak to cause panic among public due to the
loss imposed on them by UPDF, the colonel said.
</P>
<P>
ADF had some 1,000 members in its ranks in last November but
now they divided themselves into some separate small groups on
the run, recent reports from western Uganda indicated.
</P>
<P>
"The Monitor" report today confirmed death of Mutebi, an ADF
rebel commander. The body of Mutebi was identified by captured
ADF rebels. Mutebi was one of ADF rebels killed on February 13 in
a fierce fighting between the rebels and UPDF in south-western
district of Bushenyi. The rebels were repulsed after Mutebi's
death. Five magazines fully loaded with ammunition, two hand
grenades and an anti-tank grenade were found on the Mutebi's
body. Five rebels were captured in the battle.
</P>
<P>
The commander sent local defence units to convince local
people to return to their homes after the fighting, the newspaper

<HEADLINE> Israeli Scientists Find New Way to Separate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 23 (Xinhua) -- A new technique for
separating isotopes, based on an application of quantum theory,
has been developed at Israel's Weizman Institute of Science,
reported The Jerusalem Post today.
</P>
<P>
The discovery will open up new industrial uses in a variety of
fields, including advanced chemistry, genetic engineering,
pharmaceuticals, biotechnology and medical equipment, the report
quoted an announcement of the institute as saying.
</P>
<P>
The technique was developed by Dr. Ilya Averbukh, a chemical
physicist who immigrated five-and-a-half years ago from the
former Soviet Union, and joined Weizman's staff.
</P>
<P>
Yeda, the institute's research and development arm, has
applied for a patent on the new technique.
</P>
<P>
For decades, methods of separating isotopes have been based
on the use of centrifuges. But these techniques, said Averbukh,
are very expensive, relatively slow and not highly accurate.
</P>
<P>
During the past 25 years, highly effective laser methods were
introduced to separate isotopes, but their use is limited by the
need to fine-tune the laser beam to one particular isotope,
which makes these techniques quite expensive, added the
physicist.
</P>
<P>
Averbukh's idea is based on quantum theory, which is one of
the most proven scientific theories but also one of the least
tangible. Among its principles is that one can never know
simultaneously the location and speed of movement of a
particle. Thus, a particle being or not being in a certain place
is a matter of probability, and cannot be scientifically proven.
</P>
<P>
Under certain conditions, according to quantum theories, there
is no choice but to presume that a single particle exists and
doesn't exist in a number of places at the same time.
</P>
<P>
The Averbukh method is referred to as "wavepacket technology,"
because it makes use of wavepackets, a quantum-theory concept
describing particular states in which electrons, atoms or
molecules can be found.

CANBERRA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Australia will donate 2.5
million Australian dollars (about 2 million U.S. dollars) to the
World Food Program's appeal to raise 41.6 million U.S. dollars for
emergency famine relief to the Democratic People's Republic of

The World Food Program's appeal hopes to purchase 100,000 tons

<HEADLINE> Uganda Becomes Major Transit Route for Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has become a major
transit route for narcotic drugs especially heroin, cocaine,
mandrax and cannabis from Latin America and Asia to Europe and
USA, reported the local daily "the Monitor" today.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's senior officials in the narcotics department were
quoted as saying, "The trend is worrying. Traffickers are finding
most European routes difficult. East African territory is very
appropriate at the moment."
</P>
<P>
In 1996, 15 traffickers including a Gambian, four Nigerians,
two Pakistanis, two Mali nationals, two Kenyans and four Ugandans
were arrested in Uganda and prosecuted in courts of law.
</P>
<P>
In the same year, Ugandan authorities intercepted 2,72
kilograms of heroin worth 80,000 U.S. dollars, over 78 kilograms
of mandrax tablets worth 679,000 dollars, about four kilograms of
cocaine worth 800,000 dollars and others.
</P>
<P>
The officials said, " For every ten traffickers arrested, nine
have passed through, so the trend is bad.''
</P>
<P>
They said, most of the drugs are passed through Entebbe

<HEADLINE> Philippines Seeks to Export More Sugar to U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines is trying to
get the additional allocation due its sugar exports to the United
States, sources from the country's Sugar Regulatory Administration
said today.
</P>
<P>
Sugar Regulatory Administration chief Wilson Gamboa flew to the
U.S. today to iron out kinks in Philippine sugar exports, an
administration official revealed.
</P>
<P>
The official said Gamboa's trip seeks to ensure that the
Philippines gets the additional allocation of its sugar exports.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines shipped in advance last month 25,000 tons of
sugar to cover an expected additional allocation.
</P>
<P>
Gamboa was quoted by the official as saying the allocation has
not been granted even as the U.S. sugar's stock-to-ratio-use has
slipped.
</P>
<P>
Gamboa said he would also look into the threat posed by
competition from Latin American countries which have trade links
with the U.S. under the North American Free Trade Area agreement.
</P>
<P>
Mexican sugar, for example, is exported tariff-free to the
U.S., and, thus is priced lower than Philippine sugar.
</P>
<P>
Gamboa said he will strive to counter the possibility that the
country's sugar quota may be reduced because of the increased
exports from Mexico and other Latin American countries.
</P>
<P>
He will also look into the possibility of selling Philippine
sugar directly to private companies or American consumers.
</P>
<P>
The price of sugar in the Philippines slumped toward the end of
last year because imports under the so-called counter trade scheme
led to an oversupply.
</P>
<P>
The Sugar Regulatory Administration cannot regulate sugar
imports because the country's Court of Appeals has ruled that its
authority does not extend to imports.

KAMPALA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Over 1.7 billion sticks of
cigarettes were produced and consumed by Ugandans in 1996 as
compared to 1.62 billion sticks in 1995, reported the local daily
"the Monitor" today.
</P>
<P>
It represents a five percent increase, according to the
British American Tobacco (BAT), which held the monopoly in
Uganda's tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of male to female smokers in Uganda is estimated at
96:4, the paper said, adding that this is mainly on account of
the strong cultural beliefs that do not favour women smoking.
</P>
<P>
However, younger women are now increasingly taking to smoking
especially in urban areas where social life is more open, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, tobacco industry in Uganda paid 44 million dollars
to government in taxes, a slight increase from 43 million dollars
in 1995, the paper added.
</P>
<P>
Cigarrette prices in Uganda remaind constant in 1994-96.

KAMPALA. February 23 (Xinhua) -- Beer consumption in Uganda
increased from 3.3 million crates (about 82.5 million bottles )
in 1995 to 4.5 million crates (about 112.5 million bottles ),

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Southern Tanzania
regions of Mtwara, Ruvuma and Lindi are destined to receive
stable electricity from gas pumped from Mnazi Bay wells in Mtwara
Region.
</P>
<P>
According to the local paper "Sunday Observer", an Irish
Company Tullow was negotiating with the petroleum entity to build
a gas processing plant from electricity production in Mtawara.
</P>
<P>
Hamidu Bisanga, Public Relations Manager with the Tanzania
Petrolleum Development Corporation (TPDC) was quoted as saying
that the project would cost about USD 30 million to complete.
</P>
<P>
Mtwara, Songea and Lindi receive thermal electric power from
diesel run engines which make them often experience power
shortages.
</P>
<P>
The project is to be funded by the World Bank which is also to
fund another gas project aimed at transferring gas from Songo
Songo to Dar es Salaam to the tune of USD 250 million.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the project is USD 300 million, the deficit
of which is to be met by the Tanzania government and other
donors.
</P>
<P>
A portion of the gas is to be used for electric power
production that would be put under the national grid for
export.

<HEADLINE> China's Telephone Switching Machine Market to Be Brisk By 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- China will ensure a good
market for domestic and foreign manufacturers of telephone
switching machines in the next four years, as the Post and
Telecommunications Ministry plans to bring the country's switching
capacity to 170 million lines by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
According a survey appearing in the latest issue of China
Electronics News, program-controlled switching machines will
increase by 84 million during the Ninth Five-Year Plan
(1996-2000). By 2000, long-distance switching capacity will reach
six million accesses and telephone customers exceed 130 million.
</P>
<P>
Then the national telephone availability rate will hit 10
percent, and will be as high as 30 to 40 percent in urban area.
</P>
<P>
However, the increasing market demand will still lag behind
supply capacity. China has already approved 44 manufacturers of
commercial switching machines, including 12 Sino-foreign joint
ventures. These plants have a combined production capacity of 24
million lines annually, far exceeding the yearly demand of 16.4
million lines.
</P>
<P>
China began to reduce imports of foreign switching machines in
1996, and competition among Sino-foregin joint ventures, domestic
plants, and overseas companies will grow increasingly vigorous in
coming years, the report says, urging the central government to
readjust the over-heated growth of the switching machine industry
in the country, and calling for more financial support for
domestic companies to exploit the overseas market.
</P>
<P>
The report also suggests that the government maintain imports
of key parts of advanced switching systems, in spite of its
decision to cool down the purchase of foreign switching machines.

HARARE, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Exploration for minerals in
Zimbabwe has increased to new heights with current exclusive
prospecting orders (epos) standing at 230 and a further 160
applications being processed, the Sunday Mail reported today.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's minister of mines Swithun Mombeshora told the paper
that this was a phenomenal increase considering that in 1991 only
74 epos were processed and used.
</P>
<P>
The total area currently reserved for exploration activity
accounted for 90.5 percent of the total land mass of Zimbabwe and
there was room for foreign investors to come to Zimbabwe, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past four years expenditure on exploration has been
going up with about five million U.S. dollars being spent in
1995. Figures for last year were not yet available but the
expenditure could be higher, he said.
</P>
<P>
Most of those prospecting were seeking diamonds, gold and base
minerals. Zimbabwe is thought to have earned at least 700 million
U.S. dollars from mining last year, he said.

ROME, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The president of the Italian
National Olympic Committee (CONI) on Saturday denied accusations
from South Africa that his committee has organized a campaign to
discredit Cape Town's bid for the 2004 Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Chris Ball, president of the committee promoting Cape Town's
bid, charged that the Rome 2004 Committee was behind reports in
the Italian media highlighting the alleged crime problems in Cape
Town.
</P>
<P>
These reports went public in Italian media after a panel of the
International Olympic Committee (IOC) released its evaluation
report following tours to the eleven candidate cities for the 2004
Games.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Ball, CONI president Pescante, also a member of
the Rome 2004 Committee, said "Italian sport follows the rules of
fair play. They are part of our culture, and nothing in the world
would make us stray from them."
</P>
<P>
"On a personal level, I have always respected South Africa and
how its sport have become a key factor in creating a climate of
solidarity, peace and democracy."
</P>
<P>
Pescante said he hoped the race for the 2004 would continue "in
the true Olympic spirit."
</P>
<P>
Apart from Rome and Cape Town, the other candidate cities were
Istanbul, Stockholm, Seville, Lille, San Juan, Rio de Janeiro,
Buenos Aires, Athens and St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
The IOC panel is expected to name four or five finalists in
March and announce the winner for the 2004 Games in September.

LUSAKA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has
rejected a 20 billion Kwacha (15.4 million US dollars) donation
from the European Union (eu) for agricultural projects.
</P>
<P>
The local press today quoted a senior government official as
confirming the government stand, saying that the EU proposed
donation to the agricultural sector investment program (ASIP)
projects is tailored to benefit only "non-indigenous big
farmers".
</P>
<P>
Agriculture, food and fisheries permanent secretary Austin
Sichinga said, "We don't want something which will only benefit a
single group, this is why we have asked for modifications until
the government is satisfied."
</P>
<P>
The report quoted sources within the Ministry of Agriculture,
Food and Fisheries as revealing that a total of 15 billion Kwacha
out of the 20 billion Kwacha (15.4 million US dollars) have been
earmarked by the EU for several projects which would allegedly
only benefit a clique of farmers whose countries of origin are
among donors funding ASIP projects.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, an official sitting on the ASIP
committee will soon be removed because he was allegedly operating
as if he was serving the interests of other countries. endiem

<HEADLINE> Round-Up: Indonesia Promotes Ties with ASEAN Observer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto's
tour of Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar, which ended here today, helped
promote its bilateral ties and cooperation with the three observer
countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
During his week-long visits to the three countries, Soeharto
emphasized his country's support for their entry into ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Ali Alatas, who accompanied Soeharto during
the visits, stressed in Yangon that ASEAN, taking into account
each country's internal political situation, never sets forth
preconditions for countries to join the grouping.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed the unanimous decision made at the Jakarta
informal ASEAN summit meeting last November that Cambodia, Laos
and Myanmar would be admitted simultaneously as full members.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN now groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto, during his current tour, held talks with leaders of
the three countries. All expressed their aspirations to promote
their bilateral ties and cooperation especially in the field of
economy.
</P>
<P>
In Cambodia, an agreement between Indonesia and Cambodia to
further promote the existing 1994 agreement on economic and
technical cooperation was reached. A memorandum of understanding
on oil and gas exploration development and protection was also
signed.
</P>
<P>
In Laos, an MOU on cooperation in agriculture, forestry and air
transport was signed between Indonesia and Laos.
</P>
<P>
During Soeharto's last stop in Myanmar, Indonesia and Myanmar
reached two MOUs including the one between his country's PT.
Triputra Unggul Utama company and state-owned Myanma Airways on
setting up a joint venture to run Myanmar's domestic air
transport services.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto's three-nation tour, which began on February 17,
helped boost Indonesia's bilateral ties with Cambodia, Laos and
Myanmar, observers said.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Bankers Urged to Speed up Loan Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Finance Minister
Shah Ams Kibria Saturday expressed his "anxiety" over the slow
recovery of classified loan and asked the bankers to apply the new
law framed to deal with the default menace.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Loan Court Law had been amended months ago for
gearing up the loan-recovery drive, he told a meeting with
managing directors of the nationalized and private banks, local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
"You try your best to recover the classified loan. Just inform
me if the present laws are not sufficient. If needed, we will make
law more stringent and efficient," Kibria was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Bangladeshi Central Bank has asked the commercial banks to
recover by March 31 at least 50 percent of the total classified
credit, now amounting to 150 billion taka (about 3.75 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
But the rate of recovery was not up to the expected level, said
officials and bankers. This, they said, has become a great
hindrance for the recovery of the economy.
</P>
<P>
Kibria said no nation could prosper with a default culture. The
recovery rate of classified loan would be considered in evaluating
the professional competence of the bankers, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- the home secretaries of
Bangladesh and India are to hold a three-day crucial meeting in
New Delhi beginning tomorrow to take policy decisions on
elimination of cross-border insurgency and border crimes, said a
foreign ministry official here.
</P>
<P>
The main thrust of the meeting is likely to be on review of
security aspects and problems of cross-border crimes being
encountered by the two countries and setting up of a necessary
monitoring mechanism, the official indicated.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first meeting at the home secretary level
between the two countries since October 1993.
</P>
<P>
Both countries have long been fighting insurgents in their
border regions.
</P>
<P>
Dhaka is facing tribal problems in its southeast areas
bordering India and Myanmar. In northeast India bordering
Bangladesh and Myanmar, thousands of people have been killed in
battles between the guerrillas and Indian government troops over
the last decades.
</P>
<P>
A decision to exchange information on insurgency and terrorism
between the relevant agencies of the two countries may also be
taken to counter security threats, the foreign ministry official
added.
</P>
<P>
The decision to meet cross-border insurgency threats and border
related problems was taken during the meeting between Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina and her Indian counterpart Deve Gowda when
the latter visited Dhaka last month.

MACAO, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Portuguese President Jorge
Sampaio left here today for Beijing as scheduled for a week-long
state visit to China after his six-day stay here.
</P>
<P>
Sampaio is expected to meet Chinese President Jiang Zemin,
Premier Li Peng and Chairman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress Qiao Shi.
</P>
<P>
He will also visit Shenyang, capital of northeast China's
Liaoning Province, Xi'an, capital of China's Shaanxi Province and
Shanghai in east China.
</P>
<P>
Sampaio is expected to discuss with Chinese leaders a wide
range of issues on bilateral cooperation in Macao and on exchange
in economic and trade fields.
</P>
<P>
Trade and economic exchange between Portugal and China is
likely to be a major topic during the president's visit to China.
</P>
<P>
Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama, ministers of economy
and of science and technology and 40 representatives of industrial
and commercial, tourism and financial sectors are accompanying the
president in his visit to China.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Macao Government, including Governor Vasco

<HEADLINE> Thai Stock Market Revives With Fears Lingering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The Stock Exchange of Thailand
(SET) index kept its nose-dive earlier this month, but the market
recovered last week, to the relief of investors.
</P>
<P>
The mild resurgence towards the end of the week was led by
foreign investors, the same people who bailed out earlier and sent
the index plunging below 740 points.
</P>
<P>
A key to the recovery was a series of strong statements by
central and commercial banks, which said a baht devaluation was
out of the question, no matter how bad things might get, noting
that baht devaluation would do more harm than good to the economy.
</P>
<P>
The Thai currency also steadied during the week, although at a
record high rate to the US dollar, almost touching the
psychological level of 26 baht to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts fear that there may be new attacks on the
baht, because of the steadily appreciating dollar.
</P>
<P>
For most of the week the central bank set the mid-rate at
25.98-25.99 baht to the dollar, but never crossed the 26-baht
point.
</P>
<P>
Although details were unclear in the money market, it appeared
foreign speculators had largely halted their relentless attacks on
the baht, and were content to take previous profits.

<HEADLINE> CCPIT Group of Entrepreneurs for China's Poor Areas to visit 2nd Tier US States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- China's top trade promotion
body plans to bolster trade and investment links between China's
poor inland and less developed areas of the United States, "China
Daily Business Weekly" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The China Council for the Promotion of International Trade
(CCPIT) will send a delegation of entrepreneurs from China's poor
areas on a study tour of second-tier US states later this year,
Chairman Guo Dongpo said.
</P>
<P>
He did not specify which states nor when the trip would occur.
</P>
<P>
Guo said the delegation would visit less affluent parts of the
United States because previous Chinese trade campaigns focused on
the US east and west coasts.
</P>
<P>
Inland China and less affluent American states differ less in
their level of economic development, making trade and investment
co-operation more possible, Guo said.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed CCPIT's interest in further promoting trade with
the United States.
</P>
<P>
"China and the United States are among the world's largest
economics, " he said. "China's huge consumer market and the United
State's strong technology and funding power mean great potential
for the two countries to further their economic and trade
co-operation."
</P>
<P>
Looking into the United States' inland is part of China's plan
to diversify trade around the world, he said.

<HEADLINE> Asian, European Political Parties Mourn Deng's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of a number of
political parties in Asia and Europe have extended condolences to
the Communist Party of China (CPC) over the death of Deng
Xiaoping, who died late Wednesday, aged 93.
</P>
<P>
Dharmasiri Senanayake, general secretary of the Sri Lanka
Freedom Party, said in his message that during the last 18 years,
China experienced unprecedented and un-interrupted economic growth
averaging ten percent, an all time world record indeed, the credit
for which goes to the pragmatic leader of China, Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated the party's friendship and understanding
with the CPC and the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Surya Bahadur Thapa, chairman of the Central Committee of the
Nepal National Democratic Party, described Deng as one of the most
outstanding leaders within the 20th century, saying that his death
was a great loss for China and the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
He said that Deng was a real friend and excellent thinker,
adding that Deng's thinking and line aimed at modernizing China
and raising its international status should be learned from by all.
</P>
<P>
Koichi Kato, chairman of Japan's Liberal Democratic Party
(LDP), praised Deng for his contribution to China's construction.
</P>
<P>
The chairman expressed his heartfelt admiration for Deng's
efforts for the improvement of peace and stability in China and
Asia, and the expansion of the friendship and cooperative ties
between China and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Absamat Masaliyev, leader of the Kyrgyz Communist Party, called
Deng an outstanding state and political activist.
</P>
<P>
He firmly believed that China will continue its socialist
construction cause which Deng devoted all his life to, and put its
economy, society and spirit to a new high.
</P>
<P>
Thurmer Gyula, chairman of the Hungarian Munkaspart, said Deng
was a great man, statesman and thinker.
</P>
<P>
He said that Deng's death was a loss for both Hungary's and
the international workers' movements.

<HEADLINE> Consumers Lack Acumen, Insurers Continue to Emerge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese life insurance have
sufficient reasons to expect favorable prospects for their
business as Chinese income level rise, thanks to the country's
steady economic growth, according to today's "China Daily Business
Weekly".
</P>
<P>
Last year, private citizens deposited 3,800 billion yuan (457.8
billion US dollars) in banks, and average financial assets per
household was 30,000 (3,614 US dollars) yuan in some large cities.
</P>
<P>
Insurers believe that means more money is available to spend on
insurance. They anticipate the annual life insurance premium will
hit 144 billion yuan (17 billion US dollars) in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Their dreams have been enhanced with the establishment of new
life insurance companies opened last year, and more are expected
to emerge this year.
</P>
<P>
But one thing is blocking the quick realization of the
dream: individuals' slow acceptance of insurance and lack of
awareness.
</P>
<P>
According to AXA-National Mutual Group survey, the Chinese life
insurance market is largely hidden by a substantial lack of
knowledge and information.
</P>
<P>
Only 24 percent of respondents said that they were somewhat
familiar with life insurance, and two percent said they weren't
very familiar.
</P>
<P>
About 2,523 people in 50 cities participated in the survey.
</P>
<P>
Of the respondents who said they would not buy or were somewhat
unlikely to buy life insurance, more than half said that they
didn't think they needed it. Forty percent do not think they know
enough to make a decision, and 31 percent believe that they can
not afford life insurance.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted by the Future Road Market Research Co.
Ltd. in Beijing showed similar results.
</P>
<P>
More than 80 percent of the respondents say that they know
little about insurance, and none said they knew insurance well.
</P>
<P>
The poor awareness of insurance has resulted in embarrassing
figures for China's life insurance businesses.
</P>
<P>
Of 1.2 billion people, 300 million have life insurance. The
national life insurance premium income accounted for 0.3 percent
of gross national products.
</P>
<P>
If Chinese insurers want their dreams to come true, they should
engage in a non-profit activity first: education.
</P>
<P>
The environment is getting tougher for insurers now that people
are considering how to better use their financial assets after the
central bank cut the interest rate twice last year.
</P>
<P>
Life insurance is less attractive because of its low investment
yield and fluidity compared with stocks and treasury bonds.

<HEADLINE> Nepal May have 200,000 Drug Addicts by 2000: Researcher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 23 (Xinhua) -- There are now about 40,000
drug addicts in Nepal and the number could each 200,000 by the
year 2000, according to a local researcher.
</P>
<P>
Professor Kapil Shrestha told a symposium on drug addiction
here Saturday that the drug addicts in Nepal are mainly the youths
from the age group of 14-40, which accounts for 27 percent of the
country's total population of 20 million.
</P>
<P>
He cited media advertizing on alcohol and cigarettes and
unemployment as main reasons for the rise in drug addiction in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Blaming media advertisements for luring youths into getting
hooked to alcohol and cigarettes, the professor said the first
step to drugs is alcohol and cigarette addiction.
</P>
<P>
He said the unemployment problem in the country is ticking like
a timebomb which could explode any time taking the youths into the
abyss of drugs.
</P>
<P>
According to Shrestha, 200,000 Nepali youths are facing
unemployment and the figure is increasing every year.
</P>
<P>
Others participants at the symposium, organized by a local
youth club, suggested that the government introduce laws
concerning drug addicts to supplement the existing ones on drug
trafficking and sales only.

Until the early 1990s, barter trade dominated Sino-Russian
trade ties. Turnover grew especially fast in skirmishing
crossborder barter trade, said Xu Yaping, deputy director-general
of the State Council's Special Economic Zone Office.
</P>
<P>
Increasing cash trade, which took the lead last year after
China moved to rectify trade with ex-Soviet and Eastern European
countries, serves the anticipated growth, Xu said.
</P>
<P>
To improve prosperity and stability in border areas, China
opened 13 border cities to foreign investment in 1992, which
ushered in a period of meteoric economic growth. Preferential
border trade policies sparked a great flow of talent and goods.
</P>
<P>
But lax control over border trade rights resulted in many
problems in commodity quality and traders' credibility in
implementing contracts and settling accounts.
</P>
<P>
That, plus trade policy changes in neighbouring countries and
domestic credit control, dealt a heavy blow to the sector in 1994
when nationwide border trade plummeted 50 percent to 80
percent. Russia resorted to commodity export limits and restricted
entry access to Chinese traders.
</P>
<P>
The drop eased to 26 percent in 1995. Last year's figure is not
available.
</P>
<P>
To halt the decrease and restore order in border trade, the
State Council amended its border trade rights management rule. It
allowed companies registered in the border cities and other
counties of the nine provinces and autonomous regions that border
foreign countries to conduct border trade after authorization from
the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
While phasing out most tax incentives devised for coastal
areas, China decided to retain tax deduction for border trade
through 1998.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Business Community Praises Deng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The foreign business community
in Beijing shared the sorrow of the Chinese nation for the death
of senior leader Deng Xiaoping while voicing confidence in
continuing business in China, said today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
"Some people have vision; some people do things," said Hermann
Koelle, president of Siemens Ltd in China, "But Deng both was a
man of vision and implemented his ideas, which is very rare."
</P>
<P>
Koelle described Deng as a great man who devised and executed
China's massive reform and opening drive 18 years ago. Since then,
the living standards of a large part of the world's population have
improved significantly.
</P>
<P>
"We have no fear of any fallback in China's economy toward the
next century," Koelle said.
</P>
<P>
Siemens' investment in China is expected to top one billion US
dollars by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Other business leaders also remarked on their admiration for
Deng and their continued confidence in the Chinese climate, said
the Beijing-based paper.
</P>
<P>
Jerry Norskog, president of Johnson &AMP; Johnson China
Development, said he believed that business would continue as
usual.
</P>
<P>
"We started our investment in China in the late 1970s based on
our confidence in Deng's reform and opening policies," he said. "We
are confident of China's further opening and sustained economic
growth, as well as social and political stability."
</P>
<P>
US aircraft maker Boeing will continue its plan to launch a
major industrial project in China, said Jiande Chen, Boeing
Commercial Airplane Group's China affairs director.
</P>
<P>
Boeing owes more to Deng, whose visit to the company's Seattle
headquarter in 1972 marked the start of its role as China's
predominant commercial aircraft supplier for the next 25
years. China's domestic air fleets have more than 200 Boeing
models.
</P>
<P>
Deng's death will not negatively affect Airbus Industrie's
investment and economic activities in China, said a representative
of Airbus Industrie China.
</P>
<P>
"We see no sign that China's development momentum will slow
down due to the death of the senior leader," he said." Instead, we
think the country's economic policies will go as planned and
maintain a high growth rate in the following years."
</P>
<P>
Spokespersons for financial services group HSBC Holding Plc,
and Imperial Chemical Industries Plc, also expressed their
confidence in China's economic future and said that their plans to
expand would not alter.

<HEADLINE> Reinsurer's Prospects Favorable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- China's promising insurance
market gives the country's only reinsurer confidence to aim for a
10.4 billion yuan (1.25 billion US dollars) business turnover this
year, according to the "Business Weekly".
</P>
<P>
PICC Reinsurance Company Ltd. (PICC Re) hopes that its premium
income will increase 50 per cent from last year, company president
Dai Fengju said.
</P>
<P>
The turnover goal includes 200 million yuan (24 million US
dollars) from commercial premiums and 10.2 billion yuan (1.23
billion US dollars) from legal reinsurance business assigned by
the Chinese Government.
</P>
<P>
Under the Insurance Law, domestic insurers are required to
distribute 20 percent of their business - except life insurance -
to PICC Re.
</P>
<P>
Reinsurance is an effective way to diversify risks for
insurance companies. Insurers can share the compensation for heavy
losses, maintain healthy growth and expand their insurance
business.
</P>
<P>
The company will transform its market strategy from
international business emphasis to domestic and foreign markets
this year.
</P>
<P>
"It is likely for PICC Re to achieve 200 million yuan (24
million US dollars) premium income from the commercial reinsurance
sector," he said.
</P>
<P>
Reinsurance businesses focus on property insurance while the
demand for life insurance remains marginal. With the continuous
expansion of life insurance, demand for reinsurance will increase.
</P>
<P>
PICC Re will prepare to offer life reinsurance this year. It is
expected to draft regulations on the new business, train personnel
and investigate the life insurance market.
</P>
<P>
Established in July 1996, PICC Re is one of the three
subsidiaries of the People's Insurance Company (Group) of China,
the country's largest insurer. The other two are PICC Life and
PICC Property.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Trade to Grow in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- China's foreign trade is
expected to grow moderately this year, with imports expanding
faster than exports, a Beijing-expert predicted an Beijing-based
expert.
</P>
<P>
Qiu Xichun, a senior researcher on foreign trade, was quoted in
today's China Daily as saying that this year's external trade
would be about 310 billion US dollars, a seven percent jump from
last year.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, China's foreign trade climbed by 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
He said imports would be 150-155 billion US dollars, up eight
percent to 12 percent from the previous year. Exports are expected
to be 155-166 billion US dollars, rising three percent to six
percent.
</P>
<P>
Qiu said imports did not grow significantly last year, although
the government slashed the average import tariff rate to 23
percent from 35.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
This is partly because China's economic development was slow
last year, and relatively tight monetary policies limited its
import practices, Qiu said. "This year will be difference."
</P>
<P>
Qiu said the economy's "soft landing" last year laid a
foundation for steady economic development. It is expected to spur
demand for imports, especially machines and equipment, raw
materials like steel, and consumer products.
</P>
<P>
The government is expected to reduce non-tariff measures and
standardize administration over imports this year, he said, adding
that in 1996, China's government cut import tariff severely and
promised to lower the rate to below 15 percent by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
"If the import reforms progress smoothly, the power of tariff
and non-tariff barrier reduction in stimulating imports gradually
will show," said Qiu.
</P>
<P>
However, exports have entered a mild growth period as signified
by a 1.5 percent growth last year, the lowest in the past decade,
Qiu said.
</P>
<P>
The trend mainly results from weakening competitiveness of
traditional key Chinese export products and exporters.
</P>
<P>
"Dynamic export growth is not likely in following years," he
said, But this year's export development can be better
than last year.
</P>
<P>
A favourable element for China's exports today is the active
world economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the low inflation rate and high economic development
of China can also benefit exports with ample product supply and
relatively low cost, Qiu said.

<HEADLINE> Jail Privatization Under Study in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The Department of Interior and
Local governments of the Philippines are studying the
privatization of certain aspects of jail operations in the county,
the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Interior Secretary Robert Barbers was quoted as
saying that he was "receptive" to a Senate proposal to privatize
certain services of city, municipal and district jails.
</P>
<P>
Barbers said the idea of privatizing jail services was
recommended by Senator Orlando Mercado and is patterned after the
jail system and management in Australia.
</P>
<P>
Barbers explained that the privatization of local jails will
benefit the Philippine National Police as officials and personnel
of the jail bureau can be absorbed and utilized for police work to
enhance the campaign against criminality.
</P>
<P>
Barbers said plans are now underway for him and other jail
management officials to visit Australia and observe how the system
works and if it could be adopted in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The concept of privatizing local jail management services in
the country surfaced after reports of alleged poor management and
maintenance in jails resulting in riots and escapes of inmates.

<HEADLINE> Drug Dealers Turn to Credit Dealings in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Sale on credit and direct
sales are fast replacing cash in the amphetamine trade in
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
More traders have learned to avoid arrest by giving their
clients credit and allowing for the transfer of money to their
bank accounts later.
</P>
<P>
The switch has further hindered the drug suppression operation
by police.
</P>
<P>
Since the new government took office in December, it has
stepped up crackdown on drug trafficking and trade.
</P>
<P>
The change in the method of payment between drug traders and
their clients has added more obstacles to the drug-busting
efforts, according to Ong-art Klampaiboon, spokesman for the
Special Committee on Amphetamine Suppression.
</P>
<P>
In most cases, police arrest drug traders during the delivery
of the drug to their clients, who normally pay in cash.
</P>
<P>
The cash, along with the drug, is used by police as evidence to
take legal action against the drug suspects.
</P>
<P>
However, with the change in the payment method, it has become
even more difficult for police to seize money as evidence.
</P>
<P>
Many amphetamine dealers also resort to the direct sales
network, which bypasses the middlemen in order to increase profits
and avoid being captured.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Faces New Credit Downgrading Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Another foreign credit-rating
agency is considering downgrading Thailand's credit status.
</P>
<P>
The Japan Bond Research Institute (JBRI) is examining the risk
of the Thai government and its agencies not paying off foreign
currency debts, according to a local press report today.
</P>
<P>
The new threat follows a warning two weeks ago by US-based
Moody's Investor Services, which said it was reviewing Thailand's
rating and may downgrade Thailand's creditworthiness status.
</P>
<P>
The JBRI said that although Thailand maintains high economic
growth which is leveraged by direct investment from overseas, and
is forming a diversified industrial base, the country has been
running a current account deficit in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese agency in particular cited a sharp slowdown in
Thai exports and observed that some labor-intensive industries are
no longer competitive.

<P>
BEIJING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Two political parties in Latin
America have sent messages of condolences to the Chinese Communist
Party (CPC) over the death of Deng Xiaoping on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Investment in South China Growing Steadily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The capital of south China's
Guangdong Province, Guangzhou, had attracted 1.79 billion dollars
of investment from Taiwan and established 985 Taiwan-funded
ventures by the end of last year, according to recent statistics.
</P>
<P>
He Jiaxin, Deputy Director of the city's Taiwan Affairs Office,
attributes the steady increase to laws protecting the rights and
interests of Taiwan business people and to improvements in the
investment environment.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou has already established a Taiwan investment
protection zone in the city, and since 1989, about 100
Taiwan-funded ventures have been established in the city every
year.
</P>
<P>
More than 90 percent of the Taiwan-funded ventures are showing
a profit. Many businessmen have turned their initial investment
into larger amounts of investment.
</P>
<P>
One Taiwanese businessman started with a shoe-making venture in
Guangzhou eight years ago and now has two shoe factories, three
bowling alleys, and over a dozen grocery chain stores.

<P>
TIANJIN, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The 12 overseas bank branches
in the northern Chinese municipality of Tianjin had more than 7.2
million US dollars in profits last year.
</P>
<P>
A local banking official said that the huge gains came from the
growth in foreign-funded ventures in the city, where there are
nearly 10,000 of them, involving a total of 10 billion US dollars
in investment.
</P>
<P>
The foreign currency loan business continued to be a leading
profit maker, but the overseas banks also expanded fund-raising
channels.
</P>
<P>
The 12 branch banks did 4.78 billion US dollars worth of
foreign trade in 1996, more than six times that of the previous
year. Total foreign currency assets jumped more than 100 percent
to 2.27 billion US dollars and the branches made 1.6 billion US
dollars in hard currency loans last year.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, hard currency deposits also went up by an
astonishing 82 percent to 359 million US dollars.

<P>
MANILA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The following are Philippine
business news in brief:
</P>
<P>
-- The Philippine Department of Transportation and
Communications has proposed that the government policy align with
the newly-approved global tele-communications service accord under
the World Trade Organization. Communications Under-secretary
Josefina Lichauco said Friday that the proposed order would allow
direct access to all international fixed and mobile satellites by
foreign carriers.
</P>
<P>
-- Total investments in the Philippines swelled to an
unprecedented 28.64 percent last year compared to 3.99 percent
based on current prices in the previous year, further bolstering
the government's claims that the country is now on its way to a
sustainable economic growth, according to a reported released by
the National Statistical Coordination Board.
</P>
<P>
-- Sugar administration chief Wilson Gamboa is to fly to the
United States today to iron out kinks in Philippine sugar exports.
His trip seeks to ensure that the Philippines gets the additional
allocation due in its sugar exports to the United States. The
Philippines shipped in advance last month 25,000 metric tons of
sugar to cover an expected additional allocation. But the
allocation has not been granted even as the U.S. sugar's
stock-to-ratio-use has slipped.
</P>
<P>
-- The Nuclear Free Philippines Coalition and locally based
community groups have vowed to fight the government's plan to
build 10 nuclear power plants all over the country, including the
Bataan Nuclear Power Plant, the Sunday Chronicle newspaper said
today.

PARIS, February 22 (Xinhua) -- England's Johnny Nelson won the
vacant European cruiserweight title by stopping Patrice Aouissi of
France in Berck-Sur-Mer, France, on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Nelson, 30, had stepped in to replace compatriot Terry Dunstan,
who withdrew at the last minute with a lung infection.
</P>
<P>
Nelson, who had a record of 27 wins and 12 loss before the
bout, gave enough heavy punches from the start to the 30-year-old
Aouissi, who briefly held the title in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Aouissi, who entered the bout with a record of 17 wins and two
defeats in 19 fights, finally gave up the fight in the seventh
before a brutal onslaught of Nelson as the referee stepped in.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Region Sets Six-Month Hunting Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region in south China has made its hunting season less than six
months in accordance with the breeding habits of wild animals.
</P>
<P>
According to the regional government, hunting is forbidden in
the entire region from March 20 to September 30, except in
established hunting areas for those with licenses.
</P>
<P>
The move aims at protecting endangered wildlife and improving
its breeding conditions, said an announcement issued by the
regional government.
</P>
<P>
It said that, during the closed season, units that need animals
for research, teaching, or breeding must get permission from
forestry administration departments above the county level before
they hunt, and then only for a fixed time in fixed areas.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi is a semi-tropical area that has various kinds of
wildlife in its mountains which are covered with thick forests.
</P>
<P>
In respecting the hunting traditions of a number of ethnic
groups, the region has set 43 counties and three state-run
forestry centers as hunting areas during the hunting-forbidden
season.
</P>
<P>
The announcement said that hunting is also banned at
reservoirs, rivers, coasts, and other wetlands, and on farmland,
in villages, near schools or airports, in parks, nature reserves,
or scenic spots and along roads in and out of hunting areas.
</P>
<P>
The announcement said that if increasing numbers of wildlife
cause crop damage, or harm people or domestic animals in
restricted areas, people can catch a limited number of them after
getting permission from the regional forestry authorities.

The notice asked the officials of coal mines with serious
safety problems to cease production and make improvements. Any
mines failing to meet the government standard after rectifications
are made will be shut down, it stressed.
</P>
<P>
Each mine should have safety personnel in their ranks,
according to the notice, and the training of miners should be
enhanced.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the country had 15 township coal mine
accidents, each with more than 10 casualties, from November 7 to

<HEADLINE> Quebec Plans Trade Missions to China, Latin America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard
is planning to lead provincial trade missions to China in November
and to several Latin American countries next year.
</P>
<P>
But the Quebec premier insisted that the two trade missions
will not be just a Quebec version of Team Canada.
</P>
<P>
In November 1994, Canadian Premier Jean Chretien led the first
Team Canada trade mission to China, which was followed by a trade
mission to Latin America in January 1995.
</P>
<P>
The province of Quebec didn't participate in either of the two
missions, though it joined the Team Canada mission to South Korea,
Thailand and the Philippines in January this year.
</P>
<P>
"We don't plan to copy the Team Canada formula nor to try to
outdo it in terms of contracts signed or the number of countries
visited," he was quoted as saying by reports today.
</P>
<P>
Bouchard made the announcement to the Quebec Association of
Manufacturers and Exporters in a pep talk, which stressed the need
for companies to seek out new markets worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Asia is a major area of economic opportunity and so is Latin
America, Bouchard noted.
</P>
<P>
He invited the executives to sign up now for China. Details of
the trip will be developed further when Quebec plays host to a
meeting of trade ministers of APEC countries in early May, he
said.
