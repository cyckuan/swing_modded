<HEADLINE> Cement Demand to Rise in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The demand for cement is expected
to rise in the next three years in China, thanks to an increase in
state investment in the infrastructure sector, according to the
Administration of the Building Materials Industry.
</P>
<P>
China plans to invest 750 billion US dollars in developing
infrastructure in the next three years, with the annual growth
rate of fixed assets investment topping 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The investment will mainly go to the transportation sector,
residential housing, irrigation works and water conservancy
facilities, and these construction projects will naturally need a
large amount of cement.
</P>
<P>
The administration predicted that the country's annual demand
for cement will reach 648 million tons in the coming years, an
increase of 9.04 percent, which will offer great opportunities to
Chinese cement enterprises now suffering a slump.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China plans to build more than 4,000 kilometers of
expressways, which will also boost the demand for high-quality
cement.

<HEADLINE> China Increases Natural Science Funding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- China has increased its natural
science funding at an annual speed of 20 percent over the past few
years, and will further increase it in the future.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jia'er, director of the State Natural Science Fund
Committee (SNSFC), said today that the committee allocated 1.04
billion yuan (about 125 million US dollars) for natural science
research in 1999, compared with 80 million yuan in 1986.
</P>
<P>
China's natural science funding has made great contributions to
pushing forward the development of basic research, and supported
innovation in science and technology, said Chen, also a member of
the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
</P>
<P>
With the support of the natural science fund, China has
progressed rapidly in some fields such as studies of mathematical
mechanization theory, distribution of substances in the universe,
modern astrophysics, genome research and evolution of early life.
</P>
<P>
Among the 60 key basic research projects launched recently in
China, 85 percent have received support of natural science funding,
according to Chen.
</P>
<P>
The SNSFC, established in Beijing in 1986, aims to use research
funds effectively, and to coordinate and provide funds for
research in basic science and some fields of applied science in
accordance with State policies.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Science Foundation Supporting Young Scientists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The National Natural Science
Foundation has supported about 60,000 scholars, including a large
number of young scientists, to conduct basic research over the
past years.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Young Scientists Fund has supported more than 6,000
researchers, and 559 outstanding young scholars have received
funding from the foundation, according to Chen Jia'er, director of
the foundation's committee.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, the committee has granted funds to 84
overseas young scientists, and helped over 1,700 overseas scholars
conduct research in China.
</P>
<P>
Chen said today that among the leading scientists in charge of
the funded projects, 28.3 percent are under the age of 35,
compared with 1.3 percent in 1986. And the ratio for scientists
under the age of 45 increased from 12.2 percent in 1986 to 64.6
percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The committee established the fund for outstanding young
scientists under the age of 45 in 1994. Then, in 1996, it set up
the foundation for training talented people in basic science, and
part of the plan is to offer 300 million yuan (about 36 million US
dollars) from 1996 to 2000 to train students majoring in 83 basic
sciences, six special subjects and six key science projects at 39
universities across China.
</P>
<P>
The special fund for young Chinese scientists living abroad was
set up in 1998 to encourage them to return to China.

<HEADLINE> Joseph Yam Urges Attention to Challenges of Asian Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive of the Hong
Kong Monetary Authority Joseph Yam Monday warned against the risks
hidden behind the recovery of the Asian economy.
</P>
<P>
"If the recovery in the region is to be sustainable, we should
remain vigilant and be ware of the risks lurking under these
bubbling activities," Yam said at the Sixth Manila Framework Group
Meeting held in Hong Kong Monday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The group, comprising senior finance and central bank officials
from 14 economies including the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region, was founded in November 1997 amid the deep throes of the
Asian financial crisis to develop a concerted approach to
restoring financial stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
Yam cited three major challenges facing the Asian economies in
dealing with the risks as "domestic structural reforms, monitoring
and surveillance of capital flows, and coping with the
destabilizing impact of highly leveraged institutions."
</P>
<P>
"If we, individual economies and the international financial
community, can muster the determination to tackle these challenges,
we will go a long way in helping to reduce systemic risks, and
improve the functioning of the international financial system and
the stability of the financial market," Yam said.
</P>
<P>
Yam said while more domestic and international efforts have
been devoted to these issues, there is still much catching up to
do.
</P>
<P>
"This is precisely the reason why we gather here today -- to
take stock of progress, exchange views on the unfinished reforms,
and work for a more robust and safe domestic as well as
international financial system for all of us," he said.
</P>
<P>
The group meets twice a year. Senior representatives of the
International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the Bank for
International Settlements and the Asian Development Bank also
attend the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Finance Firms, Bank to Pump More Money Into High-Tech Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 6,700 leading companies in
Beijing's high-tech area of Zhongguancun are going to have more
chances of getting badly needed bank loans thanks to a three-sided
deal signed here tonight.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, the Beijing Science and Technology Venture
Capital Co. Ltd, Beijing Zhongguancun Science and Technology
Guarantee Co. Ltd, and the Beijing branch of the Construction Bank
of China, one of the four biggest commercial banks in China, will
cooperate for the first time to give financial support to
promising high-tech firms in Zhongguancun.
</P>
<P>
The deal, known as the Framework Agreement on Joint Support
for the Development of High-Tech Firms, is designed to minimize
market risks in providing venture capital, credit guarantees and
bank loans for small and medium-sized high-tech firms.
</P>
<P>
The three sides will also join hands to explore new ways to
attract venture capital, minimize market risks and facilitate the
commercialization of new- and high-technological achievements.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the three companies will set up a joint
committee to examine and approve loans to high-tech firms.
</P>
<P>
Set up in 1998 with a registered capital of 500 million yuan (
about 60 million US dollars), the Beijing Science and Technology
Venture Capital Co. Ltd was one of the first companies involved in
the venture capital business in China.
</P>
<P>
Established late last year with a registered capital of 182
million yuan (about 22 million US dollars), the Beijing
Zhongguancun Science and Technology Guarantee Co. Ltd is the first
professional guarantee company in Beijing to be awarded the right
to do guarantee business.

<HEADLINE> Iran Accuses U.S. of Lacking Honesty in Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Tuesday accused the United
States of lacking honesty in assessing bilateral ties, and of
raising "baseless" allegations against the Islamic republic.
</P>
<P>
"The recent contradictory remarks by U.S. officials in an
inappropriate tone show not only their ignorance of the geography
of the region, but also their lack of honesty in their relations
with the Islamic Republic," said Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid
Reza Asefi.
</P>
<P>
In a reaction to the recent remarks by the U.S. special envoy on
arms disarmament, Asefi said Iran has never posed any threat to the
region and its neighbors, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Iran has a "bright record" in taking measures to help establish
peace and stability in the region, he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. special envoy termed Iran as a threat to the region
after Secretary of State Madeleine Albright Friday announced the
lifting of a ban on imports of Iranian luxury goods and called for
warm relations with Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Iranian officials showed a mixed reaction to Albright's
overture, which was described as "positive" by some Iranian
officials, but "another step of U.S. conspiracy" by others.
</P>
<P>
Washington severed ties with Tehran in 1980 after its embassy in
Tehran was taken over by radical Iranian students at the heydays of
the 1979 Islamic revolution, which toppled the former pro-U.S. shah
regime.
</P>
<P>
Following the election of moderate President Mohammad Khatami in
1997, the two countries exchanged some goodwill signals and U.S.
officials called for "unconditional talks" with Tehran to improve
their ties.

<HEADLINE> This Year to Witness Peace in Middle East: Arab League Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdel-Meguid on Tuesday voiced hope that the year 2000 would be a
year of peace in the Middle East region.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to mark the 55th anniversary of the league's
establishment, to be observed Wednesday, Abdel-Meguid also
expressed hope the Middle East would be rendered free from the
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Since the eruption of the Arab-Israeli conflict over half a
century ago and up till now, the league had been defending the
Palestinian cause and standing by Syria in its fight to recover the
Golan Heights captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast War, he said.
</P>
<P>
The league had confronted all attempts to undermine the unity
and independence of Sudan, Iraq, Somalia and the Comoros, he said,
adding that the league had greatly contributed to the suspension of
international sanctions imposed on Libya.
</P>
<P>
The league also had backed the United Arab Emirates in its
efforts to solve territorial disputes with Iran over three Gulf
islands, namely Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo-based pan-Arab forum was endeavoring to ease the
sufferings of the Iraqi people, Abdel-Meguid said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the league's keenness on promoting relations with
the United Nations, the Gulf Cooperation Council, the Organization
of Islamic Conference and the Organization of African Unity.
</P>
<P>
The league had underscored the importance of putting into effect
the pan-Arab free trade zone as a step forward on the road of
setting up the hoped-for Arab common market, he said.
</P>
<P>
It also paid due attention to Arab social development and
women's role in the development process, he added.
</P>
<P>
The anniversary of the league's establishment coincided with the
start of the third millennium, in which the Arab nation was looking
forward to restoring solidarity and unity of the Arab ranks, he
stressed.

<HEADLINE> Russian Government Urges Early Ratification of START-2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Russian government officials
Tuesday urged the country's parliament to ratify the second stage
of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or START-2, as early as
possible.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry held a closed-door hearing on proposals to
ratify START-2 and a 1997 package of missile defense agreements,
the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the defense, foreign and other ministries present
at the hearing "expressed the unanimous opinion in favor of the
earliest possible ratification of START-2, the protocol on the
extension of the deadline for its enforcement and the package of
missile defense agreements signed in New York on September 27,
1997, and aimed at strengthening the ABM (Anti-Ballistic Missile)
treaty," the Foreign Ministry said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov stressed that "the ratification of
the START-2 treaty and the above-mentioned agreements would be in
the interests of guaranteeing the national security of the Russian
Federation and strengthening strategic stability in a world
currently in a difficult international situation," the document
said.
</P>
<P>
It said ratification of the accords would "open the way to the
beginning of official negotiations between the Russian Federation
and the United States on further reductions in strategic offensive
armaments under a START-3 treaty."
</P>
<P>
The hearing was arranged by the committees for international
affairs, defense and security of the State Duma lower house of
parliament, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
Under START-2, signed between Russia and the United States in
January 1993, the two sides' nuclear warheads will be cut to 3,000-
3,500 each.
</P>
<P>
The State Duma has so far refused to endorse the treaty in the
aftermath of Washington's military actions against Iraq and
Yugoslavia and other sores in bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Senate approved the treaty in January 1996.

<HEADLINE> List of Candidates in Upcoming Russian Presidential Poll (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Twelve candidates, led by acting
President Vladimir Putin, will stand in Russia's presidential
elections Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Following is part of a list of the presidential hopefuls:
</P>
<P>
- - - -
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Putin, a 47-year old former KGB intelligence officer
and the ex-head of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB)
domestic security service, became prime minister last August and
took over as acting president after Boris Yeltsin's surprise
resignation on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
By far the most popular politician in Russia, Putin commands a
wide lead in opinion polls. His popularity is attributed to his
bold military actions against Chechen rebels, his no-nonsense
incorruptible image and his promise of rejuvenating the Russian
nation.
</P>
<P>
Putin appeals to popular longing for a strong leader capable of
pilling the country out of its economic morass and uprooting
widespread official corruption.
</P>
<P>
He pledges to stand by free-market reforms and liberal values.
</P>
<P>
When he took over as acting head of state, commentators listed
Chechnya, the economy and heightened expectations as the three
factors that could wreck his chances of winning the presidential
race. But Putin's performance during nearly three months has
proved that he does well in all three fronts.
</P>
<P>
With the presidential poll five days away, few now doubt that
Putin would become the official master of the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
A recent opinion poll by the VTsIOM agency put his support at
over 60 percent. According to the poll, more than 74 percent of
Russians are sure that Putin will win.
</P>
<P>
- - - -
</P>
<P>
Gennady Zyuganov, Communist Party leader and the Kremlin's main
opponent over the last 10 years, is running for the presidency for
the second time. He lost a campaign to Boris Yeltsin in the second
round of the 1996 presidential election. He has been unable to
expand his support base, largely consisting of elderly people
longing for the relative security of the Soviet era.
</P>
<P>
Surveys show that Zyuganov isn't expected to be a serious rival
to Putin.
</P>
<P>
The VTsIOM's poll indicated he could hope for support of around
20 percent of voters. His mostly elderly supporters are considered
to be highly organized but he has so far failed to mobilize a
majority in his favor.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov vowed to use Russia's natural resources "for the
benefit of the entire people and each single Russian." He said
that if he comes to power, he will have the constitution amended
in a way ensuring "real democratization, the elimination of the
authoritarian presidential rule, and a higher role for the Federal
Assembly and the government."
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov also plans to re-establish state control over the
strategic economic sectors. He consents to immediately double
pensions, social benefits, salaries of those employed in state-
owned enterprises as well as federal budget revenues.
</P>
<P>
He calls for establishing renovated Soviet power and restoring
people's power and social justice in the country.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President Stresses Importance of Agricultural Modernization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
has stressed the importance of agricultural modernization and
listed obstacles to this goal.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Uganda Consultative Group Meeting of Donors here
Tuesday, Museveni said that major obstacles such as lack of
markets, infrastructure, processing of agricultural products,
micro-finance credit, security and water harvesting must be
addressed first and foremost.
</P>
<P>
Museveni urged donors to assist Uganda to solve the problem of
markets for its products by intervening with the World Trade
Organization so that subsidies to farmers in Europe are removed
to allow Ugandan products to have access to European markets.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, farmers must be guided to produce
high-value crops which would bring them adequate income.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out, however, that no country in the world has
modernized its society through agriculture alone and that
modernization of agriculture must be supplemented by
industrialization in order to have total transformation.
</P>
<P>
The donors meeting, which opened Monday, is expected to last
five days and would review Uganda's economic performance over the
past year and commit development aid to this east African
country.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Civic Educators Urged to Be Neutral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
has urged civic educators to take a neutral stand during their
work when they educate people on the coming referendum.
</P>
<P>
Museveni made the appeal at a referendum luncheon hosted by the
Donors Referendum 2000 Group at the Sheraton Hotel here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A press release from the President's Office said that the
president demanded the 6,800 civic educators to explain the
significance of the referendum which will decide on the country's
future political system.
</P>
<P>
Rwakijuma Nyabongo, a representative of the Uganda Project and
 Implementation Management Center, briefed the luncheon meeting
about the program of civic education and assured the meeting that
the civic educators were neutral and would simply educate the
people about the referendum without taking sides.
</P>
<P>
Museveni also explained the problem of inadequate funding for
the referendum process and said that it was unrealistic to expect
the referendum process to be fully funded in a country like
Uganda where all government activities are run on either a half
or even a quarter of the needed funds.
</P>
<P>
Uganda will hold a referendum in June to choose a suitable
political system under the 1995 Constitution.

<HEADLINE> Rebels Active in Central Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan rebels have stepped up
their guerrilla activities in central Angola in the past month,
destabilizing the situation in provinces of Huambo and Bie and
interrupting relief operations for refugees, state media reported
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Rebels of the National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA) launched small scale actions, such as attacking
villages, killing and kidnapping officials, destructing bridges
and communication facilities, and laying landmines on roads.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government forces have made counter offensive by
reportedly killing 15 rebels in Huambo and wiping out a secret
UNITA base near Chiunbo.
</P>
<P>
However, tension came back to the central provinces as the
rebels penetrated frequently.
</P>
<P>
The number of refugees remained at 280,000 in Huambo City and
230,000 in Kuito City because the refugees feared to return home.
</P>
<P>
The World Food Program and other international relief agencies
have suspended or reduced aid to refugees since the aid convoys
came under attack and ran into mines.
</P>
<P>
The government troops launched all-out offensive against UNITA
stronghold in central highland last September, crushing most of
its regular army and evicting the rest to remote bush areas in
east and south of the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, UNITA said on Tuesday it had killed 827 government
soldiers during clashes in recent days in the southwest African
country.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Lisbon, the rebel group said it had
captured two diamond mines in northeast province of Lunda Norte.

<HEADLINE> Beirut Denies Making Deals with Japan on JRA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 21 (Xinhua) - Lebanon made no underground deals
with Japan before it deported four Japanese Red Army members to
Jordan, Prime Minister Salim Hoss was quoted as saying on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Parliament member Ammar Musawi told reporters that the prime
minister confirmed that Lebanon was not involved in any secret deal
with Japan on JRA, Daily Star newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Hoss's office also denied reports that Japan, a major investor
here, had agreed to pour fund into Lebanon before it deported the
four to Amman on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The four JRA members, wanted for worldwide attacks, were handed
over by Jordanian authorities at the airport to Japanese diplomats
who took them back to Tokyo to face trial.
</P>
<P>
The four Japanese have been wanted in Japan on international
terrorism charges and will face possible execution if found guilty.
</P>
<P>
State Prosecutor Adnan Addoum told reporters that the four JRA
members were sent to Jordan "after the kingdom decided to take them
in. Lebanon is not responsible for what happened after they left
the country."
</P>
<P>
Lebanon evicted four Red Army members to Jordan Friday when
their political asylum requests was turned down. Only one member of
the group, the 51-year-old Kozo Okamoto, is permitted to stay in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Okamoto was the sole surviving perpetrator of the 1972 attack on
Israel's Lod Airport in 1972 that left 26 people dead. He was
sentenced to life imprisonment in Israel but was freed along with
1,150 Palestinians in a swap for Israeli soldiers in 1985.
</P>
<P>
The deportation provoked a demonstration of JRA's supporters
Friday night that became a clash with police later.
</P>
<P>
Japan, which does not have an extradition agreement with
Lebanon,has sought the extradition of the five since they were
arrested in Lebanon on February 15,1997.
</P>
<P>
Beirut rejected Tokyo's request because Lebanese law stipulated
that they must first serve their sentences before any extradition
demand could be examined. 
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Kozo Okamoto, Masao Adachi, 59, Kazuo Tohira, 46,
Harowo Wako, 50, and Mariko Yamamoto, 59, were each sentenced to 42
months in prison for forging documents, using false passports and
residing in Lebanon illegally.
</P>
<P>
They finished their three years of imprisonment term last week
and asked for political asylum.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Observes Day For Elimination of Racial Discrimination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Tuesday
observed the International Day for the Elimination of Racial
Discrimination, March 21, with the focus on the 2001 South Africa
world conference against racism.
</P>
<P>
This year's observance marks the beginning of the new
millennium with renewed efforts to eradicate racism, racial
discrimination, xenophobia and intolerance.
</P>
<P>
On March 21, 1960, South African police opened fire and killed
69 people at a peaceful demonstration in Sharpeville, South Africa,
against the apartheid regime's "pass laws."
</P>
<P>
Proclaiming the International Day in 1966, the international
community was called on to redouble its efforts to eliminate all
forms of racial discrimination.
</P>
<P>
The world conference would provide a historic opportunity to
move closer to a more just and more tolerant society for all, said
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan in a message to the occasion.
</P>
<P>
"Eliminating racism and overcoming obstacles to equality will
not be easy, but with perseverance, faith and commitment it can be
done. Next year's world conference should mark a big step forward,
" said Annan.
</P>
<P>
Also in a message, President of the General Assembly Theo-Ben
Gurirab said, "There is a growing realization that racism,
xenophobia and intolerance are the root causes of most of the
conflicts and human rights violations that mar our world."
</P>
<P>
"Combating these evils is therefore a collective responsibility.
A fundamental first step is that States and the international
community acknowledge the reality of multiracial and multi-ethnic
societies," said the president.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming World Conference Against Racism, Racial
Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, to be held in
South Africa in 2001, is aimed to promote greater awareness
concerning the scourge of racism and increase the focus on
practical steps to eradicate racism by considering how to ensure
that the international standards and instruments are applied in
efforts to combat it.

<HEADLINE> Interview: NATO Achieves Very Little in Kosovo  (by Gu Zhenqiu) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 21 (Xinhua) -- NATO fails to achieve its
strategic goal, which was to put Yugoslavia on its knees,
Vladislav Jovanovic, charge d'affaires of the Yugoslav Mission to
the United Nations, said here late Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Its achievement is very partial," Jovanovic said in an
exclusive interview with Xinhua as the first anniversary of the
NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, beginning March 24 last year, is
drawing near.
</P>
<P>
"Even the deployment of international security presence in
Kosovo is not according to the NATO scenario, because it is the U.
N. which has the upper hand" in the Kosovo issue, he said.
</P>
<P>
NATO, without the authorization of the Security Council,
launched 78-day air strikes on Yugoslavia, a sovereign member of
the U.N. family, violating the U.N. Charter and international law.
The Security Council adopted resolution 1244 on June 10 last year
to authorize the deployment of the U.N. Mission (UNMIK) and the
international peace-keepers (KFOR) in Kosovo, a Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
"Yugoslavia went to war against NATO morally or politically,"
he said. "Yugoslavia was not defeated. Militarily, it has
outmaneuvered NATO and the Yugoslav army remain intact, as strong
as it was before the war."
</P>
<P>
"In the aggression against Yugoslavia, the (NATO) military
efficiency was a problem, only (striking) on the civilian targets"
in the program intended to destroy the Yugoslav military targets,
he said. "This is a very big failure."
</P>
<P>
The NATO war against Yugoslavia gave rise to fear that the
United Nations will be replaced by NATO, the world's most powerful
military machine, and the universally accepted norms governing
international relations be annulled.
</P>
<P>
"The latest session of the General Assembly was an encouraging
sign. Over 80 percent, if not 90 percent, of the Member States
have pronounced themselves against the unilateralism, and for the
multilateralism," he said. "They have opposed the military action
against any country which are not previously endorsed by the
Security Council."
</P>
<P>
"The NATO countries remained isolated in the sea of the
countries opposing the military action," he said. "Out of 188 U.N.
Member States, the number of countries supporting NATO use of
force was no more than 30 to 40, including those who are
dissatisfied with the NATO policy, but they have to follow the
mainstream."
</P>
<P>
"Many NATO diplomats in the United Nations have told me that
they were unhappy with and ashamed of the military action," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The great majority, maybe three quarters, of the
international community are on the side of Yugoslavia or against
the NATO aggression," he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N. Charter, the 15-nation Security Council has the
primary responsibility for the maintenance of peace and security
in the world at large.
</P>
<P>
The unilateral NATO military action originated a heated debate
in the international community on the relations between the state
sovereignty and alleged "humanitarian intervention," and fears
among developing countries, the small and weak ones in particular,
that their state sovereignty might be violated on humanitarian
grounds in the future.
</P>
<P>
Some 10 months after the presence in the Serbian province, the
UNMIK and the KFOR "totally failed" to carry out resolution 1244,
which demands full respect for Yugoslavia's sovereignty, complete
disarmament and disbanding of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army (
KLA) and territorial integrity and the guarantee of safety and
security of all ethnic groups in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"Not a single provision of the resolution has been implemented,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
The security situation has further worsened since the beginning
of February. Serbians and other non-Albanians are frequently
subject to terrorist attacks by Albanian separatists and
terrorists, and even international peace-keepers were killed by
the terrorists in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade will fight against any attempt to separate Kosovo from
Yugoslavia, he said. "Kosovo is a province of the Republic of
Serbia and it has never been an independent state."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Ambassador Defends Government Banning of Falun Gong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador Qiao Zonghuai
gave a news briefing here Tuesday on China's banning of the cult
Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
"Falun Gong is a typical cult that harms the society," Qiao
said in an opening statement. "The anti-humanity, anti-society and
anti-science words and deeds of the cult's founder Li Hongzhi have
already caused serious damages to society."
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years in some parts of China, more than 1,400
people have died as a result of practicing Falun Gong and many
others have suffered psychological distress, he said.
</P>
<P>
At the strong appeal of the people, the Chinese government,
strictly in accordance with the law, decided to outlaw the "
Research Society of Falun Dafa" and the evil cult under the
illegal organization's control.
</P>
<P>
"The banning of Falun Gong by the Chinese government not only
complies with the international human rights instruments but also
follows the common practice of all other governments in the world
regarding cults," Qiao told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the briefing also watched a video show exposing
the true face of the Falun Gong cult.
</P>
<P>
The following are major questions and answers at the briefing:
</P>
<P>
Q: Up until now, how many Falun Gong practitioners have been
prosecuted? Whether Falun Gong disciples are arbitrarily tried and
given harsh punishment for their acts?
</P>
<P>
A: The policy of the Chinese government is that only those who
organize and use this evil cult to engage in illegal business
activities or any other illegal activities or disturb social order
repeatedly will be prosecuted. These people only account for a
very small proportion of the practitioners.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, 44 people in relation to 20 cases have been
prosecuted by the procuratorates to the courts.
</P>
<P>
The trials of some key members of the Falun Gong cult by the
Chinese courts have been conducted in strict accordance with legal
procedures, the defendants invited lawyers for their defense and
their legitimate rights have been guaranteed in due regards.
</P>
<P>
After careful trials and based on ample facts and evidence, the
courts found that the accused had organized and used the cult to
obstruct justice, illegally obtained state secrets, illegally
possessed state confidential documents and secrets, intentionally
leaked secret state information and carried out illegal business
activities. In accordance with Article 300 of the Criminal Law of
the People's Republic of China and other relevant regulations, the
courts issued decisions on the accused.
</P>
<P>
Q: Does the decision to ban Falun Gong have any effect on other
Qigong organization?
</P>
<P>
A: The Chinese government has repeatedly reiterated that China
is a country ruled by law. All social groups and organizations
should abide by the constitution and law in carrying out their
activities. The Chinese government has never opposed or prohibited
normal practicing activities aimed at building health. Therefore,
it is permissible and will not be prohibited if the normal
practice activities are in line with the law. The purpose of
banning Falun Gong is just to ensure the normal health activities
by the people and prevent such swindlers as Li Hongzhi from
poisoning the people in the name of practicing Qigong.
</P>
<P>
Q: Do you think the issue of Falun Gong will be raised at this
year's session of the Commission on Human Rights? Will it be used
as an excuse to table a draft resolution in China?
</P>
<P>
A: Outlawing and fighting against Falun Gong by the Chinese
government have won the support of the majority of countries and
their governments. We appreciate this. Meanwhile, we advise those
few people who persist on using Falun Gong to interfere in the
internal affairs of China to change over to new ways. If some
people will use Falun Gong as an excuse to table a draft
resolution on China in the Commission on Human Rights, to support
the evil cult, they will only end up with ruined reputation and
indecent result.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Releases New Report on Replacement Migration Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 21 (Xinhua) -- A new U.N. report said
Tuesday that demographic changes in the next 50 years will require
a reappraisal of current economic, social and political thinking,
including immigration policies.
</P>
<P>
The report titled "Replacement Migration: Is it a Solution to
Declining and Aging Populations?" was launched by the Population
Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Replacement migration refers to the international migration
that a country would need to prevent population decline and
population aging resulting from low fertility and mortality rates.
</P>
<P>
The report indicated that between 1995 and 2050, the population
of Japan and virtually all countries of Europe will most likely
decline.
</P>
<P>
In a number of cases, including Estonia, Bulgaria and Italy,
countries would lose between one quarter and one third of their
population, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Population aging will be pervasive, bringing the median age of
population to historically unprecedented high levels. For instance,
in Italy, the median age will rise from 41 years in 2000 to 53
years in 2050, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Major findings of this report include:
</P>
<P>
-- In the next 50 years, the populations of most developed
countries are projected to become smaller and older as a result of
low fertility and increased longevity;
</P>
<P>
-- Population decline is inevitable in the absence of
replacement migration;
</P>
<P>
-- Some immigration is needed to prevent population decline in
all countries and regions examined in the report;
</P>
<P>
-- The numbers of immigrants needed to prevent the decline of
the total population are considerably larger than those envisioned
by the United Nations projections;
</P>
<P>
-- The numbers of immigrants needed to prevent declines in the
working-age population are large than those needed to prevent
declines in total population;
</P>
<P>
-- Relative to their population size, Italy and Germany would
need the largest number of migrants to maintain the size of their
working-age population;
</P>
<P>
-- The levels of migration needed to prevent population aging
are many times larger than the migration streams needed to prevent
population decline;
</P>
<P>
-- The new challenges of declining and aging population will
require a comprehensive reassessment of many established policies
and programs, with a long-term perspective.
</P>
<P>
The report said significant population decline coupled with an
aging population is a new experience, with no quick solutions and
no single response.

<HEADLINE> Man to Stand Trial Next Year for Omagh Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 21 (Xinhua) -- A man who is accused of plotting a
bombing which killed 29 people in 1998 in Omagh, Northern Ireland,
will be on trial next year, an Irish court official said in Dublin
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Dublin's Special Criminal Court has set January 16 as the date
for the trial of Colm Murphy, a Reuters report monitored here in
London said.
</P>
<P>
Murphy, 47, is charged with conspiring to cause an explosion in
the town of Omagh in Northern Ireland in 1998. The bombing killed
29 people and wounded 200. It was the worst single act of violence
in Northern Ireland during 30 years of sectarian bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
The Real IRA (Irish Republican Army), a republican splinter
group, claimed responsibility for the attack.
</P>
<P>
The other suspects behind the bombing had been identified but
might never be brought to justice because of a lack of evidence,
the report said.

<HEADLINE> China Submits Documents to Working Party on China's WTO Accession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese delegation has
submitted two sets of documents about China's trade laws and
regulations and its foreign trade regime to the Working Party on
China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
The 177 laws and regulations concerning China's economic and
trade relations with foreign countries mainly cover customs
administration, import and export, foreign investment
administration, other laws and regulations dealing with economic
issues that affect trade, and those relating to trade in services,
said head of the delegation Long Yongtu at the working party
meeting Tuesday at the WTO headquarters in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Long, China's chief trade negotiator, stressed that the review
of China's foreign trade regime has already concluded at the then
GATT working party on China in 1992. He adding that his
delegation had submitted the updated version of the Memorandum on
China's Trade Regime for the purpose of transparency.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the new memorandum will serve to
help members of the current working party to better understand the
development and progress of China's economic and trade system, and
to facilitate the drafting of the factual part of the Working
Party Report on China.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to push forward its WTO accession, Long said that
the Chinese government had taken a whole range of measures at home
to get fully prepared for the implementation of the relevant WTO
obligations.
</P>
<P>
"China will amend or repeal the laws and regulations identified
as not fully in consistency with the WTO agreements," he told the
session.
</P>
<P>
China has also organized many training programs for government
officials at middle and senior level nationwide to study and
understand the WTO rules so as to ensure that the WTO rules and
the commitments which China has undertaken in bilateral talks on
market access will effectively implemented.
</P>
<P>
"As a responsible country, China is always serious in the
implementation of its obligations made under the international
agreements," Long said. "All the preparations China has done for
joining the WTO clearly demonstrate that the Chinese government
has the determination, confidence as well as capability to enforce
what it has committed in the WTO."
</P>
<P>
He urged relevant WTO members, upon completion of the bilateral
negotiations with China, to expeditiously fulfill their obligation
to amend the outdated domestic legislation in order to ensure
establishment of a stable and constructive economic and trade
relations at multilateral and bilateral levels with China on the
basis of unconditional MFN (most favored nation status).
</P>
<P>
The ninth session of the Working Party on China Tuesday is the
first of its kind since July 1998. At present, among 37 WTO
members which have conducted bilateral consultations on market
access with China, 27 have already concluded their negotiations
with China.

<HEADLINE> Girard: China's WTO Accession Reaches Final Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- China's accession to the World
Trade Organization (WTO) has reached the final stage, said the
chairman of the Working Party on China here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
China's accession is "on a good track" and a lot of progress
has been made since the eighth session in July 1998, said Chairman
Pierre Girard in his summping-up statement.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral ties, Swiss Trade Ambassador Girard said, out of
the 37 WTO members expressing an interest in negotiating market
access in goods and services, China has concluded accords with 27.
</P>
<P>
They include Hungary, New Zealand, South Korea, the Czech
Republic, Slovakia, Turkey, Singapore, Pakistan, Indonesia, Japan,
Australia ,Chile, the United States, Canada, Venezuela, Cuba,
Brazil, Sri Lanka, Uruguay, Peru, Iceland, Norway, the Philippines,
India, Colombia, Argentina, and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Of 10 members yet to conclude their bilateral accords with
China, several are close to technical completion. "This marks very
major progress and shows that we are now entering the final phase
of our work," said Girard.
</P>
<P>
The 10 members are the European Union, Costa Rica, Ecuador,
Guatemala, the Kyrgyz Republic, Latvia, Malaysia, Mexico, Poland,
and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
"Moving to the multilateral aspect of our work, I would first
like to thank the Chinese delegation, on behalf of the Working
Party, for submitting valuable new inputs," said Girard. "Here I
am referring to, first, the updated Memorandum on China's Foreign
Trade Regime and, second, to a compilation of some 177 Chinese
laws and regulations. These will constitute important inputs for
our future work."
</P>
<P>
Girard expected the next session, temporarily scheduled in May,
will be very important. He urged the remaining WTO members to
finalize their bilateral talks with China as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> Israeli, Palestinian Delegations Arrive in Washington for Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli and Palestinian
delegations have arrived in Washington for a week of peace talks
at a nearby air base, hoping they would reach a framework
agreement on final status talks.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians arrived here Monday night while the Israelis
came Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The United States, which is hosting the talks and will take
part in some of the sessions, said it did not anticipate any
dramatic progress at this stage in the talks.
</P>
<P>
"We expect this process to take a substantial amount of time to
overcome differences on these profound issues and therefore we don
't expect there to be early breakthroughs," State Department
spokesman James Rubin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian talks will be held at a much lower
level, and analysts here agreed to Rubin's remarks, saying they
expected more preparatory work than dramatic breakthroughs.
</P>
<P>
U.S. envoy Dennis Ross invited both delegations to lunch at the
site of the talks, Bolling Air Force Base in the southeast of the
U.S. capital.
</P>
<P>
The talks will start with separate meetings between the U.S.
mediators and the two delegations. The Israelis and Palestinians
will then sit down alone, Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
"The goal is for it to be a serious brainstorming session where
the parties can really talk about the issues in a more free-
flowing fashion than they have been able to do to date," he said.
</P>
<P>
"These kinds of issues don't get solved quickly but in order to
get solved they have to be fully explored in as intensive a way as
possible," he added.
</P>
<P>
The media will have no access to the air force base during the
talks and the negotiators will stay on the base.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton, who is now visiting three nations
in South Asia with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright for his
company, is not due back until after the Bolling talks end.
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to be presenting ideas. We are going to be
helping them to brainstorm. At a later stage perhaps we might have
more ideas of our own," Rubin said.

<HEADLINE> Eritrea Accepts OAU Peace Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The Eritrean government said it
has accepted the peace plan of the Organization of African Unity
and it is ready to cooperate with the OAU in its mediating
efforts to end the border conflict between Ethiopia and Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Eritrean Cabinet made the decision in a statement on the
current status of the OAU peace plan following a meeting it held
in the capital Asmara Monday, said a press release by the
Eritrean Foreign Affairs Ministry, reached here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, the Cabinet said that from the outset, the
Eritrean government has accepted the OAU peace plan without
equivocation, and in this spirit, Eritrea has been cooperating
with the OAU unreservedly for its implementation.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, the statement said, Ethiopia has formally
rejected the Technical Arrangements which were submitted by the
OAU as a non-amendable document, thus rendering fruitless and
tireless efforts exerted by the OAU and its partners over the past
seven months.
</P>
<P>
In order to insure the success of the new round of efforts, the
Cabinet of Ministers said that the OAU should officially announce
that the Technical Arrangements submitted as non-amendable are
open for discussion by both sides.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet also said that the Eritrean government accepts, in
principle,
</P>
<P>
the convention of proximity talks between the two parties, and
the specific issues and format modalities for the discussion must
be clarified in advance.
</P>
<P>
Due to the rejection to the Technical Arrangement from
Ethiopia, the statement said, the peace process for the border
conflict between the two countries has reached a deadlock.
</P>
<P>
The two Horn of African countries started war over border
dispute in early May 1998. Since then tens of thousands of
soldiers from both sides have died in conflicts.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 20 (Xinhua) -- President Sam Nujoma was
sworn in for a third five-year term in Windhoek as Namibia marked
the 10th anniversary of independence on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The main objectives over the next five years for my government
will be to accelerate the process of job creation by increasing
support for small and medium scale enterprises," Nujoma said in
his inauguration address.
</P>
<P>
He also said his government had to tackle the spread of
HIV/AIDS, unemployment, and access to better health care,
education, water and electricity.
</P>
<P>
"The main goal of my government is for Namibians to achieve the
standard of living comparable to that of developed countries by
the year 2030," Nujoma added.
</P>
<P>
At the televised ceremony attended by South African president
Thabo Mbeki and several other visiting heads of state, members of
a new Namibian cabinet were also sworn in following the
overwhelming victory of Nujoma's ruling South West Africa People's
Organization (SWAPO) in last December's elections.
</P>
<P>
Among the dignitaries was former Finnish president Martti
Ahtisaari, who helped steer Namibia to independence from South
Africa in 1990 when he oversaw one of the most successful
peacekeeping operations of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Ahtisaari said he was "delighted" to be back in Namibia to see
the achievements made over the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
China also sent a government delegation, headed by State
Councilor Luo Gan, to the ceremony.

<HEADLINE> World Donors Urged to Offer Food Relief to Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations World Food
Program (WFP) has urged international donor countries to rush
their relief food to Ethiopia which has been facing food crisis
since last year.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued Monday, the WFP expressed a growing
concern over the late rainy season, which should have started in
Ethiopia several weeks ago and the increasingly deteriorating
situation in the Somali region as a direct result of the drought.
</P>
<P>
The WFP called on the international donor community to respond
quickly to both the Disaster Prevention and Preparedness
Commission (DPPC) appeal launched in January and the United
Nations Country Team appeal launched a week later.
</P>
<P>
According to the release, response to the DPPC appeal has been
slow with only one confirmed pledge having been received by the
WFP so far.
</P>
<P>
Under the WFP emergency operation to assist those affected by
the natural disaster, 250,000 tons of food has been requested, the
release said.
</P>
<P>
Describing the future pipeline situation as frightening, WFP
Ethiopia Country Director Judith Lewis urged all donors to confirm
their pledges as quickly as possible in order to keep the pipeline
flowing.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that there are some eight million victims of
famine in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
"With all that is in the pipeline, taking into consideration
existing stocks and shipment arrivals, we can only meet the needs
until mid-July", Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
The release quoted Lewis as saying that the situation in Somali
region is critical while lack of water and attendant health
problems remain a main concern.

ADDIS ABABA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Finland will donate 85,000
U.S. dollars to the Organization of African Unity (OAU) as a
contribution for the activities of the International Panel of
Eminent Personalities (IPEP) to investigate the 1994 genocide in
Rwanda, an OAU press release said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by Faustin Kinuma, Director the
Finance Department of the OAU and Heli Sirvi, Charge d'Affaires of
the Finnish Embassy, in OAU headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the signing ceremony, Abdalla Bujra, Chief Executive
Officer of the IPEP, expressed appreciation for the contribution
of the Finnish government.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time such a major international panel was set
up by the OAU to investigate and address the causes as well as to
ensure that similar events do not take place against either in
Africa or elsewhere, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan genocide in 1994 resulted from a civil war between
peoples of Hutu and Tutsi in the country. More than 500,000
people were reportedly killed in the genocide.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council of the United Nations adopted a
resolution in November 1994 to establish an international court
for the investigations of suspects that involved in the genocide
and to bring them to trial.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The Namibian people will
forever remember the dedication and sacrifices made by the
frontline states during Namibia's struggle for national
liberation, president Sam Nujoma said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the celebration of the 10th anniversary of
independence in the capital of Windhoek, Nujoma said Namibia's
liberation should be attributed to the frontline states' concrete
support and solidarity with the Namibians.
</P>
<P>
He said over the past 10 years, Namibia maintained peace and
stability.
</P>
<P>
"It is also our hope that other countries around the world,
which are experiencing internal conflicts, will soon achieve and
enjoy peace and stability so that their people can concentrate on
socio-economic reconstruction and development," Nujoma said.
</P>
<P>
During Namibia's independence struggle against South Africa's
colonial rule, the frontline states, namely Angola, Botswana,
Mozambique, Tanzania and Zimbabwe, provided substantial assistance
to Nujoma's South West Africa People's Organization. They also
suffered bomb attacks and aggression by white-ruled South African
troops.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 21 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's major gold
producers sat out Tuesday's fifth British gold auction, saying
that they did not bid for any gold on auction this time.
</P>
<P>
These major gold producers include Anglogold, Goldfields,
Harmony, Durban Deep and Western Areas.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of England, Britain's central bank, announced on
Tuesday that it sold 804,400 ounces of gold reserves, or around 25
tons, at 285.25 U.S. dollars per ounce.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the world's largest gold producer, Anglogold,
said the group had not participated in the latest gold auction.
Anglogold bought gold at two previous auctions--in November 1999
and January this year.
</P>
<P>
Goldfields spokesman Willie Jacobz said the group had not bid
at the latest auction. "We participated in the last two auctions,
but we sat this one out. we have no positions to cover," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bernard Swanepoel, a spokesman of Harmony, South Africa's third
largest gold producer, confirmed that the group had not

Another group of people who suffer from the disease are

months would amount to 203,000 kilowatt, but the current capacity
the power stations could muster up is only 180,000 kilowatt,
acting General Manager of the EEPCO Mihiret Debebe told a forum.
</P>
<P>
He said in addition to increasing demand for power supply, the
late rainy season, which should have started several weeks ago,
had also promoted the need for power rationing.
</P>
<P>
Consumers should expect alternate power disruption from 7:00
a.m. to 8: 00 p.m. every four days, he said, noting the load
shedding power supply system, to be practical soon across the
nation, would be the sole alternative to meet the least the
minimum demand for electricity consumption.
</P>
<P>
Mihiret urged high electric power consuming firms to properly
and economically utilize the power supply to cooperate with the
EEPCO in the efforts geared to overcome the temporary problem.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has revised its foreign
investment law in a bid to improve the environment of foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
The revised Foreign Investment Law (revised) of the country has
been finalized and is due to be submitted to the National Assembly
in April, Vietnam News Agency (VNA) Tuesday quoted the Ministry of
Planning and Investment (MPI) as saying.
</P>
<P>
The revised version has been written in a way that aims to
systematically and further ensure the stimulus policies and legal
safety for foreign investment, and to create an equal footing
between domestic and foreign investors, stressed experts of the
rewriting board.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, foreign investors will be allowed to establish
stock companies while, as stipulated in the current law, they are
now only permitted to set up limited liability companies.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to attract more foreign investment in remote and
highland areas, the MPI in its proposed provisions states that
foreign direct investment (FDI) projects in those areas may be
subject to tax exemption when transferring profit abroad.

DHAKA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- A total of 6,500 community clinics
out of the planned 18,000, are expected to start functioning in
April to reach medicare to every rural household in Bangladesh,

<HEADLINE> U.S. Trade Deficit Surges to New High in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. trade deficit surged
to record 28 billion U.S. dollars in January as Americans' demand
for foreign oil hit an all-time high while exports dropped, the
Commerce Department reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit increased by 13.8 percent in January compared
to the 24.6 billion dollars in December, stark evidence that the
country began the year with the same weakness in trade that was
exhibited throughout 1999.
</P>
<P>
In January, total U.S. exports of goods and services dipped 1.8
percent to 84.06 billion dollars, still the second-highest level
on record, following a record 85.56 billion dollars in sales in
December.
</P>
<P>
The export decline reflected a drop of 347 million dollars in
sales of chemicals and other industrial supplies, a decrease of
355 million dollars in sales of U.S. semiconductors and a decline
of 231 million dollars in exports of consumer goods such as stereo
equipment and household appliances.
</P>
<P>
Imports hit another monthly record of 112.07 billion in January,
up 1.7 percent from the December record.
</P>
<P>
Imports of foreign petroleum climbed by 919 million dollars to
a record high of 7.87 billion dollars in January, thanks mainly to
the sharp rise in oil prices. That was more than double the level
of a year ago, when the country was enjoying a big slide in
petroleum prices.
</P>
<P>
Other big import increases were in foreign autos, which rose by
677 million dollars and imports of capital goods, including
computers and telecommunications equipment, which climbed by 207
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
America's deficit with Canada, its biggest trading partner, set
an all-time record of 4.29 billion dollars in January, up 24.4
percent from December. The deficit with Mexico, the other partner
in the North American Free Trade Agreement, more than doubled in
January to 1.77 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
America's deficit with the 15-nation European Union shrank by a
slight 0.9 percent to 3.86 billion dollars in January. The deficit
with Japan dropped by nearly 20 percent to 5.58 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
For all of last year, the country posted an all-time high trade
deficit of 267.6 billion dollars, 62.9 percent higher than the
previous record, an imbalance of 164.3 billion dollars in 1998.

<HEADLINE> 20 People Killed in Clan Fighting Over Farms in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, March 21 (Xinhua) -- At least 20 people were killed
and a dozen others wounded Monday after heavy armed confrontation
flared up between opposing clan militiamen over farms and water
canals in southern Somalia.
</P>
<P>
According to VHF radio reports, the fighting between the Fiqi
Omar and Fiqi Muhumad subclans of the Dir community in Hiran
region, was concentrated around Kabhanley village, some 360
kilometers north of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses contacted on the VHF radios said that they had
seen 15 dead bodies inside the village, while other people
confirmed that they had found five more in between the Kabhanley
and Defow villages, which are ten kilometers apart.
</P>
<P>
The Fiqi Muhumad subclan militiamen attacked the Kabhanley
village inhabited by their rival Fiqi Omar people and took over
the village after hours of serious armed confrontation,
independent sources said.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, three trucks full of ammunition
including 20 assault rifles and two rocket-propelled grenades and
food were seized from the defeated Fiqi Omar fighters before the
fighting subsided late Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
However, the fighting broke out again Tuesday morning in the
same village after the Fiqi Omar fighters reorganized themselves
around Defow village for a counter-attack operation.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the area indicated that in the counter-attack, the
Fiqi Omar fighters regained control of the village they lost to
their rivals on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The VHF radios of the two villages has gone out of the air as a
result of the fighting, but the latest reports from the villages
Tuesday afternoon indicated that the situation is calm, but
tension is very high with each of the two sides making more
preparations for further armed confrontations.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the fighting is said to have related to earlier
dispute over farms and water canals which each subclan claimed its
ownership. Neutral elders from the neighboring Beletuein town had
for several times tried to intervene for mediation but in vain.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the country, at least two people were killed and
five others wounded after fighting broke out between the Biyomal
and Tunni clans in Lower Shabelleh region, some 200 kilometers
south of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
According to confirmed reports, the dispute was over farms
leased to one of the clans in the past season.
</P>
<P>
Even though there has been no rain falls during the past
season, the owners still asked for more money to renew the leasing
contract, something the other side had denied.
</P>
<P>
The dispute, which had led to the destruction of several houses
in Erileh village some 35 kilometers north of the coastal town of
Brava, is not resolved yet.

BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
today called on both the Chinese and US leaders to properly handle,
in the US election year, major issues such as how to ensure that
the Sino-US ties maintain stability and continue improving and
developing.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks in a meeting with Richard C. Holbrooke,
US permanent representative to the United Nations, here this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
In the US election year, "certain people in the US have
attempted to involve Sino-US relations in US presidential campaign
politics and disturb the improvement and development of Sino-US
ties," he said.
</P>
<P>
He described the proper handling of Sino-US relations as a "
major issue" for the leaders of both countries "at this critical
moment."
</P>
<P>
Proceeding from the fundamental interests of the people of the
two countries, Jiang said, it is "of vital importance" to strictly
abide by the three Sino-US joint communiques, handle the
differences between the two countries properly and ensure that the
basis of Sino-US relations is solid and safe from damage.
</P>
<P>
He said that the the Taiwan issue is the biggest barrier to the
improvement and development of Sino-US relations, stressing that
the Taiwan issue is the internal affairs of China. "It is the
common aspiration and sacred mission of the whole Chinese people
to safeguard China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and
realize complete reunification," he said.

<P>
China's complete reunification "not only is the common
aspiration of the entire Chinese people and in the fundamental
interests of the Chinese nation, but also is conducive to the
healthy and steady development of Sino-US ties," he said, adding
that "this is also beneficial to the US side."
</P>
<P>
Saying that he is paying close attention to the development of
the situation on Taiwan island, Jiang reiterated that "the one
China principle provides the basis and prerequisite for resolving
the Taiwan issue peacefully."
</P>
<P>
Jiang stressed that the Taiwan regional election of local
leaders and its result cannot change the fact that Taiwan is but
part of China's territory.
</P>
<P>
"I have openly stated that leaders across the Taiwan Straits
can hold talks," Jiang said, "but the prerequisite for such talks
is the one China principle."
</P>
<P>
He demanded that the United States abide by the three Sino-US
joint communiques and the commitments of "three no's" in the two-
hour meeting with Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
The "three no's" refers to the US giving no support to the
independence of Taiwan; no support to "one China, one Taiwan" or "
two Chinas"; and no support to Taiwan's entry into any
international organization with membership of sovereign states. (

"The US should take concrete actions to support its one China
policy. Only by doing so can Sino-US ties avoid setbacks and
instead register improvement and development," he said.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke conveyed greetings from US President Bill Clinton to
Jiang, and Jiang asked him to convey his regards to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke agreed that the US and China should handle bilateral
ties from a long-term and strategic viewpoint for the building of
stable, mature and cooperative ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Clinton administration values the role of
China in the international arena. The US government will continue
to strengthen its cooperation with China in UN affairs and make
efforts to gear US-China relations to the direction of a
constructive and strategic partnership, he said.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke said that the US side is fully aware of the
importance and sensitiveness of the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
He said that the US will continue its adherence to the one
China principle, the three Sino-US joint communiques and the
commitment to the "three no's."
</P>
<P>
The US government opposes the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act,
and will block it from becoming law, he said.
</P>
<P>
Also, he told Jiang that the US government will firmly push
Congress to grant China Permanent Normal Trade Relations status.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Police See "Ice" As Top Enemy This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese police, the country's
major anti-drug force, have targeted "ice" as the No. one enemy
this year.
</P>
<P>
Yang Fengrui, director of the drug-fighting department of the
Ministry of Public Security, said here today that last year
Chinese police confiscated 16 tons of "ice", 10 times the figure
for the previous year.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking at a national conference on fighting the drug
scourge held in this capital of Guizhou Province, in southwest
China.
</P>
<P>
China is the world's largest producer of natural ephedrine,
from which "ice" is extracted, and has been falling victim to the
increasingly rampant drug trafficking worldwide, especially "ice"
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
So far, "ice" trafficking has been found in 24 provinces,
municipalities and ethnic autonomous regions in the country,
according to the police officer.
</P>
<P>
Yang urged the use of every means to fight "ice" manufacturers
and traffickers throughout the country. Special efforts should be
made to crack down on "ice" making and selling networks, step up
control over places of recreation, and organize special campaigns
in some areas that have seen wide-spread trafficking and use of "
ice".
</P>
<P>
Drugs have become an increasingly severe problem in China.
Official figures show that in 1999, the number of registered drug
addicts topped 680,000, a 14.3 percent rise over 1998.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Starts Second-Phase Renovation of Wangfujing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Beijing today started the second-
phase renovation of Wangfujing, the city's busiest commercial
street. The whole project is expected to be completed in September.
</P>
<P>
Wangfujing Street, which is located in the central downtown
area of Beijing, is only two km from the Beijing Railway Station.
The first phase of its reconstruction was completed in September
1999, helping attract an average number of 300,000 customers a day.
</P>
<P>
The second phase of the construction will help the street
expand in the north, east and west directions. The Jinyu (Goldfish)
Hutong on the east side of the street will be turned into an
avenue of hotels and restaurants, while a back street on the west
side will be built into a street of snack bars.
</P>
<P>
The project also includes the extension of the street to the
north, which will make Wangfujing Street two or three kilometers
longer than before.
</P>
<P>
The current commercial structure of the street will also be
renovated, with more toilets and other public facilities
constructed.
</P>
<P>
The project will cost a total of 340 million yuan (about 40
million U.S. dollars), and 242 million yuan will be spent to
relocate residents living in the affected areas.

<HEADLINE> Israel Hands Over More West Bank Land to Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEITUNIA, WEST BANK, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Israel carried out an
overdue troop withdrawal from 6.1 percent of the West Bank Tuesday
as the negotiations with the Palestinians aimed at reaching a
permanent peace is to resume in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Excited Palestinian police fired their guns toward the sky while
they drove in open jeeps into this newly transferred town in
southwestern Ramallah. Residents greeted the police and the sense
of freedom by setting off firecrackers and honking car horns.
</P>
<P>
"Listen to the sounds of the guns, and watch the people smiling,
you would know how glad we are," said Kamal Kamel, a middle-aged
carpenter, waving to the police.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, at a transfer ceremony held at an Israeli army base
near Beitunia, Israeli army officers gave Palestinian security
officials copies of the maps outlining the area being handed over.
</P>
<P>
Then, they toured the area in jeeps to inspect the new
boundaries marked by yellow and brown concrete blocks. Beitunia was
handed over to full Palestinian rule from joint Israeli-Palestinian
control.
</P>
<P>
Similar ceremonies took place and similar scenes of joy were
seen near Hebron, Bethlehem and other Palestinian-ruled cities in
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal, the last of a three-stage redeployment
stipulated in the Sharm el Sheikh agreement signed last year, was
supposed to have been carried out on January 20, but a dispute over
the areas involved delayed its implementation.
</P>
<P>
At the heart of the dispute was Israel's refusal to accept the
Palestinians demand that Israel include Arab villages surrounding
Jerusalem, claimed by both sides as their capital, in this
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
To break a five-week deadlock caused by the dispute, Prime
Minister Ehud Barak had once agreed to include an Arab village
abutting Jerusalem, but abandoned his plan at last moment bowing to
right-wing pressures.
</P>
<P>
After the transfer, 5.1 percent from joint control to full
Palestinian control and 1 percent from full Israeli control to
total Palestinian control, the Palestinians will have full or
partial control over 40 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad that we've got more land, but that's not enough. We
shall get all the land occupied by Israel," Mysar Maaly, a tourist
guide at early 30s, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"Look, this land also belongs to us," Maaly said, pointing to
the direction of the nearby Jewish settlement of Givat Ze'ev, one
of the largest settlement blocs surrounding Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
According to Israeli-Palestinian peace deals, Israel should
carry out an additional withdrawal from the West Bank in June. The
Palestinians wish to get more than 90 percent of the West Bank,
seized by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war, after that
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
The scope of the coming withdrawal is expected to be decided in
a framework agreement on final-status issues such as final borders,
Jerusalem, Jewish settlements, refugees and water.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Palestinian negotiators will resume talks over these
issues in Washington later Tuesday with an aim of reaching the
framework deal by May and a final peace treaty by September.

<HEADLINE> India Gives No Commitment on Signing CTBT: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"We have given no commitment on the CTBT," said Indian National
Security Advisor Brajesh Mishra while briefing the reporters on
the two-hour talks between the two leaders.
</P>
<P>
Declaring that it was entirely for New Delhi itself to decide
on how to meet its security needs, Mishra said India has already
committed to developing a consensus on the CTBT issue in the
country.
</P>
<P>
"This process of achieving consensus is going on. This
continued to be our position," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
New Delhi will have a minimum credible nuclear deterrent, but
it does not wish to be engaged in any arms race in the region, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Though the two sides had different expressions on the non-
proliferation issue and India's security, he said, they agreed in
the end to work together on the question.
</P>
<P>
According to Mishra, Clinton and Vajpayee had a restricted
session on Tuesday morning for about 50 minutes, which was
followed by 10 minutes of one-to-one discussions and 45 minutes of
meeting between respective delegations.
</P>
<P>
"There has been total agreement on deepening and broadening of
friendship between the two countries," he said, adding that a
decision has also been taken on enhancing cooperation in security,
political and economic matters.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed on the steps that need to be taken to reduce
tension in the south Asian subcontinent, he said.
</P>
<P>
India also raised to the U.S. side the issue of lifting
sanctions imposed on India after the Pokhran nuclear tests in 1998,
and Washington gave the assurance while some steps had already
been taken in this direction, some others would be taken in the
future, said Mishra.

<HEADLINE> Canada not Looking for Trade War with Australia: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Canada was not looking for a
trade war over Australia's Tasmania state's refusal to allow
Canadian salmon imports into the state, Canada's High Commission
in Canberra said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Canada's objective is to regain access to the Australian
market for uncooked salmon, not to limit trade with Australia,"
Wayne Robson, first secretary at the high commission, told the ABC
radio.
</P>
<P>
"And certainly if both sides can come to a mutually
satisfactory agreement on implementation then Canada will withdraw
its request to retaliate," he said.
</P>
<P>
Australia's beef and lamb producers fear retaliatory action
from Canada could cost them millions of Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
Tasmania remains adamant it will keep its ban on salmon, in
defiance of a World Trade Organization ruling and directly against
the federal government's move to relax restrictions.
</P>
<P>
The government is urging Tasmania to reverse its decision,
while also negotiating with Canada, to ensure other agricultural
industries do not suffer losses.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Consoles Soldiers, Warns Rebels in Mindanao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada made a surprise visit to north Mindanao Tuesday morning
where he paid tribute to fallen soldiers, Philippine News Agency
said.
</P>
<P>
The president, together with Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado,
flew to Kauswagan, North Lanao province, for a personal overview
of the coastal town held under siege by rebels of the Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF) last week.
</P>
<P>
In a speech in Kauswagan, Estrada offered peace invitation to
rebels but warned that the government will not hesitate to use
force against those who terrorized local residents.
</P>
<P>
"The assault in Kauswagan was a challenge to our government. It
(attack) shows that the MILF did not recognize the government's
peace efforts," Estrada was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, Estrada said, the government will not be cowed by the
MILF's acts of terrorism since "our armed forces are willing to
sacrifice their lives in defense of our people."
</P>
<P>
Estrada exhorted the people that without peace in Mindanao,
more than 18 million people will never have economic development.
</P>
<P>
During the occasion, Estrada distributed 300 bags of rice, 300
bags of sugar and 600 bags of assorted canned goods to some 3,000
evacuees who were dislocated during the siege in Kauswagan.
</P>
<P>
From Kauswagan, Estrada flew to Cagayan de ORO, Misamis
Oriental province, and arrived about 2:00 p.m. in Camp Evangelista
where he paid tribute to four soldiers and two civilian volunteers
now lying in state there.
</P>
<P>
From the military camp, Estrada motored to the Army Station
Hospital in the city where he consoled the wounded at an army
station hospital before flying back to Manila.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Djibouti Conference on Somali Peace Shadowed By Aidid's Refusal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Somali faction leader Hussein
Mohamed Aidid has refused to attend the Djibouti conference, and
shadowed the peace efforts to look for a lasting solution to the
ten-year civil war in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
"We are not attending any reconciliation conference whose
agendas and political plan are not clear," Aidid said in a press
conference Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"But instead, we're now heading for Libya for an alternative
conference in which a government will be established for Somalia,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
So far there has been no word as yet from Libya over this
alleged meeting.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of seven split factions under the Somalia
National Alliance (SNA), Aidid accused the Djibouti initiative for
not giving what he called the political organizations any
important role to play in the conference.
</P>
<P>
"The Djibouti peace plan favors the civic society groups whose
constituencies are not known to anyone," he said.
</P>
<P>
Over 60 Somali intellectuals are now meeting in Djibouti to
establish the agenda and criteria of participation for the
reconciliation conference.
</P>
<P>
They are expected to discuss the best possible government for
Somalia and how the power sharing system for Somalia would be like
and submit them to the Djibouti conference to be opened on April
20.
</P>
<P>
Although many Somali faction leaders like Aidid don't seem to
be ready to relinquish power for any peace settlement if they are
not given the privilege of being the front running elements, the
civic society groups are determined to carry forward with the
Djibouti peace plan.
</P>
<P>
The civic society groups have been flourishing by organizing
themselves according to their profession. For instance, the local
non-government organizations have announced their main umbrella,
the lawyers have made their law society and the teachers have
declared their own union.
</P>
<P>
The artists' club, which now unifies the singers, poets, actors
and the comedians from all sides of Mogadishu and the country in
general, have started holding public shows with music and poems.
</P>
<P>
Their latest such large and unguarded public show was held
inside the main stadium of Mogadishu on Saturday and attracted
thousands of people.
</P>
<P>
At the function, Mustafa Sheikh Elmi, new chairman of the
artists' club, told the crowd that at last peace seems to be
forthcoming for the Somalis.
</P>
<P>
The symptoms for peace include the wearing out of the trust the
people have had for the faction leaders and the turning into shame
of the assault rifles earlier carried as a fashion by young gunmen
in Mogadishu, one of the artists said.
</P>
<P>
According to Elmi, their main aim is to raise the public
awareness of the people especially at this crucial moment when the
politics of Somalia is coming out of the chaotic situation to
understandable.
</P>
<P>
The show of the artists is a new phenomenon in Mogadishu and
they have promised to continue holding such public gatherings and
orient people for peace through various traditional ways of
introducing poems, songs and comedies.

<HEADLINE> Fresh Violence in Northern Nigeria Kills Four </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Tension heightened again in
Nigeria's northern Kaduna state on Monday as four men were killed
at a suburb of the capital city of Kaduna, reported the Guardian,
a leading Nigerian newspaper, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The resurgence of violence came just as the state government
constituted a panel to probe the recent crisis over the Islamic
Sharia law, during which some 1,000 people in Kaduna and other
states were killed, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Monday's killing took place in a protest against alleged
extortion by soldiers at Rigasa in the suburb of Kaduna city.
</P>
<P>
The protest soon assumed religious dimensions when some
placard-carrying youths demanded the imposition of Sharia rule.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers made some arrests, which further raised the
tempers while the deployment of anti-riot policemen aggravated the
crisis, local residents said. In the ensuing melee, at least four
people were killed.
</P>
<P>
State Governor Ahmed Makarfi, in a statement after the riot,
has called on the "good citizens of Kaduna state including
uniformed personnel to help keep peace and avoid any acts capable
of destabilizing the current normalcy in the state."

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia's Polio Immunization Campaign Successful: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia has made successful
effort to curb the spread of polio after a national campaign to
guard against the disease kicked off last year, a senior official
said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Impressive results had been scored in the campaign due to the
newly designed house to house immunization strategy, said
Tesfanesh Belay, chief of Family Health Department of the Health
Ministry, at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
She said the campaign would continue this year, targeting the
states of, among others, Amhara and the most populous states in
Ethiopia, Oromia and Gambella.
</P>
<P>
According to Tesfanesh, the coming house to house immunization
campaign will be carried out in two rounds with the first taking
place during March 24- 30 and the second during April 21-27.
</P>
<P>
About 300,000 children under five years old will receive two
doses of oral polio vaccines in the immunization campaign, she
said.
</P>
<P>
The 1999 National Immunization Campaign, sponsored by the
Health Ministry, were mainly implemented in the states of Somali,
Afar and Benshangul-Gumuz.

<HEADLINE> British Inflation Rises Slightly in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 21 (Xinhua) - Inflation is beginning to rise
again in Britain, raising the prospect that higher interest rates
will be needed.
</P>
<P>
Prices excluding mortgage payments rose 0.4 percent on the
month to stand 2.2 percent higher in the year to February, up from
2.1 percent in the previous month, according to the Office for
National Statistics (ONS).
</P>
<P>
The headline rate of inflation in the month rose to 2.3 percent,
compared with 2.0 percent in January. However that is still below
the government's target of 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The ONS said the largest upward effect on the index came from
housing costs, as rising mortgage payments reflected recent rate
rises by the Bank of England.
</P>
<P>
The Bank has already increased British interest rates four
times in an attempt to curb inflation, but house prices are still
rising sharply and wages are growing faster than the Bank would
like.
</P>
<P>
Economists here believe that with Britain's economy set to grow
strongly this year, and the possibility of a give-away pre-
election budget, there will be pressure on the Bank to raise rates
again.

<HEADLINE> France Needs 1.47 Million Immigrants: U.N. Report </HEADLINE>

<P>
The report, worked out by a U.N. experts' group on population,
said that without immigrants, the people in France would have to
work until they are 74 years old by 2050.
</P>
<P>
The report covers studies on the consequences from the aging of
the populations in eight European and Asian countries and the
United States from 1995 till 2050.
</P>
<P>
It said that because of the low birth rate in France, which
stood at 1.72 children per woman in the period from 1990 to 1995,
and the prolonging of life expectancy up to 77.1 years in average,
France's population is aging and its population structure showing
imbalance.
</P>
<P>
In order to keep a population of 61 million people as it is now,
France needs to have 1.47 million immigrants in the coming 50
years, or 27,000 immigrants per year, it said.
</P>
<P>
France absorbed 39,000 immigrants each year in average from
1995 to 1998.

interference in each other's internal affairs, Li vowed. He said
that China respects the independent choices of development
patterns that fit the particular conditions of their states
undertaken by the African peoples, including the people of the
Republic of the Congo.
</P>
<P>
"Peace and stability are the prerequisites and basis of
development, and we hope that the Republic of the Congo will make
new progress in stabilizing its political situation and reviving
its economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
President Sassau-nguesso said he was pleased to meet Li and his
wife during this visit. Sassau-nguesso has made seven visits to
China since 1964. He was deeply impressed by China's development
throughout these years, he added.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral relations have assumed a smooth course of development
since the two forged diplomatic ties in 1964, and China has
consistently stood with the Republic of the Congo, and offered its
compassion and support throughout all the armed conflicts and
difficulties it has suffered, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"My dialogues with President Jiang, Chairman Li of the NPC and
Premier Zhu during this visit have all proved completely
successful, and I will return to my homeland with a satisfied
heart," President Sassau-nguesso said.

<HEADLINE> HK to Introduce Reloadable Electronic Parking Cards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong is to launch a six-
month trial scheme on paying parking fees with reloadable
electronic cards as from March 25, said Peter Luk, a senior
officer of the Hong Kong Transport Department Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Apart from e-Park cards currently in use, electronic parking
meters on about 700 existing parking spaces on 38 streets in Wan
Chai, Happy Valley, and Causeway Bay will accept Mondex cards
while those on another 700 parking spaces on 37 streets in Tsim
Sha Tsui and Yau Ma Tei will take Visa Cash cards.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are about 16,000 metered parking spaces in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Luk said that motorists would no doubt find the reloadable
Mondex card and Visa Cash card, which serve as an alternative for
parking payment, very convenient and environmentally friendly.
</P>
<P>
"If the trial goes successfully, the government will spend less
in the cost by issuing less non-reloadable e-Park cards," Luk said.
</P>
<P>
Motorists can add value to their cards at the Automated Teller
Machines with Mondex and Visa Cash logos.
</P>
<P>
During the period from April 1998 to September 1999, all coin-
operated mechanical meters were replaced by Electronic Parking
Devices (EPDs). Only e-Park cards issued by the transport
department were accepted by EPDs when these devices were first
introduced.
</P>
<P>
The transport department will evaluate the result at the end of
the trial and the performance of the two electronic cash cards
will be assessed on the basis of the relative reliability of the
cards, maintenance requirements, revenue security, enforcement
implications and public acceptability.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah MPs Say No to SLA Amnesty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Parliament members of Hezbollah
guerrillas have withdrawn their support for a draft law that will
grant amnesty to South Lebanon Army (SLA) militiamen, Daily Star
newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah's parliament member (MP) Ibrahim Sayyed told reporters
that SLA militiamen lost their chance of obtaining amnesty after
Israel announced its plan early this month to pull out its troops
from south Lebanon by July.
</P>
<P>
"Officially and clearly, the chance given to the Israeli
collaborators is over and we (Hezbollah) are no longer concerned
with the draft law," he said.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a self-styled security zone in 1985 in south
Lebanon with a claimed aim of protecting its northern territories
from cross-border guerrilla attacks. The SLA, funded and controlled
by Israel, has been helping the Jewish state patrol the so-called
security zone.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or Party of God, is waging a war of attrition to oust
the Israeli occupation troops and the SLA from the country, the
last active Arab-Israeli battlefront.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah has repeatedly announced that they will not forgive
SLA militiamen who are regarded as traitors here.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- Thanks to the upward oil price which also yielded a 43
percent rise in the stock market, Saudi Running Account deficit
declined to 3.9 billion U.S dollars in l999 from 13 billion dollars
in 1998 last year, according to a work report on national
economy in 1999 and prospects in 2000 by the Saudi-American Bank's
Economic Department Chairman Office.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- The 25th Middle East regional conference of the U.N.
Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) opened here on Monday. The
meeting will iron out a strategic framework for sustainable agro-
based development in the Middle East and improving food security
and agricultural education.
</P>

businesses and also its marketing activities into separate
corporations. Its tobacco leaf business will be run by a state-
owned firm.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Clinton's Visit to Bangladesh Largely  Symbolic  by Chen Jian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The wind-whirling visit of U.S.
President Bill Clinton to Bangladesh on March 20 ended after an 11-
hour hectic stay. Although it was termed as "extraordinary" by
Bangladeshi President Shahabuddin Ahmed, in fact, both Bangladesh
and the United States didn't get what they had expected, and the
visit is, by and large, symbolic.
</P>
<P>
On the itinerary of Clinton's visit disclosed by Bangladeshi
side, increase of garment export quota and free access of
Bangladeshi products to the United States featured prominently.
During the meeting with President Clinton, Bangladeshi Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina requested Clinton to increase Bangladeshi
garment export quota for at least 30 percent, and to commit duty-
free and quota-free access of Bangladeshi products to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
As the United States is the largest importer of Bangladesh's
ready-made garment, export quota increase and free access could
benefit Bangladesh, the largest least-developed country to a great
extent. The business circle in Dhaka also raised the same requests
when talking with visiting U.S. Commerce Secretary William Daley.
However, they received no promise on these issues from the U.S.
side.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the U.S. commerce secretary expressed his concerns
over enforceable commercial law, infrastructure, skill of work
force and political stability in Bangladesh which, he said, would
be scrutinized by U.S. companies before going for investments.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Hasina also urged President Clinton to give
Legal Permanent Resident status to undocumented citizens of
Bangladesh in the United States, but the request was refused by
Clinton who said there was a limit to what he could do since the
United States has immigration laws that govern this.
</P>
<P>
Another issue on deportation of the killers of Sheikh Mujibur
Rahman, the first prime minister of the country, was not even
mentioned by President Clinton, though he paid respect to Rahman
in his speech at the press conference.
</P>
<P>
Except for the unsatisfactory responses by the United States to
the above four demands, the cancellation of President Clinton's
scheduled visit to National Memorial and a model village due to
security concerns also disappointed Bangladeshi people.
</P>
<P>
The United States didn't get what they wanted either. Hasina
sticked to the previous position on gas export which was sought
vehemently by international oil companies by saying that after
fully meeting domestic requirements and ensuring gas reserves for
50 years, the remaining surplus gas will be available for export.
</P>
<P>
Despite all the disappointments on both sides, the visit itself
symbolized significant importance. It is the first ever visit by a
U.S. President to Bangladesh since its independence in 1971, and
from now on, the United States regards Bangladesh as a "partner",
not a "bottomless basket".
</P>
<P>
President Clinton highly praised the signing and ratification
of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty by Bangladesh, especially
when the other two South Asian powers, India and Pakistan, refuse
to do so. He also regarded Bangladesh as a nation where democracy
could co-exist with Islam peacefully.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Clinton announced to provide 97 million U.S.
dollars of food assistance and 50 million dollars for clean energy
research. And Bangladesh will be the very first nation to receive
funding under a U.S. program that converts old debt to new funding
to protect tropical forests. More than 10 million dollars of
assistance was committed by President Clinton to help child labors
return to schools, to improve workplace standards for women, and
to prevent the trafficking of women and children. Two U.S.
companies signed memorandums of understanding on telecom
cooperation respectively with Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone
Bureau during Clinton's visit.
</P>
<P>
Both sides expressed seriousness to enhance the existing
bilateral friendship during the visit, and President Clinton
invited Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to visit the United States in
reciprocity to his Dhaka tour. Though the achievements of Clinton'
s visit fell short of expectation, Bangladesh and the United
States will continue to cooperate in the fields of energy,
information technology and telecommunication. The reciprocal visit
by Hasina, which is initially set in October, will undoubtedly
further strengthen U.S.-Bangladesh ties.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian FUNCINPEC Congress Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's FUNCINPEC party
ended its three-day congress Tuesday, emphasizing the importance
to strengthen party's unity and building.
</P>
<P>
Some 700 party representatives from all over the country
attended the congress chaired by party President Prince Norodom
Ranariddh at party's headquarters in Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the participants discussed the key issues
such as drafting law for party's commune election, enhancing the
internal structure of the party, developing the country's economy
and eliminating poverty.
</P>
<P>
According to a four-point communique released after the meeting,
the party announced that it fully supports the policy stated by
Prince Ranariddh to firmly protect and respect the monarchy regime
as well as to strengthen the party building.
</P>
<P>
Second, it expressed to support the decision of political
committee about the building of a peaceful and legal country and
the reduction of poverty.
</P>
<P>
Third, it expressed to support the decision for strengthening
the framework of National Council, observer, executive committee
and the status of party members.
</P>
<P>
And the forth, it expressed to support the decision about the
communal and district election, that is to establish one committee
for studying a law and a general procedure for the guarantee of
fairness, transparency and justice of the election and for
strengthening the cooperation of mix-committee between FUNCINPEC
and the Cambodian People's Party (CPP).
</P>
<P>
It was said the party's next task already placed on the agenda
is to admit breakaway members back into the party fold, and the
first group of people who were possible returning would include
Ung Hout, president of Reastr Niyum Party (Populist Party) (RNP),
Nady Tan and Tao Seng Hour, vice presidents of the RNP, as well as
the party's Secretary General Pou Sothirak.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of the party's congress, Prince
Ranariddh said FUNCINPEC needed to improve itself to win commune
elections in 2001 and national elections in 2003.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "as the president, I understand that we should
gather the voices we lost in the July 1997 events because those
voices are the voices of FUNCINPEC."
</P>
<P>
Ung Hout, who replaced Ranariddh as the first prime minister
after July 1997, formed the Reastr Niyum Party before the 1998
general election. Most of his party members are from FUNCINPEC as
then the royalist party was split into many factions due to the
event that took place in July 1997.

way of solving the land problem."
</P>
<P>
The forum said it was concerned with the deteriorating state of
law and order in the country. War veterans have occupied more
than 400 commercial farms countrywide.
</P>
<P>
The forum said the country's international reputation and image
as a peaceful and law-abiding nation was being badly damaged.
</P>
<P>
"It is becoming extremely difficult to initiate moves to rescue
Zimbabwe' s ailing economy from its present state when farm
invasions undermine such efforts," it said.
</P>
<P>
The business leaders called upon the Minister of Home Affairs
and the Commissioner of Police to uphold the Constitution of
Zimbabwe and the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
The High Court last Friday declared the occupations by black
war veterans illegal, and ruled that if they did not move out from
the farms, police would evict them after 72 hours.
</P>
<P>
White farmers warned that the refusal of black occupiers to obey
the court order to vacate their farms would plunge Zimbabwe into
anarchy.

<HEADLINE> Obasanjo Urges to Abandon Unfair Trade Practice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo urged the parliamentarians from African, Caribbean,
Pacific and European Union (ACP-EU) countries, to help correct the
injustices in Lome Convention and international trade and
assistance regime.
</P>
<P>
The president said on Monday at the opening of the four-day
session of the ACP-EU joint parliamentary assembly in Nigeria's
capital Abuja that "70 percent of development assistance to ACP
countries is recycled to Europe."
</P>
<P>
According to the Nigerian News Agency report on Tuesday, the
share of ACP countries in European imports market accounted for
6.7 percent in 1976, while it decreased to 2.8 percent in 1994 and
it is declining in recent years.
</P>
<P>
He blamed this partly on the "strings attached" to the
development assistance and *relentless movement of the terms of
trade against primary products over the years*.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo called for "a stronger, more fruitful and more
result-oriented partnership" between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
*If the 20th century was the era of colonialism, let the
decades of the 21st century be one of the genuine partnership for
African, Caribbean, and Pacific renaissance and the full
restoration of human dignity universally," he said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is the largest international meeting hosted by
Nigeria's civilian government since it took office from the
military last May.
</P>
<P>
The Lome Convention, aimed at providing assistance and opening
market to former colonies of the European countries, was first
signed in 1975 and revised three times as Lome II, III and IV, is
due for further revision in June to be known as Lome V.
</P>
<P>
In addition to delegates from the 86 ACP and EU member
countries, the Organization of African Unity, African Development
Bank, and other inter- governmental organizations also sent their
representatives to the meeting.

<HEADLINE> France Welcomes Senegal Election Result </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 21 (Xinhua) -- France Tuesday welcomed the result
of the presidential election in Senegal in which the opposition
leader Abdoulaye Wade was elected to replace President Abdou Diouf.
</P>

Elysee presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that the election was marked by "transparency and
fairness" and proved "the taking root of democracy" in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said that the result of the election also showed "the
maturation and the will of the Senegalese people to choose their
leaders in all serenity".
</P>
<P>
"This is a very good example for Africa, which shows that the
voices of the constitution will allow all citizens to make their

<HEADLINE> World Bank to Release 250 Million Dollars in Loans to Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank will disburse 250
million U.S. dollars to Russia by the end of this year, the bank's
Director for Russia, Michael Carter, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Russia is likely to receive 100 million dollars of the first
privatization tranche of the coal loan in the near future, the
Interfax news agency quoted Carter as saying.
</P>
<P>
Although this tranche is automatically released upon Russia's
implementation of the set conditions, the World Bank leadership
will take into consideration the ongoing Chechen conflict, Carter
said.
</P>
<P>
Russia launched military campaigns against rebels in the
breakaway republic last September following waves of armed Chechen
incursions into neighboring Daghestan and a series of apartment
explosions, also blamed on Chechen militants that killed some 300
people in Moscow and two other cities.
</P>
<P>
Moscow sees the military action as a bid to weed out bandits
and terrorists from the breakaway republic. Carter's remark on
Chechnya is likely to be rejected as an attempt to exert political
pressure on Russia by an international financial institution.
</P>
<P>
The privatization of 35 percent of coal-producing enterprises
is the main requirement for the release and this condition was met
with the privatization of Krasnoyarsk Coal Company, Carter said.
</P>
<P>
Russia will receive the fourth and last tranche of the social
adjustment loan totaling 50 million dollars in early summer if it
adheres to the agreed proportions of state support in the coal
sector and continues to monitor the social consequences of the
coal sector restructuring, he said.
</P>
<P>
Carter expressed the hope that Russia would be able to get the
second privatization loan totaling 100 million dollars in the
second half of this year, but he noted that Russia had
considerably delayed implementation of the agreed restructuring in
the social protection system.

<HEADLINE> France Calls for More IMF Aid to Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 21 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
Tuesday called on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to provide
more aid to developing countries, especially African states.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that the IMF should pay more attention to the
economic problems of African countries when he received new IMF
General Director Horst Koehler at the Elysee presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
Koehler, who is president of the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development in Frankfurt, will replace
Frenchman Michel Camdessus this week in Washington.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting with Chirac, the new IMF chief said that how
to provide aid to African states will be a major subject for his
organization.
</P>
<P>
"The reduction of debt is an important element for the global
strategy of fighting poverty in order to give a better chance to
developing countries," said Koehler.
</P>
<P>
But he said that the reduction of debt by rich countries should
be inscribed within the framework of a global strategy including
structural reforms and adopting a system of good government by
developing countries.

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier Qian Meets Holbrooke (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Qian Qichen stressed
here today that under the prerequisite of the one China principle,
any issue can be discussed between the two sides of the Taiwan
Straits.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark in a meeting with Permanent Representative
of the United States to the United Nations Richard Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
Qian said the one China principle is the basis and prerequisite
for a peaceful settlement of the Taiwan issue, stressing that
whoever comes to power cannot pursue "Taiwan independence", and
any form of "Taiwan independence" is absolutely not allowed.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has always claimed that it adheres to the
one China policy, which is also the stand of almost all countries
in the world, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the heads of state of China and the United States
have exchanged visits in recent years, and Sino-U.S. relations
have gradually embarked on a track of improvement and development.
The two countries reached a "win-win" agreement on China's entry
to the World Trade Organization at the end of last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
In general, bilateral relations are facing both opportunities
for development and serious challenges at the turn of the century,
he said. The biggest challenge to those relations is the Taiwan
issue, and how to properly handle the issue is of crucial
importance for their direction, he said.

Radnaasumberel Gonchigdorj, chairman of the State Grand Hural of
the Republic of Mongolia, here today that China is satisfied with
the growth of Sino-Mongolian cooperation in all fields in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
Since the signing of the Treaty on Sino-Mongolian Friendly and
Cooperative Relations in 1994, Zhu said, the two countries have
maintained frequent high-level exchanges. The Mongolian and
Chinese presidents visited the other's countries in 1998 and 1999,
respectively. The Mongolian prime minister also paid a successful
visit to China last year, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
The economic and trade cooperation between the two countries is
also remarkable. "Now China has become Mongolia's largest trading
partner and No. 1 investor," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu asked Gonchigdorj to convey his regards to the other
Mongolian leaders.
</P>
<P>
Gonchigdorj said that Mongolia and China are friendly
neighboring countries, and that "neighbors share common wishes".
He conveyed Mongolia's congratulations to China on its economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Trade authorities of both countries should keep up efforts to
materialize Premier Zhu Rongji's five-point proposals on enhancing
bilateral trade cooperation, made during his meeting with the
Mongolian prime minister last year, said Gonchigdorj, adding that
the State Grand Hural of Mongolia will provide a legal basis for
such efforts.
</P>
<P>
Gonchigdorj also exchanged views with Premier Zhu on
strengthening cooperation in infrastructure construction.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the wish that Premier Zhu Rongji would visit
Mongolia in the near future.

<HEADLINE> Jiang: Taiwan Issue Biggest Barrier to Sino-US Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said here today that the Taiwan issue is the biggest barrier to
the improvement and development of Sino-US relations.
</P>
<P>
He demanded that the United States abide by the three Sino-US
joint communiques and the commitments of "three no's" in a two-
hour meeting with Richard C. Holbrooke, the US permanent
representative to the United Nations, at Zhongnanhai, location of
China's central government.
</P>
<P>
"The US should take concrete actions to support its one China
policy. Only by doing so can Sino-US ties avoid setbacks and
instead register improvement and development," he said.
</P>
<P>
The "three no's" refers to the US giving no support to the
independence of Taiwan; no support to "one China, one Taiwan" or "
two Chinas;" and no support to Taiwan entry into any international
organization with membership of sovereign states.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke said that the US side is fully aware of the
importance and sensitiveness of the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
He said that the US will continue its adherence to the one
China principle, the three Sino-US joint communiques and the
commitment to the "three no's."
</P>
<P>
The US government opposes the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act,
and will block it from becoming law, he said.
</P>
<P>
Also, he told Jiang that the US government will firmly push
Congress to grant China permanent Normal Trade Relations status.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
today called on both Chinese and US leaders to properly handle, in
the US election year, major issues such as how to ensure that the
Sino-US ties maintain stability and continue improving and
developing.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remark in a meeting with Richard C. Holbrooke,
US permanent representative to the United Nations, here this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
In the US election year, "certain people in the US have
attempted to involve Sino-US relations in US presidential campaign
politics and disturb the improvement and development of Sino-US
ties," he said.
</P>
<P>
He described the proper handling of Sino-US relations as a "
major issue" for leaders in both countries "at this critical
moment."
</P>
<P>
Proceeding from the fundamental interests of the people of the
two countries, Jiang said, it is "of vital importance" to strictly
abide by the three Sino-US joint communiques, handle the
differences between the two countries properly and ensure that the
basis of Sino-US relations is solid and safe from damage.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke agreed that the US and China should handle bilateral
ties from a long-term and strategic viewpoint for the building of
stable, mature and cooperative ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Clinton administration values the role of
China in the international arena. The US government will continue
to strengthen its cooperation with China in UN affairs and make
efforts to gear US-China relations to the direction of a
constructive and strategic partnership, he said.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
stressed here today that the Taiwan regional election of local
leaders and its result can not change the fact that Taiwan is but
part of China's territory.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remark in a meeting with Richard C. Holbrooke,
US permanent representative to the United Nations this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"I have openly stated that leaders across the Taiwan Straits
can hold talks," Jiang said, "but the prerequisite for such talks
is the one China principle."
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the Taiwan issue is the internal affairs of
China. "It is the common aspiration and sacred mission of the
whole Chinese people to safeguard China's sovereignty and
territorial integrity, and realize complete reunification," he
said.
</P>
<P>
China's complete reunification "not only is the common
aspiration of the entire Chinese people and in the fundamental
interests of the Chinese nation, but also is conducive to the
healthy and steady development of Sino-US ties," he said, adding
that "this is also beneficial to the US side."
</P>
<P>
Saying that he is paying close attention to the development of
the situation on Taiwan island, Jiang reiterated that "the one
China principle provides the basis and prerequisite for resolving
the Taiwan issue peacefully."

<HEADLINE> (Recast) Chinese Foreign Minister Meets Holbrooke (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- If the U.S. side is bent on
confrontation on the human rights issue, China will oblige it and
fight to the finish, and this practice of the U.S. side to go
against the tide of history cannot attain the support of the vast
majority of member nations of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan made the remarks here
today during his meeting with Richard Holbrooke, permanent
representative of the United States to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people have never been afraid of any bluffs and
pressure, including those on the human rights issue, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that differences between the two countries on this issue
should be resolved through dialog on the basis of equality and
mutual respect, Tang said the U.S. side should deal with the
differences from a strategic and long-term perspective, "rein in
at the brink of the precipice" and correct its erroneous decision
of attempting to table an anti-China draft resolution at the U.N.
Human Rights Commission Session, and return to the track of dialog.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the human rights issue, Tang and Holbrooke also
exchanged views on the Sino-U.S. relations and the reform of the U.
N.
</P>
<P>
China and the United States, both permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council, shoulder important responsibilities for
safeguarding international peace and security, and both occupy
decisive status in the U.N. affairs, Tang said. The maintenance of
sound and stable Sino-U.S. relations accords with the shared
interests of both sides, and will contribute to safeguarding the
international peace and security, and China is ready to strengthen
its cooperation with the U.S. within the U. N.

<TEXT>
<P>
Tang underlined that the Taiwan issue is China's internal
affairs, and said that an election was held in the Taiwan region,
and the Chinese mainland will listen to what the new leader in
Taiwan says and see how he acts.
</P>
<P>
The One-China principle is the basis and prerequisite for the
peaceful settlement of the Taiwan issue, Tang said. The U.S.
government is committed to following this principle, and adhering
to the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques, and not to supporting "
Taiwan's independence", or "two Chinas", or "one China, one Taiwan
", or Taiwan's membership in any international organizations where
statehood is required.
</P>
<P>
"China attaches great importance to these commitments, and pays
all the more attention to the actions to be taken by the U.S. side
to fulfill its commitments," Tang said. He expressed his hope
that the U.S. will be fully aware of the sensitivity and
complexity of the present situation, and deal with the Taiwan
issue prudently.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke noted that the Clinton Administration will work to
promote the steady growth of U.S.-China relations. He re-affirmed
the United States' one China principle, and expressed its
readiness to enhance consultations and cooperation with China in
the international arena, within the arena of the United Nations in
particular.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Wang Guangya also held
talks with Holbrooke on U.N. affairs and other related issues.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Officials Call for Reform of World Finance System (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Reform of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) is "absolutely necessary" for IMF to exercise
the great authority needed to prevent and resolve new crises in
the 21st century, according to a group of senior world finance and
central bank officials.
</P>
<P>
Reform of the world financial system with the IMF at the center
was one of the main topics in a series of meetings this spring,
including the Sixth Meeting of the Manila Framework Group, which
concluded in Hong Kong Monday.
</P>
<P>
The group with 14 member economies was set up in November 1997
after the eruption of the Asian financial crisis. It meets twice a
year to discuss issues affecting financial stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
In the two-day meeting, the group members exchanged views on
the recent efforts to streamline the IMF's financing facilities
and on the work to better involve the private sectors in crisis
prevention and resolution. They also discussed the need to review
the IMF's quota allocation in order to better reflect the economic
realities of the world today.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Vice Finance Minister for International Affairs
Haruhiko Kuroda said that greater attention should be paid to
large-scale and abrupt capital movements when conducting IMF
surveillance and formulating its programs.
</P>
<P>
Kuroda also said that the IMF's involvement should be limited
in structural policies that are directly linked to solving crises.
He suggested that emphasis should be put on enhancing IMF's
transparency and improving its decision making procedures.

<P>
It is clear that the IMF will have to maintain or even
strengthen its function as a kind of international "leader of last
resort" in certain cases such as a crisis caused by temporary
liquidity shortage, they said.
</P>
<P>
The officials believed that despite the fact that many Asian
countries have emerged as important economic powers over the past
50 years since the founding the IMF, the voting share and Board
representation of the Asian countries have been extremely limited.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, 37 percent of the voting power in the IMF
belongs to Executive Directors from Europe. Eight of the 24
Executive Directors come from Europe, and seven of these eight
represent a single economic union, they said.
</P>
<P>
"We believed that the member countries of the IMF urgently need
to consider the redistribution of quotas," Kuroda said.
</P>
<P>
The group also urged the continuation of the work to improve
the stability and functioning of the international financial
system, with continuing close cooperation between industrial
economies and emerging market economies.
</P>
<P>
They recognized the importance of monitoring and understanding
cross-border capital flows and the resulting stock positions. The
group called for greater cooperative efforts by individual
economies and the international financial institutions to improve
the frequency, timeliness and comprehensiveness of data releases.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. think tank East-West
Institute will present Ismail Cem, the Turkish foreign minister,
and George Papandreou, the Greek foreign minister, with the "
Statesman of the Year Award".
</P>
<P>
The awards ceremony will be held in New York on May 2, 2000, the
Anatolia News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The "Statesman of the Year Award" is given every year to
statesmen who greatly contribute to the construction of a united
and peaceful Europe.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece, the neighbors and team mates in NATO, have
been at odds over disputes on Cyprus and Aegean Sea, but the
bilateral ties have got warmer and warmer since both sides rushed
their aid to each other in last year's devastating earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here attributed the rapprochement to the efforts by
both foreign ministers, hailing Cem and Papandereou as architects
of the closer relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers exchanged visits to each other's
country this year, boosting bilateral cooperation in many fields
but avoiding touching on the sensitive hard-core disputes at the
improper time.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Cem and Papandreou would proceed to
Washington, D.C. together to meet the U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, following the awards ceremony.

<HEADLINE> Israel Hands Over More West Bank Land to Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEITUNIA, West Bank, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Israel is carrying out
a long-overdue troops withdrawal from 6.1 percent of the West Bank
on Tuesday as the Israeli-Palestinian talks aimed at reaching a
permanent peace treaty are to resume in Washington.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony held at an army base near this newly transferred
town southwest of the West Bank city of Ramallah, Israeli army
officers gave Palestinian security officers copies of the maps
outlining the area being transferred before they toured the area in
jeeps to inspect the new boundaries.
</P>
<P>
Similar ceremonies were to be staged later Tuesday near the West
Bank cities of Hebron and Nablus.
</P>
<P>
After the handover, 5.1 percent from joint control to full
Palestinian control and 1 percent from full Israeli control to
total Palestinian control, the Palestinians will have full or
partial control over 40 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's withdrawal, the last of a three-stage redeployment
stipulated in the Sharm el Sheikh memorandum signed last September,
was originally scheduled for January 20, but a dispute over the
areas included has delayed its implementation.
</P>
<P>
At the heart of the dispute was Israel's refusal to accept the
Palestinians' demand that the third redeployment include Arab
villages abutting Jerusalem, claimed by both sides as their
capital. To break a five-week deadlock, Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak had once agreed to handover the Anata village bordering
Jerusalem, but abandoned his plan at last moment bowing to right-
wing pressures.
</P>
<P>
The latest withdrawal came just hours after two separate
shooting incidents Monday night in which a Palestinian woman was
killed and her husband and three Israelis were injured in the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Israelis were wounded, one of them seriously, after gunmen
in a car opened fire at their van while they were on their way to
deliver holiday gifts to Israeli soldiers near Hebron for the
Jewish festival of Purim.
</P>
<P>
Israeli soldiers set up roadblocks following the attack, and
later opened fire on a Palestinian car, killing the Palestinian
woman and seriously injuring her husband. The Israeli army said
Tuesday that the soldiers opened fire after the driver tried to run
over one of the soldiers at the checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal also coincided with the resumption of the
Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations in Washington on Tuesday
over final-status issues such as the fate of Jerusalem, Jewish
settlements and Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which are expected to last 10 days, were aimed at
reaching a framework agreement on these issues by May and a final
detailed peace treaty by September.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Well Placed to Face Globalization  Challenges: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is well placed in
meeting the challenges of globalization, its Foreign Minister Syed
Hamid Albar said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia, with a government strong enough to stand up for what
is right and good for the country, has a clear set of foreign
policy objectives and priorities in pursuing the aspirations of
the people, the minister said at a dialogue organized by the
Institute for Development Studies (IDS) in Kota Kinabalu, Sabah
state, east Malaysia, according to Bernama news agency.
</P>
<P>
He was confident that Malaysia's effort may not be totally
successful, but the negative impact of globalization on Malaysia
could be minimized.
</P>
<P>
"The challenge before us is to harness the best out of
globalization while removing or minimizing the negative aspect.
Our objective is to ensure Malaysia's interest is not marginalized
as the process of globalization moves forward," Bernama quoted him
as saying in his talk entitled "International Relations in the Era
of Globalization".
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid said that in the context of international relations,
a number of approaches, initiatives and strategies had been put in
place such as continuing to be vocal at the regional and
international fora on vital issues "even if ours is the only voice.
"
</P>
<P>
He stressed "We also need to promote a united stand among
developing countries on issues of common concern and hope that
such a stand, especially at the United Nations and the World Trade
Organization, would prevent western powers from forcing the
acceptance of their agenda upon the developing countries."
</P>
<P>
As the sheer force of globalization is beyond the ability of
any one agency to handle, he said "the collective effort of the
entire nation is needed...globalization has made it imperative
that we all work together as no single issue can be seen in
isolation anymore."
</P>
<P>
He warned that the country should also be wary of the tactics
of developed countries which utilize non-trade issues like workers
' rights to undermine the competitiveness of developing countries.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Foreign Minister Abdul
Sattar Tuesday expressed his confidence that U.S. President Bill
Clinton's visit to India and Pakistan would help in opening a new
door to peaceful settlement of the long-standing Kashmir dispute.
</P>
<P>
Sattar said Clinton has demonstrated "unique qualities" of
persuasion and bringing parties to dispute together and hoped that
he would contribute towards beginning of efforts for a peaceful
solution of the Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister make these remarks while delivering a talk
on peace and security in South Asia at a function here.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Indian opposition to the third-party mediation,
Sattar said, "if there is a threat to the maintenance of
international peace and security, then members of the United
Nations have an obligation (to mediate)."
</P>
<P>
He mentioned that the U.N. Charter calls for use of various
peaceful means for the settlement of disputes including bilateral
negotiations, inquiry, conciliation, mediation, arbitration and
adjudication.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has long been expecting the mediation of President
Clinton, who is on his tour to India and is scheduled to visit
Pakistan later this week, to solve the thorny Kashmir dispute in
the means of plebiscite by Kashmiries.
</P>
<P>
However, India, who claims Kashmir as an "integral" part of it,
has precluded the possibility of any third-party interference in
the dispute.
</P>
<P>
Turning to Pak-U.S. relations, Sattar said his country enjoys a
good history of "friendly and fair relations" with the superpower
and would like to see them growing.
</P>
<P>
He said the Kashmir issue will remain high on the agenda during
Clinton's visit to Islamabad, however, other issues such as
terrorism, nuclear issue and democracy will also be under
discussion.

"We will never hold any negotiations with any people or party
that advocate Taiwan independence," Zhu said during a meeting with
visiting Congolese President Denis Sassau-nguesso.
</P>
<P>
Zhu noted that Chinese President Jiang Zemin stated on Monday
that whoever comes to power in Taiwan is welcome to visit the
mainland for talks. However, there should be a basis for dialogues
and negotiations across the Taiwan Straits, namely, the one China
principle must first be recognized, and under this prerequisite,
everything can be discussed.
</P>
<P>
"This is our bottom line,"Zhu said, adding that the central
government's consistent policy on the Taiwan issue is peaceful
reunification and one country, two systems.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that dramatic changes have taken place in China since
the Congolese president first visited China in 1987.
</P>
<P>
Zhu referred to the talks between the two presidents yesterday
as fruitful, and said that the visit of the president has been a
success as the two countries have signed many agreements on
economy and culture.

<HEADLINE> China to Focus Drug-control Efforts on Curbing Narcotics Inflow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, March 21 (Xinhua) -- China will strive to curb
narcotics inflow across the border in its drug control efforts, a
senior police officer said here today.
</P>
<P>
Chinese police has been alarmed by increasing manufacturing and
trafficking of drugs across the border, especially from the Golden
Triangle facing Southwest China, said Yang Fengrui, director of
the drug-control department of the Ministry of Public Security.
</P>
<P>
He warned that China cannot resolve the problem of drug
trafficking unless the foreign sources of drugs are blocked.
</P>
<P>
Chinese police uncovered 64,000 drug-related cases and captured
a total of 5.3 tons of heroin in 1999, the police officer told a
national conference on drug control that opened here today.
</P>
<P>
The police found that all the 3.5 tons of heroin involved in 60
major cases was smuggled into Southwest China from the Golden
Triangle between Laos, Myanmar and Thailand, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China also faces an increasing threat from the
Golden Crescent area in Central Asia, which has become the world's
largest producer of opium -- in 1999, the area turned out 4,600
tons of opium, the police officer said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wants Strong Partnership With India: Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Clinton, the first U.S. President to visit India in the past 22
years, made the remarks during a meeting with the press following
two hours of talks with Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
here on Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also announced that during the talks he extended an
invitation to Vajpayee to visit Washington and the prime minister
accepted it.
</P>
<P>
"Prime Minister Vajpayee has accepted my invitation to visit
the United States later this year," Clinton told the reporters.
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure as a result of this visit and as a result of
discussions, a new chapter is being added into our bilateral
relations," the Indian prime minister said at the post-summit
joint press conference.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to a "Vision Statement" on the future of
the Indo-U.S. relations in the new millennium signed by Clinton
and Vajpayee on Tuesday after their talks, India and the United
States have agreed on a number of steps to intensify and
institutionalize the dialogue between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister of India and the President of the United
States will hold regular bilateral summits in alternating capitals
or elsewhere, including on the occasions of multilateral meetings,
to review the bilateral relations and consult on international
development and issues, said the statement, adding that the two
leaders will also remain in "frequent contact" on telephone and
through letters.
</P>
<P>
The two countries will also hold an Annual Foreign Policy
Dialogue at the level of India's External Affairs Minister and the
U.S. Secretary of State, and make the ongoing Dialogue on Security
and Non-proliferation continue, said the document.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the existing Foreign Office
Consultations between India's Foreign Secretary and the U.S.
Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs will continue, while
a Dialogue on Asian Security will also be conducted as part of the
Foreign Office Consultations.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of both countries expressed satisfaction at the
establishment of the Joint Working Group on Counter-terrorism and
its productive first meeting in February this year and agreed that
the group should continue to meet regularly, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to institutionalize bilateral economic dialogue
between the two countries, the statement said, leaders of both
countries have decided to set up an Indo-U.S. Financial and
Economic Forum, start an Indo-U.S. Commercial Dialogue and
establish an Indo-U.S. Working Group on Trade. Meanwhile, a high-
level Co-ordinating Group will also be set up to help promote the
bilateral economic dialogue between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have also agreed to set up a Joint Consultative
Group on Clean Energy and Environment and an Indo-U.S. Science and
Technology Forum, the statement added.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Optimistic About Progress on CTBT Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I am quite optimistic that we will make some progress," said
Clinton while meeting the press with Indian Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee following two hours of summit talks here on
Tuesday morning." I hope we will wind up in a common position."
</P>
<P>
Implying his discussion with Vajpayee on the CTBT issue was a
quite difficult one, Clinton described the talks as "frank and
candid" and noted that Vajpayee was "very honest" in the dialogue.
</P>
<P>
"There is a possibility that we can reach a common ground on
banning fissile material and nuclear export controls," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he conceded that the CTBT issue is a contentious issue
and expressed the hope that the democratic process in India would
help in the treaty's ratification just as it would in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Since India conducted nuclear tests in early 1998, the United
States and many other countries across the world have repeatedly
urged New Delhi to sign the CTBT at an early date. The latter,
however, has always said that it would not yield to any pressure
and sign the treaty without a national consensus.

<P>
NEW DELHI, March 21 (Xinhua) -- India and the United States
said Tuesday that they share a commitment to reducing and
ultimately eliminating nuclear weapons, but they have not always
agreed on how to reach this common goal.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement issued here by Indian Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee and U.S. President Bill Clinton said that the
United States believes India should forgo nuclear weapons, but
India believes that it needs to maintain a credible minimum
nuclear deterrent in keeping with its own assessment of its
security needs.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the statement said that India and the United
States are prepared to work together to prevent the proliferation
of nuclear weapons and their means of delivery.
</P>
<P>
To this end, the two countries will persist with and build upon
the productive bilateral dialogue already under way, it added.
</P>
<P>
The statement indicated that the two countries reaffirmed their
respective voluntary commitment to forgo further nuclear explosive
tests.
</P>
<P>
"We will work together and with others for an early
commencement of negotiations on a treaty to end the production of
fissile materials for nuclear weapons, " it continued. " We have
both shown strong commitment to export controls, and will continue
to strengthen them."
</P>
<P>
The two countries will seek to narrow their differences and
increase mutual understanding on non-proliferation and security
issues, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"This will help us to realize the full potential of Indo-U.S.
relations and contribute significantly to regional and global
security," the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Urged to Introduce Kiswahili Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Vice President
Omar Ali Juma has urged the educational institutions to make its
national language Kiswahili the medium of instruction at all
levels of education, the Guardian newspaper reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony of a four-day international
workshop on Kiswahili held at the University of Dar es Salaam on
Monday, Juma said institutions at all levels should commit
themselves to the task of developing the language to prepare
terminology, textbooks and experts to achieve the goal of making
it the medium of instruction in the education system in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
He urged Kiswahili experts to look the language issue at its
broader context because the "growth of a language anywhere in the
world depends on several key issues."
</P>
<P>
These include the economy, politics, culture, the importance of
the language to the community concerned, the educational system
and how that language is taught and used, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said they also include the availability of books and the
financial capacity of the people to buy the books and the
prevailing international environment.
</P>
<P>
However, the vice president cautioned that the switch-over to
Kiswahili does not mean the rejection of the teaching of English,
which is the primary language of commerce, administration and high
education in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
English should be taught expertly and be used where they are
needed, he said.
</P>
<P>
Although Kiswahili and English are both official languages in
Tanzania, the government has been making deliberate efforts to
promote Kiswahili, a language which is most popular in people's
daily life and helped bring the land into unification.
</P>
<P>
Originated in Zanzibar and nearby coastal Tanzania, Kiswahili
is also the most widely spoken language in East Africa.

ADDIS ABABA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The bee industry, a major
foreign currency earner for Ethiopia, has suffered a lot from
raging bush fires in the south of the country, the Monitor
newspaper reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
More than 13,000 beehives have been burnt and the livelihoods
of many honey farmers have been ruined by the one month-old fires
in the Bale and Borena regions, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest report, forest fires in the Bale
region, about 400 kilometers south of the capital Addis Ababa,
have almost been brought under control after weeks of efforts to
snuff it out.
</P>
<P>
However, the bee industry in the region, among others, might be
 seriously affected for a period of time because the local ecology
has been devastated, environmentalists said.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia, which ranks the 10th biggest honey producer in the
world, is a major producer of beeswax, next only to Mexico and
China.

prepared by the Select Committee on Corruption of Kenya's
Parliament and the Anti- Corruption Authority will be taken to
Parliament for debate and adoption before July this year, the
Daily Nation newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the list of corruption people, the newspaper
said, the Parliament will be given a list of public resources
they have acquired illegally, and the strategies to list the lost
resources and restore their ownership to the state.
</P>
<P>
The undertakings by 15-member select committee were made Monday
at a two- day seminar opened in the capital Nairobi before the
head of Public Service Richard Leakey, the World Bank resident
representative Harold Wackman and other officials.
</P>
<P>
The committee will also recommend what punishment the corrupt
people should face and outline ways to seal the loopholes through
which they have looted public resources.
</P>
<P>
The plan to name and shame corrupt people announced by the
committee is a follow-up to a decision to set up a special court
to deal with corruption cases, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Three weeks ago, the Kenyan government stated that corruption
in corridors of power was one of the leading cause of poverty in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Corruption has undermined investors' confidence and increased
the cost of doing business in Kenya, said the government-drafted
poverty eradication paper which was released on March 8.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, Leakey warned that his government would continue
to stamp out all corrupt and lax civil servants.
</P>
<P>
Due to rampant corruption and poor governance, the
International Monetary Fund suspended its 205-million-U.S. dollar
loan to Kenya in July 1997, contributing to the slowdown of the
country's economic growth.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Ambassador Defends Government Banning of Falun Gong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Ambassador Qiao Zonghuai gave a
news briefing here Tuesday on China's banning of the cult Falun
Gong.
</P>
<P>
"Falun Gong is a typical cult that harms the society," Qiao
said in an opening statement. "The anti-humanity, anti-society and
anti-science words and deeds of the cult's founder Li Hongzhi have
already caused serious damages to society."
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years in some parts of China, more than 1,400
people have died as a result of practicing Falun Gong and many
others have suffered psychological distress, he said.
</P>
<P>
At the strong appeal of the people, the Chinese government,
strictly in accordance with the law, decided to outlaw the "
Research Society of Falun Dafa" and the evil cult under the
illegal organization's control.
</P>
<P>
"The banning of Falun Gong by the Chinese government not only
complies with the international human rights instruments but also
follows the common practice of all other governments in the world
regarding cults," Qiao told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the briefing also watched a video show exposing
the true face of the Falun Gong cult.

BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji said
here today that any form of Taiwan independence will never be
allowed.
</P>
<P>
"We will never hold any negotiations with any people and party
that advocate Taiwan Independence," Zhu said during his meeting
with visiting Congolese President Denis Sassau-nguesso.
</P>
<P>
Zhu noted that Chinese President Jiang Zemin stated on Monday
that whoever comes to power in Taiwan is welcome to the mainland
for talks. However, there should be a basis for dialogues and
negotiations across the Taiwan Straits, namely, the one China
principle must first be recognized, and under this prerequisite,
everything can be discussed.

<HEADLINE> Accidents Become Top Killer of Children in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Traffic accidents, drowning and
other mishaps have replaced infectious diseases and malnutrition
as top killer of Chinese children under 14, according to a
research.
</P>
<P>
While infants are vulnerable to suffocation, children aged one
to four are mostly victims of drowning and kids of 5 to 14 years
old are prone to traffic accidents, said Professor Ding Zongyi,
director for the research of accidental injuries of children at
Beijing Paediatric Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
Traffic accidents were the leading cause of death for urban
children, and youngsters in rural areas were more often killed in
drowning, said Prof. Ding.
</P>
<P>
Other accidents that result in injuries and deaths include
poisoning, burn and scald, falling, animal bite, suicide and
homicide. Although national statistics are not available, Prof.
Ding said the number of such cases was growing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
"Infectious diseases and malnutrition among children have been
under control along with great improvement of living standards,"
he said. "At the same time, accidents are increasingly threatening
the health and lives of kids."
</P>
<P>
He attributed the growing rate of youngster tragedies to
carelessness of parents, inadequate education in safety awareness,
and insufficient first-aid service.
</P>
<P>
"In order to avoid tragedies, adults should be aware of their
responsibilities, and safety education targeting at the public
should be enhanced," he suggested.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Turkish newspapers on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sabah (Morning):
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit, who will pay an
official visit to India at the end of March, rejected Pakistan's
invitation, saying that his visit to Pakistan might be understood
as a support to General Pervez Musharraf, the leader of the
military administration in Pakistan who came to power with a
military coup.
</P>
<P>
In an earlier statement, Ecevit asked General Musharraf not to
execute ousted Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National):
</P>
<P>
-- The Ankara State Security Court sentenced on Monday Bayram
Ali Bayramoglu, the chairman of Independent Industrialists' and
Businessmen's Association to one year in prison, and fined him 1.5
million Turkish liras on charges of inciting people to hatred and
enmity by discriminating religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
The court has adjourned Bayramoglu's sentence because he has no
previous convictions.
</P>
<P>
Cumhuriyet (Republic):
</P>
<P>
-- Sadettin Tantan, the Turkish minister of interior, said on
Monday that Nevruz was a celebration that existed since the
existence of Turkish nation, adding that "nobody can ban the
festival."
</P>
<P>
Earlier it was reported that the authority would limit the
celebration of Nevruz, which has a history of 5,000 years and is
popular for Turkish of Kurdish origin.
</P>
<P>
A crisis center has been set up in Istanbul under the
chairmanship of Istanbul Governor Erol Cakir because of Nevruz
celebrations while leaves of all security officials were lifted.

<HEADLINE> Closer U.S.-Iran Ties Not to Hurt Turkey: Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Efforts by the U.S. administration
to forge closer ties with Iran will not be at the expense of
Turkey's interests, said an Ankara-based U.S. diplomat.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Turkish Daily News on Monday, U.S.
Ambassador to Ankara Mark Parris categorically denied that the
latest message which Washington sent to Iran for closer ties means
that Washington has turned its back on the Baku-Ceyhan and trans-
Caspian pipelines.
</P>
<P>
Washington remains committed to the implementation of these two
projects, which were launched on the sidelines of the Istanbul
summit of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE), said the ambassador.
</P>
<P>
U.S. support for the two projects, which are believed to turn
Turkey into a major strategic energy export route, will stand firm
because the Clinton administration regards them as "the best way of
moving Caspian energy to export markets in a reliable and
commercially viable manner," said the senior diplomat.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to inform all the interested parties in the
region that we have invested valuable time and energy on these two
projects and that we will make the maximum effort to see they are
finalized," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the latest move by Washington to lift an import
ban on Iranian luxury goods should be taken seriously as an effort
to enhance its ties with Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, diplomatic sources here said that it will take a long
time for the United States to improve its ties with Iran and this
will save time for the implementation of the two projects.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. won't be looking at any other options in the
foreseeable future," the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. showed great interest in thawing its chilly ties with
Tehran soon after reformist Iranian President Mohammad Khatami came
to power in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The interest was further fueled when reformists, main supporters
of Khatami, trounced the hard liners in recent Iranian
parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
This recent sign in rapprochement has sparked speculation that
once Iran and the United States forge closer ties, Washington would
lose interest in the Baku-Ceyhan and trans-Caspian projects,
preferring to move Caspian energy through Iran.
</P>
<P>
However, diplomatic observers here said Iranian hardliners are
still strong and in control of key decision-making mechanisms, and
thus would always block closer Iran-U.S. relations.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Military Uneasy Over Thorny Issues With Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish military is
increasingly impatient about the little progress in dialogue
between Greece and Turkey on the deep-rooted issue of sovereignty
rights in the Aegean Sea, Turkish Daily News reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Armed Forces (TSK) is unhappy about the fact that
the Greek side has so far failed to initiate a dialogue on basic
military and security issues in spite of a political rapprochement
between the two NATO allies, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Senior Turkish military officers recently lodged complaints to
the United States, which has on one hand put pressure on both
countries for a peaceful settlement of their disputes, and on the
other hand has been arming both Ankara and Athens under the pretext
of balancing the military might of the two rival Aegean neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The TSK has also warned Washington that a new tension between
Turkey and Greece may be brewing because the risk of dog fights
between fighter jets coming from opposite directions in the Aegean
airspace is on the rise. Pilots might open fire out of
miscalculation of the other side's intentions.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, locked in disputes over the Aegean Sea and
Cyprus, cashed in on the mutual sympathy produced by devastating
earthquakes in their two countries last summer in a process dubbed
earthquake diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
The rapprochement was furthered when Greek Foreign Minister
George Papandreou and his Turkish counterpart Ismail Cem exchanged
visits to each other's country early this year. Nine agreements
were signed between the two countries in areas such as tourism,
trade and counter-terrorism.
</P>
<P>
However, the thorny issues that have fundamentally marred the
relations between the two neighbors were not touched on.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that Athens will not make any initiative
before the April 9 elections in Greece and the Turkish side will
accordingly adopt a wait-and-see attitude.

HONOLULU, Hawaii, March 20 (Xinhua) -- There is only one China

Taiwan will be reunified eventually. He said he is confident in

mainland.
</P>
<P>
Jorge Gonzalez from Chile said the Taiwan issue is an internal
affair of China. No one should interfere in other country's
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
He added that China has a long history and splendid culture. It
will find ways to solve its own problems through its own way. Hong
Kong and Macao are good examples.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Denies Discriminatory Practices Against Foreign Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 21 (Xinhua) -- South Korea Tuesday denied foreign
claims that its domestic car market is closed to foreign auto.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean Foreign Affairs and Trade Ministry said in a
statement that the imbalance in auto trade has been caused by
market conditions, not because its domestic market has been closed
to foreign cars.
</P>
<P>
The ministry denied discriminatory practices against foreign
cars, including a special tax probe on those who drive imported
cars.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the Korea Automobile Manufacturers'
Association told a press conference that the sluggish sale of
foreign cars in South Korea should not be taken as an excuse to
criticize the country.
</P>
<P>
Foreign auto makers should do more if they want to increase
sales in South Korea, including enhancing price competitiveness,
improving quality and service and apply more advertising, said the
association.
</P>
<P>
It predicted that South Korea will import some 6,000 foreign
cars this year, up 150 percent from last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Australia asks the Court of
Arbitration for Sport (CAS) to rule on swimming's new bodysuits
before advising their competitors to wear them at the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
AOC secretary-general Craig McLatchey said Australia wanted the
CAS to approve the use of the suits even though swimming's world
governing body FINA had already cleared them.
</P>
<P>
Speedo unveiled the "Fastskin" bodysuit at the world short-
course championships last week. Designed to mimic shark skin, they
are said to improve race times by up to three per cent.
</P>
<P>
McLatchey said Australia was concerned that a swimmer wearing a
bodysuit could be stripped of an Olympic medal because another
competitor protested to the CAS, which adjudicates on Olympic
appeals.
</P>
<P>
"We're not challenging (FINA's) rules, we're simply asking
whether there is the proper process to ensure that those rules are
adhered to," McLatchey said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Foreign Minister Meets Holbrooke (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- If the U.S. side is bent on
confrontation, China will oblige it and fight to the finish, and
this practice of the U.S. side to go against the tide of history
cannot attain the support of the vast majority of member nations
of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan made the remarks here
today during his meeting with Richard Holbrooke, the permanent
representative of the United States to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Tang and Holbrooke exchanged views on the
issues concerning Sino-U.S. relations and the reform of the United
Nations and the human rights issue.
</P>
<P>
China and the United States, both permanent members of the
United Nations (U.N.) Security Council, shoulder important
responsibilities for safeguarding international peace and security,
and both occupy decisive status in the U.N. affairs, Tang said.
The maintenance of sound and stable Sino-U.S. relations accords
with the shared interests of both sides, and will contribute to
safeguarding the international peace and security, and China is
ready to strengthen its cooperation with the U.S. within the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Tang underlined that the Taiwan issue is China's internal
affair, and said that an election was held in the Taiwan region,
and the Chinese mainland will listen to what the new leader in
Taiwan says and see how he acts.
</P>
<P>
The one-China principle is the basis and prerequisite for the
peaceful settlement of Taiwan issue, Tang said. the U.S.
government is committed to following this principle, and adhering
to the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques, and not to supporting "
Taiwan's independence", or "two Chinas", or "one China, one Taiwan
", or Taiwan's membership in any international organizations where
statehood is required.
</P>
<P>
"China attaches great importance to these commitments, and pays
all the more attention to the actions to be taken by the U.S. side
to fulfill its commitments," Tang said, and added he hopes that
the U.S. will be fully aware of the sensitivity and complexity of
the present situation, and deal with the Taiwan issue prudently.

<P>
The Chinese people have never been afraid of any bluffs and
pressure, including those on the human rights issue, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that differences between the two countries on this issue
should be resolved through dialog on the basis of equality and
mutual respect, Tang said the U.S. side should deal with the
differences from a strategic and long-term perspective, "rein in
at the brink of the precipice" and correct its erroneous decision
of attempting to table an anti-China draft resolution at the U.N.
human rights conference, and return to the track of dialog.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke noted that the Clinton Administration will work to
promote the steady growth of U.S.-China relations. He re-affirmed
the United States' one China principle, and expressed its
readiness to enhance consultations and cooperation with China in
the international arena, within the arena of the United Nations in
particular.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Wang Guangya also held
talks with Holbrooke on U.N. affairs and other related issues.

<P>
The Chinese side is seriously concerned about such a move (the
reported plan for such a visit) motivated by a small group of anti-
China forces in Japan, said Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side sincerely hopes that the Japanese government
would strictly abide by its commitments on the Taiwan issue, pay
close attention to the matter, and properly deal with it, Sun said.
</P>
<P>
Sun today also urged the United States to strictly follow the
commitments it has made on the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
China demands that the U.S. cautiously handle the Taiwan issue
and take practical measures to follow its "One China" stance, the
principles set forth in the three joint communiques, and the three
"nos" commitment it has already made, Sun said.
</P>
<P>
Sun Yuxi said that any attempt to interfere in China's internal
affairs under the name of human rights is doomed to failure.
</P>
<P>
Sun also warned today that any attempt to interfere in China's
internal affairs under the name of human rights is doomed to
failure.
</P>
<P>
He made this remark in response to a question about reports
that the U.S. expects to get its resolution on China's human
rights into debate at the UN Human Rights Commission Session in
Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Sun said the Chinese government has made great efforts to
protect human rights, and China's human rights condition is at an
unprecedented high level right now.
</P>
<P>
China advocates dialogue and opposes confrontation on this
issue in the international arena, however, if there's any
confrontational action taken against China this time in Geneva,
China would fight it to the end, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Sun also spoke about the visits to China by Paek Nam Sun,
foreign affairs minister of the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea (DPRK), and Richard Holbrooke, permanent representative of
the United States to the United Nations (UN), at today's press
conference.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, French Specialists Discuss Nuclear Power Technologies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and French specialists
discussed new trends in the nuclear power industry and future
cooperation between China and France at an international symposium
here today.
</P>
<P>
The symposium on French nuclear technologies, sponsored by the
French Atomic Energy Commission, attracted more than 300
participants from China, France and other countries.
</P>
<P>
Engineers from three giants in the industry, Electricite de
France (EDF), Cogema and Framatome, discussed with their Chinese
counterparts design, construction and operation of nuclear power
plants, reactors and shielding system.
</P>
<P>
They also offered a number of technological advices to Chinese
companies.
</P>
<P>
France has been developing power plants for at least 100 years,
and latest statistics show that 82 percent of its current
electricity consumption comes from nuclear power plants.
</P>
<P>
Michel Vasseneix from EDF, which has been helping China to
initiate a new development program since 1997, showed EDF's plan
for future nuclear plants in China.
</P>
<P>
Several Cogema technicians discussed technologies on final
processing and recycling of nuclear fuel with the Chinese experts.
Cogema leads others internationally on uranium exploration and
production.
</P>
<P>
As an important technology provider for China, Framatome has
been in cooperation with Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant, Qinshan
Nuclear Power Plant, Ling'ao Nuclear Power Plant and Qinghua
University for several years.
</P>
<P>
Many world-renowned nuclear enterprises show their interest in
China's plan on nuclear power development. Businesses in 14
countries including France, Germany and the United States are
participating in an ongoing international nuclear exhibition in
Beijing.

<HEADLINE> Israel Withdraws Troops From More Land of West Bank  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Israel on Tuesday began to transfer
another 6.1 percent of the West Bank territory to the Palestinians,
which would complete the three-phase land transfer under interim
peace accords.
</P>
<P>
A ceremony was held at Beitounia, one of the areas being handed
over to the Palestinians, to mark the start of the transfer, said a
report reaching here. Similar ceremonies were to take place near
the West Bank cities of Hebron and Nablus.
</P>
<P>
The transfer will expand the Palestinian-controled West Bank
territories to about 41 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
About 5.1 percent of the West Bank being transferred had been
under Palestinian civil rule and Israeli security control, and one
percent had been under full Israeli control. Now, all these land
will be going to full Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
Under the Sharm el Sheikh memorandum signed by Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat last
September, the third stage of the Israeli redeployment in 6.1
percent of the West Bank should be completed by January 20.
However, it was postponed mainly due to the sharp differences over
which areas must be included. The Palestinians want more populated
areas especially those near Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The land dispute also led to the month-long deadlock in Israeli-
Palestinian peace talks and caused the two sides to miss a February
13 deadline for a framework agreement on a permanent peace.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, Israel's security cabinet narrowly approved a
heavily revised withdrawal map that did not include the Arab
village of Anata on the fringe of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who rejected previous Israeli
pullback proposals and insisted he be given more populated areas
near Jerusalem, accepted the new map.
</P>
<P>
The areas being handed over to the Palestinians include villages
near the towns of Jenin, Ramallah, Hebron, Bethlehem, Tulkarm and
Qalqilia.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Egyptian newspapers on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian experts are expected to complete by the end of this
month the refurbishment of Lebanon's "Dermbouh" power plant, 40
percent of which was destroyed by Israeli air raids on February 8.

Works to renew and renovate the second power station, 60 percent of
which was damaged by the airstrikes, are about to come to an end.
And it is expected to go full operation in mid-April. And the
Egyptian side will install as a whole the third power plant which
was rendered to ruins.
</P>
<P>
Al Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian Assistant Foreign Minister for Asian Affairs Negui
el-Ghatrifi will leave for the South Korean capital Seoul on April
6 to co-chair a meeting of the Egyptian-Korean committee which will
discuss bilateral political, economic and trade relations.
</P>
<P>
Al Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
-- The European Union has agreed to grant Egypt 7 million
Egyptian pounds (2 million U.S. dollars) to finance a project to
combat brown rot in potatoes. The project is aimed to ebb the rot
disease from 4 percent to 2 percent by 2004, said Agriculture
Minister Youssef Wali.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Gazette:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said there was a good
chance of making peace in the Middle East despite ups and downs in
the peace negotiations, especially on the Palestinian and Syrian
tracks.
</P>
<P>
He told the Egyptian and Arab communities in California Monday
that the region should be ready for post-peace challenges, adding
that every possible effort was being made to ensure that the
current negotiations produced comprehensive and just peace.

<P>
JERUSALEM, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians aimed at
laying the groundwork for a final peace treaty by September are to
resume in Washington Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The talks are expected to last roughly 10 days. The Israeli
delegation will be led by chief negotiator Oded Eran, while his
Palestinian counterpart Yasser Abed Rabbo was due to arrive with
top negotiator Saeb Erekat.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross said the negotiators have to do
this in a way that is basically out of limelight, that allows them
to do some serious brainstorming, and that's not something you do
at the leader level.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Further clarifications made Monday by the ultra-Orthodox Shas
party's spiritual leader Rabbi Ovadia Yosef were rejected by Meretz
leader Education Minister Yossi Sarid, making an end to the crisis
between his party and Shas unlikely.
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Yosef drew an analogy between Sarid and Haman, the villain
in this week's upcoming Jewish Purim holiday and stated that his
name should be wiped out of the world in his weekly Saturday night
address carried over local radio.
</P>
<P>
Intensive meetings were held Monday between Prime Minister Ehud
Barak's One Israel coalition, the prime minister's office and Shas
in an effort to extricate a public apology from Yosef.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. administration sources expected that next week's summit
between President Bill Clinton and Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
will result in a renewal of Israel-Syrian peace talks a few days
later.
</P>
<P>
A new round of peace negotiations between Israel and Syria, the
Americans hope, might produce a peace agreement within a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Syrian presidents will meet in Geneva next Sunday.
Clinton will stop in Switzerland on his way back to Washington from
India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Three Israelis were injured Monday night in a shooting attack
near the Tarqumiya checkpoint west of Hebron. One of the victims
was seriously wounded, while the other two suffered light injuries.
</P>
<P>
The shooting incident coincides with the signing of the maps of
the third-stage of the second West Bank redeployment between
Israeli officials and the Palestinian National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
The three victims were on their way to distribute the Jewish
Purim holiday's gifts to Israel Defense Forces troops at Tarqumiya.
It appears that the shooter fled into PNA territory.

<HEADLINE> No Threat of War in South Asia: Vajpayee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"There are differences. There have been clashes. There is a
problem of cross-country terrorism. Innocent people are being
killed. But there is no threat of any war," said Vajpayee in a
meeting with the press following two hours of talks with visiting
U.S. President Bill Clinton here on Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that India is committed to peaceful
means to solve all problems and discuss them on the table.
</P>
<P>
"We do not think in terms of war and nobody should think in
those terms in the subcontinent," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Asked about Clinton's earlier description of South Asia as the
"most dangerous place" in the world today, Vajpayee said he is
confident that Clinton would change his view when he completes his
South Asia tour.
</P>
<P>
"Situation is not so bad as it is made out to be," he noted.
</P>
<P>
During their joint meeting of the press, both Vajpayee and
Clinton condemned the killing of 35 Sikhs in Kashmir by militants
on Monday night as a "brutal massacre" and an "outrage," and
called for the ending of violence against innocent civilians.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Vajpayee expressed the hope that Clinton would bring
up the issue of cross-border terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir with
Pakistani leaders during his visit to Islamabad on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"I hope this question will be discussed by the President in
Islamabad," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Military (TNI)
will stick to its reform commitment and has found a new paradigm
to adjust to global developments, a senior TNI official said here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We are committed to continue our internal reform agenda, "
Territorial Chief of Staff Let. Gen. Agus Widjojo told
participants of the national conference on the Building of New
Indonesia at the National Resilience Institute.
</P>
<P>
Widjojo said that the TNI will focus on its task of
safeguarding national defense system to challenge threats from
external forces.
</P>
<P>
"The TNI has done its best to make changes both structurally
and culturally. And such a move will never stop as the TNI
realized that reform constitutes a process and takes time,"
Widjojo added.
</P>
<P>
The TNI's role in the future cannot be separated from global
strategic changes, he said, "so, the TNI will not stop its efforts
to make redefinition, reposition, and reactualization of it's role
in the future. All of that is a response, and answer as well, to
the new developments and changes which have been taking place (
both at home and overseas)."

<P>
NEW DELHI, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. President Bill
Clinton said here on Tuesday that he felt optimistic about India
and the United States making some progress and winding up in a
common position on the issue of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty
(CTBT).
</P>
<P>
"I am quite optimistic that we will make some progress," said
Clinton while meeting the press with Indian Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee following two hours of summit talks here on
Tuesday morning. "I hope we will wind up in a common position."
</P>
<P>
Implying his discussion with Vajpayee on the CTBT issue was a
quite difficult one, Clinton described the talks as "frank and
candid" and noted that Vajpayee was "very honest" in the dialogue.
</P>
<P>
"There is a possibility that we can reach a common ground on
banning fissile material and nuclear export controls," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he conceded that the CTBT issue was a contentious
issue and expressed the hope that the democratic process in India
would help in the treaty's ratification just as it would in the
United States.

<HEADLINE> Security Tightened in Chechnya Ahead of Sunday Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Russian troops continued their
assaults on Chechen rebels Monday in the southern mountains and
stepped up security in areas under their control in the run-up to
Sunday's presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
A Russian flag was hoisted over Komsomolskoye Monday night, an
indication that the village, which has witnessed some of the
fiercest fighting over the past two weeks, was now under full
control of federal forces.
</P>
<P>
A mopping-up operation has ended in the Chechen village, which
is located about 4 kilometers from the strategically important
Argun gorge, the Interfax news agency reported, citing the federal
military headquarters in the North Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
Some 500 to 600 separatists were killed in the two-week battle
in Komsomolskoye where rebels under Chechen Commander Ruslan
Gelayev tried in vain to break through a federal siege.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 Russian servicemen were killed and over 300
wounded in the village, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
Although much of the breakaway republic is now under federal
control, the main rebel ringleaders remain at large.
</P>
<P>
Chechen president Aslan Maskhadov and field commanders Shamil
Basayev and Khattab are believed to be in the southern areas of
the Argun gorge, but their precise whereabouts are unknown.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest estimate by the Russian military
headquarters in the North Caucasus, about 2,500 rebels remain
active in Chechnya, including 1,500 in mountainous areas and
around 1,000 on the plains.
</P>
<P>
With Russia's presidential elections just five days away,
federal troops have stepped up security in Chechen regions under
their control. Rebels have threatened to sabotage voting in Grozny,
the provincial capital, and other settlements.
</P>
<P>
Security has also been beefed up in other parts of Russia,
where over 100,000 policemen are expected to guard the polling
stations.
</P>
<P>
Russia launched the military campaign last September following
armed Chechen incursions into neighboring Daghestan and a spate of
apartment bombings that left more than 300 people dead in Moscow
and two other cities.
</P>
<P>
Authorities said Chechen separatists were behind the blasts and
that evidences had been found inside Chechnya.

<HEADLINE> Pioneer Cities to Discuss Ways to Curb Global Poverty Trends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Members of the World Alliance of
Cities Against Poverty (WACAP) will meet in Geneva on April 3-5 to
tackle issues of growing global poverty, said the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, participants will try to establish
partnerships, build up the capacity of municipalities to tackle
poverty, explore innovative formulas to fund social development,
and to express publicly the cities' concerns and proposals.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will also examine how municipalities can better
cope with catastrophes and emergency situations, whose
consequences are all the more devastating when they hit poor and
unprepared areas.
</P>
<P>
Coinciding with the beginning of the U.N. Decade for the
Eradication of Poverty (1997-2006), WACAP was established at the
UNDP's initiative to empower municipalities to challenge poverty
locally and globally.
</P>
<P>
Over 1.3 billion people currently survive on less than one U.S.
dollar a day, a figure that grows by 25 million every year,
according to the UNDP. However, the world's top three billionaires
have assets greater than the combined GNP of the 48 least
developed countries and their 600 million people.
</P>
<P>
In industrialized countries more than 100 million people live
below the income poverty-line, more than 5 million are homeless
and 37 million jobless, said the UNDP. More than 1 billion people
in developing countries lack adequate shelter and an estimated 100
million are homeless.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 21 (Xinhua) -- About 107 Cuban doctors arrived
here on Monday to help improve the health care delivery in
Zimbabwe's rural and district hospitals, the Herald newspaper
reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The volunteer doctors, who have brought with them 1.3 tons of
drugs to bail out three districts reeling under the effects of
Cyclone Eline, will be on a two-year contract.
</P>
<P>
They will undergo a few weeks of orientation in Harare and
Bulawayo before taking up their posts at various hospitals, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
According to Cuban Ambassador to Zimbabwe Rodolfo Sarracino,
the doctors are volunteers on full salary in Cuba and what
Zimbabwe needs to do is only to give them accommodation and
monthly allowances.

<HEADLINE> 25 Killed in Oil Tanker Explosion in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 21 (Xinhua) -- At least 25 people were
burnt to death and 40 others suffered severe burns when an
overturned petrol tanker caught fire in Rungwe District of
Tanzania's southwest Mbeya Region Sunday afternoon, Tanzanian
media reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The tragedy occurred when one of the local villagers gathering
to extract oil from the overturned tanker for personal use
tampered with the batteries of the tanker, causing a spark which
ignited the explosion.
</P>
<P>
According to Mbeya Regional Police Commander Laurian Sanya, the
fateful tanker was one of the two that were transporting fuel from
Dar es Salaam to neighboring Malawi.
</P>
<P>
While the drivers were trying to use the other tanker to tow
the overturned tanker back on the road, a group of villagers
rushed to the scene and chased them away.
</P>
<P>
Most of the bodies were burnt beyond recognition, Sanya said,
adding that only five skulls were discovered from the ashes at the
scene.

<HEADLINE> Monkeys, Humans Fight over Water in Drought-hit Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Monkeys and villagers clashed
over a relief water delivery Monday in the drought-stricken
northeast Kenya's Mandera District , the Daily Nation newspaper
reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ten villagers were hurt and eight moneys were killed in the
two-hour fight for water, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
When three water tankers arrived at the open market, monkeys
began attacking the villagers by clawing, biting and
stone-throwing, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
Villagers were forced to flee but later returned with pangas
and axes to counter-attack the monkeys.
</P>
<P>
An acute shortage of water in the district had forced the wild
animals out of the bush and gazelles.
</P>
<P>
Local residents feared that dangerous animals like elephants,
lions and leopards would attack them too in search of water.

<HEADLINE> Intel Debuts Faster Chips for Internet-based Applications </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Intel Corp., the world's
largest chip maker, Monday unveiled two new high-end Pentium III
microprocessors, according to reports from the company.
</P>
<P>
The California-based chip giant rolled out two new Pentium III
processors, one that operates at 866 megahertz, or million cycles-
per-second, and the other at 850 MHz.
</P>
<P>
The new chips are designed to enhance Internet-based
applications such as audio, video, animation and 3-D, the company
said.
</P>
<P>
The 866 and 850 Pentium III processors, which are priced in 1,
000-unit quantities at 776 U.S. dollars and 765 dollars
respectively, are currently available from PC makers such as Dell,
Gateway, and Compaq, according Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy.
</P>
<P>
IBM is expected to begin delivering PCs with the new processors
within a month, Mulloy said.
</P>
<P>
However, some industry observers have pointed out that all of
Intel's high-end chips have been in short supply.
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, Intel and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), its
smaller rival in the market for PC microprocessors, have been in a
fierce battle for bragging rights. Earlier this month, AMD beat
Intel to the punch, rolling out its 1 GHz Athlon processor two
days before Intel rolled out its fastest processor.
</P>
<P>
Some industry observers have been critical of the companies'
focus on being the first to announce incremental speed increases,
which they said has contributed in large part to supply problems
for all of Intel's Pentium processors, even those on the lower end.
</P>
<P>
"The clock-speed wars have gotten to the point where it's not
clear who benefits," said Joe Osha, semiconductor analyst at
Merrill Lynch in New York.
</P>
<P>
"It's certainly not the customer who wants to buy 700 MHz stuff
at reasonable prices. It has been a problem, but availability has
improved over the past four weeks or so." he added.

BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua)-- China today reaffirmed its strong
opposition to any visit to Japan by Taiwan's Lee Teng-hui, warning
such a visit will have a serious impact on Sino-Japanese relations.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side is seriously concerned about such a move (the
reported plan for such a visit) motivated by a small group of anti-
China forces in Japan, said Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi.
</P>
<P>
Sun said Lee's visit to Japan, in whatever form or name, will
become a serious political matter in the relations between China
and Japan, and is firmly opposed by the Chinese government and
people.
</P>

The Chinese side sincerely hopes that the Japanese government
would strictly abide by its commitments on the Taiwan issue, pay

BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua)-- China today urged the United
States to strictly follow the commitments it has made on the
Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
China demands that the U.S. would cautiously handle the Taiwan
issue and take practical measures to follow its "One China" stance,
the principles set forth in the three joint communiques, and the
three "nos" commitment it has already made, according to foreign
ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi at today's press conference.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has committed itself to three "nos", namely not to
support the independence of Taiwan, not to support "two Chinas" or
"one China, one Taiwan", and not to support Taiwan's membership in
any organization for which statehood is a requirement, Sun further
explained.
</P>
<P>
China has also demanded that the U.S. keeps relations with
Taiwan only on the non-official level, and stop its arms sales to
Taiwan, he noted.

<HEADLINE> Teachers' Housing Project Completed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Education
announced here today that a government project to revamp shabby
apartments for university teachers has been completed.
</P>
<P>
More than 66,000 families of young teachers working with over
300 universities and colleges affiliated to central government
departments, have moved into the new residences.
</P>
<P>
The program, part of the efforts to implement the strategy of
developing the nation through science, technology and education,
was initiated in 1998 after a year of experiments.
</P>
<P>
The central government has allocated special funds for the
project to rebuild the shabby houses of university teachers with a
total floor space of 3.59 million sq.m..
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local governments in 16 provinces and municipalities
have also allocated special funds to help renovate teachers'
residence for local universities and colleges.
</P>
<P>
For decades, Chinese teachers had been working hard, but living
on low payment and in shabby houses. In recent years, the central
government has been making efforts to improve living conditions,
including pay-hikes and house-rebuilding, for university teachers
in a bid to curb a worsening brain drain.

"On behalf of the President and all Americans, let me express

<HEADLINE> Boeing Strike Ends, Engineers Back to Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Boeing Co. engineers and
technical workers returned to work Monday after a 40-day walkout,
following approval of a contract by the striking union Sunday
night, according to reports from the company.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 10,000 of the 13,440 eligible, dues-paying members of
the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace (
SPEEA) voted on the three-year contract Sunday, with both
engineers and technical workers approving it by more than 70
percent, the union said.
</P>
<P>
The contract guarantees wage increases of at least 3 percent
each year, in addition to production-linked bonuses of up to 2,500
U.S. dollars. Boeing also dropped its demand that workers pay part
of their health insurance premiums and extended health coverage to
domestic partners.
</P>
<P>
Union leaders were jubilant at a Sunday evening news conference
after the final tally of votes.
</P>
<P>
"All I can say is, this is history. And if this is what it
feels like to make history, let's just keep doing it," SPEEA
Executive Director Charles Bofferding said.
</P>
<P>
Richard Trumka, secretary-treasurer of the AFL-CIO, the
umbrella labor group that SPEEA recently affiliated with, said the
walkout and concessions won prove that unions benefit all workers,
"white collar, blue collar, or no collar."
</P>
<P>
Boeing, the world's biggest maker of jet aircraft, missed at
least 15 airplane deliveries and work on some government contracts
lagged during the walkout by 15,000 to 17,000 workers that began
February 9.
</P>
<P>
In its annual report to federal regulators, filed last week,
Boeing said the strike would hurt financial performance in the
first quarter, which ends March 31, and could affect the second
quarter as well.
</P>
<P>
"We realize there are many challenges that face us all in the
days to come, not the least of which are reintegrating our team
and working to recover from the impacts of the strike," said Phil
Condit, chief executive of the world's largest aircraft maker.
</P>
<P>
"This has been an emotional time for all involved. We are
confident that, with time, we will be able to heal from this
unfortunate situation as we strive to continue listening to each
other and understanding our mutual interests," Condit said in a
statement.

<HEADLINE> Australia Supports China in Dealing With Imported Polio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Australia will contribute 2.5
million AUD to the Chinese Government's emergency response to an
imported case of poliomyelitis, according to a news release from
the Australian Embassy in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The emergency measures, which will be managed by the World
Health Organization, will be implemented in four areas of west
China--Ningxia, Qinghai, Gansu and Tibet--as an effort to help
prevent the spread of polio.
</P>
<P>
Australia will help China by providing supports for
supplementary polio immunization for children under 10 years old
in the four target areas, conducting special surveillance to
detect, investigate and report any polio case, and providing
information to government leaders at all levels on polio
eradication.
</P>
<P>
In October last year, a child in northwest China's Qinghai
province was crippled by polio, which is the first confirmed case
of polio in China for more than three years, and also the first
one in the Western Pacific region in more than two years.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Says "Delighted" to Be in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. President Bill
Clinton said here on Tuesday that he was honored and delighted to
be in India.
</P>
<P>
"I am honored to be here. I am delighted to be here, it is so
beautiful," Clinton told more than 100 Indian and foreign
reporters after a reception ceremony in the forecourts of the
Rashtrapati Bhavan, or the Presidential Palace, in downtown Delhi.
</P>
<P>
However, he did not answer any further questions and walked
away as a journalist sought his reaction on the latest bloodshed
in Kashmir, where 35 Sikh residents were massacred Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Press Trust of India (PTI) quoted U.S. Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, who was also present during the
ceremony, as saying that Clinton might make a statement on the
massacre.
</P>
<P>
"I am not the best person (to comment on the incident). The
president might probably make a statement," Talbott told the PTI.
</P>
<P>
Arriving in his Stretch Limousine led by 60 horse riders of the
President's Body Guard, Clinton, along with his daughter Chelsea,
was greeted by Indian President K R Narayanan and Prime Minister
Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
</P>
<P>
After inspecting an inter-services Guard of Honor, Clinton met
Indian dignitaries including Home Minister L K Advani, Defense
Minister George Fernandes, External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh
and Congress President Sonia Gandhi.
</P>
<P>
He then introduced Narayanan to his delegation, which included
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, National Security Advisor
Sandy Berger, and Talbott.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will hold talks with Vajpayee on Tuesday morning,
following which the two are expected to make a "Vision Statement."
</P>
<P>
"The overall thrust of the talks (between Clinton and Vajpayee)
would be (our) relationship," Talbott told the PTI, adding that
the statement will be a "powerful" one with a "very positive
language."

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seriously Concerned With Kashmir Killings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Tuesday expressed serious concern over the killing of 35 Sikh
residents by militants in Kashmir on Monday night, the Press Trust
of India (PTI) reported.
</P>
<P>
Clinton conveyed his concern to Indian Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee during his brief meeting with the latter during a
welcome ceremony at Rashtrapati Bhavan, or the Presidential Palace,
earlier in the day, the PTI quoted official sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The PTI reported earlier that according to U.S. Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, Clinton was likely to make an
official statement on the Kashmir massacre later Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The killing of the 35 Sikhs, all male residents in a village in
south Kashmir, occurred at around 9 p.m. Monday evening and was
described by the PTI as the first militant attack on the local
Sikh community over the past decade. No militant group has so far
claimed responsibility for the incident.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday morning, Clinton, accompanied by his daughter
Chelsea, paid homage to the founding father of India Mahatma
Gandhi at his memorial at Rajghat.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who drove straight to Rajghat after the welcome
ceremony at the Presidential Palace, offered floral tributes to
Gandhi's memorial and planted a sapling of "Him Champa", or
Magnolia Grandiflora, on the occasion.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president was showed around the memorial by Indian
Minister of State for External Affairs Ajit Panja and later signed
the visitors' book.
</P>
<P>
Senior U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, also paid their homage to Gandhi.

<HEADLINE> North American Storage Utility Market to Expand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Driven by the demand for
storage capacity and the explosive e-commerce market, the North
American storage utility market is expected to grow to 8 billion U.
S. dollars in 2003 from just 10 million dollars in 1999, according
to a report released Monday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. research firm Dataquest defines storage utility as
provisioning of storage capacity, which could be delivered via the
net, for servers on a usage basis. An array of storage services
may be delivered in conjunction with this capacity, ranging from
administration services, backup of servers and PCs, system and
file recovery and restoration services, archiving, data
warehousing and others.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that storage utility penetration of corporate
data centers would not exceed 1 billion dollars until 2003, while
storage utility revenue generated through Internet data centers
would reach almost 6 billion dollars by 2003, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
Corporate data centers have entrenched information technology
departments and established storage infrastructures. Internet data
centers tend to serve customers with few or no storage resources.
Even corporations with their own data centers tend to host their
business to business and e-commerce applications from Internet
data centers.

<HEADLINE> B2B Advertising Outstrips Other Industries in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Growth in online advertising
of business-to-business (B2B) companies in the United States has
outstripped all other industries in the last four months,
according to data released Monday by U.S. media matrix company
AdRelevance.
</P>
<P>
The number of B2B companies advertising online has increased 58
percent over the last four months, compared with an average of
only 17 percent for all other industries including travel,
software, financial services, etc., said AdRelevance, a company
engaging in competitive data tracking of online advertising.
</P>
<P>
Between October 1999 and February 2000, B2B advertisers have
increased ad spending by 66 percent based on average number of ad
impressions per company. In the fourth quarter of 1999, B2B banner
advertising accounted for approximately 1.9 billion ad impressions,
or 5 percent of online advertising overall. Impression refers to
the number of times an ad is rendered for viewing by a user.
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, the majority of B2B online advertising
focuses on technology, AdRelevance found. Sixty-two percent of all
B2B ads feature such products and services as Web design, e-
commerce security, network hardware, domain registration and
related business technology.
</P>
<P>
The rapid growth of B2B advertising is a natural result of the
year-long rush to the Internet by B2B companies forging new ground
in e-commerce, according to AdRelevance. Last year, there was a
boom in commercial activity on the Internet as B2B e-commerce
became the focus of hundreds of companies looking to stake claims
in new territory. "Now that so many companies in the B2B sector
have a presence online, it makes sense for them to advertising
there," the company said.
</P>
<P>
The data gathered by AdRelevance suggests that the majority of
B2B advertising is taking place outside the consumer corridors of
mainstream Net traffic. Although all industries are more likely to
advertising on portals and search engines, B2B advertisers are
relatively less likely to do so than their business-to-consumer (B
2C) counterparts. Similarly, B2B companies are more likely to
advertise on computer/technology, business/finance and general
news sites, where B2C companies are relatively scarce.

<HEADLINE> Deliverymen Charged With Theft As Stolen Oscars Recovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Police on Monday charged two
men who worked for the trucking company hired to deliver Academy
Awards statues with stealing the 55 Oscars, 52 of which were
recovered Sunday night beside a trash bin.
</P>
<P>
Salvage man Willie Fulgear stumbled upon one of 10 boxes filled
with the gold-plated trophies when he was looking for large
packing boxes behind a grocery store. Then he reported to the
police.
</P>
<P>
Police also said they had arrested two shipping company workers
Saturday in what they said was an inside job.
</P>
<P>
Truck driver Lawrence Ledentand and loading dock worker Anthony
Hart, both 38, worked for the Roadway Express Co., which handles
shipments of the Oscars. They were charged with grand theft.
</P>
<P>
Authorities said they were still hunting for three of the short,
bald, gold-hued Oscar statuettes and were hoping that they won't
get far on foot.
</P>
<P>
The duo, who had allegedly hoped to sell the Oscars for vast
profits, were being held in lieu of 100,000 U.S. dollars bail,
police said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference at police headquarters, where the
recovered Oscars were displayed on a rickety table covered with
red paper, Robert Rehme, president of the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences, assured the public that such a heist
would never happen again.
</P>
<P>
"(The thieves) made a terrible mistake and I don't think they
were thinking. These (statuettes) are not very marketable. How are
you going to sell an Oscar? People are going to turn you in,"
Rehme said.
</P>
<P>
The Oscars were shipped March 3 from manufacturer R.S. Owens of
Chicago and arrived at Roadway Express' warehouse in Bell,
California, on March 8.
</P>
<P>
Jon Gerloff, security manager for Roadway's western division,
said the company believes Hart and Ledent made off with the
statues the same day the shipment arrived.
</P>
<P>
Rehme also said the Academy had not decided whether to invite
Fulgear to the Oscars, though others said that would make kind of
a satisfactory conclusion to the whole thing.
</P>
<P>
The theft marked the second snafu in the Academy Awards in a
month. A couple of weeks ago, 4,200 ballots mailed to voters in
the Los Angeles area disappeared, and new ballots had to be mailed.
The missing ballots eventually were found -- misrouted to a bulk-
mail office.

<HEADLINE> Thai Economic Growth Slightly Up on Forecast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The Thai economy grew by 4.2
percent last year, up slightly from 4.1 percent previously
forecast, the Bangkok Post reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) of
Thailand was quoted as saying in an announcement Monday that 6.5
percent growth was recorded in the fourth quarter last year,
compared with the same period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Sansern Wongcha-um, secretary-general of the main state
planning agency said that growth in the third quarter last year
was 7.4 percent against a projection of 7.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
This year, economic growth was on track for 4.4 percent, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Inflation is projected at 2.2 percent to 2.3 percent this year,
compared with 0.3 percent recorded last year. The forecast is
based on the assumption that world oil prices will average 25 U.S.
dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's current account is forecast to record a surplus of 8.
3 billion dollars, based on export growth of 6.5 percent, the baht
averaging 38 to the U.S. dollar and progress in restructuring the
financial sector.
</P>
<P>
Sansern said the recovery would not form a W-shape -- in other
words include another downturn -- because the worst had now passed,
adding that the recovery should form a V-shape.
</P>
<P>
He suggested the government focus on promoting the recovery of
the agricultural and financial sectors.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Board of Investment (BOI) of Thailand projected
export growth this year to exceed 10 percent in U.S. dollar terms,
compared with six percent forecast by the Commerce Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Electronic and related parts would show the highest growth of
any sector, BOI forecasts.

<P>
NEW DELHI, March 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Tuesday began his five-day state visit to India, which both sides
hope will set the course for a new relationship with indications
of disagreement on key issues between Washington and New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
The visit is seen here as a milestone as it is the first by a U.

cold war, when India was a close ally of the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts here said, the achievements of the visit
might be limited only to economic and business areas due to
disagreement on critical issues like India's nuclear programs and
the Kashmir dispute between India and Pakistan.

Clinton will be accorded a state welcome in the morning by
Indian President Kocheril Raman Narayanan before holding talks
with Indian leaders including one-to-one talks with Prime Minister
Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
</P>
<P>
Before he left Washington, Clinton said he would use the trip
to rekindle the relationship with India and to reduce tensions
between New Delhi and Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who paid a historical one-day visit to Bangladesh on
Monday and will also make a stopover in Pakistan after his visit
to India, described South Asia and the so-called line of control
between India and Pakistan in Kashmir as the most dangerous place
in the world.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters in the Oval Office that he would make it
clear that a nuclear future was dangerous for India, Pakistan and
the world.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president, who earlier described the nuclear status
quo in South Asia as "unacceptable," reportedly said that he would
try to persuade India and Pakistan, together with Israel and Cuba,
into the nuclear nonproliferation treaty, which is not an easy
task for Clinton to achieve.
</P>
<P>
Just hours before Clinton arrived in India on Sunday night at
the start of his South Asian tour, Vajpayee said New Delhi would
take its own decision about its security and not come under
pressure from anybody.
</P>
<P>
Officials here have reportedly confirmed that India had already
deployed nuclear missiles in the country with several Pakistani
cities as targets following Pakistan's reported deployment against
India.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee has ruled out the possibility of India signing the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) during Clinton's visit,
saying: "We are not going to sign CTBT during Clinton's visit, but
the issue will be discussed."
</P>
<P>
Expressing the hope that Clinton's visit would help improve
bilateral ties, Vajpayee said the relationship should be on equal
terms.
</P>
<P>
On Kashmir, India has insisted on noninterference by any third
party, saying it is a part of Indian territory and it could only
be resolved bilaterally between New Delhi and Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with a television channel, India's ambassador
to the U.S. Naresh Chandra warned Washington against interference
in Kashmir. "More interest by the U.S. can prove counter-
productive," he said.
</P>
<P>
As Clinton turned back to New Delhi from Dhaka late Monday
night, reports reaching here said at least 35 Sikhs were killed by
unidentified gunmen in India-controlled Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, to Indian businessmen who saw ups and downs in
economic relations between the two countries, Clinton's visit did
bring some good news with the U.S. announcement of removal of 51
Indian companies from the list of sanctions imposed after India's
nuclear test in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is not only the largest investor in India but also
India's largest trading partner with two-way trade in 1999
totaling 12.79 billion U.S. dollars, more than nine billion
dollars of which are India's exports to the U.S.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. investment in India accounted for about 25 percent of
all foreign direct investment approved from 1991 to September last
year, or 13.115 billion dollars out of the total 58.716 billion
dollars during the period. Official figures showed that actual
inflows from the U.S. totaled 2.264 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> 1stlead: 35 Sikhs killed in Kashmir -- PTI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 21 (Xinhua) -- In the first incident of its
kind, militants massacred 35 male Sikh residents in a village in
south Kashmir on Monday evening, just hours before the formal
beginning of a five-day state visit to India by U.S. President
Bill Clinton, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported.
</P>
<P>
Around 40 to 50 heavily armed militants descended upon
Chatisinghpura village, some 56 km to the south of Srinagar in
India-controlled Kashmir, at around 9 p.m. Monday night and called
out members of Sikh families there, the PTI quoted local police as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The militants then separated male members of the Sikh families
and sprayed bullets on them, killing 34 on the spot and seriously
wounding two others, said the police. One of the injured died in a
nearby local hospital.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time in the decade-long history of militancy in
Kashmir that the Sikh community there was targeted by militant
attacks, said the PTI, adding that there are 250 Sikh families in
the Chatisinghpura village.
</P>
<P>
In protest of the incident, the Sikh community in Kashmir have
shut down shops in some parts of the city of Jammu and are
assembling in large numbers at a local gurdwara, or Sikh church,
to discuss further actions, the PTI said.

<HEADLINE> hke032112--More Than 100 People Kidnapped in Southern Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Some 60 heavily armed extremists
have taken hostage a Roman Catholic priest, a school principal,
several teachers and about 100 students of a school in the
southern Philippines, Philippine News Agency (PNA) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The news agency quoted a military report as saying that the
kidnapping, which was carried out by the men believed to belong to
the extremist group Abu Sayyaf, took place at a high school in the
southern island province of Basilan Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Some 30 students were released by the armed men Monday
afternoon, but the fate of the other hostages remains unverified,
the PNA said.
</P>
<P>
In all, a total of six pre-elementary teachers, seven high
school teachers and two elementary school teachers were taken from
the school along with the students, the PNA added.
</P>
<P>
Initial reports said the hostage taking came an hour after the
rebels attacked an army detachment, about 200 meters from the
school.
</P>
<P>
After about a 30 minute gunfight with the soldiers at the
detachment, the rebels withdrew but passed by the school and took
the hostages for use as shields in their withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Local military spokesman Larry Atendido was quoted as saying
that government troops and local policemen are tracking down the
armed men along with their hostages.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar's Draft Environmental Law Being Finalized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, March 21 (Xinhua) -- A draft Environmental Protection
Law of Myanmar is being finalized by the country's Attorney-
General's Office and will be submitted to the cabinet for approval,
said Tuesday's New Light of Myanmar newspaper, quoting Foreign
Minister U Win Aung.
</P>
<P>
The Environmental Protection Law is one of the two Myanmar
environmental laws currently in the process of drafting. The other
one is the Environmental Impact Assessment Rules.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting here Monday of Myanmar's National
Commission for Environmental Affairs (NCEA), U Win Aung, who is
also NCEA chairman, said the NCEA was doing its utmost in
environmental protection by preparing a national report on
convention to combat desertification and implementing Montreal
Protocol in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
He said the NCEA, with support and cooperation from the Japan
International Cooperation Agency, is carrying out air quality
monitoring in the capital of Yangon.
</P>
<P>
The NCEA, since its inception in February 1990, has made
efforts to enhance environmental management in the country,
promoting public attention to environmental matters through public
environmental awareness programs.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar adopted a national environmental policy in late 1994
with the aim of achieving harmony and balance between the
environment and development through the integration of
environmental consideration into the development process to
enhance the quality of life of all its citizens.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the NCEA formulated and published Myanmar Agenda 21 --
a plan of action for sustainable development in the country.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar now has a total of 57 environmentally-related laws.
However, most of these sectoral laws are incidental environmental
laws and are not specifically intended for environmental
protection.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The United State is not only
the largest investor in India but also India's largest trading
partner with two-way trade rising to 12.79 billion U.S. dollars in
1999, official figures showed.
</P>
<P>
India's exports to the U.S. have been steadily growing since
1992 at an average rate of 13.7 percent in dollar terms annually
while imports from the U.S. have been fluctuating.
</P>
<P>
India exports to the U.S. rose to 9.083 billion dollars last
year from only 3.781 billion dollars in 1992 and 6.169 billion
dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
India's imports from the U.S. declined by 0.6 percent to 3.318
billion dollars in 1996, increased by 8.9 percent to 3.616 billion
dollars in 1997, dropped again by 1.96 percent to 3.545 billion
dollars in 1998 and grew by 4.6 percent to 3.707 billion dollars
last year.
</P>
<P>
India's exports to the U.S. have been rising mainly on account
of significant increases in the exports of diamonds, textiles and
ready-made garments, machinery, carpets, footwear and leather
products, dyes, iron and steel products, chemicals, fruit and nuts
and spices, coffee and tea.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, when India began its economic reform process, India
has carried out sweeping changes in its economic policies to
stimulate domestic and foreign investment in many sectors, the
effects of which were profound on trade and investment between
India and the U.S.

cold war, when India was an close ally of the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts here said, the achievements of the visit

<HEADLINE> Appliance Servers, Fast-growing Worldwide Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Appliance servers, which will
be quickly adopted by enterprises and businesses, are expected to
be an emerging market worldwide, according to a report released
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report from the International Data Corporation (IDC), a U.S.
market research firm, expects the market to reach 11 billion U.S.
dollars by 2004, from less than 1 billion dollars in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Today's service providers and dotcoms are demanding "reliable
and scaleable solutions" to provide their dedicated functions, and
many small enterprises are also looking for inexpensive, reliable
ways to build a network, said the report. The IDC believes
appliance servers are solutions to these problems.
</P>
<P>
According to the IDC, appliance servers will take away market
share from general-purpose servers. Meanwhile, general-purpose
server sellers are expected to turn their servers into appliance
ones.
</P>
<P>
The emerging market will focus on specific applications and end-
user segments, the IDC said. Network-attached storage will
represent the largest opportunity for appliance servers,
accounting for more than half of the market value through 2004,
while revenues in the Web server segment will increase the fastest
with an annual growth rate of 130 percent.

WASHINGTON, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Texas Governor George W. Bush
and U.S. Vice President Al Gore have roughly equal amounts of
money for the first time since the presidential campaign started

</P>
<P>
Bush, who spent a record 63.2 million dollars in winning the
Republican presidential nomination, said Monday he had 10.6

Meanwhile, Gore's campaign said it had 4.1 million cash on hand
and will receive another 7.3 million dollars of "matching funds"
from the federal government, making it a total of 11.4 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from the Federal Election Commission, Bush
raised 3.2 million dollars in February, bringing his total to 73.9
million dollars, another record in U.S. history.

Gore spent 6.1 million dollars last month, bringing his overall
spending total to 33 million. He raised 2.1 million dollars,
bringing his fund-raising total to 37.2 million dollars. Gore also
reported debts of 1 million dollars.
</P>

they try to conserve money for national advertising and targeting
key electoral states over the next five months.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese version of Windows
2000, a new operating system worked out by Microsoft for business
computers, made its debut in Beijing Monday, China Daily reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The new operating system provides enhanced reliability,
scalability, mobility and security than previous versions, Michael
Rawding, director of Microsoft Corp (China), was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The release of Windows 2000 Chinese version came about a month
after the English version had been released in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
"Windows 2000 is designed to enable organizations to quickly
and flexibly build the next generation of applications that take
the advantages of the Internet," Rawding said.
</P>
<P>
He said unlike Windows 98 that focused on home consumers,
Windows 2000 is designed for business computers to cope with the e-
commerce age.
</P>
<P>
"Windows 2000 enables PC manufacturers, software vendors and
channel partners to offer their customers the widest range of
choice of a platform for building the next generation of business
solutions," said Bill Gates in a congratulation speech for the
release through a video-conferencing system.
</P>
<P>
Company sources said around one million units of Windows 2000
have been sold since February 17.
</P>
<P>
The new operating system was hailed by Chinese computer users,
more than 20 business organizations including Shanghai Pudong
Development Bank and China Radio International have already
adopted the new operating system.
</P>
<P>
Retail price for Windows 2000 in China will be approximately 15
to 20 percent lower than in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Rawding said he expects the sales of Windows 2000 to be high in
China. The company plans to promote Windows 2000 (China) in a
cross-country tour.

<P>
BELGRADE, March 20 (Xinhua) -- U.N. envoy on human rights for
Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Yugoslavia Jiri Dienstbier said
here Monday that the deteriorating security situation in the
Yugoslavian province of Kosovo has been caused by the
international community's failure in implementing U.N. Resolution
1244.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo is now "in chaos" and has become "a haven for criminals,
" Dienstbier said at a press conference after meetings with
Yugoslavian Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic.
</P>
<P>
The Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) is committing horrifying
racial cleansing against non-Albanians in Kosovo after Yugoslavian
armed forces withdrew from the region, he added.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the U.N. envoy and the Yugoslavian foreign
minister agreed that since the U.N. Interim Administration Mission
in Kosovo (UNMIK) and the international peacekeeping force (KFOR)
took control of Kosovo, the region's security situation has
worsened.
</P>
<P>
Dienstbier urged a full implementation of U.N. Resolution 1244,
which demands a total disarmament of the KLA and the return of
Yugoslavian police.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Western China Launches Afforestation Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- China is vigorously pushing ahead
a program to return low-yielding farmland in its vast western
areas to forests and grassland.
</P>
<P>
Under the government-initiated "grain-for-green" program, China
's resource-rich, economically backward hinterland is expected to
be afforested with trees and grass in the upcoming decades.
</P>
<P>
Qinghai Province, where China's two longest rivers -- the
Yangtze and the Yellow -- originate, will convert 18,000 ha of its
low-yielding farmland along the rivers to forests and grassland
this year. The area will expand to 360,000 ha by 2010.
</P>
<P>
The western China province plans to build a forest covering an
area of 876,000 ha and close 1.4 million ha of hillsides to
livestock grazing and cook-fuel gathering, in a bid to facilitate
the afforestation drive over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The move is to raise the forest coverage rate in Qinghai by
four percent to 200,000 ha.
</P>
<P>
People in Golmud, a city built on gobi desert, will build an 11-
km-long and 606-meter-wide forest belt on the edge of the Qaidam
Basin.
</P>
<P>
Neighboring Gansu Province has pledged to launch three
ecological projects this year. The first one is to build a tree
belt along the middle reaches of the Yellow in 11 years. The
second one is to take measures to prevent desertification, while
the third involves pilot experiments with the grain-for-green
scheme.
</P>
<P>
The government of Sichuan Province has set up a leading group
to take charge of local afforestation efforts. Sichuan plans to
turn 200,000 ha of its hillsides and barren land to grassland and
forest. By the end of February, 86,000 ha had been afforested.

<HEADLINE> Fight Urged to Limit Sea Land Mining </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- China wants to step up
supervision and expand publicity to win back its coastlines that
have been damaged by excessive mining of sea land, China Daily
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The China Marine Supervision Headquarters suggested these
measures in a report wrapping up the country's first national
investigation on sea sand exploitation.
</P>
<P>
The investigation covered China's three million square
kilometers of salt water, and was conducted from mid-January
through Spring Festival.
</P>
<P>
The most serious sea-sand abuses were found in Zhoushan, east
China's Zhejiang Province, and the two places in south China's
Guangdong Province: the mouth of the Pearl River and Zhanjiang.
</P>
<P>
Sea sand mining became profitable in the early 1990s because of
increasing construction and the drying out of river sand.
</P>
<P>
As China's geological, oceanic, water conservancy and
transportation departments at first disagreed about who would
manage sea sand removal, the sand was over-mined over several
years, causing the coastline to recede in many places.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that people living near salt water should
consider sea sand more as an important biosphere element rather
than a mineral. That the sand can turn into profitable
construction material should come last to people's minds.
</P>
<P>
It recommends that China develop a program to define where it
is acceptable to mine sea sand. It also suggests speeding up the
issuing of permits and the punishment of violators.

<HEADLINE> Youth Project Helps Redefine Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- After three years of trials, an
educational support program designed to help youngsters develop
their personal interests and characters was made formal yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The program, called "Project Success", features activities
designed to help children find happiness in studying, practice
classroom knowledge, develop their understanding of team work and
build skills through competition.
</P>
<P>
At present, many teachers and parents still think getting high
grades and passing the national college entrance examination mean
success for children, today's China Daily quoted Sun Yunxiao, an
official in charge of the project, as saying.
</P>
<P>
These attitudes have twisted the concept of the country's nine-
year compulsory education and caused many students to fail, Sun
said.
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of the project is to change the narrow view on
achievements and help each child succeed," Sun was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The project also backs up government efforts to change China's
education system, Sun added.
</P>
<P>
Project Success is sponsored by the China Youth and Children
Research Committee and the China Youth and Children Research
Center.
</P>
<P>
The pilot project covered 24 primary schools in Hefei,
Shijiazhuang and Tianjin plus two stations in Beijing. Educators
and parents applauded the results, the paper said.

MEXICO CITY, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The number of grey whales

<HEADLINE> Glaucoma Found to Affect Eyes, Brain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- American and Canadian researchers
announced their new discovery in the study of glaucoma Monday in
Toronto.
</P>
<P>
According to an announcement, St. Michael's Hospital (SMH) and
the University of Toronto have discovered that the disease
associated with blindness affects not only the eyes but the entire
visual system, including the brain.
</P>
<P>
"Our study shows for the first time that in glaucoma there is
also a loss of specific nerve cells in the brain which control
ability to see color and motion," said Dr. Yeni Yucel, a
neuropathologist at SMH.
</P>
<P>
This discovery gives patients new hope because doctors can now
focus on additional innovative treatment strategies similar to
those aimed at Alzheimer's and Parkinson's patients, said the
researchers.
</P>
<P>
By using three-dimensional computer reconstruction, the
researchers found that glaucoma could destroy 40 percent of the
nerve cells both in the eye and in the brain.
</P>
<P>
"It's clear that if we want to develop strategies to prevent
the death of nerve cells in the eye, we need to also take into
account what's happening to the target nerve cells in the brain,"
said Yucel.
</P>
<P>
Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness and affects 67 million
people worldwide, especially the elderly and those with a family
member with glaucoma. Diabetes, high blood pressure and short-
sightedness may also lead to the disease.

<HEADLINE> Clinton-Assad Summit Has Special Significance: Syrian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk
Shareh said Monday that the upcoming summit between U.S. President
Bill Clinton and Syrian President Hafez Assad is of special
significance in helping the Syrian-Israeli talks out of impasse.
</P>
<P>
This is the first Syrian official comment after Clinton
announced in Dhaka, capital of Bangladesh, earlier in the day that
he would meet Assad in Geneva Sunday to try to revive the Syrian
track that remains frozen since January.
</P>
<P>
Shareh said at a joint press conference with his visiting Qatari
counterpart Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassim Bin Jabir al-Thani that future
Israeli-Syrian talks would be based on the 1991 Madrid Peace
Conference that kicked off the Mideast peace process and tackled
the problems left off from last round of talks in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Israel held two rounds of peace talks that resumed in
December last year after a 45-month suspension in Washington last
December and January before hitting a snag again due to disputes
over which issues should be discussed first.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian foreign minister expressed the hope that the upcoming
summit will be an important opportunity to revive all the facets of
the Mideast peace process, paving the way for the realization of a
just, comprehensive peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that expected targets on all tracks will materialize,"
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Should they resume, the Syrian-Israeli peace talks are expected
to still focus on four issues - borders, water, security
arrangements and normalization of bilateral ties.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian President Urges Good Governance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo on Monday urged African, Caribbean and Pacific countries
to pay attention to good governance if they want to benefit from
their trade partnership with the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo told the opening of the four-day 30th session of the
ACP-EU joint parliamentary assembly in Nigeria's capital Abuja
that for the successor agreement of Lome Convention to have the
desired impact on the 71-member ACP nations, both sides "must
strengthen their institutions for combating corruption".
</P>
<P>
The Lome Convention, first signed in 1975 and revised three
times as Lome II, III and IV, is due for further revision in June
to be known as Lome V.
</P>
<P>
While the developing countries should use their resources and
financial assistance more prudently, and not for "personal
enrichment of irresponsible politicians", donor countries in
Europe must also live by these standards and dissuade their
officials from giving bribe, Obasanjo said in his key note speech
at the opening session.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo urged the assembly to ensure that the successor
agreement "become the watershed for a stronger, more fruitful and
more result- oriented partnership".
</P>
<P>
"If the 20th century was the era of colonialism, let the
decades of the 21st century be one of the genuine partnership for
African, Caribbean and Pacific renaissance and the full
restoration of human dignity universally," he said.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Oil Minister Calls for OPEC Consensus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Ministers of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) who will meet in Vienna,
Austria, on March 27 will reach a consensus on production quotas in
view of the oil-starved global market, Venezuelan Oil Minister Ali
Rodriguez has said.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival here Tuesday, Rodriguez said "the market this
year was characterized by strong demand but we still need to work
to achieve market stability. It will be the main problem discussed
in Vienna."
</P>
<P>
The year-long output curb adopted by OPEC and non-OPEC countries
since last March have helped push world crude prices from record
lows to record highs.
</P>
<P>
The limited oil supply but increased demand have also drained
the excess inventories and drew cries of anguish from OPEC's
biggest consumer the U.S..
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is lobbying the producers in the cartel to increase oil
output to bring down the sky-high oil prices. U.S. Energy Secretary
Bill Richardson is also in Algeria, part of his efforts to persuade
the OPEC countries to increase output at the Vienna meeting.
</P>
<P>
Richardson, who met Algerian Minister of Energy and Mines Chakib
Khelil and Rodriguez, underlined the need to stabilize the oil
market.
</P>
<P>
"The United States thinks that OPEC, which is sovereign in its
decisions, should work to assure the stability of oil prices, a
stability that is good not only for producing countries but for
consuming countries," Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
Richardson said that while 10 U.S. dollars for a barrel of oil
before the oil curb is too low, 30 dollars that have dominated the
oil market recently is too much. He said a medium price is ideal.
</P>
<P>
Khelil told reporters that a price around 25 dollars would be
attractive for all parties.
</P>
<P>
Richardson has met with officials in Saudi Arabia and Nigeria in
the last week, and later this week he will travel to France, Norway
and Britain to press his message for higher production to stabilize
markets and avoid economic disruption.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez's five-nation tour also came ahead of the OPEC oil
ministers meeting, which had taken him to Iraq, Iran and Kuwait.
And he will travel on to Libya.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela, the world's third-largest oil exporters and a
founding member of the oil cartel, has scaled back production by
650,000 barrels a day since March 1998, when OPEC members agreed to
reduce output to raise sagging prices.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela, a major oil supplier to the U.S., is believed to side
with Saudi Arabia and non-OPEC member Mexico in favoring an output
hike, but Rodriguez has warned against a large increase that could
spur a collapse in oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
The OPEC meeting in Vienna timed with the expiration of the
year-long production cut agreement will focus on working out an
mechanism for maintaining stability of the oil market, the Algerian
News Agency quoted him rodriguez saying.

<HEADLINE> Greece Donates Patrol Boat to Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Greece Tuesday donated a patrol
boat to the Cyprus navy to show their determination to boost their
deterrent capability in the framework of the joint defense
doctrine.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a delivery ceremony also attended by visiting
Cypriot Defense Minister Socrates Hasikos, Greek Defense Minister
Akis Tsohatzopoulos said that the common obligation of the two
countries to ensure the security of their nations against any
threat and to joint support the prospect for security, peace and
cooperation among all the peoples of the region was reflected in
the donation of the patrol boat "Konosso," which was renamed "
Kyrenia" after the Turkish-occupied town on Cyprus' northern coast.
</P>
<P>
Tsohatzopoulos also warned that any effort to change the
status quo or to dispute their sovereign rights would find them
united and strong in their response.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-controlled
south and the Turkish Cypriots-dominated north since 1974 when
Turkey invaded and occupied the northern third of the island
following a short-lived coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
As a major guarantor of Cyprus, Athens and Nicosia have signed
a joint defense doctrine.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-sponsored peace talks, aimed at reuniting the island
under a bizonal and bicommunal federation, have been held on and
off for the past decades, but so far no tangible results have been
achieved as the gap between the two sides has remained wide on the
main aspects of the Cyprus problem.

<HEADLINE> List of Candidates in Upcoming Russian Presidential Poll (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
- - - -
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Putin -- a 47-year old former KGB intelligence officer
and the ex-head of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB)
domestic security service, became prime minister last August and
took over as acting president after Boris Yeltsin's surprise
resignation on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
By far the most popular politician in Russia, Putin commands a
wide lead in opinion polls. His popularity is attributed to his
bold military actions against Chechen rebels, his no-nonsense
incorruptible image and his promise of rejuvenating the Russian
nation.
</P>
<P>
Putin appeals to popular longing for a strong leader capable of
pilling the country out of its economic morass and uprooting
widespread official corruption.
</P>
<P>
He pledges to stand by free-market reforms and liberal values.
</P>
<P>
When he took over as acting head of state, commentators listed
Chechnya, the economy and heightened expectations as the three
factors that could wreck his chances of winning the presidential
race. But Putin's performance during nearly three months has
proved that he did well in all three fronts.
</P>
<P>
With the presidential poll five days away, few now doubt that
Putin would become the official master of the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
A recent opinion poll by the VTsIOM agency put his support at
over 60 percent. According to the poll, more than 74 percent of
Russians are sure that Putin will win.
</P>
<P>
- - - -
</P>
<P>
Gennady Zyuganov -- Communist Party leader, the Kremlin's main
opponent over the last 10 years, is running for the presidency for
the second time. He lost a campaign to Boris Yeltsin in the second
round of the 1996 presidential election. He has been unable to
expand his support base, largely consisting of elderly people
longing for the relative security of the Soviet era.
</P>
<P>
Surveys show that Zyuganov isn't expected to be a serious rival
to Putin.
</P>
<P>
The VTsIOM's poll indicated he could hope for support of around
20 percent of voters. His mostly elderly supporters are considered
to be highly organized but he has so far failed to mobilize a
majority in his favor.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov vowed to use Russia's natural resources "for the
benefit of the entire people and each single Russian." He said
that if he comes to power he will have the constitution amended in
a way ensuring "real democratization, the elimination of the
authoritarian presidential rule, and a higher role for the Federal
Assembly and the government."
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov also plans to re-establish state control over the
strategic economic sectors. He consents to immediately double
pensions, social benefits, salaries of those employed in state-
owned enterprises as well as federal budget revenues.
</P>
<P>
He calls for establishing renovated Soviet power and restoring
people's power and social justice in the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Twelve candidates, led by acting
President Vladimir Putin, will stand in Russia's presidential
elections Sunday. Following is part of a list of the presidential
hopefuls:
</P>
<P>
- - - -
</P>
<P>
Ella Pamfilova -- the first woman to run for the presidency and
the only female in this campaign.
</P>
<P>
She was a member of the previous Duma but did not manage to get
elected in a 1999 parliamentary election.
</P>
<P>
Panfilova, also head of an organization called For Civil
Dignity,says her main purpose in seeking the presidency is to set
a precedent for other women.
</P>
<P>
- - - -
</P>
<P>
Konstantin Titov -- governor of the Samara region on the Volga
river. He is one of the more respected regional leaders and sits
in the Federation Council, upper house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
Titov supports liberal reforms and has the image of a strong
economic manager. His chances of winning are very slim.
</P>
<P>
- - - -
</P>
<P>
Amangeldy Tuleyev -- left-leaning governor of the coal-rich
Kemerovo region. He backs Russia's Communists and has experience
of running for the presidency, although he has never got close to
winning.
</P>
<P>
- - - -
</P>
<P>
Yuri Skuratov -- a former chief prosecutor suspended a year ago
over a sex and corruption scandal. The Kremlin has tried three
times to have him permanently sacked, but the Federation Council
voted each time not to use its power to dismiss him.
</P>
<P>
Skuratov said the sex scandal was engineered by the Kremlin in
a bid to disgrace him and stop an investigation into high-level
corruption.
</P>
<P>
- - - -
</P>
<P>
Umar Dzhabrailov -- an ethnic Chechen, also a businessman with
links to Moscow's upmarket Slavyanskaya hotel.
</P>
<P>
- - - -
</P>
<P>
Stanislav Govorukhin -- a senior deputy from the Fatherland-All
Russia party, led by Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov and former Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
</P>
<P>
Govorukhin was a popular film director in the Soviet era and is
a long-standing center-left opponent of the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
- - - -
</P>
<P>
Alexey Podberyozkin -- former assistant to Zyuganov, left the
Communist Party to form his own Spiritual Heritage party. He is
seen as representing the intellectual wing of Russia's Communists.
</P>
<P>
- - - -
</P>
<P>
Yevgeny Savostyanov -- the former head of the Moscow department
of the FSB domestic security service and one-time member of the
Kremlin staff. Currently, he serves as head of the Moscow fund of
presidential programs.
</P>
<P>
- - - -
</P>
<P>
Campaigning by all candidates has been extremely slack because
Putin is so far in the lead and looks set to win the presidency.
</P>
<P>
Opinion polls show Putin getting support from about 60 percent
of voters, with his nearest challenger, Zyuganov, recording about
20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Observers believe that many of the other 11 presidential
candidates actually stand no chance of winning the elections.
</P>
<P>
According to VTsIOM, even if Putin cannot make it in the first
round, he will do in he run-off. He is expected to gain two thirds
of the votes if his rival is Gennady Zyuganov, and three fourths
of the votes if the opponent is Grigory Yavlinsky, said Alexey
Grazhdankin,deputy director of VTsIOM.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Federal Reserve Raises Key Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Reserve on
Tuesday raised its federal funds rate by a quarter-point, the
fifth increase since June, in an effort to slow the speeding
economy and keep inflation at bay.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came after a closed-door meeting of the
central bank's Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest
rate policies.
</P>
<P>
The Fed said it was increasing its target for the federal funds
rate, the interest that banks charge each other on overnight loans,
to 6 percent from 5.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
It also raised its mostly symbolic discount rate, the interest
that the Fed charges to make direct loans to banks, by a quarter-
point to 5.50 percent from 5.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
In a statement explaining its decision, the Fed said it
continues to remain concerned that the rapidly growing economy "
could foster inflationary imbalances that would undermine the
economy's record economic expansion."
</P>
<P>
The Fed had already raised rates four times in quarter-point
steps since June to slow the economy and keep inflation under
control. The increases have done little to either slow the economy
or its main engine, consumer spending, which accounts for two-
thirds of all economic activity.
</P>
<P>
The Fed said future "risks are weighted mainly toward
conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the
foreseeable future."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. economy grew by a breakneck 6.9 percent annual rate in
the final three months of 1999 and many economists believe growth
in the current quarter will come in around 5 percent, far above
the 3.5 percent rate the Fed would like to see at this stage of
the economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has warned in recent
speeches that the strong consumer demand, which he said was being
powered by the surge in wealth created by the stock market, cannot
continue to outstrip supply without triggering serious inflation
problems.
</P>
<P>
"The Committee remains concerned that increases in demand will
continue to exceed the growth in potential supply, which could
foster inflationary imbalances that would undermine the economy's
record economic expansion," the Fed said in its statement.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Twelve candidates, led by acting
President Vladimir Putin, will stand in Russia's presidential
elections Sunday. Following is part of a list of the presidential
hopefuls:
</P>
<P>
Grigory Yavlinsky -- a liberal economist, lawmaker and the head
of the liberal Yabloko party, who also ran in the last
presidential election in 1996 and came fourth. He supports market
reforms with a human face and has promised an end to the Chechen
war if elected.
</P>
<P>
Yavlinsky is well known in the West but he and his party have
never won more than 10 percent of the vote in a whole string of
Russian elections. Opinion polls put his rating in single figures.
</P>
<P>
Yavlinsky's party polled less than 6 percent in the December
parliamentary elections, and is expected to fare correspondingly
in the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
He has sharply criticized Putin's performance in his role as
acting president.
</P>
<P>
In his opinion, Putin's term in the office "has resulted in the
communist takeover of the State Duma or the lower house of the
parliament, the concentration of capital in the hands of oligarchs,
immense spending on the war in Chechnya, with which no economic
growth is feasible, and the imposition of political censorship."
</P>
<P>
Putin has not moved forward in any area and he "will not
succeed in carrying out a program for pulling the country out of
crisis," Yavlinsky said. "The only to have happened is a 30-
percent drop in incomes and the standard of living," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Yavlinsky said he hopes that he will defeat Zyuganov in the
first round of voting and square off with Putin in the second, run-
off round.
</P>
<P>
He believes that political talks are the only way to resolve
the Chechnya crisis and authorities of all levels should be
elected, not appointed.
</P>
<P>
- - - -
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Zhirinovsky -- born April 25, 1946, an outspoken and
flamboyant nationalist, leader of the Liberal-Democratic Party,
was registered on March 7 after the Supreme Court overturned
orders banning him from the race for not declaring property
belonging to his son.
</P>
<P>
Zhirinovsky, whose anti-Western tirades have gained him
notoriety in Russia and abroad, came in third in 1991 presidential
elections. He was elected to parliament and finished fifth in the
1996 presidential race, but has lost much of his following in
recent years and is not expected to fare well this time.
</P>
<P>
He has been a fixture in the lower house of parliament, the
State Duma, since 1993. His antics -- including dousing fellow
deputies with water and pulling a colleague's hair -- have given
him a reputation as the bad boy of Russian politics.
</P>
<P>
Despite his ultranationalist views, Zhirinovsky's party has
consistently followed the Kremlin line in key votes in recent
years.The trend has alienated many of his original supporters.
</P>
<P>
Zhirinovsky, who is now a deputy speaker in parliament,
promised to establish a "military-police state,'' increase the
size of the army and restore the feared Soviet-era KGB if elected
president.
</P>
<P>
Russia needs a "firm president who will be feared,'' and "
democracy will lead this country to an abyss," he said, quoted by
the Interfax news agency.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Commission on
Human Rights should be a forum of dialogue and cooperation for the
promotion and protection of human rights instead of a battlefield
of ideology, said Chinese Ambassador Qiao Zonghuai here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that this session of the commission will pursue the
principle of dialogue and cooperation and conduct calm and in-
depth discussion on human rights issues concerned by international
community," Qiao told the 53-member commission at its 56th session
in a written statement. "In the new century, the commission should
take on a new face and discard all 'Cold War' practices."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese ambassador also expressed hope that the current
session would take concrete actions to redress the imbalance
between the two categories of rights, adding that human rights are
not the rights of a few countries nor the rights of the rich, but
the rights of all people.
</P>
<P>
He said that the commission should take the suggestions by some
regional groups and countries into account and adopt effective
measures to improve efficiency of the commission.
</P>
<P>
The suggestions include to reduce the session to four weeks by
reclustering and biennializing of agenda items. The 56th session
meets from March 20 to April 28.

<HEADLINE> Britain Keen to Restore N.Irish Home Rule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Northern Ireland
Secretary Peter Mandelson said on Tuesday that all sides in the
peace process must make new compromises and take fresh risks if
there is to be political progress.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson was speaking after talks with Irish Foreign Minister
Brian Cowen in Dublin on Tuesday aimed at working towards trying
to find a plan to revive the stalled process.
</P>
<P>
The Northern Ireland secretary said there was no room for
threatened vetoes or unjustified preconditions. He added that he
wanted to restore home rule to the province as early as possible
after suspending its fledgling administration last month.
</P>
<P>
But he defended recent comments by Ulster Unionist leader David
Trimble that he might now be prepared to re-enter the assembly
with Sinn Fein before IRA decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson said: "I don't think he has softened his position.It
is same position he had when he went into government. What he
wants is some clarity and some clear understanding about what
others are going to do. That is not unreasonable."
</P>
<P>
He added: "I think that with a bit of give and take that is
what we can produce. But everyone has to play their part in making

Irish Foreign Minister Brian Cowen said: "We were getting an
opportunity to meet today to take stock of our meetings and
discussions in Washington and also to prepare the ground for a
meeting between the Prime Minister (Tony Blair) and the Taoiseach
(Bertin Ahern) in Lisbon later on in the week."

The leaders of the province's pro-Agreement parties traveled to
the United States last week to take part in the St Patrick's Day

<P>
The process has been stagnating since mid-February, when the
British government suspended the fledgling power-sharing
government, in the absence of any handover of IRA weapons.
</P>
<P>
The two governments had hoped relations between the parties
would be repaired and progress made while they were in Washington.
</P>
<P>
But no way forward to break the deadlock over the
decommissioning issue emerged from the talks.
</P>
<P>
Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble said earlier this week he
was "completely relaxed" about the possibility of a leadership
challenge at his party's annual general meeting on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Britain Welcomes Handover of Croatian Indictee to War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 21 (Xinhua)-- Britain on Tuesday welcomed the
handover by the Croatian government to the International Criminal
Tribunal of ailing Bosnian Croat warlord Mladen Naletilic Tuta.
</P>
<P>
"This latest move confirms that the new Croatian government
sees its future as part of the modern Europe," Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"It realizes that there can be no hiding place in this modern
Europe for those accused of war crimes," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Naletilic, who was charged in December 1998 by the
International Criminal Tribunal for Former Yugoslavia with the
murder,persecution and torture of Moslems in southern Bosnia, was
flown to The Hague in a special plane and arrived in the tribunal'
s detention center early in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Croatian President Stipe Mesic was "starting to steer Croatia
away from its troubled past, setting an example for others in the
region to follow," Cook said in the statement.

<P>
ATHENS, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Greece's Coalition of the Left
party Tuesday called for vigilance against the reappearance of far-
right forces in Europe.
</P>
<P>
In an announcement issued on the occasion of World Anti-Racism
Day, the left-wing party stated that European countries, including
Greece, were now faced with increasing cases of racist conduct and
xenophobia.
</P>
<P>
The party added that the strengthening of far-right forces in
many European countries necessitated vigilance and immediate
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
The party also proposed the enactment by Greece of a law
against discrimination, the establishment of an anti-racism
training lesson at schools and the banning of racist propaganda by
the mass media.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Prudent over Elion's Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. District Judge K. Michael Moore's 50-page ruling dismissed
the lawsuit filed by Elian's great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez, who
wants to keep Elian against the wishes of the boy's father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
``Determination to grant asylum is a matter within the
discretion of the attorney general,'' Moore wrote. The ruling came
12 days after Moore held a hearing on the case.
</P>
<P>
Elian's fate has been debated since he was found clinging to an
inner tube off Florida on Nov. 25. His mother and 10 others
drowned when their boat capsized during an attempt to reach the
United States. The case has become a tug of war between the Cuban
government and family members in the United States who oppose the
Cuban government's Communist ideology and want to raise the
motherless boy.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Attorney General Janet Reno said the decision
reaffirms the Clinton administration's position that ``only Elian'
s father can speak for his son on federal immigration matters. ...
It is time for this little boy, who has been through so much, to
move on with his life at his father's side.''

<HEADLINE> Israelis, Palestinians Start Talks at Bolling Air Force Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
delegations started their peace talks on Tuesday at Bolling Air
Force Base southeast of Washington, in hope to reach a framework
agreement for September 13 final status talks.
</P>
<P>
Both U.S. and Palestinian spokesmen tried to play down
expectations of dramatic progress, despite improvement of
atmosphere after Israel began another stage of withdrawal from the
West Bank earlier on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said earlier that
there were "a substantial amount of time to overcome differences"
on many profound issues and therefore no breakthroughs should be
harbored at an early stage of the talks.
</P>
<P>
"The goal is for it to be a serious brainstorming session where
the parties can really talk about the issues in a more free-
flowing fashion than they have been able to do to date," he said.
</P>
<P>
"These kinds of issues don't get solved quickly but in order to
get solved they have to be fully explored in as intensive a way as
possible," he added.
</P>
<P>
U.S. mediators will take part in some of the sessions. U.S.
envoy Dennis Ross earlier met the two delegations separately.
After that the two side sat down for serious talks.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said U.S. mediators were not going to present any ideas,
but help both sides brainstorm.
</P>
<P>
"At a later stage, perhaps, we might have more ideas of our own,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat told reporters that he did
not expect any breakthroughs, only expect the Israeli side to take
the negotiations "seriously."
</P>
<P>
The Bolling talks will mainly focus on "final status" issues,
such as borders, Jerusalem, the status of the Palestinian
territories and the fate of Palestinian refugees and Jewish
settlements.
</P>
<P>
The aim is to reach a framework agreement on these disputes by
May and a final agreement by September 13.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Missile Defense Test Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The announcement was made at a press conference by Ronald
Kadish, director of the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization of
the Defense Department.
</P>
<P>
However, Kadish said the Pentagon still will be able to tell
President Bill Clinton this summer whether its anti-missile system
is technically ready to be deployed despite a new delay in testing.
</P>
<P>
Until now, the Pentagon had said it would make an assessment in
June of the system's readiness to deploy. Because the next test
has been delayed until June, the assessment will be done in July,
Kadish said.
</P>
<P>
The assessment in July will be done after 30 days of analysis
of the June test results -- half the time that Kadish's office has
taken to analyze the results of previous tests. Only 85 percent of
the data from the June test will be available for consideration by
July, but that will be sufficient, Kadish said.
</P>
<P>
The July review will still leave Clinton time to decide, by
October or November, whether to proceed with deployment, he said.
</P>
<P>
If Clinton were to wait beyond November, the Pentagon could not
remain on track to completing the construction required at bases
in Alaska in order to have the anti-missile system operating by
the target date of 2005, Kadish said.
</P>
<P>
So far, two tests have been staged of the system's ability to
intercept a target missile in space. The first, last fall,
succeeded. The second, in January, failed.
</P>
<P>
The international community is opposed to the U.S. national
missile defense system, which is prohibited by the 1972 Anti-
ballistic Missile treaty. The Clinton administration wants to
amend the treaty to permit such defenses.
</P>
<P>
Kadish said he remains confident that the Pentagon can make an
informed recommendation this summer, despite the test schedule
delay.
</P>
<P>
The missile defense system would use a network of radars and
interceptor missiles based in Alaska to detect, track and shoot
down long-range ballistic missiles outside the Earth's atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Arms control experts said the U.S. decision to set up the anti-
missile national defense system will aggravate the arms race, thus
affecting world peace and stability.

MOSCOW, March 22 (Xinhua) -- One of the 12 candidates vying for

Acting President Vladimir Putin remains the runaway favorite.
Recent opinion polls put his approval rating at around 60 percent,
well above the 50 percent needed to win in the first round.

JOHANNESBURG, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Parts of the South African

Press Association reported on Tuesday.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) Tuesday called for consolidation of
regional integration by African, Caribbean and Pacific countries
(ACP) as their first step to merge into the world economy.
</P>
<P>
"ACP countries have done well over the years to create regional
identity and must now consolidate it," said Executive Secretary of
the Africa's largest regional economic organization Iansana
Kouyate.
</P>
<P>
Represented by his deputy Francis Ofei, he said in a written
speech addressed to the on-going 30th joint parliamentary assembly
of the ACP-EU (European Union) in Nigeria's capital Abuja that the
ACP countries must avoid smaller-group fragmentation, which will
sue to weaken the regional scheme.
</P>
<P>
He said that the ECOWAS, with some 214 million people and an
estimated Gross Domestic Product of 107 billion U.S. dollars, was
in the process of harmonizing its commercial laws with a view to
providing economic operators with the legal instruments necessary
for developing cross-border trade.
</P>
<P>
According to Kouyate, the ACP secretariat and its ECOWAS
counterpart had established contact toward enhancing cooperation
between the two organizations and reinforcing the ACP group.

<HEADLINE> Electoral Commission Inaugurated in S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone's President Ahmed
Tejan Kabbah on Monday swore in an electoral commission to oversee
future general elections as designated by the Lome peace accord,
reports reaching here on Tuesday said.
</P>
<P>
According to the accord, signed last July in the Togolese
capital by Kabbah administration and Foday Sankoh's Revolutionary
United Front (RUF), the poll should be held after all rebels are
disarmed.
</P>
<P>
The peace accord gave the former rebels a full pardon plus some
cabinet posts in a transitional government.
</P>
<P>
But many RUF fighters, who still control much of eastern Sierra
Leone, have refused to turn in weapons and blocked U.N.
peacekeeping troops from deploying in the areas under their
control.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the U.N. Security Council increased the
peacekeepers in Sierra Leone to 11,100 from 6,000. But as of early
March, only 5,880 troops had been deployed.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations
Bernard Miyet, who is on a visit to the west African country,
pledged on Sunday that the U. N. would finish the full deployment
within three or four months.
</P>
<P>
More than 50,000 civilians of the country's 4.5 million people
were killed and even more maimed in a nine-year civil war which
started in 1991.

<HEADLINE> German Minister Criticizes U.S. Boycott Against Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The German government will not
follow Washington's anti-Cuba policy, but is interested in "open
political dialogues," a German minister said Tuesday in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul, Minister of Development, criticized
anti-Cuba policy of Washington while meeting with Cuban Vice
President Carlos Lage.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone who has seen the situation (in Cuba) knows that the
ten-years of boycott and U.S. embargo against Cuba have made no
contribution to improving the situation there," she said after the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The German government will keep on its "open political
dialogues" with Cuba and stick to development policy, she said.
</P>
<P>
"We will not gloss over facts, but either will we take any
ideological blinker," stressed Wiezorek-Zeul, who is due to visit
Havana this May as the first German cabinet member.
</P>
<P>
Berlin decided at the end of year 1999 to provide Cuba with 11
million marks as first official development help.
</P>
<P>
But the German marks from Berlin are not without prerequisite,
Wieczorek-Zeul said, insisting that Cuba must "improve its human
rights conditions" and "enhance people's participation in politics.
"
</P>
<P>
Lage, the first Cuban state leader to visit Germany in 40
years, said he was pleased with the talks with Wieczorek-Zeul.
</P>
<P>
"Of course we have disputes, but there are many fields for
Cuba and Germany to cooperate, for example, tourism," said Lage.
</P>
<P>
Lage cited more than 200 000 German guests visited Cuba last
year, and the number would further rise.
</P>
<P>
The German-Cuban trade soared last year, when Cuban exports to
Germany grew by 50 percent to 75.6 million marks and imports from
Germany valued at 128.6 million marks, Lage said.
</P>
<P>
Lage is due to meet with German Foreign Minister Joschka
Fischer and Economics Minister Werner Mueller Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> British Chancellor Unveils Budget 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 21 (Xinhua) -- British Chancellor of the
Exchequer Gordon Brown Tuesday announced a 2-billion-pound
spending boost for the National Health Service (NHS) in a budget
targeting health, education and e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
Delivering his budget in the Commons, Brown gave a glowing
picture of the economy since the Labor party came to power in 1997,
saying inflation was low and under control.
</P>
<P>
"Britain has been growing steadily while meeting inflation
target," the Chancellor said. He predicted Britain would
experience economic growth in the coming year of 2.75-3.25 percent,
nearly double the figure forecast a year ago.
</P>
<P>
With Britain's finances in robust shape, Brown also raised his
forecast to a likely surplus of 12 billion pounds from a previous
3-billion-pound deficit.
</P>
<P>
He ruled out the additional cut in the basic tax rate that some
economists had predicted, and the opposition party had demanded.
</P>
<P>
Announcing "radical reform" to business taxation, the
chancellor said that his reforms would allow the UK to"meet and
master a tide of technological change" and lead the way into the e-
commerce future.
</P>
<P>
"We want to catch up with the U.S. as soon as possible,"he said,
giving small businesses tax rebates on computers and equipment
they buy to enter the world of e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the budget, an observers said that the budget had
few major surprises and looked set to keep Britain's economy
moving ahead steadily.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Rise On Confidence In Inflation Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stock rose sharply
Tuesday as investors were convinced that the Federal Reserve will
reach its goal soon in fighting inflation by raising interest
rates once again.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 227.10 at 10,907.34,
extending its gain of 85.01 points Monday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mostly higher. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index rose 37.24 at 1,493.87 and the technology heavy
Nasdaq composite index rose 101.68 at 4,711.68.
</P>
<P>
The market rallied after the Federal Reserve announced its
decision to raise short-term interest rates by a quarter-
percentage point. It's the fifth increase since last June in a pre-
emptive move to ward off inflation.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said investors are increasingly confident that the
Federal Reserve's long cycled of rate increase is almost over.
Financial stocks that are most sensitive to inflation led the Dow'
s advance. Cyclical companies were also higher.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq index bounced back from a loss of as much as 100
points in early trading. Cisco Systems and Yahoo! led the index
higher.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 11.65 at 642.79 and the Russell 2000 index
of smaller companies rose 3.59 at 552.79. But the American Stock
Exchange index fell 2.44 at 1,003.83.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an 11-to-7 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,810 up, 1,161 down and 504
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume increased to 1.05 billion shares from 912.92
million in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumers Showing Interest in Online Beauty Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Online beauty product sales
accounted one percent of the U.S. beauty market in 1999, but could
gain significant market share in the near term, according to a
report released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Last year, American consumers spent more than 25 billion U.S.
dollars on beauty products, of which 250 million dollars worth of
goods were purchased online, said the report from market
information provider NPD Group.
</P>
<P>
While a relatively small percentage of Internet users reported
previously purchasing beauty products online, said the report,
nearly two-thirds of those polled said they would consider doing
so in the future. A total of 3,400 consumers were surveyed in
January 2000.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, fragrance, makeup and skin care
products accounted for two percent of all health and beauty
products online. Fifteen percent of consumers with Web access have
shopped on the Internet for fragrances, makeup, skin care, bath
and body or hair products.
</P>
<P>
Convenience, not price, is driving most of these consumers to
the Internet for beauty products, the report said. Seventy-five
percent of online beauty shoppers cited "shop anytime" as a reason
for choosing the Internet over traditional retail stores.
</P>
<P>
Brand name has also emerged as another important factor in
online beauty purchasing decisions. Sixty-four percent of online
beauty purchasers said they mostly buy products that they have
tried before.
</P>
<P>
The most visited beauty e-commerce sites are those that have
existed for a longer time and have a high level of advertising,
according to the report. Sites that focus on health and beauty are
more visited than beauty-only sites.

<TEXT>
<P>
Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said that Predator and Hunter
drones, known as "unmanned aerial vehicles" (UAVs), are being
dispatched but he would not say how many army troops will be sent
to operate them from ground stations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a daily briefing, Bacon also dismissed a report
that Kosovo Albanian militias are close to a conditional agreement
to suspend attacks against Serbs beyond the U.S.-patrolled sector
of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post reported Tuesday that ethnic Albanian
militias are close to an agreement to suspend attacks against
Belgrade security forces in Serbia, just beyond the U.S.-patrolled
sector of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted officials as saying that "in exchange... U.
S. peacekeepers will agree to refrain from cracking down on ethnic
Albanian fighters as forcefully as they did last Wednesday when
more than 300 U.S.troops descended on five militia staging areas
and arms caches, arresting nine alleged insurgents."
</P>
<P>
Bacon said he knows of no agreement "on the horizon of that
type." "What I can tell you is that we have been working very
hard to convince the Kosovar Albanians not to be provocative, not
to attack Serbs, either in Kosovo or outside Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
But Bacon added that the multinational forces in Kosovo reserve
the right to search Albanian arms caches and stop provocative acts.
</P>
<P>
"We very much reserve the right to act on credible intelligence
to go after arms caches if we believe they're there and we can
find them.This is what we did last week, and we reserve the right

<HEADLINE> Only 4 to 5 Million Visitors Expected in Italy This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Tourist companies are radically
downgrading estimates of how many extra visitors are expected to
visit Rome for the ongoing Holy Year, from over 20 million to no
more than 4-5 million.
</P>
<P>
The new estimate was given by Piergiorgio Togni, general
manager at Enit, the Italian tourist board, who told the weekly,
Oggi, that the original estimates were "rather unrealistic".
</P>
<P>
The magazine suggested that spending on Holy Year facilities
may have been radically overdone, although the facilities will
certainly come in useful to the city's normal residents.
</P>
<P>
Photos illustrating the interview showed desolately empty
spaces at the major facilities set up or even custom built for the
Holy Year -at the new and widely criticized subterranean car and
coach park under the Janiculum hill, on the special J- line buses
laid on by Rome's city council and the special welcome center set
up at the Termini central train station.
</P>
<P>
Togni told the weekly that the initial figures were based on
nothing more than a poll of practicing Catholics in dioceses
throughout the world on whether they planned to go to Rome for the
Holy Year.
</P>
<P>
"It's one thing to say you intend or would like to make a
journey,something quite different to actually make it," he said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the year, said Togni, "our forecasts say Rome
will have seen about nine million visitors, up 9 percent on last
year."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Supreme Court Opposes Government's Regulation of Tobacco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Supreme Court ruled
Tuesday that the government lacks authority to regulate tobacco as
an addictive drug.
</P>
<P>
Ruling 5-4, the justices said the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA)overreached when it reversed a decades-old policy in 1996 and
sought to crack down on cigarette sales to minors.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that Congress has clearly precluded the FDA from
asserting jurisdiction to regulate tobacco products," Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor wrote for the court.
</P>
<P>
Today's ruling was considered a blow to the Clinton
administration's main anti-smoking initiative, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
In response, President Clinton urged Congress to pass a law
letting the FDA reinstate its rules cracking down on cigarette
sales to minors.
</P>
<P>
"If we are to protect our children from the harms of tobacco,
Congress must now enact the provisions of the FDA rule," Clinton
said in a statement issued while he was traveling in India.
</P>
<P>
But the ruling was warmly welcomed by the tabacco industry that
has been under increasing pressure for selling a product the
American Cancer Society calls the leading cause of cancer.
</P>
<P>
Mark Smith, spokesman for Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp.,said
that "business and industry throughout the nation ought to breathe
a sigh of relief."
</P>
<P>
"The highest court in the land has confirmed that a federal
agency cannot on its own go beyond its limits of authority set by
Congress," he said.

<HEADLINE> Candidate Pull Out of Russian Presidential Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 22 (Xinhua) -- One of the 12 candidates vying for
the Russian presidency dropped out of the race late Tuesday, just
minutes before the deadline allowed under law.
</P>
<P>
Yevgeny Savostyanov, told the NTV commercial television of his
decision at 23:47 local time (20:47 GMT) and called on his
supporters to back Grigory Yavlinsky, leader of the liberal
Yabloko party in Sunday's voting.
</P>
<P>
Savostyanov, the former head of the Moscow department of the
Federal Security Service and member of the Kremlin staff, serves
as head of the Moscow fund of presidential programs.
</P>
<P>
Observers believe the latest development would not have any
major impact on the outcome of the elections as Savostyanov was
expected to get less than 1 percent of the votes if he stayed in
the race.
</P>
<P>
Acting President Vladimir Putin remains the runaway favorite.
Recent opinion polls put his approval rating at around 60 percent,
well above the 50 percent needed to win in the first round.
</P>
<P>
Communist party leader Gennady Zyuganov is expected to garner
20 percent of the votes, followed by Yavlinsky and ultra-
nationallist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, leader of the Liberal
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, Zhirinovsky offered to quit the race and
support either Zyuganov or Yavlinsky as the only other candidate
to face Putin. Or if they refuse, Zhirinovsky said, he would
volunteer as the only opposition candidate to confront Putin.
</P>
<P>
The offer was rejected by many of the candidates and Putin
described it as "unexpected as Zhirinovsky's visit to the Gypsies.
"
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Zhirinovsky was shown on national
television seeking the service of a Gypsy fortune teller, who
predicted that someone with the V. V. initials would win the race.
Both Putin and Zhirinovsky's first and middle names begin with the
letter V.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Supports UNMOT Withdrawal From Tajikistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council on Tuesday voiced its support for U.N. Secretary-
General Kofi Annan's intention to withdraw the U.N. mission in
Tajikistan when its mandate expires in May.
</P>
<P>
The move came after the Security Council reviewed the latest
report by the Secretary-General on the current situation in
Tajikistan, in which he said the United Nations Mission of
Observers in Tajikistan (UNMOT) has played an important role in
the country through its active involvement in bringing about the
peace agreement and insuring its implementation, as well as in
monitoring the country's first multi-party elections held on
February 27.
</P>
<P>
In a presidential statement, the Council welcomed decisive
progress in the implementation of the General agreement on the
Establishment of Peace and National Accord in Tajikistan of 1997
thanks to sequential and persistent efforts of the President of
the Tajikistan and the leadership of the Commission on National
Reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
The Council welcomed, in particular, the holding on February 27,
2000 of the first multi-party and pluralistic parliamentary
election in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Council urged the Government and the Parliament of
Tajikistan to work towards elections in the future that meet fully
acceptable standards as a means to consolidate peace.
</P>
<P>
UNMOT was established in 1994 to assist in monitoring a
ceasefire agreement. After three years of U.N.-sponsored
negotiations, its mandate was strengthened to allow it to help
promote peace and reconciliation and assist in implementation of
the peace agreement singed in Moscow in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Liu Promotes Beijing Tourism in Berlin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
 BERLIN March 21 (Xinhua)--Beijing and Berlin, two state
capitals with great cultural tradition, should enhance their
friendship with more direct contact among their residents,
visiting Beijing mayor Liu Qi Tuesday said here.
</P>
<P>
 One kind of this friendly exchange is tourism, he added at a
reception hosted by his Berlin counterpart Eberhard Diepgen.
</P>
<P>
"We hope, that with tourism and the common love to our
historical and cultural inheritance, we can enhance understanding
and friendship between our two nations, and make contribution to
the peace and development of the world," said Liu.
</P>
<P>
Liu presented Dipgen and some 300 guests with not only the
traditional scenarios in Beijing, but also the development of
Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
"With the beginning of our reforming and opening policy,
Beijing has been modernized. Now it has become an international
and modern metropolis," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yu Changjiang, director of Beijing Tourism Agency, introduced
the latest changes in downtown Beijing with dozens of projection
photos. And Hu Xiaodan, whom the Beijing officials called "the top
designer of our city," presented his works symbolizing the Beijing
Imperial Palace.
</P>
<P>
The German capital laid much importance to Liu's visit. A
statement of Diepgen said, "it is very good that German capital
links with the capital of China as a partner. Your visit has
brought something lively to the partnership between our two cities.
