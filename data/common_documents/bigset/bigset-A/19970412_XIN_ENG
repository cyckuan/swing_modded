<HEADLINE> France Urges Iran Not to Retaliate Against Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 11 (Xinhua) -- France today urged Iran not to
retaliate against Germany, one day after a German court accused
Tehran of masterminding the assassination of three Iranian Kurds
and their interpreter in Berlin in September 1992.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt said, "In
the immediate future, France is particularly attentive to the
arrangements Iran will make to prevent any inappropriate reaction
toward the citizens or the interests of Germany and, in a general
way, of Europe."
</P>
<P>
"The solidarity of France with Germany is complete in this
affair," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
A court in Berlin sentenced an Iranian grocer and a Lebanese
accomplice to life in prison for their role in killing the Kurds
in the Mykonos restaurant in Berlin, and Germany recalled its
ambassador from Tehran after the ruling, an action which was
echoed by all the European Union countries.
</P>
<P>
In reaction, the Iranian government has expelled four German
diplomats and recalled its own ambassador from Bonn, while about
800 Iranians staged a demonstration today in front of the German
embassy in Tehran to protest the court ruling.
</P>
<P>
On the perspective of economic damage Iran can bring to France,
the spokesman said, "The risk for France is not an economic or
trade risk. France is a trade partner of second importance for
Iran."
</P>
<P>
"In 1996, France imported a little more than 6 billion francs
(1.2 billion U.S. dollars) from Iran, with the petroleum
representing more than 95 percent of these imports," said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said that France's export to Iran falls well behind those by
the United States, Germany, Italy and Britain.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also reaffirmed France's opposition to a proposal
by the United States to impose an economic embargo upon Iran,
saying that embargo does not appear to be a proper way.

<HEADLINE> US Retail Sales Slow to 0.2 Percent Gain in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. retail sales slowed to an
increase of 0.2 percent in March, the smallest gain in four
months, the U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that sales totaled a seasonally adjusted
215.6 billion dollars, up slightly from 215.1 billion in February.
It was the smallest increase since a 0.1 percent drop last
November.
</P>
<P>
The report also revised the gain of sales in February up to 1.5
percent from the initial estimate of 0.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
It said that sales of durable goods, items expected to last for
more than three years, edged up 0.1 percent after roaring ahead
3.1 percent in February. It was the smallest advance since a 0.3
percent decline in November.
</P>
<P>
Auto sales, which posted a 3.3 percent increase in February,
dropped by 0.6 percent, the first loss since a 0.9 percent decline
in November.
</P>
<P>
Sales of nondurable goods such as food and fuel were up by 0.3
percent, also the smallest since a 0.1 percent gain in November.
The nondurable category posted a 0.4 percent gain in February.
</P>
<P>
Retail sales in the U.S. represent about one-third of the
economic activity. Consumer spending has been a major driving
force for the strong U.S. economic expansion in recent months.

<HEADLINE> US Producer Prices Down for 3rd Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. producer prices declined
for the third month in a row mainly resulting from the largest
decline in energy costs in six years.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Labor Department reported today that prices paid to
producers such as farms and factories fell by 0.1 percent last
month, following drops of 0.4 percent in February and 0.3 percent
in January.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that the Producer Price Index (PPI) in
the U.S. recorded three consecutive declines since 1993.
</P>
<P>
But the report said the closely-watched core prices -- outside
food and energy -- shot up unexpectedly by 0.4 percent in March,
the largest in 14 months.
</P>
<P>
In March, the wholesale cost of energy fell by 3.4 percent, the
largest decline since March 1991.
</P>
<P>
Food prices rose by 0.9 percent, the first increase since
October. Among them, beef price jumped 6.8 percent, fish rose 7.9
percent and vegetables increased by 13.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Prices at the finished level outside food and energy were
propelled by a 2.5 percent increase in tobacco, the largest since
May, and rises in civilian aircraft, books, prescription drugs and
alcoholic beverages.
</P>
<P>
Energy declines also helped push down indexes for prices at
earlier stages of the production process. Intermediate goods fell
by 0.6 percent and crude goods declined by 6.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The PPI measures the cost of goods before they reach consumers.
Its movement offers important clues for the future behavior of the
Consumer Price Index, which tracks the prices of services and
retail goods.

<HEADLINE> New Analysis: Cost Another Hurdle to NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The question of cost for NATO's
eastward expansion seems to have been neglected because so much
time has been devoted to discussing the "who and when" factors of
the move.
</P>
<P>
However, cost looms large as the final decision on which
countries should be taken in draw near.
</P>
<P>
The scheduled Madrid NATO summit in July is expected to decide
on new members for the 16-country bloc.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Russia's firm opposition to the enlargement plan,
the huge cost of the project is viewed by some experts as another
hurdle that the alliance can hardly leap over.
</P>
<P>
Studies by the Pentagon and independent United States think
tanks show the cost could be astronomical.
</P>
<P>
The Congressional Budget Office of the United States estimated
the cost of the planned expansion to be as high as 61 to 125
billion U.S. dollars, through to the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
The Rand Corporation, a California-based think tank, came up
with a modest estimate of 14 to 110 billion dollars over the next
decade.
</P>
<P>
The White House, which is firm and eager on pushing forward the
expansion process, predicted in February that it might cost
between 27 and 35 billion dollars to take in Poland, Hungary and
the Czech Republic, which are most likely to be the first
countries to join the alliance in 1999.
</P>
<P>
What will be the amount of money is not important. The real
question is where it will come from.
</P>
<P>
First, there is not even slightest chance of increases in
defense budgets of major NATO members. On the contrary, defense
spending is declining among member states.
</P>
<P>
The organization's major European allies are cutting their
armed forces as they try hard to meet European Economic and
Monetary Union (EMU) criteria.
</P>
<P>
The EMU, which hopes to launch a single European currency by
the year 1999, has established a budget deficit ceiling of three
percent of the GDP.
</P>
<P>
Extra funds for NATO expansion are hardly an option in view for
these countries.
</P>
<P>
Alliance budgets, such as the common infrastructure program,
known as the Security Investment Program, are already modest in
scale and are earmarked for agreed on measures.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, it seems to be paradoxical for new NATO members to
spend more money on their armed forces at a time when economic
revival and social reform need all the financial resources they
can get.
</P>
<P>
The annual defense budget of the Czech Republic is just 1.1
billion dollars, while Hungary has only 600 million dollars to
spend each year on its entire defense needs.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, money has traditionally been a major obstacle for new
NATO initiatives.
</P>
<P>
How to share the heavy burden of the expansion cost will become
a major controversy among the 16 NATO members once the enlargement
process is formally begun at the Madrid summit.
</P>
<P>
"There's going to be a big fight within the alliance over who
will pay what. They haven't even warmed up for that one yet," a
NATO official warned.
</P>
<P>
The alliance's eastward expansion, which has already met strong
opposition from Russia since it tries to take in Central and
Eastern European countries, allies of the Soviet Union in the Cold
War era, is not likely to be a smooth process.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
met Iranian parliament speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri in the
Kremlin today, Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Yeltsin said he was satisfied with
Russian-Iranian relations and cooperation. A sound beneficial
cooperation had been established between Russia and Iran and this
was further developing.
</P>
<P>
The range of cooperation between Russia and Iran, in Yeltsin's
opinion, was reason enough to say that relations between the two
states would develop and strengthen further.
</P>
<P>
Nateq-Nouri also expressed his satisfaction with the
Iranian-Russian relations.
</P>
<P>
At a plenary session of the Russian State Duma (the lower house)
after the meeting, Nateq-Nouri said Iranian-Russian relations were
based "on a stable foundation, long-term prospects and unchanging
interests."
</P>
<P>
He hoped to increase economic cooperation with Russia,
including cooperation in energy sources.

<HEADLINE> US Chrysler Auto Workers Strike Shuts 4 Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- A strike by 1,800 engine-plant
workers forced the U.S. No. 3 automaker Chrysler Corp. to shut
down its four profitable light-truck plants, according to reports
reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The workers' strike kicked off at midnight Wednesday at the
Mound Road Engine Plant that is the sole supplier of engines for
some of the automaker's pickup trucks following failed
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Main issues in bargaining for a new local contract included
health and safety, discrimination against minority employees and
Chrysler's shifting of some engine component production to outside
suppliers, noted a strike leader.
</P>
<P>
The plant is the sole provider of V-6 and V-8 engines for Ram
and Dakota pickup trucks built at the Dodge City assembly complex
in nearby Warren. It is the primary source of engines for Ram
pickups assembled at St. Louis, although that plant uses some
engines made in Toluca, Mexico, it was reported.
</P>
<P>
The plant also is the only source of V-8 engines used in
Chrysler's popular Jeep Grand Cherokee sport utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
The Mound Road plant also builds V-10 engines used in the
limited-production Dodge Viper and some Ram pickups.
</P>
<P>
The strike is expected to cost Chrysler as much as 11 million
U.S. dollars a day in net income, estimated an industrial analyst.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between the company and representatives of the
United Auto Workers began in early January. The engine plant was
the last of Chrysler's U.S. manufacturing facilities where a local
contract had not been reached.

<HEADLINE> S. African Mining Companies Concerned About </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 11 (Xinhua) -- South African mining
companies have been closely watching the domestic situation in
Zaire, one of Africa's mining powers, after rebels seized
Lubumbashi, capital of the cooper-rich province of Shaba.
</P>
<P>
Southern African Broadcasting Association quoted informed
sources as saying today that at least three South African mining
companies have submitted tenders to develop Zairean copper mines.
</P>
<P>
De Beers, South Africa's diamonds giant, said it had five
diamond buying offices in Zaire and a contract with a Zairean
mining company to buy its products.
</P>
<P>
Lubumbashi fell to the rebels on Wednesday after stiff
resistance by the elite Presidential Security Division.
</P>
<P>
Rebel leader Laurent Kabila has announced a three-day truce to
allow President Mobutu Sese Seko to surrender power, warning that
his troops would resume fighting if the ailing Zairean leader did
not take the offer.

<HEADLINE> British Small Businessmen Support Labor Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- More than 80 leaders of Britain's
small companies have voiced their support for Tony Blair's Labor
party, claiming that the ruling Conservative party has failed to
support them in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
In a letter in The Times newspaper today, the industrialists
argued that there have been 11 tax increases and red tape had
expanded rather than contracted under the Conservatives.
</P>
<P>
"A small business has gone bust every three minutes of every
working day since 1992. (John) Major's belated announcement
earlier this week on business rates will do too little to make up
for what we have lost," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that small business can look forward with
confidence to a profitable future with a Labor government," it
added.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said that the open letter of these small
business people was another blow to the embattled Conservative
party, which has claimed to be the party of small business.
</P>
<P>
In a business manifesto due to be launched later today, the
Labor party, which is leading the Conservatives by some 20
percentage points in opinion polls, would unveil plans to get more
private funding into public projects.

<HEADLINE> UK Interest Rates Left Unchanged Before Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Britain's official interest rates
were left unchanged at the current 6 percent today and there will
be no interest rate rise before the general election on May 1, the
Bank of England said in a statement today.
</P>
<P>
The central bank's statement was issued following Chancellor
Kenneth Clarke's last monthly monetary meeting before the general
election with Bank of England governor Eddie George Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Although the minutes of Thursday's meeting will not be
published until the end of May, analysts believed that George was
most likely to have advised an increase in interest rates to guard
against inflation, as he has every month since November.
</P>
<P>
But Clarke was thought once again to have rejected the advise
because of the closeness of the general election.
</P>
<P>
It is widely expected that interest rates must rise whichever
party wins the general election after the next monetary meeting on
May 7.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM, Israel (Xinhua) -- Giant Belgian steel company,
Coqril Sambara, has made an initial venture into the Israel
market, reported bi-weekly Israel Business Today.
</P>
<P>
Coqril has established a steel processing plant at Haifa
port together with Haifa-based construction material manufacturer,
Eders.
</P>
<P>
The initial investment in the new company called Edcastel
totals 8 million U.S. dollars, which will be covered in equal
parts by the two companies. The facility will be expanded at a
later stage, bringing the full cost past the 10 million dollars
mark.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- The Israeli diamond industry achieved a dynamic
6.2 percent increase in polished diamond exports in the first two
months of 1997, with January-February sales exceeding 775
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The latest issue of bi-weekly Israel Business attributed much of
the growth to increased sales to the U.S. and Hong Kong which
totaled 450 million and 170 million dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
Israel Diamond Institute (IDI) Chairman, Moshe Schnitzer,
pointed out that buyers in the U.S. market expressed confidence
in Israel's ability to supply a comprehensive range of goods,
from mele'es to larger stones in all qualities.
</P>
<P>
Schnitzer added that the imminent political turnaround in Hong
Kong is not negatively impacting on the local market, and that
Israeli diamantaires are continuously expanding their marketing
network to relatively new consuming centers in southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
A delegation of Israeli diamond cutters recently conducted
seminars on the polished diamond industry in Indonesia and the
Philippines under the auspices of the IDI.
</P>
<P>
More than 600 leaders of the diamond and fine jewelry trades
in both these relatively new markets attended the gatherings. In
view of the size of both markets, the event takes on considerable
importance.
</P>
<P>
Diamond industry is a major foreign currency earner for
Israel. The total exports in 1996 amounted to 3.998 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel is seeking gas imports from neighboring
Egypt despite new tension in the Arab-Israeli relations.
</P>
<P>
The local bi-weekly Israeli Business, which came off the press
today, reported that Israeli Minister of National Infrastructure
Ariel Sharon has met with Egyptian Ambassador to Israel Muhammad
Basyouni to express his country's willingness to start gas
business talks.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has added his weight to the
project following a discussion on the topic with President Hosni
Mubarak during his recent visit to Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptians have warned that they will offer their natural
gas resources to other countries than Israel if significant
headway is not achieved in peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has recently signed gas supply agreements with Jordan and
Turkey, although it is believed that Egypt could also meet
Israel's natural gas requirements if the political atmosphere
permits.
</P>
<P>
The Arab countries have reached a consensus on linking the
economic relations with Israel to the Middle East peace process, a
warning which seemed to be ignored so far by the Israeli
hardliners, now in power.
</P>
<P>

JOHANNESBURG, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The Finnish government
agreed to assist Namibia's rural water supply and forestry
management programs, Southern African Broadcasting Association
(SABA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Finland will provide Namibia with nearly
nine million U.S. Dollars of aid.
</P>
<P>
About eight million U.S. Dollars will be used to finance a
forestry program in the next five years to address institutional
and social problems in the sector, SABA quoted informed sources
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The remaining sum goes to the Namibia's government scheme of
supplying water in the rural areas for 12 months.
</P>
<P>
Namibia, with a population of 1.6 million, is one of the most
drought-prone countries in the Southern African region. Namibian
President Sam Nujoma declared last year a natural disaster
emergency in some parts of the country.

<HEADLINE> Tension Should Not Hurt German-Iran Trade Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 11 (Xinhua) -- German-Iran business ties should not
be impaired by the mounting tension between the two countries
following the "Mykonos" trial in Berlin, Germany's top industrial
organization said today.
</P>
<P>
The German Council of Trade and Industry (DIHT), the umbrella
organization of chambers of commerce, said that a visit by a major
business delegation from Teheran would still go ahead as scheduled
on April 21-25.
</P>
<P>
The Iran delegation, made up of 26 representatives of various
chambers representing different sectors, is expected to visit
Dresden and Hamburg before meeting German companies at DIHT
headquarters in Bonn on April 23, Christoph Wolf, a DIHT official
said.
</P>
<P>
Wolf also said the DIHT was advising German companies to
maintain their business ties with Iran and not to be drawn into
political issues.
</P>
<P>
The DIHT statement came one day after the verdict in Berlin
against four men involved in the murder of four Kurdish opposition
figures in the Mykonos restaurant in Berlin in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The Berlin court said Iranian leaders ordered the killings of
Sadegh Charafkandi, chief of the banned Democratic Kurdish Party
in Iran, and his three aides in 1992, a charge rejected by Iran.
</P>
<P>
Following this, both Germany and Iran have recalled their
ambassadors and expelled four diplomats from each other's
capitals. The European Union (EU) also reacted with a mass recall
of ambassadors and suspension of dialogue with Iran.
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Ministry spokesman, Martin Erdmann, stressed
today that the EU dialogue with Iran was only suspended, not
permanently cancelled. He did not specify how long the suspension
would last.
</P>
<P>
"It is not in our interest in the current situation to pour oil
onto the fire," he said.
</P>
<P>
Germany is currently Iran's biggest trading partner in Europe,
with its exports to Iran reaching 2.2 billion marks (about 1.3
billion U.S. dollars) in 1996. Imports from Iran were 1.1 billion
marks (650 million dollars).

<P>
The Macedonian prime minister also met German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl and Finance Minister Theo Waigel during the past two days.

<HEADLINE> Irish Government Unveils Computer Education Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The Irish government has announced
a 30 million pound (about 48 million U.S. dollar) five-year
investment program in an effort to bring more computer education
into schools.
</P>
<P>
The scheme called Schools IT 2000, which will train 14,000
teachers in information technology education, is designed to get a
computer with internet access into every primary and secondary
school by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the program's introduction ceremony Thursday, Irish
Prime Minister John Bruton said the program could allow Ireland to
take full advantage of the economic, social and educational
benefits of the information society.
</P>
<P>
"We need to be in the forefront of these technologies by moving
forward through three or four stages of technology development in
one leap," he said.
</P>
<P>
The 48-million-dollar budget is to be divided with half for
computer equipment and half for the training of teachers and the
development of practices and curriculum products to be used in
school education programs.
</P>
<P>
Joe O'Toole, general secretary of the Irish National Teachers
Organization, said the project, which "we have been calling for
for quite some time" was "a great advance to bring primary schools
into the next millennium."
</P>
<P>
However, he said one computer per school was not enough to
provide "adequate computer education" for large numbers of
students.

<HEADLINE> Angola's Unity Government Takes Office to End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Angola's government of national
unity and reconciliation was sworn in here today to cement peace
after nearly two decades of civil war in the southern African
country.
</P>
<P>
"It could make a definite contribution to a better solution,"
said President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos in a speech at a ceremony
attended by 13 foreign heads of state.
</P>
<P>
"The formation of this government is another fundamental step
in a long and difficult process of peace," said the president.
"Behind us lie thousands of dead, a devastated country and a
semi-paralysed economy," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Jonas Savimbi, leader of the former rebel movement, the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), did
not show up. He was represented at the ceremony by Antonio Dembo,
his deputy.
</P>
<P>
Eleven UNITA members joined the unity government which has a
total of 80 officials including 28 ministers.
</P>
<P>
UNITA has been given four portfolios in the unity cabinet --
ministers of geology and mining, health, commerce and tourism,
while most of the ministrial portfolios were taken by the ruling
Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA).
</P>
<P>
UNITA leader Savimbi himself has been appointed "president of
the largest opposition party", a post that carries the right to
regular consultation with President Dos Santos and an official
residence in Luanda.
</P>
<P>
According to President Dos Santos, top tasks facing the
newly-inaugurated unity government include the formation process
of the united army, clearing of millions of land mines planted
during the civil war, repatriation of refugees, and a vast task
of rebuilding the devastated national economy.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony today was the culmination of a peace process
which began in November 1994 when the two sides signed a peace
accord in Lusaka, Zambia.
</P>
<P>
MPLA and UNITA went to war with each other shortly after
independence in 1975, turning the oil-and-diamond-rich country
into one of Africa's war field.
</P>
<P>
United Nations officials this week unveiled a plan to begin
demobilizing some 40,000 UNITA fighters on Saturday. The soldiers
have spent months in U.N. assembly areas.
</P>
<P>
Among the foreign heads of state watching were President Jorge
Sampaio of Portugal, President Nelson Mandela of South Africa and
President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Blondin Beye, special representative of U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan, also congratulated the swearing-in of the unity
government.
</P>
<P>
"A stable, lasting peace should allow greater exploitation of
the country's largely unexplored mineral wealth and could bring
greater regulation to diamond mining, now largely the realm of
freelancers under UNITA control," said an observer closerly
watching the situation.

Peace in Angola would not only help rebuild the devastated
economy in the country, but would also foster regional stability
in southern Africa.
</P>

remembered by the Angolan history as "a turning point".

JOHANNESBURG, April 11 (Xinhua) -- South Africa was considered
as the venue of a new AIDS research center, Luc Montagnier, head
of the World Foundation of AIDS Research and Prevention, said in
Pretoria today.
</P>
<P>
Montagnier said his foundation had to learn more about the
natural history of AIDS in Africa in order to design new and
affordable treatments for the killer disease.
</P>
<P>
Montagnier, a Frenchman who had discovered the AIDS virus,
said South Africa had over the past five years seen the fastest
growth in the disease on the continent.
</P>
<P>
An estimated two million people have currently been infected
with HIV virus which causes AIDS throughout South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The proposed new AIDS research center would be provided with
public and private funding, and linked to a similar one in the
west African country of Cote d'Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
Montagnier and representatives of South African medical
organizations were currently touring the country to find a
suitable site for the proposed AIDS research center, which should
be close to a hospital and a university.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 11 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan returned
home today after concluding his 21-day visit to the United States,
Radio Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, the king held discussions on the stalemated
Middle East peace process with U.S. President Bill Clinton,
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting between Hussein and Clinton, the
U.S. government promised to present a new serious formula to the
Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government also decided to sell subsidized wheat flour
and corn to Jordan and extend credit to Jordan for purchasing
other commodities as part of U.S. assistance to the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Washington also agreed to support Jordan's efforts to
reschedule its debts due for repayment between June 1997 and June
1999.
</P>
<P>
The king discussed the peace process and other issues related
to Jordanian-U.N. relations during his talks with Annan on March
31.
</P>
<P>
But the king's talks with Netanyahu on the peace process after
his surgery scored no achievements, the report said.
</P>
<P>
On April 5, the king underwent a surgery at Mayo Clinic,
Minnesota, to remove a proportion of his prostate gland which became
enlarged and caused him some difficulty in urinating.
</P>
<P>
Hussein said that "the surgery was not easy, but it was
successful and its results were positive."
</P>
<P>
The king's visit to the U.S. came against the background that
Israeli construction of Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem
triggered widespread protest from the Palestinians and the peace
process was seriously threatened.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Dangers of UK's Unbalanced Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Many of Britain's economists are
worrying that the shape of growth in its economy in recent months
is becoming increasingly unbalanced.
</P>
<P>
While the latest evidence on consumer activity has reflected a
sign of overheating in Britain's economy, the continued strength
of the pound has even cast a dark cloud over recovery in its
industry.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of the year, strong evidence showed that
1997 will still very much be the year of the consumer.
</P>
<P>
The most visible indication of rising consumer activity is the
strength of spending in the high street, with retail sales growing
at over 4 percent per year.
</P>
<P>
The strong consumer activity has been backed up by record
consumer borrowing and the continued recovery in the housing
market.
</P>
<P>
Official figures released Thursday showing further house price
increases and rising national construction order books emphasized
the strength of recovery in these markets.
</P>
<P>
House prices nationally rose 7.2 percent over the year and by
11 percent in the first quarter. The average price of a UK home in
the first quarter was 66,899 pounds (107,040 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
While the consumer sector has continued to gather pace,
industry has looked far less healthy.
</P>
<P>
Although recent months have seen an upturn in the growth of
manufacturing output owing to the increase of domestic demand, the
warning signs are obvious.
</P>
<P>
The export orders balance of the Confederation of British
Industry survey has dropped to its lowest level for three years,
while manufacturing investment is falling sharply.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, Roger Bootle and Jonathan Loynes, co-editors of
HSBC Markets wrote in an article entitled "UK Economic Prospects,"
"It would be no surprise if output growth were to slow quite
sharply over the summer as sterling's strength really starts to
bite into competitiveness."
</P>
<P>
Under these circumstances, people are bound to ask: what would
happen to Britain's economy if the growth is unbalanced?
</P>
<P>
At the moment, there seems to be few ill-effects as yet,
inflation is low and falling, and unemployment is dropping.
</P>
<P>
But economists from the City argue: the current favorable
economic situation in Britain underlines precisely the importance
of avoiding unbalanced growth because they were made possible by
the very sort of balanced growth conditions which now look to be
at risk.
</P>
<P>
They believe that stronger domestic demand in Britain will soon
start to pull in more imports, while the growth of exports is
already slowing in response to the stronger pound. By the second
half of the year, the trade position could be worsening
considerably.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that all of this will present a serious policy
dilemma for the next government, whichever party forms it.
</P>
<P>
There is little doubt that the new government will be anxious
to avoid overheating in the consumer sector.

Commission has toured the drought areas and confirmed the
calamities.
</P>
<P>
The pasturalists were in short of milk supply due to the dry
grazing land and lack of water in the drought affected areas, and
flocks of goats perished due to failure in taking urgent measures
to stamp out animal diseases resulted from recurrent drought,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
This is the second drought affected areas announced by the
Ethiopian government since last month. The nation said last month
that nearly one million people needed emergency food aid in three
southern states, namely the Somali, Oromiya, and the Southern
People's states.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia attained the second consecutive bumper agricultural
harvest in 1996/97 with grain output of 11. 7 million tons, a
20.6 percent increase over the previous 9.7 million tons.

<HEADLINE> Israel Develops Advanced Computer-Controlled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli researchers have
developed a labor and cost-saving harvester, a robotic device
programmed by farmers to pick exactly the amount and type of
produce required with no human intervention.
</P>
<P>
The harvester developed by researchers of the Israeli Greentech
Company is designed for stationary growing environments, such as
tomatoes, cucumbers, melons, eggplants and peppers in greenhouse,
according to a report of Israel Export Institute. It can work
vertically and horizontally.
</P>
<P>
The device, 2 meters high, can reach up to 2.5 meters. It is
composed of a computer, a controller, image processing tools
and arm.
</P>
<P>
The "pick head" can be changed according to the shape of fruit
being collected. Using the control panel, farmers input the
color, size and weight of the produce to be picked and the robot
harvester starts picking, identifying the correct fruit using its
image processing capabilities.
</P>
<P>
The harvester reportedly can pick 80 kilograms of tomatoes
weighing 170-200 grams per hour. The robot can work 24
hours a day and its performance can be observed by installing a
video camera in the greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
The invention not only frees farm hands from extremely hard
work in the greenhouse due to the humid atmosphere and high
temperature and pressures, but also halve labor requirements.

<P>
HARARE, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Plans are at an advanced stage to
set up a regulatory authority to curb restrictive business
practices in Zimbabwe, Deputy Minister of Industry and Commerce
Obert Mpofu said here today.
</P>
<P>
Mpofu said that the Industry and Trade Competition Commission
will be formed once an act has been passed by parliament.
</P>
<P>
Mpofu said the government is against monopolistic tendencies
in the economy and will ensure that consumers are not unfairly
treated by local companies.
</P>
<P>
"The commission will serve to curb restrictive business
practices and control abuses of monopoly power and sanction
mergers and takeover," Mpofu said.
</P>
<P>
He said his ministry will not neglect its obligation to
protect the interests and rights of consumers, adding it is now
geared to play a more pro-active rather than a reactive role in
the economy.

JOHANNESBURG, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Namibian Defense Minister
Philemon Malima said today that a South African company which
recruits mercenaries was involved in mobilizing disgruntled
former soldiers to destabilize the country.
</P>
<P>
Intelligence reports show Executive Outcomes, a military

Addressing parliament, Malima said Hans Dreyer, former leader

involved in the operation. He also assured the nation that the
situation is under control.

Meanwhile, Executive Outcomes rejected the claim that it was

<HEADLINE> Cypriot President Proposes Rapprochement Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides has put forward a detailed proposal that could
contribute toward rapprochement between Greek and Turkish
Cypriots, a government spokesman said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily press briefing, Manolis Chritstofides
said "the measures are neither spasmodic nor temporary, and
could lead to positive steps toward rapprochement."
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government supports reconciliation between the two
communities on the island, Chritstofides stressed.
</P>
<P>
However, he declined to give further details about the
measures, saying only that the Cypriot government is expecting the
U.N. to reply.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the U.N.-led proximity talks between the two
sides aimed at paving the way for direct talks between
President Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash,
Christofides said there are some encouraging developments.
</P>
<P>
But he noted that "we have not yet reached the desired
point that would allow face-to-face negotiations." Efforts must
continue, he added.
</P>
<P>
"The ground for direct talks has to be prepared in the best
possible way and we all have to speak the same language,
otherwise another round of negotiations, just for the sake of
negotiations, will take place," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He said when the proximity talks end, the government will
assess the outcome and decide "whether what we have before us is
what we want to begin direct negotiations."
</P>
<P>
In the past three weeks, U.N. Resident Representative Gustave
Feissel has been holding bi-weekly separate meetings with
President Clerides and Denktash in a bid to prepare the ground
for face-to-face negotiations, which is likely to take place in
June.
</P>
<P>
Feissel today briefed President Clerides on last Wednesday's
meeting in Geneva between U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and
Denktash.
</P>
<P>
In a statement upon his return Thursday from Geneva, where he
attended the Annan-Denktash meeting, Feissel said progress has
been made in the proximity talks between President Clerides and
Denktash on both the substance of the Cyprus problem and the
mutual good-will gestures.
</P>
<P>
He also said Annan is keen on getting Denktash and Clerides to
face-to-face talks by the middle of this year.
</P>
<P>
Clerides and Denktash have not met since October 1994 when
the two men held two rounds of informal talks here under
the U.N. auspices.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of an
Athens-backed coup.

<HEADLINE> Cholera Claims 48 Lives In Tanzania Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Cholera disease which
started in January has so far claimed 48 lives and affected 957
people in different parts of of the capital here.
</P>
<P>
Health Commissioner of Dar es Salaam City Commission (DCC)
Matiku Nyakarungu made this disclosure here today, saying that
the killer disease which started at five different areas, has now
covered more areas.
</P>
<P>
The epidemic is spreading at a high speed because of the
on-going rains and people's negligence to health rules, according
to the health commissioner.
</P>
<P>
Nyakarungu said the city commission is finalizing plans to
establish new cholera emergency centers at Mbagala and Manzese in
addition to the eight existing ones, so that victims are treated
in time and their movement restricted to control the epidemic
spread.
</P>
<P>
He further said the Tanzanian government and different
international organizations are working hand-in-hand with the
city commission in curbing the killer disease by funding.
</P>
<P>
Cholera dehydrates the human body extremely fast through
purging and vomiting and can kill the victim within three hours
of the first symptoms if proper treatment is not administered.

<HEADLINE> Lychee Treatment System Developed In Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Based on research by the
Israeli Volcani Institute, IMA Engineering Ltd. has developed a
Lychee Treatment System (LTS) that ensures shelf-life of at
least four weeks, enabling successful marketing of the fruit to
the desired markets.
</P>
<P>
The LTS offers natural post-harvest treatment, sorting and
packing for shipment, according to a report of Israel Export
Institute.
</P>
<P>
Capable of handling 1000 kilograms per hour, it consists of
five stations: an elevator for moving the fruit from picking
boxes to the dipping unit; the "heart" of the system, where post
harvest treatment is carried out; a dryer; sorting unit and
packing unit.
</P>
<P>
The equipment is easy to install and to transport. During
1994-96 seasons, the system was tested successfully on a
commercial level both in Israel and Thailand, with excellent
European market response.
</P>
<P>
Treated fruits were also exported to the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Because of its very short shelf life (about four days), most
of the 600,000 tons of lychee produced in the world is sold at a
very low price for canning. But demand for fresh quality lychee
is growing and the U.S., European and Japanese markets offer high
prices and profits.

WASHINGTON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Friday he will appeal a federal judge's ruling that struck
down a law giving the president the power to veto specific items
in bills passed by Congress.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that he was "disappointed." "I intend to appeal
it," Clinton said of the ruling. "We ought to give the Supreme
Court a chance to have their say on it."
</P>
<P>
"I think the line-item veto is very important in helping to

as he was leaving a meeting with newspaper editors from around the
nation.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson issued his decision
late Thursday overturning the Line-Item Veto Act, a new and
still-unused law that carried enormous significance for federal
spending and the balance of power in government.
</P>
<P>
The law, passed by Congress last year, allowed the president
for the first time to veto particular items in spending bills and
certain limited tax provisions passed by Congress. Previously, the
president could only veto entire bills.

NEW DELHI, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister H.D. Deve
Gowda today lost a vote of confidence in his 10-month-old
government, paving the way for the ruling United Front and the
Congress party to negotiate a solution to the current political
crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
The crisis was provoked by the Congress Party President Sitaram
Kesri who withdrew the party's support to the government on March
30, accusing it of failing to check the rise of communal forces
such as the Bharatiya Janata Party and making efforts to
marginalize the party.
</P>
<P>
President Shanker Dayal Sharma set today the deadline for Deve
Gowda to seek a vote of confidence in his government in the Lok
Sabha (the lower house of parliament).
</P>
<P>
The prime minister moved a motion in a special sitting of the
lower house today after the 13-party United Front and the Congress
party failed to reach a compromise in spite of two rounds of
formal talks between them.
</P>
<P>
The Congress party had demanded the removal of Gowda as an
precondition for any future arrangement. But the United Front had
categorically ruled out any change in its leadership.
</P>
<P>
The motion was defeated with 158 for, 292 against and six in
absence in a total of 456 votes.
</P>
<P>
The 11th Lok Sabha has an effective strength of 543 seats,
excluding two vacancies.

After being defeated in the lower house of parliament, Gowda
said that he was not recommending the dissolution of parliament to

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Seeks Help for Release of Hostages in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz confirmed here today that a number of Lebanese citizens
had been taken hostage in Zaire and the government was seeking
international help for their release.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Star, the only English daily in Beirut, reported
that Zairean rebels kidnapped 60 Lebanese citizens assembling at
the airport in the southeastern city of Lubumbashi for a French
charter plane Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Zairean rebels rounded up all the 60 passengers, stripped them
of their passports and luggage and led them away to an unknown
destination, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"There are a number of Lebanese citizens held as hostages in
Zaire and they have been asked to pay a sum of money to be set
free," the Lebanese foreign minister told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
"We are in continuous contacts with a number of countries but
it has turned out that few of these countries can do something at
Lubumbashi," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have made a lot of contacts with the French on this issue,
and I made additional calls this morning. But we were informed
that France's influence and power was in Kinshasa and outside of
Lubumbashi," Boueiz added.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister promised to conduct more contacts,
probably with the United States and Belgium, for an evacuation of
the Lebanese who want to leave that country.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Somalia is now receiving
considerable rain after almost two years of prolonged droughts
which hit many regions in the country.
</P>
<P>
As the droughts, diseases and the related malnourishment have
claimed the lives of many people and livestock, now the long
expected rain has brought hope to people while creating
difficulties in parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Many key streets linking the southern port city of Kismayu to
its nearby towns of Jamame, Badhadhe, Afmadow and Dhobley have
been cut off by the rains which have fallen in Lower Jubba Region
during the last few days.
</P>
<P>
The tarmac road especially linking Kismayu with Mogadishu has
also been affected by rain water.
</P>
<P>
The hazards created by the rain have mainly jeopardized the
commercial activities from Mogadishu to Kismayu and to the
central regions.
</P>
<P>
However, the herdsmen and nomads are happy about the new life
their herds are looking forward to.
</P>
<P>
As usual, in seven days time, the pastoral land will be filled
with new grass for the cattle and sheep to graze while the goats
and camels which rely on trees will also enjoy the new leaves in
10 days time.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Spend 31-Billion-Dollar on Army </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Turkey will spend 31 billion
U.S. dollars on the defense modernization program for the next
decade in an effort to enhance the Turkish armed forces' combat
capabilities, a high-ranking official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Defense Minister Turhan Tayan
said that the program would foresee the acquisition of thousands
of armored combat vehicles, attack helicopters, main battle
tanks, warships, missiles as well as communication systems.
</P>
<P>
This 10-year defense program will also involves the
continuation of the modernization of Turkish Air Force's fighter
planes, Tayan said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that his ministry would present the detailed plan to
private sector in order to draw their attention to the defense
industry.
</P>
<P>
Tayan said that the government would provide financial
support to local companies which were willing to be involved in
the projects to increase the share of domestic capital in the
country's defense industry sector.
</P>
<P>
The minister emphasized the importance of setting up Turkey's
own defense industry system, adding that Turkey had drawn a lesson
from the U.S. arms embargo on Ankara following a Turkish
military intervention in Cyprus in 1974.
</P>
<P>
He added that the government would pay attention to the
defense industry, in which great strides had been made during the
past years.
</P>
<P>
At the end of last year, a report prepared by the military
authorities said that 150 billion U.S. dollars would be needed
to fund the arms procurement and operation of the Turkish Armed
Forces for the next 25 years.
</P>
<P>
As a military power in the region, Turkey has the second
largest force in NATO, trailing only the United States in the
number of troops.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 11 (Xinhua) -- An officer of the west African
peacekeeping force (ECOMOG), who is linked to some impounded
Indian hemp, is being detained in Liberia and will face full
military disciplinary action.
</P>
<P>
A report of the News Agency of Nigeria from Monrovia, capital
of Liberia said today the officer arrived in Freeport aboard a
ship from Sierra Leone last Saturday when two containers with
several baskets of marijuana (Indian hemp) were impounded.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, ECOMOG Force Commander, Nigeria's
Major General Victor Malu has advised all ECOMOG troops to shun
all acts of indiscipline, emphasizing that all cases of
misdemeanor would continue to be severely punished.
</P>
<P>
The report did not mention the name, rank and nationality of
the officer.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG was sent to Liberia in 1990, following the outbreak of
civil war in the country on Christmas Eve of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Its peace-keeping operation culminated in successfully
disarming and disbanding Liberia's warring factions of more than
30,000 militiamen earlier this year.

In his speech to the session on Thursday, Gambari expressed
concern at the slow pace of international assistance to the west
Africa peace-keeping force in Liberia known as ECOMOG, as the
Liberian elections approach.

PARIS. April 11 (Xinhua) -- The service company of Compagnie de
Suez and the water company Lyonnaise des Eaux today agreed to
merge to create a French-Belgian giant concern of services ranging

world's number one company of "collective services of proximity"
covering services in energy, water, cleaning and communication.

Gerard Mestrallet, the president of Suez, will be the
operational director of the future group, while Monod will be the

Brcko is formerly a Muslim majority town but now controlled by

In mid February, the international panel decided to postpone

OTTAWA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The deal between European Union
(EU) and the United States on the Helms-Burton Act should apply to
Canada or to any other country, a senior Canadian official said
here today.
</P>
<P>
The European Union reached a deal today with the U.S. on their
dispute over the anti-Cuban legislation, which seeks to punish
foreign companies doing business on the Caribbean island.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the EU said it intends to withdraw its complaint
before the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
The union had accused the U.S. of violating international trade
rules by seeking to impose its policies beyond U.S. territory.
</P>
<P>
"We insist that it apply to Canada or any other country and I
think the way the law's written it would have to anyway," Canadian
Trade Minister Art Eggleton said today.
</P>
<P>
"The law of Helms-Burton will not provide for discriminatory
procedure relevant to some countries and not others," Eggleton was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Canada has been fighting against the U.S. act from the very
beginning.
</P>

About a dozen Canadian businessmen have been barred from the

WASHINGTON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today said that there will be no change in the U.S. embargo policy
against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Clinton accused Cuba of "illegally" shooting down two planes
early last year. The U.S. enacted the Helms-Burton law
strengthening sanctions against Cuba after its forces shot down
the two light planes entering Cuba from the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Speaking before a luncheon of the American Society of
Newspapers Editors, Clinton firmly defended U.S. policy towards
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
"Our policy toward Cuba today therefore is one that is dictated
by Cuba not by the United States. And until I see some indication
of willingness to change, it's going to be very difficult to
persuade me to change our policy," he said.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions imposed by the U.S. on Cuba have been strongly
criticized all over the world, particularly after the Helms-Burton
Act was enacted. The European Union has requested the World Trade
Organization to make a verdict on the controversial law.
</P>
<P>
In Brussels today, the European Union (EU) announced that it
has struck a deal with the U.S. over the row, which could lead to
amendment of the Helms-Burton law.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has introduced
agrotourism as an effort to help this East Mediterranean country
become a tourist hot-spot, a Cyprus Tourism Organization (CTO)
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference on the occasion of the first
anniversary of the founding of the Cyprus Agrotourism Company, CTO
Director General Frini Michael said agrotourism, a new and
alternative way of holidaying, "is based on accommodation in
existing, restored, specially designed buildings, with traditional
architecture, or new, though old-style ones."
</P>
<P>
Agrotourism aims to promote and maintain the "environmental,
as well as cultural particularities of the island's countryside,
while it constitutes an incentive, for remote villages, toward
maintaining their local traditional style," Michael noted.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, under the project, 27 traditional
premises in various villages, totalling 250 beds, have been
restored and turned to tourist flats, museums or restaurants, by
March 31, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' economy heavily relies on the tourism sector, which
can earn about 1.6 billion U.S. dollars from over 2 million
tourists every year.
</P>
<P>
Recent years have witnessed decline of tourist arrivals
because of competitiveness from other tourist countries and
political situation on the island.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Italy's 11-months-old government won
a vote of confidence in parliament's lower house Saturday,
clearing a challenge from the right-wing opposition seeking to
block a security force for stricken Albania.
</P>
<P>
The center-left government led by Prime Minister Romano Prodi
won by 321 votes to 166, with one abstention. The vote was taken
after the Refoundation Communist Party, which earlier broke ranks
with the government, returned to support Prodi's party.
</P>
<P>
Prodi's minority government was forced into the test after the
Refoundation Communist Party, led by former Prime Minister Silvio
Berlusconi, abandoned Prodi in a parliamentary vote Wednesday on
sending Italian troops to Albania as part of a 6,000-strong
multinational force to aid the Balkan state.
</P>
<P>
The government-dominated Senate had given its support to Prodi
over the Albanian mission, which is due to swing into action next
week.
</P>
<P>
Prodi came to power last May but has always struggled to get
along with his troublesome ally -- the Refoundation Communist
Party. Other coalition partners have threatened to quit the
government if Prodi fails to reach an accord with the Refoundation
Communist Party on future policy goals.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: HKSAR PLC's 4th Meeting Fruitful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The Provisional Legislative
Council (PLC) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(HKSAR) ended its fourth meeting here today with a series of
progress.
</P>
<P>
It is significant that the PLC has passed the first and second
readings of a bill from the Secretary of Justice of the HKSAR,
namely the "Holidays (1997 and 1998) Bill."
</P>
<P>
The readings of the bill at the plenary session of the PLC
marked the start of the PLC's function to enact laws for Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
On April 10, the HKSAR Chief Executive's Office published the
Holidays (1997 and 1998) Bill, which provides for several
additional holidays in the remainder of 1997 and for the general
holidays in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the HKSAR Chief Executive's Office has also issued a
 consultative document on the proposals for the amendments to the
Societies Ordinance and the Public Order Ordinance in Hong Kong
and it is expected to be presented to the PLC in the coming months
 after the office solicits Hong Kong people's suggestions.
</P>
<P>
All the developments have indicated that with the approaching
of Hong Kong's return to the motherland, the PLC is accelerating
its work in legislation for the future HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
Besides enacting laws, the 60-member PLC elected on December
21, 1996 will shoulder heavy tasks to examine and approve the
1997-1998 budget to be submitted by the HKSAR government, approve
the appointment of the judges of the Court of Final Appeal and the
 Chief Justice of the High court of the HKSAR as well as to debate
 policy address to be delivered by the Chief Executive.
</P>
<P>
In the past three months, the PLC has made preparations for its
 missions.
</P>
<P>
At today's meeting, the council adopted "the Rules of Procedure
 of the PLC" and passed the amendments to "the Resolution on
Registration of Members' Interests," which represents another
major progress in the PLC's work.
</P>
<P>
"The Rules of Procedure" will ensure the PLC to work
effectively up to June 30, 1998 when the First Legislature of the
HKSAR is to be elected whereas "the Resolution on Registration of
Members' Interests" will enhance the transparency of the council,
which is necessary for the PLC in its commitment to the
implementation of the principle of "Hong Kong people governing
Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
With Leong Che-hung and Ip Kwok-him elected chairman and deputy
 chairman of the PLC's House Committee, and Ronald Arculli and
Henry Wu as chairman and deputy chairman of the Finance Committee
at today's meeting, the PLC is mature to play its role in its
legislative work for the establishment of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Wong, president of the current Legislative Council and
member of the PLC, said that today's meeting is fruitful.
</P>
<P>
Wong especially talked about Leong Che Hung being both the
chairman of the House Committee of the PLC of the HKSAR and the
existing Legislative Council, adding, "That will be helpful to the
 PLC's work."
</P>
<P>
PLC member Yeung Chun Kam said that time is pressing for the
PLC to fulfill its tasks in line with the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
He said that today's election for heads of the two committees
represented the trust of the PLC members in them and it also
demonstrated the cooperative attitude in the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Youth Misbehavior Rouses Social Concern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 12 (Xinhua) -- An attempt by a Kuwaiti
secondary school student to gun down his Egyptian teacher
Wednesday have roused great concern about rising crime and
declining morality of the young generation in the small Islamic
state.
</P>
<P>
Just because his science teacher failed him in geology, a
15-year old student Wednesday shot twice and seriously injured the
teacher, Mutaz Mahmoud Ibrahim, 35, on the Asmaei Secondary School
campus.
</P>
<P>
The teacher who was injured in his stomach, lung and liver is
still in critical condition and under treatment in a hospital's
intensive care unit.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti scholars and officials express their great distress over
surging violence among Kuwaiti youth which they described as
dangerous and detrimental to the social moral.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Education Minister Abdullah Al-Ghuneim described the
unprecedented incident in Kuwait's history as "strange and
contradictory to our traditions and values and something the
Kuwaiti society is unfamiliar with."
</P>
<P>
Sociologists believed that the incident is only the tip of the
ice-burg of crime in the country, of which the crime rate is about
one percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Such incidents have made Kuwaitis raise questions on whether
the country should do more to shore up the stability of a
traditional Muslim society and impose tougher penalties on the
criminals.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that there are two main causes of the
misbehaviors of the youths. On one hand, the sudden abundance of
wealth caused by the oil boom has ensured a luxury life enjoyed by
the younger generation. This has resulted in lack of spiritual
ballast in their minds. On the other, many bad western ideas have
entered Kuwaiti people's minds since the 1990 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
An associate professor of sociology in Kuwait University told
Xinhua that the phenomena of selfishness, laziness, clannishness
and chasing sumptuosity are common among youngsters. Cases of
drug addiction, murder and rape committed by the youngsters are
often reported in local media.
</P>
<P>
Only in October 1995, some 4,500 juvenile delinquents were
involved in 2,500 judicial cases.
</P>
<P>
But some consider the case from another angle. They say the
government should set up more recreational facilities in the small
country with few parks or sports grounds to attract more youngsters
to do healthy activities in their spare time. "The youths are
filled with energy, but they have no place to go," a clinical
psychologist told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
He complained that at nights, especially on holidays, groups of
car-crazing Kuwaiti youngsters are seen roaring up and down the
main highways in cars and motorcycles with extra high-speed.
</P>
<P>
Still, many put the blame on the large number of illegal owning
of weapons among the Kuwaiti people resulted from the 1990 Iraqi
invasion. At the end of the war, fleeing Iraqis left a huge
quantity of weapons and ammunitions in Kuwait. Many of the guns
have yet to be handed to the government in spite of the
government's appeals.
</P>
<P>
The situation is critical enough for the government and
National Assembly to tackle the problem of juvenile delinquency on
a firm footing, a parliamentary member Hassan Jawhar was quoted as
saying by the Arab Times.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti parliamentary members have called on imposing a
mandatory death sentence for drug trafficking and drug abuse in
which many youngsters were involved in.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, officials and educationists called on parents
to monitor their children more closely.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Ease Closure on West Bank, Gaza </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli army is to ease a
three-week total closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip, allowing
a limited number of Palestinians to enter Israel for work.
</P>
<P>
According to an Israel Radio report, the decision to ease
the closure was made by Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai and army Chief of Staff Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, and it
will take effect Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Starting from Sunday morning, 20,000 Palestinian workers from
the West Bank and Gaza Strip will be permitted to enter Israel,
said the report. It added that the permit will only be given to
married men over the age of 45.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Israel imposed the total closure on the West
Bank and Gaza Strip immediately after a suicide bombing attack
in a downtown coffee shop in Tel Aviv, which left three
women dead and over 50 injured.
</P>
<P>
The closure has barred tens of thousands of Palestinians
from returning to their jobs inside Israel, and from traveling
between the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Earlier last week, the Israeli army allowed Gaza Strip
residents in the West Bank to return to the strip, as well
as West Bank residents in the Gaza Strip to travel home.
</P>
<P>
The army was also allowing Palestinians who are married to
Jerusalem residents with Israeli identity cards to enter the
city.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, 22 more Palestinian ambulances were allowed to
enter Israel on an emergency basis, bringing to 36 the
number of ambulances allowed to traverse Israel between the
Palestinian autonomous areas.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army said that 100 Palestinian laborers who have
jobs in tourist industries were also allowed entry into Israel,
but it stressed that all entrance permits are subjected to strict
security clearances.

ROME, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The Shroud of Turin, revered by
many Roman Catholics as the burial cloth of Jesus Christ, narrowly
escaped incineration today when a fire gutted the chapel where it
is housed.
</P>
<P>
Firefighters braved scorching heat to carry out a silver box
containing the shroud, a piece of cloth bearing the stained image
of a crucified man believed by many faithful to be Christ.
</P>
<P>
The shroud, 4.4 meter by 1.4 meter, was taken from the Middle
East by the crusaders in 1353 and housed in a chapel in France. It
was transferred to Turin after being slightly damaged by fire.
</P>
<P>
Always revered in Italy, the shroud gained world fame at the
end of last century, when a photographic negative revealed the
image on it which is invisible to the naked eyes.
</P>
<P>
Fire officials said the blaze also caused considerable damage
to part of an adjacent museum.
</P>

The police said there were no injuries.

BAGHDAD, April 12 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan
expects that the U.N. Security Council Sanctions Committee will
renew the oil-for-food deal with Iraq for another six-month term,
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi newspaper Babel carried a story on the deal, which has
alleviated the sufferings of the Iraqi people since its
enforcement last December.
</P>
<P>
Annan was quoted by the Iraqi paper as saying that "in my
personal estimation, the current term of the agreement will be
extended for another six months soon after its termination in
June" as long as the conditions that facilitated its signing
remain.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-Iraq deal allowed Iraq last December to sell 2 billion
dollars worth of oil every six months to buy badly-need foodstuffs
and medicine.
</P>
<P>
The first batch of the purchased foodstuffs and medicine
arrived in Iraq on March 20 under the deal, the current term of
which will expire by the end of June.
</P>
<P>
The volume of the foodstuffs that have been transported to Iraq
under the deal has so far reached 200,000 tonnes.

<HEADLINE> Many Nairobi City Buildings Risk Collapse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 12 (Xinhua) -- A Kenyan official has said that
55 percent of Nairobi city had informal settlements where no
standards of construction were applicable, Kenya Times reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a Presidential Commission of Inquiry as
saying on Friday that many urban dwellers in Kenya's capital city
are sitting on a time bomb due to the existing sub-standard
buildings.
</P>
<P>
The commission noted that an earthquake measuring between four
and five on the Richter scale would demolish thousands of
residential buildings in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
A group of officials led by the Commission Chairman Reuben
Mutiso pointed out that some of the buildings emerging in the
recent past lacked reinforced foundation and support structure
after they conducted a public inspection of houses in the city on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mutiso said that many buildings "are not engineered, nor
supervised and the very elements of construction are not looked
into when approving them."
</P>
<P>
During the tour, he said, the commission had discovered there
were a number tall buildings whose fire escapes were locked up
and some others had no fire escapes at all.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the city's central business district buildings have
not been maintained for a long time, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Commission of Inquiry was appointed by Kenyan President
Daniel arap Moi following the Sunbeam Supermarket disaster in
which 16 people were killed when the building's canopy collapsed.

<HEADLINE> Stalled Mideast Peace process to Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 12 (Xinhua) - Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul Salam
Majali said here today that the currently stalled Middle East
peace process would be eventually moving forward.
</P>
<P>
"Both sides are still working on it to seek for concrete
ideas," though no new initiatives were produced during King of
Jordan Hussein's recent visit to the United States." said Majali
who accompanied Hussein during the visit from March 21 to April 11.
</P>
<P>
"It is critical at this moment, but I do not think it will
stay like this for long," said Majali.
</P>
<P>
Majali, who was named prime minister by the king last month for
the second time, negotiated and later signed Jordan's peace treaty
with Israel in 1994 during his first tenure from May 1993 to
January 1995.
</P>
<P>
The current impasse was attributed to Israeli government's
decision to build 6,500 Jewish housings in Arab East Jerusalem,
which the Palestinians want to be the capital of their future state,
said the prime Minister
</P>
<P>
Jordan would do all it could to help the Palestinian people
regain their legitimate rights and exercise their
self-determination on their own soil, said Majali.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also urged the U.S. to play "active partner"
role to offer of solutions to help the Palestinians and Israelis
to carry on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Every problem has a solution," said Majali, confident that
the peace process would be reactivated again.
</P>
<P>
As to the issue of Iraq, Majali said that Jordan wanted the
United Nations sanctions imposed on Baghdad following its invasion
of Kuwait in 1990 to be lifted soon to end the suffering of the
Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
"But at the same time, we would like to see Iraq comply with
all related U.N. Security Council resolutions," he said, adding
this includes the dismantling of all weapons of mass destruction,
Long-range missiles and paying for war reparations.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Minister for
Petroleum and Natural Resources Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan today
called for cooperation from all concerned quarters to achieve
self-sufficiency in energy production.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony of the Fifth Annual Technical
Conference of Pakistan held here today, Nisar emphasized the
importance of exploiting advances in technology to meet energy
challenges facing the country.
</P>
<P>
He said that new initiatives and far reaching reforms were
being initiated in Pakistan to stimulate economic growth by
energizing the industrial sector and increasing exports.
</P>
<P>
This obviously would mean an even higher demand for energy and
energy infrastructure, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, Pakistan is producing a little more
than half of its oil consumption indigenously, mostly in the form
of gas.
</P>
<P>
"It is the second half which is imported and puts a strain on
our foreign exchange reserves and checks economic growth, we want
to increase our indigenous production," Nisar said.
</P>
<P>
He said half the basin areas of the country including offshore
were not under active exploration.
</P>
<P>
And the government expects to introduce new technologies in
exploring and tapping the undiscovered potential resources of oil
and gas in the country, he said.

<HEADLINE> Afrobeat King Fela Arrested for Hemp Consumption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Afrobeat king Fela
Anikulapo-Kuti was arrested for Indian hemp consumption on
Wednesday by the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA),
local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions of Major-General Musa Bamaiyi, the
chairman of NDLEA, at a news conforence in Lagos on Friday, Fela
reportedly said that hemp is not drug but a medicinal grass,
which he has been taking for 40 years and is good to his health
and composition.
</P>
<P>
He said he knows that hard drugs like cocaine and heroine are
bad and don't take them, nor does he encourage people to take
them.
</P>
<P>
The NDLEA recovered 10 kilograms of Indian hemp from Fela's
house in a raid last year, but raised no charges against him.
Instead, it tried to rehabilitate him.
</P>
<P>
But over the past one year, Major-General Bamaiyi said, Fela
"has remained unrepentant in his bad habit. His followership
seems to be on the increase daily."
</P>
<P>
Fela's activities "have held many innocent souls hostage and
with the gloom now pervading their lives, they are doomed if the
agency fails in its sacred responsibility of rescuing their
enslaved souls from his clutches", he said.
</P>
<P>
"Drastic disease needs drastic surgery to get proper cure," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Arrested together with Fela are 106 others in his shrine and
house, including many teenagers, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Fela himself contriubted the failed rehabilitation to a
"communication gap" between him and the NDLEA.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's PM: Economy in Recess </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 12 (Xinhua) - Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul Salam
Majali acknowledged here today that his country's economy was in
recess and investment did not move forward in a satisfactory way.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is red tape, pledging to remove all
obstacles facing economic development.
</P>
<P>
The government would encourage people to invest outside Amman,
the capital, through offering incentives, providing necessary
infrastructure and adopting a centralized policy, Majali told a
press conference.
</P>
<P>
In summary, Majali vowed to give high priority to economic
development and social progress in his country.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the Jordanian citizens to move to work and not
let the foreign labor to further grow in their country.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, non-Jordanian workers are
costing the country more than 500 million Jordanian dinars (about
714 million U.S. dollars) annually.
</P>
<P>
This might be one of the main solutions to unemployment and
poverty which were ravaging the country's economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government has promised to accelerate the economic reform
through legislation. It also urged the private sector to launch
economic and trade projects in different governorates.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1990s, Jordan enjoyed a flourishing economy on the
basis of foreign aids. It began to lose foreign aids when the Gulf
crisis broke out for it sided with Iraq. Since then, the country,
scant of natural resources and without oil, has suffered from
economic recession.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister resumed office last month with a pledge to
speed up the economic reform, probably in a different way.

<HEADLINE> Fighting Breaks Peace in Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The noise of heavy machine
guns and rocket propelled grenades have today awakened the Somali
people in the war torn capital, Mogadishu, after having been
enjoying relative peace for about two months now.
</P>
<P>
Mogadishu citizens hopeful of lasting peaceful settlemtnt to
the political crises have been frightened by the unexpected
fighting in the heart of the capital.
</P>
<P>
At least seven people were killed and more than 17 others were
wounded when armed confrontation erupted between rival militiamen
loyal to north Mogadishu faction leader, Mr Ali Mahdi Mohamed, in
Bermuda neighborhood of central Mogadishu today. The clashes
which began with high intensity have cooled down to sporadic
shootings in the area in south Mogadishu. Ten of the seriosly
wounded people were rushed to north Mogadishu's ICRC run Keysaney
hospital, while few others were taken to medical treatments in
south Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the fighting is not yet officially disclosed,
however sources close to the area said the fighting began
following the nomination of a new district commissioner for the
area by Ali Mahdi Mohamed. According to the report, the
nomination of the new man backed by the people in Waberi district
was immediately opposed by militia commanders in Sigale area who
reportedly have killed the former commissioner, late Ibrahim
Shurie late last month.
</P>
<P>
The opposition group have reportedly attacked the residence of
the new commissioner killing two of his men in the house and
dislodged his supporters. The fighting has intensified as the
attack and counter-attack efforts by the militiamen of the
warring sides continued in the early hours of the day. However,
the area has become relatively calm before mid day.
</P>
<P>
A number of militiamen in the area said the new commissioner,
Mr Abdullahi Berhod, and the committee that supports him are not
trust worthy. They accused the local authority for misusing the
funds and the logistical supports from Mr Ali Mahdi of north
Mogadishu. The opposition group has also claimed that elements
against Ali Mahdi himself are behind the destabilization of
Bermuda.
</P>
<P>
There has been several attempts in solving the crises between
the two group who both support Mr Ali Mahdi Mohamed. Bermuda
neighborhood which situates in the heart of the capital, 200-400
meters north of Mogadishu's sea and airports, consists of four
portions from four different districts: Hawlwadag, Hodon, Waberi
and Hamar Ja-Jab.
</P>
<P>
Each of the three main clans of Mogadishu, Abgal, Habar Gidir
and Murusadeh, occupies parts of these four districts. The areas
controlled by the Habar Gidir and Murusadeh clans have remained
unaffected by the fighting today. The area has got its name,
Bermuda, during the height of the war between late general
Mohamed Farah Aidid and Ali Mahdi Mohamed in 1991-1992 following
Aidid's failure to capture the neighborhood.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Why China Practices Direct Election of Village </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- China is pushing a democratic
system with Chinese characteristics in its vast rural areas and
experts say that this new system of farmers directly electing
village committees has deep social roots.
</P>
<P>
The practice began after the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress passed a law on village committees in November
1987, and has since spread to 18 Chinese provinces,
municipalities, and autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the new system came, first of all, from
economic reforms begun in the countryside in the late 1970s. These
rural reforms introduced a household-based contract responsibility
system, and have had profound effects on rural economic relations
and the social structure, and provided a solid foundation for
direct election of village committees.
</P>
<P>
A village committe is a self-governing organization that
oversees public affairs and public welfare, mediates civil
disputes, maintains public order, and assists the township
government.
</P>
<P>
The contract responsibility system, which has helped Chinese
farmers prosper, has produced a new pattern of economic relations
and new ownership relations in the countryside, which combined to
create the need for a new mechanism to oversee different interests.
</P>
<P>
The system has also given farmers considerable power in
distributing rural resources, the experts say.
</P>
<P>
In the past, collectives like People's Communes used to have
distribution rights and peasants used to get grain and money from
the collectives. Today, the farmers work on contracts and pay
taxes and fees to the State and the collective.
</P>
<P>
In many parts of China where there are few township
enterprises, the collective relies on farmers, financially and in
terms of labor, for public-interest work, like road building, the
experts point out.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Why China Practices Direct Election of Village </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Relations between the State, the collective, and farmers have
become more direct under the contract responsibility system,
making farmers more concerned about village and financial affairs
and about the use of money collected from them.
</P>
<P>
The rural social structure in China has over the years
undergone great changes, as is reflected in the large-scale
movemetns of farmers between different regions and in
diversification among farmers. Nowadays, some work the soil,
others work in township enterprises, some serve as employees of
private business, others run industrial and commercial businesses
on their own or by hiring others, and still others manage village
affairs and collective enterprises.
</P>
<P>
This is a good means of balanced relations between various
social groups in rural areas by a democratic form of
self-management by farmers, the experts note.
</P>
<P>
They say that changes in the political structure of rural areas
since 1978, when China started its reform and opening-up drive,
have made it possible for farmers to elect the village committee
directly.
</P>
<P>
Because they are no longer ties to the land and because they
have more understanding of the law, Chinese farmers have developed
a need to have their opinions on issues like the management of
village affairs listened to.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the emergence of some social problems in rural
areas, like social security, financial management, and the
relationship between cadres and the people, can only be
fundamentally resolved through democratic self-management and
farmers' direct participation in the grass-roots management, the
experts say.
</P>
<P>
To meet the needs of the new situation, the Standing Committee
of the National People's Congress passed a law on organizing
village committees, stating that the director, deputy directors,
and members of the village committee should be elected by the
villagers for a three-year term.
</P>
<P>
From 1988 to early this year, 18 provinces, municipalities and
autonomous regions held three direct elections of village
committees, and other provinces and regions held two. Eastern
Fujian and northeastern Heilongjiang provinces held a fourth
series of direct elections in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Records show that China had 930,000 village committees and four
million cadres at the end of 1996.

Slovakia and Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was first signed by the Czech Republic, Hungary,

country's foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
The CEFTA provides for tax exemption on imports between member
states of the trade bloc.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Romania ran a trade volume of 738 million
U.S. dollars with CEFTA members, which accounted for 4.2 percent
of Romania's foreign trade.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Promote Products in Middle East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Some 80 Kenyan companies have
registered for the "Kenya in the Gulf" exhibition to be held in
Sharjah, United Arab Emirates, next month, according to a Daily
Nation report today.
</P>
<P>
The daily newspaper quoted Fred Kombo, President of the fair
organizer Expo-Link Ltd., as saying that the highest number of
the exhibitors are from the horticultural sector.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Kenya Association of Manufacturers had
offered a 50 percent rebate to the horticultural exhibitors who
pay 2,000 U.S. Dollars for their participation fee instead of
4,000 Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Kombo noted that a business information center is scheduled to
set up to promote Kenya's flower and vegetable to the Middle East
and the world market as well.
</P>
<P>
"Kenya flowers do not have to pass through Holland to reach
the Gulf market and they can sell there directly," he pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
According to him, another area which the exhibition will be
exploring is the tapping of the Middle East tourist market, which
was currently under-exploited.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Gulf tourists who had previously been visiting
Western capitals have shifted focus to the Far East and North
Africa.
</P>
<P>
He said that "this is an opportunity for serious promotion of
Kenyan tourism in the Gulf states whose residents are wealthy
enough to visit the country's beaches and parks."
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Kombo noted, a number of Kenyan women will
be exhibiting Kenya's crafts and wares during the Gulf event.
</P>
<P>
Arrangements have been made to set up joint programs with the
Middle East-based Arab Woman's Club of Sharjah to improve
commercial ties between women in Kenya and the Gulf region.

<HEADLINE> Women's Illiteracy Blamed for Over-Population in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The high level of illiteracy among
the Nigerian women has been identified as the major factor
responsible for the over-population in the country, the New
Nigerian reported today.
</P>
<P>
The government-owned newspaper quoted a bank official as
saying that a greater percentage of the Nigerian women are still
illiterate and do not know how to effectively and adequately plan
their family size.
</P>
<P>
David Drumm of the First City Merchant Bank made the
disclosure at the 20th anniversary lecture of the Nigeria-British
Chamber of Commerce here at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
But he didn't give any figure to show the percentage.
</P>
<P>
He warned that if nothing was done to curb this situation, the
Nigerian population in the next 22 years would be twice the
current figure, while Lagos would become the third most populous
city in the world.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, Nigeria now has a population of 102
million (the United Nations puts it at 115 million), compared
with some 88 million in 1991.
</P>
<P>
To curb the fast population growth, Drumm said, there was an
urgent need for the Nigerian government to pay greater attention
to the education of women while measures such as rural areas
development had become necessary to check rural-urban shift.
</P>
<P>
What Nigeria needs most are engineers and technicians,
according to the banker.

<HEADLINE> Gulfstream Aerospace sees Big Market Potential in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The US's Gulfstream Aerospace
Corporation, one of the world's leading business jet
manufacturers, says it wants to be involved in China's growth as
Chinese businesses become more active and competitive in the world
scene.
</P>
<P>
Bryan T. Moss, vice-chairman of the Georgia-based company, said
that its plane would be "an excellent tool" to help Chinese
businesses to expand beyond the Chinese border, and that a
well-developed business jet service in China would help bring in
more foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Moss was in Beijing today, where the company's latest plane,
the Gulfstream V, made a stop on a world tour that began in Los
Angeles. The tour will set several records for distance by
non-commercial aviation, according to Moss. It is also regarded as
a major marketing offensive by the company.
</P>
<P>
He said that Gulfstream is not pinning its hopes on short-term
sales in China, but intends to expand gradually by first leasing
planes and setting up cooperative projects with Chinese partners.
</P>
<P>
"We do not honestly know the true size of this market, but we
believe strongly in China's continuous economic growth, and we
want to be part of that process," he said.

<P>
JIASHI, Xinjiang, April 12 (Xinhua) -- An all-out effort has
been made in rescue work following a 6.6 magnitude earthquake that
hit Jiashi County of northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region at 13:34 Beijing time on Friday, leaving at least nine dead
and causing serious damage.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of cadres and local people of various ethnic groups,
along with 320 officers and men of the armed police of Xinjiang
and 2,000 army soldiers have been mobilized to help restart
production and rebuild homes, according to official sources here.
</P>
<P>
The tremor was the sixth to have hit Jiashi since January 21
that had a magnitude higher than six.
</P>
<P>
In the two townships at the epicenter, almost all houses and
and barns were destroyed and some farmland was flooded. Twenty km
to the northwest, most wooden single-storey houses were destroyed,
and concrete buildings built in recent years, like county
government office buildings, developed cracks.
</P>
<P>
Several hours after the tremor, medical teams were sent to the
area by Kashi Prefecture, the military area command in south
Xinjiang, and by Jiashi County Government. One local farmer told
Xinhua that, "Although the earthquake was serious, we aren't so
frightened that we can't pull ourselves together."
</P>
<P>
The lives of the 280,000 people in the quake area have been
seen to, and victims have been cared for and public order restored.
</P>

BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Scientists have discovered that
the Chinese mainland has been drifting eastward, having been
affected by the Indian Plate, during a research project headed by
Ye Shuhua, an academic at the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
They used satellite technology, like a global positioning
system, to study crust movement. The east part of China, referring
mainly to Shanghai, was found to be drifting seven to eight
millimeters annually to the east, relative to stable areas on the
European Plate.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai was also found to be moving in a somewhat southerly
direction and to be sinking about a millimeter every year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 12 (Xinhua) - Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz announced here today that he will urge the European and
Mediterranean countries at a Malta gathering to freeze their
relations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz left Beirut at noon today, heading a Lebanese delegation
for the conference of the Euro-Mediterranian partnership, a forum
grouping 15 states of the European Union and 12 countries along
the southern Mediterranean basin.
</P>
<P>
The conference is to be held in Valletta, Malta's capital,
Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Upon his departure, Boueiz said that he will table the issue of
freezing ties with Israel at the conference unless the Jewish
state respects the principles defined in the 1991 Madrid peace
conference and the formula of exchanging land for peace.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters at the Beirut International Airport, the
lebanese foreign minister stressed that " The resumption of the
peace process should be called for according to the bases of
Madrid and according to the mechanism of the peace process in
Madrid."
</P>
<P>
``We are not ready to enter a new mechanism and to begin to
negotiate once again what has been agreed upon," the Lebanese
official noted.
</P>
<P>
The Malta conference will be the second of the
Euro-Mediterranean partnership, which is aimed at developing
security, political, economic, cultural and social links. The
first of its kind was held in Barcelona, Spain, in November 1995.
</P>
<P>
Europe's Mediterranean partners are Algeria, Cyprus, Egypt,
Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Malta, Morocco, Tunisia, Syria, Turkey
and the Palestinian National Authority.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Arab countries decided to freeze the
normalization process with Israel and enforce an Arab boycott of
the Jewish state which infuriated them by starting the
construction of a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem in
March.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysia Airlines (MAS)
has decided to cancel all tonight's flights from the Kuala Lumpur
International Airport near here due to "wildcat" strike by Indian
air traffic controllers.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference at the airport today, MAS
Managing Director Wan Malik Ibrahim said that the flights canceled
are MH4 (KL-London/Heathrow), MH18 (KL-Zurich-Rome) and MH26
(KL-Dubai-Charles de Gaulle).
</P>
<P>
He said following the cancellation there would be no MAS return
flights on the above routes.
</P>
<P>
The strike, which entered its second day today, also forced MAS
to reschedule five flights Friday.
</P>
<P>
Wan Malik said a MAS flight bound for Kuala Lumpur from Vienna
(MH5) today was diverted to Karachi while that from Munich (MH17)
to Dubai due to the closure of the Indian airspace.
</P>
<P>
Since Friday, he said, the national carrier MAS had been trying
to make alternative arrangements and with the assistance and
cooperation of the Department of Civil Aviation (DCA) and the
International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) had managed to
make arrangement to allow its aircraft to fly through Colombo and
Muscat, in Oman.
</P>
<P>
He said if everything was cleared, all the five flights
rescheduled Friday would be resumed tonight but no time had been
fixed.
</P>
<P>
MAS has deployed about 40 officers to man its reservation
centers at the airport and City office around-the-clock to ensure
the least inconvenience to its passengers.
</P>
<P>
Last night, MAS had to take care of 1,422 stranded passengers,
providing them accommodation at various hotels in the city, meals
and international telephone calls to inform their families of the
situation, he said.

<HEADLINE> APL Initiates First Highway-Ocean Intermodal Line in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 12 (Xinhua) -- American President Lines (APL),
one of the world's ten leading shipping companies, has initiated
its first highway-ocean intermodal shipping line in China.
</P>
<P>
The new line enables the shipping of cargo containers from
Nanjing to Shanghai via a newly built expressway between the two
cities, then to ports around the world via its regular ocean
shipping services starting from the Shanghai port.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the traditional shipping route on the Yangtze
River, it now takes two, four, and six days less to transport
cargo from cities in the Yangtze River Delta area such as Nanjing
to North America, the Middle East and Europe respectively.
</P>
<P>
"As a main consumer goods and industrial parts supplier in the
world, China's importance is growing," said Chen Zuoyi, APL's
general manager for China.
</P>
<P>
He added that APL will endeavor to help manufacturers and
retailers to expand their business from coastal areas to the
inland areas of China.
</P>
<P>
APL has incorporated seven Chinese coastal ports like Shanghai,

<HEADLINE> Joint Declaration, Guarantee of Success for Macao Transition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, April 12 (Xinhua) -- A Macao top legislator said here
today that full implementation of the Sino-Portuguese Joint
Declaration is the guarantee of success for Macao's transition.
</P>
<P>
Anabela Sales Ritchie, president of the Macao Legislative
Assembly (LA), made these remarks on the eve of the 10th
anniversary of the signing of the historical document in an
exclusive interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The indigenous legislator began her career in the LA in 1976,
and was elected chairman of the assembly twice in 1992 and 1996
respectively.
</P>
<P>
"China and Portugal through the international document designed
the future of the Macao Special Administrative Region," she said.
"I believe that Macao's transition will be a success so long as
the declaration is properly carried out and implemented."
</P>
<P>
The president described the joint declaration, signed in
Beijing on April 13, 1987, as "a model of understanding that
represents peace, equality and good order on the basis of trust
and cooperation."
</P>
<P>
She said that the importance of the joint declaration goes
beyond 1999 after China resumes its exercise of sovereignty over
Macao.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that it is of great significance to the
cultivation in a broader field of bilateral relations between
Portugal and the People's Republic of China," said Ritchie.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of China and Portugal have described their relations as
"excellent." They exchanged visits frequently. The development of
"good, open, frank and constructive relations is a result of the
implementation" of the joint declaration, she said.
</P>
<P>
"The atmosphere of harmony, understanding and mutual respect is
very important to the settlement of existing problems in Macao,"
she said. "The two countries should further expand their relations
by drawing experiences from their cooperation in Macao."
</P>
<P>
She pledged that the Macao LA will take an active part in the
handling of transitional affairs so that a stable transfer of
power will be reached.

<HEADLINE> EU, U.S. Reach Deal on Anti-Cuba Law Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) and the
United States reached a deal Friday on a dispute over the
U.S. Helms-Burton Act against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
EU Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan said in a statement that
the deal would allow the EU to suspend a complaint against the
United States that the World Trade Organization in Geneva was to
take up on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The deal would help "chart a path toward a longer-term solution
through amendment of the Helms-Burton Act" and allow talks between
the EU and U.S. on the issue of extraterritorial application of
trade laws, said Brittan.
</P>
<P>
He added that the EU reserved the right to continue the case if
no broader agreement is reached in separate negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The EU insisted that the 1996 Helms-Burton Act, which seeks to
punish foreign companies that invest in property confiscated from
Americans after the 1959 revolution in Cuba, has a negative impact
on the economic interests of its member states.
</P>
<P>
However, U.S. President Bill Clinton said in Washington that he
has seen no prospect of changing the embargo policy against the
Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
He added that it would be very difficult to persuade him the
change the current U.S. policy toward Cuba.

<HEADLINE> Islamists Massacre 22 Civilians in Algeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-two civilians were massacred
by Islamic militants Friday night in Douar Menaa near Boufarik, 35
kilometers south of the Algerian capital Algiers, the Agence
France-Presse (AFP) quoted Algerian security forces as saying
today.
</P>
<P>
Security forces accused "a group of terrorists" -- which is
apparently referring to the militant group, Armed Islamic Group --
of "cowardly" committing the massacre.
</P>
<P>
No further details were given on the circumstances of the
killing, said AFP.
</P>
<P>
At least 132 civilians were killed in the past eight days in
Algeria by Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
Seventeen other people, most of them women and children, were
killed a few days ago in the village of Amroussa in the region of
Boufarik.
</P>
<P>
The massacres took place at the same time when Algerian
security forces were launching sweep operations, sometimes
accompanied by bombings and military helicopters, against the
Islamists' hiding places in the mountainous south and southwest
parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
The operations were launched to prepare for the country's
legislative elections scheduled for June 5.

<HEADLINE> Chief Minister of Malaysia's Selangor State Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Chief Minister of Malaysia's
Selangor State, Muhammad Muhamad Taib, who faces two charges in
Australia in connection with his attempt to transfer 2.4 million
ringgit (about 0.96 million U.S. dollars) out of Australia, has
resigned, it was announced here today.
</P>
<P>
His resignation, effective on Monday, was announced by Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad after the ruling United Malays National
Organization (UMNO) Supreme Council meeting at the party
headquarters here today.
</P>
<P>
Muhammad, 51, who was appointed Chief Minister of Selangor on
August 14, 1986, also resigned from the posts of Selangor and
Federal Territory UMNO liaison chief and the Selangor and Federal
Territory National Front chairman.
</P>
<P>
"It is his own wish to resign so that any investigation
conducted will not affect UMNO's image and we will only consider
his position in the party after the decision in Brisbane on
whether he is guilty or not," Mahathir said at a news conference
also attended by Muhammad.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir, who is UMNO president, said that Muhammad made his
decision after having heard the views of all the Supreme Council
members during a discussion on corruption and abuse of power and
position.
</P>
<P>
He said that Muhammad's position as the UMNO vice president
would be known on Monday when the Selangor Chief Minister issues
an official statement.
</P>
<P>
On whether Muhammad's decision (to resign) reflected his
admission of guilt, Mahathir said: "I don't know whether it is an
admission of guilt. But what he stated is that he does not want to
be linked with UMNO in any of the investigations."
</P>
<P>
Muhammad was detained at the Brisbane International Airport on
December 22 last year when currency equivalent to 1.2 million
Australian dollars was found in his luggage.
</P>
<P>
He was charged in the Brisbane Magistrate's Court with
attempting to transfer the amount in undeclared currency out of
Australia under the Financial Transactions Reports Act, 1988
which carries a maximum fine of 5,000 Australian dollars (about
4,000 U.S. dollars) or a jail term not exceeding two years or both
on conviction.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that at the mention of the case yesterday, the
prosecution stated that Muhammad will face an additional charge of
making a false declaration when his case comes up for hearing on
August 19.
</P>
<P>
The additional charge, under the same Act, carries a maximum
fine of 10,000 Australian dollars (about 8,000 U.S. dollars) or a
jail term not exceeding five years or both on conviction.
</P>
<P>
Muhammad recently became the center of controversy including
being subjected to investigations by the Anti Corruption Agency
(ACA) in connection with the cash found on him and his ownership
of properties in Australia reported to be worth millions of
ringgit (Malaysian currency).
</P>
<P>
Muhammad earlier claimed that the cash belonged to his two
brothers for the purchase of property in the Gold Coast.
</P>
<P>
The transaction could not proceed because they could not be
present in Australia for the purpose.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that Muhammad's replacement as the Chief
Minister, the Selangor and Federal Territory Liaison Committee
chief and the Selangor and Federal Territory National Front
chairman would be decided after discussions later.

<HEADLINE> Israel Seeks Business Expansion In Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Israel is seeking more business
opportunities in Vietnam while consolidating its footholds in
major economic powers in the Far East region.
</P>
<P>
Israel Export Institute (IEI) considers Vietnam as one of the
"new emerging economies," believing that the development boom in
that country would attract Israeli companies to establish a
presence there.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted lately by the IEI said that Vietnam is now
starting the process of rehabilitation and rebuilding its
national infrastructure, making large scale investment and more
imports essential.
</P>
<P>
This situation creates opportunities for companies to acquire a
bigger share or even a competitive edge in this infant market, the
survey said.
</P>
<P>
Amir Hayek, general manager of the IEI, said that Israeli
companies could find a place in agriculture and agrotechnology, a
big business estimated at over 180 million U.S. dollars per annum.
</P>
<P>
In the field of telecommunications, Vietnam expects massive
foreign involvements, with some financial problems still
pending. Israeli entrepreneurs are also allowed to get involved in
such infrastructure projects as supplies and management, which is
expected to earn the Jewish state some 300 million dollars per
year.
</P>
<P>
However, the IEI and Israeli Insurance Company against Foreign
Trade Risks, cautioned against get-rich-quick ambitions.
</P>
<P>
They noted that Vietnam is a developing country, its business
infrastructure has not yet matured, and making business there is
quite difficult. The country's lack of foreign currency and
complicated bureaucracy are also negative factors in doing
business, they said.
</P>
<P>
They strongly recommended that Israel's ties with the major
economic powers -- Japan, China and South Korea, be further
cemented so as to minimize the possible business risks at the new
market.
</P>
<P>
diplomatic relations between Israel and Vietnam is at the
ambassadorial level.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Fall of India's Gowda Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 12 (Xinhua) -- A fluid political situation is
expected to continue in India following the fall of the 13-party
United Front (UF) government headed by Deve Gowda, who was voted
out in a confidence motion in Parliament late Friday night.
</P>
<P>
The 10-month-old Gowda government appeared doomed from the very
start, as the modern history of India shows that no coalition
government could manage to last long.
</P>
<P>
From July 28, 1979 to May 16, 1996, the country had seen four
coalition governments set up and led by prime ministers Charan
Singh, V.P.Singh, C.Shekhar and A.B. Vajpayee, but none of them
lasted more than one year.
</P>
<P>
The UF came to power on June 1 last year with the support from
the Congress party after no political party could obtain a
majority in parliament and form a government by itself following
the inconclusive April-May general election.
</P>
<P>
In the 543 elected Parliament seats, the Bharatiya Janata Party
(BJP), the so-called "communal force" as labeled by other
"secular" parties, got 193 together with its alliance, while the
13-party UF won 188 seats including 11 supporters.
</P>
<P>
The Congress party got only 141 seats. And determined to
prevent the BJP from coming to power at the center, the Congress
offered its support from outside to the UF which then formed a
coalition government.
</P>
<P>
In the past 10 months, the Gowda government has won wide
approval for continuing policies of economic reforms pursued by
the previous governments and enhancing friendly relations with its
neighbors. But it has been torn by constant internal strife, which
is hampering the implementation of its promises and policies.
</P>
<P>
The 13 parties with different political persuasions came from
different parts of the country and held different views on various
issues, making it difficult for them to have a unitary stand.
</P>
<P>
In addition, it was not an easy job to be on good terms with
the UF's outside supporter of the Congress party, which has a
different background and is bent on staging a comeback someday and
form a government of its own. The worsening ties between the UF
and the Congress eventually led to the withdrawal of the
Congress's support to the UF on March 30, and the fall of the
Gowda government became almost inevitable.
</P>
<P>
Political parties are now busy working out new strategies to
tide over the current impasse. Since the majority of parliament
members loathe going to the polls so soon, they will have to find
a way out through a realignment of political parties.
</P>
<P>
The UF and the Congress are reported to have kept constant
contact with each other and the BJP is also busy mustering support
from small regional parties. However, no matter what kind of
realignment may come into being, none is expected to be able to
offer a stable government in the country.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Kuala Lumpur Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The Kuala Lumpur Stock
Exchange (KLSE) recovered a bit but was still weak in the absence
of strong interest this week.
</P>
<P>
The Composite Index (CI) recovered 1.58 points to end the week
at 1,138.36, the EMAS Index gained 0.11 of a point to 329.40 while
the Second Board Index lost 12.79 points to 595.03 and the
Industrial Index down 3.85 points to 2,139.25.
</P>
<P>
The market opened the week reeling from the bearish mood over
the central bank's lending curbs for the purchase of property and
shares and Wall Street drop over interest rates woes.
</P>
<P>
Property, construction and finance-based counters were badly
hit by the central bank's lending guidelines which were aimed at
ensuring stability in the local economy over the long term.
</P>
<P>
The National Bank's explanation over its measures and Finance
Minister Anwar Ibrahim's call to investors to invest on the basis
of market fundamentals were somewhat soothing enough for a short
rebound on Tuesday and the day after.
</P>
<P>
However, the market was already expected to fall further to
form a better base for subsequent trading and as such, any rebound
was short-lived as selling pressure continued, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
In the absence of encouraging news, rumors cropped up saying
that some stockbroking houses had run into financial difficulties
due to the default in margin calls, which put a toll on prices.
</P>
<P>
Foreign funds were said to be refusing to buy at this stage
while local funds stayed away from the bearish market.
</P>
<P>
The analysts pegged support for the benchmark CI at 1,100 and
resistance at 1,150 points.
</P>
<P>
The analysts considered the week as a "sell-on-rally market"
and would look up at the Wall Street performance for next week's
direction.
</P>
<P>
The mainboard volume was 1.207 billion shares worth 7.008
billion ringgit ( about 2.8032 billion U.S. dollars) from 1.580
billion shares valued at 9.517 billion ringgit (about 3.8068
billion U.S. dollars) last week.
</P>
<P>
The second board turnover stood at 203.042 million shares
valued at 2.213 billion ringgit (about 885.2 million U.S. dollars)
against 265.061 million shares worth 3.066 billion ringgit (about
1.2264 billion U.S. dollars) last week.
</P>
<P>
Off market deals amounted 235.994 million shares worth 1.702
billion ringgit (about 680.8 million U.S. dollars) compared with
239.436 million shares valued at 1.683 billion ringgit (about
673.2 million U.S. dollars) last week.
</P>
<P>
This week, one counter, property-based Crescendo Corp, made its
debut on the Main Board on Tuesday with a fair premium of 2.00
ringgit (about 80 U.S. cents) over its offer price of 4.00 ringgit
(about 1.6 U.S. dollars). The counter ended the week at 5.45
ringgit (about 2.18 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
During the week, property-based Damansara and Metroplex and
trading counter O'Connor's Corp were suspended from trading
pending announcements.
</P>
<P>
Aokam Perdana led the 10 most active counters, down 26 sen to
3.48 ringgit, followed by Chase Perdana which fell 1.10 ringgit to
10.50 ringgit, KLIH down 34 sen to 3.58 ringgit and AMMB-BR which
lost seven sen to 0.24 ringgit.
</P>
<P>
In terms of volume, Aokam Perdana accounted for 45.626 million
shares traded, Chase Perdana 37.493 million shares traded, AMMB-LR
36.080 million shares, KLIH 33.163 million shares, AMMB-BR 31.907
million shares, Renong 28.095 million shares, Sinora 26.457
million shares, Tekala 26.167 million shares, Berjaya Industrial
23.159 million shares and Sime Darby 21.747 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Consumer products accounted for 86.336 million shares traded,
industrial products 242.805 million shares, construction 104.469
million shares, trading/services 162.435 million shares,
infrastructure 2.956 million shares, finance 156.960 million

shares, plantation 30.632 million shares, mining 10.716 million
shares, trusts 2.214 million shares and loan stocks 172.994
million shares.
</P>
<P>
The KLSE is expected to see further dips next week as players
liquidate their stocks to cut losses in the absence of strong
interest this week.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Malaysia's CPO, Tin &AMP; Rubber Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's markets of crude
palm oil (CPO) physicals, tin and rubber closed the week mixed.
</P>
<P>
During the week, the CPO physicals market was on the uptrend,
opening the week at 1,287.50 ringgit (about 515 U.S. dollars) per
ton and ending at 1,305 ringgit (about 522 U.S. dollars) per ton.
</P>
<P>
April South closed the week at 1,305 ringgit (about 522 U.S.
dollars) per ton, up 15 ringgit (about six U.S. dollars) against
last week's close.
</P>
<P>
Private crop forecaster Ivan Wong's bearish forecast released
on Monday somewhat stagnated the market. Wong estimated a 32
percent increase for March production and exports for the same
month at 560,000 tons compared with 377,000 tons for February.
</P>
<P>
He also forecast that March stocks would rise slightly to
725,000 tons from 723,000 tons in February.
</P>
<P>
Higher export forecast by cargo surveyor Caleb Brett for the
first 10 days of April aided the bullish market. Caleb Brett's
export forecast was at 204,00 tons compared with 161,000 tons for
the first 10 days of March.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that emergence of strong leads are expected to
further push up the price of CPO physicals next week.
</P>
<P>
The market is expected to receive a bullish export forecast for
the first 15 days of April by cargo surveyor Societe Generale de
Surveillance and this would continue the market's uptrend, they
said.
</P>
<P>
On the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM), the price of the metal
was volatile this week.
</P>
<P>
It opened the week at 14.27 ringgit (about 5.708 U.S. dollars)
per kg but was lower the next day at 14.18 ringgit (about 5.672
U.S. dollars) per kg. It moved up slightly the following day, and
was again in the downtrend for the rest of the week.
</P>
<P>
It closed the week at 14.10 ringgit (about 5.64 U.S. dollars)
per kg, lower by 19 sen from last week's close at 14.29 ringgit
(about 5.716 U.S. dollars) per kg.
</P>
<P>
The turnover this week increased to 449 tons from 370 tons last
week with the locals, European and Japanese players dominating the
transactions.
</P>
<P>
The KLTM is expected to experience volatile trading next week
with the price likely to hover between 14.05 ringgit (about 5.62
U.S. dollars) and 14.25 ringgit (about 5.7 U.S. dollars) per kg.
</P>
<P>
However, the metal, which is traded in U.S. dollars on the
London Metal Exchange, is expected to gain support from the strong
greenback following the U.S. government's policy to maintain the
strong parity of its currency.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Malaysian rubber market was very quiet
throughout the week due to weak Indonesian prices and bearish
regional markets.
</P>
<P>
There were no strong leads in the market during the week to
push up rubber prices and this resulted in a gradual slide of the
prices.
</P>
<P>
RSS One and SMR 20 fell to 290.50 sen (about 116.2 U.S. cents)
per kg and 275 sen (about 110 U.S. cents) per kg respectively at
the week's close from 294.50 sen (about 117.8 U.S. cents) per kg
and 278.50 sen (about 111.4 U.S. cents) per kg last week.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian rubber prices are expected to continue their
downtrend next week unless strong leads emerge to support the
market, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
A dealer said the market hoped to see a rebound in Indonesian
rubber prices so that they could spill over the bullish sentiment
to the local front.

<P>
KAMPALA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Germany has released a loan of
31.5 million U.S. dollars to Uganda for further financial
assistance to the east African country, reported the local daily

</P>
<P>
An agreement on the loan was signed here yesterday by Ugandan
minister of state for finance Mathew Rukikaire and the German
ambassador to Uganda Hans Joachim on behalf of their respective
governments.
</P>
<P>
Rukikaire said out of the loan, 8.2 m dollars will be used for
the water supply and sanitation project for Kabale town near
Rwanda, 6 m dollaars for roads program phase iv for eastern
Uganda and 2.5 m dollars for re-integration of demobilsed
soldiers (phase ii).

<P>
The other money is to be used in other projects such as Uganda
railways container terminal in Kampala and vocational training
centres for the ministry of labour among others.

Rukikaire praised the close cooperation between the two
countries, while Joachim promised to maintain it and stressed the
confidence his government has in the stability and development in
Uganda.

assistance to the country.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Ranks First in Teenage Pregnancies in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Forty-three percent of Uganda
teenagers are mothers or pregnant with their first child, making
the country lead in teenage pregnancies in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Francois Farah, the United Nations population fund
reporesentative in Uganda was quoted by today's local daily "the
New Vision" today as saying that adolescents here engage in
sexual relations at an early age is the reason of the high
percentage of pregnancies among teenages.
</P>
<P>
He said this is partly due to lack of information about its
consequences and for lack of guidance.
</P>
<P>
He said girls are often too shy to discuss reproductive health
issues with their mothers who are also too shy to discuss sex
with their daughters.
</P>
<P>
He said traditional initiation through aunties is fading away
when there is no modern substitute to assist the youth in growing
up.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Farah said girls often lack information on how to
protect themselves against pregnancies and yet they are expected
never to say no to sexual advances from boys.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 12 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has joined its
voice to an international call to oppose Iaraeli new
house-building project in controversial East Jerusalem, which is
causing a peace crisis in Middle East, a local daily The Citizen
reported today.
</P>
<P>
This followed the announcement by Foreign Affairs Minister
Alfred Nzo on Friday that the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), of
which South Africa is a member, had decided to freeze relations
with Israel at current levels.
</P>
<P>
NAM's decision came after a special session of the Conference
on Palestine, held at NAM's ministerial meeting in India earlier
this week, during which Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat appealed
for assistance against the "obstinate and destructive " policies
of Israel, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Arafat told the conference that the peace process in the
Middle East was in grave danger because of these policies and in
particular the "abrogation" of the rights of Muslim and Christian
worshippers in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in Pretoria, Nzo said Arafat had
appealed for solidarity from the non-aligned countries in the
coming special general assembly session of the United Nations
under the banner of Uniting for Peace.
</P>
<P>
At NAM's ministerial meeting in India, South Africa was chosen
as the host country for the NAM's 12th summit of heads of state
next year, which it would take the chairmanship of the NAM from
Colombia.

<HEADLINE> Russia Plans Military Pullout From Moldova </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov said today Russia was planning to pull out its
5,000-strong troops from the east bank of the Dniestr River in
Moldova.
</P>
<P>
Primakov was speaking at a news conference in the Moldovan
capital Kishinev after taking part in talks between Moldovan
government leaders and separatists at the east bank, known as
Transdniestria.
</P>
<P>
But the Russian minister didn't disclose the date of pullout.
</P>
<P>
The Russian troops entered Moldova in 1992 to halt a civil war
between the government and the separatists, who refused to be part
of Macedonia after the mainly Romanian-speaking nation became
independent in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said the two sides have agreed to sign a "memorandum
of understanding on normalizing relations between Moldova and
Transdniestria" before May 15 this year.
</P>
<P>
A new article would be added into the memorandum, making clear
that Moldova and Transdniestria "will develop their relations as
part of a single state," he added.
</P>
<P>
Moldovan President Petru Lucinschi initially refused to sign
the document when it was drawn up last June, saying that it
breached "the principle of the intangibility of borders."
</P>
<P>
A Moldovan government spokesman told Xinhua in a telephone
interview that Moldova was satisfied with the Russian promise for
troop withdrawal and the separatist leaders' recognition of
Transdniestria as part of Moldova.
</P>
<P>
Primakov visited Kishinev for a day to discuss the relations
between Russia and Moldova, and to mediate between the Moldovan
government and the separatists.

ROME, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Secretary-General
Kofi Annan "knows very well the total commitment of Italy to
Albania," Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said after
meeting the head of the world body in Torin today.
</P>
<P>
Dini said that Annan is aware that "Italy will make a maximum
effort for the entire Albanian population."
</P>
<P>
Annan's arrival here today coincided with the first dispatch of
Italian troops to Albania, which is part of the Italian-led
multinational humanitarian mission in the troubled country.
</P>
<P>
The 6,000-strong force will be deployed in Albania to guard aid
deliveries, mainly attributed by the European Union, and help
restore order there.
</P>
<P>
Dini denied that there had been any "misunderstanding" with
Annan over the tragedy of the shipwreck of an Albanian refugee
boat late March.

Annan was quoted as speaking of "reparation" for the death of
the 89 Albanian aboard the boat which sank after colliding with an

However, Dini said Italy will provide its ravaged Balkan
neighbor with "compensation which is more than psychological."

<P>
PANAMA CITY, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The Panamanian-proposed
Multinational Antidrug Center at the U.S. Howard Air Base on the
banks of the Panama Canal should be subject to a referendum before
construction begins, a Panamanian official said today.
</P>
<P>
Jorge Ritter, who was appointed by the Panamanian government to
keep contacts with the U.S. officials on issues related to the
antidrug center, said the referendum will be called after an
agreement is reached with the United States.
</P>
<P>
Panamanian President Ernesto Perez Balladares said the
negotiations could start immediately after Gen. Wesley Clark, head
of the U.S. Army Southern Command, gives his approval.
</P>
<P>
Ritter noted that what Panama proposes is the
multilateralization of the war against drugs, which now is carried
out unilaterally by the United States from Howard.
</P>
<P>
The idea of creating the center was proposed after Panama and
the United States failed to reach an agreement on continuing
U.S. military presence in the country in November 1996.
</P>
<P>
Mexico, Peru and Colombia are expected to take part in the
center.

<HEADLINE> Envoy Says Force in Albania to Secure Aid, Restore Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The major goal of a multinational
protection force to be deployed in Albania is to guard aid
deliveries and help restore public order, not to disarm locals,
chief European mediator for Albania said today.
</P>
<P>
Franz Vranitzky, former Austrian chancellor and now chief of
international coordination effort, said the force had no mandate
to disarm locals, but Albanians would be encouraged to surrender
their weapons seized from state armories when they saw the
situation was safer.
</P>
<P>
"The most important task is to protect humanitarian and
economic aid and ensure that it does not get into the hands of
illegitimate groups," he said.
</P>
<P>
Italian advance units of the multinational force arrived in
Albania on Friday and the bulk of the force is due to begin
deployment next Monday in the tiny Balkan nation, where violence
erupted following the collapse of a number of shady pyramid
investment schemes.
</P>
<P>
Vranitzky, working on behalf of the 54-nation Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), said the OSCE's major
aims included: supporting the caretaker government; resoring
public order; furthering dialogue and cooperation; delivering aid
and working to allow elections be held in June.
</P>
<P>
Vranitzky said that the goals could not be fulfilled
individually. "All of these activities are dependent on one
another. The holding of these elections will not be possible in
chaos and anarchy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Vranitzky said he would travel to Tirana next Wednesday with
Austrian diplomat Herbert Grubmayr to prepare the ground for an
OSCE mission.
</P>
<P>
Grubmayr was newly appointed by the OSCE to coordinate a
three-pronged international relief effort -- comprising the OSCE,
the European Union and the multinational force -- in Albania.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 people have been killed since rebels took control
of the country's south last month in an eruption of anger
following the collapse of the saving schemes.

<HEADLINE> Mongolian Economy Further Down in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia's national economy in
the first quarter of the year slipped further on the downward
trend that started in the second half of last year.
</P>
<P>
As a result, according to a State Statistics Bureau report
released on Friday, the government recorded a budget deficit of
5.8 billion togrog (about seven million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The quarterly deficit was stemmed from the government's total
spenditures of 48.1 billion togrog (58.2 million dollars) and its
revenues of 42.3 billion togrog (51.2 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
In the country's industrial sector, output in the first three
months of the year stood at 44.1 billion togrog (53.4 million
dollars), 4.8 percent less than the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in animal husbandry, Mongolia's single most
important agricultural sector, a 98.3 percent survival rate
brought alive more than 3.4 million newborn livestock animals.
</P>
<P>
However, as the survival rate for newborns was about the same
as previous years, the number of adult animals dropped by 235,800,
a further down of 183,300 compared with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The price index in March, if calculated on the basis of the
fixed price in 1995, went up by 8.1 percent against last December
and 2.3 percent compared with February.
</P>
<P>
The average monthly increase of the price index in the first
quarter was 2.7 percent, said the government report.
</P>
<P>
On the labor market, 60,800 people -- 5.12 percent of
Mongolia's labor force -- were registered as jobless by April 1,
or 5,364 more than the total at the end of last year.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves Three-Year Loan for Macedonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) today approved a three-year loan of some 75 million
U.S. dollars to support Macedonia's economic restructuring.
</P>
<P>
The loan, channeled through the IMF's Enhanced Structural
Adjustment Facility (ESAF), is provided to back the 1997-99
economic reform program of the former Yugoslav Republic.
</P>
<P>
The first annual loan, equivalent to about 25 million dollars,
will be made available in two equal semiannual installments, the
first of which is available immediately.
</P>
<P>
Under the medium term, the program targets annual gross
domestic product (GDP) growth of about 5 percent, inflation of 2
to 3 percent yearly, and a decline in the external current account
deficit to 5.3 percent of GDP from 12 percent of GDP in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In this context of the strategy, the program for 1997 aims for
real GDP growth of 5 percent, year-end inflation of 2 percent, and
an external current account deficit of 8.5 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
Macedonia succeeded to the membership in the IMF of the former
Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia from December 14, 1992.
Its quota is about 68 million dollars and its outstanding use of
IMF credit stands at about 64 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The ESAF is a concessional IMF facility for assisting eligible
member nations that are undertaking economic reform programs to
strengthen their balance of payments and improve their growth
prospects.

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Negotiations for a free trade
agreement between Mexico and the Central America's Northern
Triangle countries, namely, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador,
will continue in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, from April 28 to 30.
</P>
<P>
Sergio Nunez, vice minister of the Honduran Foreign Trade
Ministry, said today in a report received from Tegucigalpa that
the meeting of negotiators-in-chiefs will try to reach consensus
on some points of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Although the four countries have reached consensus on about 80
percent of the trade agreement, "there are still sensitive points
in the hands of the negotiators, who must find formulas to open
consensus options among the parts," Nunez said.
</P>
<P>
In two or three months, Nunez said, the representatives of the
four countries will hold dialogues to decide what products will be
covered by the agreement and the issues concerning tariff
elimination among the four countries.
</P>
<P>
Nunez said the agreement would be ready by the end of the year,
as negotiations have been advancing as planned since they were
restarted in 1996 at the request of the presidents of the four
countries.
</P>
<P>
Issues already discussed include tariff reduction for
agricultural and industrial products, sanitary and technical
standards, unfair trade practices, trade protectionism, solution
of controversies, investments, and government purchases.

<P>
MANAGUA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rica has requested the
extradition from Nicaragua of the leader of Commando Yolaina who
stormed the Nicaraguan embassy in San Jose in 1993, Nicaraguan
Ministry of Foreign Affairs said today.
</P>
<P>
"The request has been acknowledged. But it will be decided by
the Supreme Court of Justice of our country according to our
constitution," said David Silva, spokesman of Nicaraguan Ministry
of Foreign Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Manuel Urbina Lara and two masked men, who made up the
so-called Commando Yolaina, stormed the Nicaraguan embassy in San
Jose on March 8, 1993, and took 20 embassy staff members,
including the ambassador, hostage.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rican authorities said the extradition request for Urbina
Lara was presented by the Costa Rican Supreme Court of Justice to
its Nicaraguan counterpart.
</P>
<P>
Urbina Lara was arrested on January 31 when he returned to
Nicaragua. The other two members of the Yolaina commando have not

<HEADLINE> Dutch PM: Special EU Summit Likely on May 23 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The Netherlands, now holding the
rotating presidency of the European Union (EU), is likely to call
a special EU summit to pave ways for a revised Maastricht Treaty.
</P>
<P>
The EU presidency is considering such a summit meeting to take
place on May 23, Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok was quoted by Dutch
radio monitored here as saying today at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
However, no decision has been made so far, he said.
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van Mierlo told EU
foreign ministers gathering in the Dutch town of Noordwijk that
the possibility for a special summit in May was "increasing."
</P>
<P>
Dutch officials indicate that whether there will be a special
summit depends on the progress made in the negotiations on a
revised Maastricht Treaty setting economic benchmarks for EU
countries to join the European Monetary Union in 1999.
</P>
<P>
EU sources say that a final decision on the summit is expected
to be hammered out when foreign ministers of the 15-nation bloc
meet in Luxembourg later this month.
</P>
<P>
The date of May 23 is less than one month before EU heads of
government meet in Amsterdam, capital of the Netherlands, to
approve the new treaty.
</P>
<P>
Dutch officials have intended to avoid holding two summits
close together this summer, but they now see it as essential if an
agreement is to be reached in June.

KATHMANDU, April 12 (Xinhua) -- A parliamentary leader of Nepal
has urged to curb the rampant corruption in the society through
building up public opinion and social pressure.
</P>
<P>
Lower House Speaker Ram Chandra Poudel said here Friday that no
one has yet been able to relieve the country of the corruption
problem despite all the claims to stop it.
</P>
<P>
He told a meeting of the Public Administration Association of
Nepal (PAAN) that activities detrimental to democratic values and
norms are taking place in the country with the power of money.

Citing the often undesired implementation of development
projects on the district level, mostly attributed to the

corruption in Nepal.

<HEADLINE> Thai Researchers Find New Way to Detect Sick Shrimps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Researchers from the
Bangkok-based Mahidol University have discovered a new method to
detect viruses in shrimps, which could help curb those diseases
threatening Thailand's shrimp exports.
</P>
<P>
The researchers from the faculty of science of the University
found that the technique of polymerase chain reaction can
accurately identify viruses when they are still in early stage in
baby shrimps within one day.
</P>
<P>
To detect the viruses that could cause shrimp diseases, like
"yellow head", and "white spots", sample baby shrimps should be
kept in 70 percent alcohol, according to the researchers.
</P>
<P>
The fatality rate of shrimps contracting these diseases could
be as high as 80 percent, they said, adding that the technique
will benefit shrimp farmers and exporters.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers said that Thailand's shrimp exports dropped to
43 billion baht (1.72 billion US dollars) in 1996 from 52 billion
baht (2.08 billion dollars) and the epidemics of the two diseases
was one of the major factors contributing to the decrease.

BANGKOK, April 12 (Xinhua) -- About 600,000 people, or one in a
hundred persons in Thailand, are suffering from mental illness or

Dr. Preecha Intho, director general of the Mental Health
Department, based his judgment on figures during the past three
years.

He said looser family relationships, as a result of social and

in the number of mental patients.
</P>

He also attributed tough competition in society to the
increase.

<P>
He said that when suffering from mental illness, young adults
turn unusually aggressive, while the elderly and children become

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Catch Rainwater For Better Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, April 12 (Xinhua) -- When Luo Youshun, a farmer in
Luoma Village of Huining County, Gansu Province, entertains a
guest, he fetches a basin of hot water so his visitor can wash,
then offers him tea.
</P>
<P>
Luo says this practice is unusual: most villagers would rather
serve their guests steamed buns than a cup of tea, and the guests
clean up with a towel dipped in a mug of water. Just a few years
ago water was more precious than food oil in the eyes of farmers
here, he says.
</P>
<P>
Now, the farmers in northwest China's dry mountainous areas
have bettered their lot by catching rainwater.
</P>
<P>
Luo's village, like most of the province's high arid areas, is
short of groundwater and has no rivers. Farmers rely heavily on
rainfall, which they store in wells. But collecting a sufficient
water supply is difficult because of the highly absorbent soil.
</P>
<P>
In dry years, farmers traveled 15 km to fetch bitter and salty
fountain water, Luo says. In 1995, the well dried up and the local
government had to send for water from the Yellow River irrigation
areas a long distance away.
</P>
<P>
He attributes the village's water supply turnaround to a
government-sponsored rainfall storage project, which has
benefitted 250,000 households and uplifted the appearance of
farmers' courtyards, now noteably more sanitary and planted with
flowers, vegetables and trees. Earthen roofs are covered with tile
and courtyards lined with cement to create the best water flow
into the storage wells.
</P>
<P>
Luo's once-muddy yard was littered with farm tools. He's
cleaned it up, and no longer feeds poultry and livestock in the
yard for safe water's sake. He says he is careful now not to leave
cigarette butts on the ground.
</P>
<P>
Some villagers have installed hand pumps on their new
wells. Others store rainwater in an elevated container, which is
connected with pipes that run into their kitchens, providing
running water.

<HEADLINE> China Hits Record in Grain Purchasing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- China hit a record to purchase
118.5 billion kg of grain during the first three months this year,
24.1 billion kg more than the same period in 1996, today's
Beijing-based "People's Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
Greater effort has enabled the country to purchase nearly all
of the grain that the farmers want to put on sales, further
encouraging their initiatives for farming and enhancing the
country's ability in macro-control of grain purchasing.
</P>
<P>
The bumper harvest of 1996 encouraged the country to take a
series of measures, such as adding the volume of special grain
reserves, to expand its capability to purchase grain.
</P>
<P>
The country's various provinces, regions and municipalities
have set new purchasing prices expected to offer more benefits for
the farmers.
</P>
<P>
By last month northeast China's Heilongjiang, Jilin and
Liaoning provinces and north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region had kept a large stock of grain totalling 63.1 billion kg,
rising 77 percent over the same period in 1996. The three
provinces and the region had transported five billion kg of grain
to some middle and big cities and areas short of grain supply by
March. The figure is expected to rise to 8.7 billion kg by the
coming June. enditem

STOCKHOLM, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Sweden attaches great
importance to Swedish-Chinese relations and hopes to further
bilateral cooperation, especially in trade and economy, Swedish
Prime Minister Goran Persson said today.
</P>
<P>
Persson recalled, at a meeting with visiting Chinese Vice
Premier Wu Bangguo, his visit to China last November, saying it is
important for leaders of both countries to obtain closer bilateral
ties through frequent contact, exchange and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Wu, who arrived here today for an official visit, hailed the
latest development of Sino-Swedish relations, noting that the
trade volume between the two countries rose by 27 percent to 1.77
billion U.S. dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Representative offices of big Swedish companies have mushroomed
in China in recent years and have launched various joint-venture
projects with their Chinese counterparts, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Though differences exist between the two countries' social
systems, ideologies and cultures, both sides should respect each
other and try to bring a stable and healthy bilateral relationship
into the next century.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Wu also held talks with Vice Speaker of the
Swedish parliament, Anders Bjorck, who called for more exchange
and cooperation between the two countries' legislatures.
</P>
<P>
Wu agreed, saying cooperation between legislative bodies is of
great importance to promote overall bilateral relations.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Starts Anti-Corruption Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma
signed today an anti-corruption program in a fresh effort to pull
the country out of the deep-rooted crime.
</P>
<P>
The program, said Justice Minister Sergy Holovaty, is to check
on all public servants before October 1, and fire those found to
be related to corruption or criminal groups.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a review on how all senior government officials
implement the nation's Anti-Corruption Law should be accomplished
before August 1, 1998, Holovaty told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine's Anti-Corruption Law, adopted in October 1995, so far
has shown no teeth. Some international organizations, including
the World Bank, have already expressed concern about the situation.
</P>
<P>
World Bank President James Wolfensohn, who complained about
corruption in a letter to Kuchma last year, raised the issue again
when he met the Ukrainian president in February at the World
Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma then kicked off a "Clean Hands" campaign against graft
immediately after returning to Kiev. The 13-page program signed
today is the first production of Kuchma's anti-corruption drive.
</P>
<P>
However, doubts remain over how much the program can achieve.
Since 1991, only 3,000 people have been punished for job-related
crimes, but none of them held a top-level position in government,
according to statistics from the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Holovaty said in March that the main base of corruption is the
officials who are now running the government and who will also see
to Kuchma's anti-corruption program.

<HEADLINE> Background: ABCs of Basic Law of Hong Kong SAR (17-18) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Following are the ABCs of the
Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (17-18)
in a question-and-answer format:
</P>
<P>
Question: After China resumes its exercise of sovereignty over
Hong Kong, can the National People's Congress (NPC) enact laws for
Hong Kong?
</P>
<P>
Answer: No, the NPC cannot unilaterally enact laws on Hong
Kong's internal administrative affairs. That is because the Basic
Law stipulates that the Hong Kong SAR has legislative power. The
Legislature of Hong Kong is the Legislative Council of the Hong
Kong SAR which will enact laws in accordance with procedures as
prescribed by the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
Laws enacted by the legislature of the Hong Kong SAR must be
reported to the NPC Standing Committee for record. The process of
reporting does not affect the entry into force of such laws.
</P>
<P>
Should the NPC Standing Committee, after consulting Committee
for the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR that operates under it,
finds that any law enacted by the Hong Kong legislature does not
conform to provisions of the Basic Law regarding affairs within
the responsibility of the central authorities as well as the
relationship between the central government and the Hong Kong SAR,
it may return the law in question but will not amend it. Any law
returned by the NPC Standing Committee will immediately be
invalidated. Such invalidation will have no retroactive power
unless otherwise provided for in laws of the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
Question: Can people in the mainland freely enter Hong Kong
after 1997?
</P>
<P>
Answer: Some people in the mainland think that, after July 1,
1997, they may freely go to Hong Kong. This is a misunderstanding.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is too small a place to have a big
population. Despite being a free port, therefore, Hong Kong has
always exercised entry controls to prevent its population from
exploding. Before 1997, there has been a strict restriction on the
number of mainlanders allowed to settle in Hong Kong. The same
strict restriction will be imposed in this regard after 1997. Also
mainlanders will not be as free to visit Hong Kong as they are to
travel from one place to another in the mainland.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law stipulates that, to enter the Hong Kong SAR,
people from other parts of China must apply for approval and that
the number of mainlanders allowed to enter the SAR for settlement
be determined by competent authorities of the central government
after consulting the Hong Kong regional government. After 1997,
therefore, there will be continued restrictions on the number of
mainlanders entering Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Given the fact that, after China resumes its exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong, many mainlanders will want to visit
the region, relevant departments will, in a planned way, increase
the number of tour groups for Hong Kong to be organized by travel
agencies.

<HEADLINE> FIFA to Investigate Roethlisberger Case, Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- World soccer ruling body FIFA said
they would investigate Swiss referee Kurt Roethlisberger who on
Thursday lost his appeal to UEFA against a life ban for attempted
bribery, according to reports reaching here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
In another development, European governing body UEFA said on
Friday it was planning to look into another match-fixing
allegation, involving Roethlisberger and Bayern Munich, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
Roethlisberger was suspended by UEFA after they found he
solicited a bribe to fix a European Cup Champions' League match
between Grasshopper Zurich and Auxerre on October 30.
</P>
<P>
But the ban extends only to UEFA-related activities and does
not apply worldwide. UEFA plans to forward the findings of their
investigation to FIFA who will examine the case, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
FIFA said in a statement Roethlisberger could face a worldwide
ban if their findings concurred with those of UEFA.

CAIRO, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Adel Mohammed scored twice to lead
the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to roll over Bahrain 2-1 in Asia's
first round Group Three World Cup qualifying tournament in Manama,
Bahrain, on Friday.

Bahrain played a mostly defensive match but launched last-ditch
attacks in the final minutes and created an opportunity for Hameed
Darwish, who scored Bahrain's only goal in the last minute.
</P>
<P>
The victory gave the UAE four points from two games. Jordan,
which drew 0-0 with the UAE on Tuesday, faces Bahrain on Monday in
the final match of the group's first phase.
</P>
<P>
The group next week will move to the UAE for the final three
matches. Only the winner of the three-team group advances to the
second round.

<HEADLINE> HK to Send 51 Athletes to East Asian Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will send 51 athletes
to the Second East Asian Games slated for May 10-19 in Pusan,
South Korea, it was announced here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Pusan Games will be the last comprehensive sporting event
Hong Kong athletes are to participate before the handover at the
midnight on June 30 this year.
</P>
<P>
From July 1 on, Hong Kong will be part of China, under the name
of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), and its athletes
will compete in international events under the name of "Hong
Kong, China", as stipulated by the Basic Law concerning the SAR.
</P>
<P>
In Pusan, Hong Kong athletes will compete in six medal sports,
namely athletics, gymnastics, badminton, judo, swimming and
diving, and Wushu and demonstration events of rowing and bowling.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong athletes collected one gold, two silver and eight
bronze medals at the inaugural East Asian Games in Shanghai in
1993.
</P>
<P>
But it would be harder now than four years ago for Hong Kong to
do equally well in terms of number of medals, as two of the sports
in which Hong Kong competed in Shanghai had been put as
demonstration events.
</P>
<P>
"Anyway, we hope that our athletes could do ever better at
Pusan," said Pang Chung, Chef de Mission of the Hong Kong
delegation.
</P>
<P>
The first group of Hong Kong athletes and officials are
scheduled to leave for South Korea on May 7, Pang said.

<HEADLINE> US, EU Reach Agreement on Anti-Cuba Law Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) and
the United States today reached an agreement on a dispute over the
Helms-Burton Act against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
In announcing the deal, U.S. Commerce Undersecretary Stuart
Eizenstat said the U.S. and EU promised "best efforts" to develop
a broader agreement by October 15.
</P>
<P>
In Brussels earlier today, EU announced that it will suspend a
complaint against the U.S. to the World Trade Organization (WTO),
but it could be revived if no broader agreement is reached in
separate negotiations.
</P>
<P>
EU Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan emphasized that EU
reserves its right to refile the complaint before the WTO if there
is no final solution.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, reached after intensive telephone
contacts between trade officials of both sides, the Clinton
administration will persuade U.S. Congress to abandon some
provisions of the law.
</P>
<P>
EU insisted that the law, which aims to stop foreign trade in
Cuba, is a violation of the free trade principles of WTO.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. argued that the complaint by EU has interfered in
its foreign policy, saying WTO has no right to make a verdict on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement avoids placing our foreign policy interests
before the WTO, an organization designed to facilitate trade, not
arbitrate foreign policy disputes," Eizenstat said.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves $657 Mln Stand-By Credit for Bulgaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) today approved credits totaling some 657 million U.S.
dollars equivalent for Bulgaria in an effort to back its
government's economic programs.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, about 147 million dollars equivalent is available
under the cereal element of the Compensatory and Contingency
Financing Facility (CCFF), which provides financing to member
nations experiencing balance of payments problems caused by an
excess in the cost of their cereal imports that is both temporary
and beyond the control of the authorities. A further some 510
million dollars is available over the next 14 months under a
stand-by credit to bolster the government's economic program for
1997-98.
</P>
<P>
The program is targeted to limit the decline of real GDP to 4.8
percent in 1997, as growth turns positive by mid-year, reduce
monthly inflation to 2 percent by the end of the year, maintain a
small surplus in the current account and double official reserves
to the equivalent of three months of imports of goods and
nonfinancial services.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria joined the IMF in September, 1990. Its quota is about
637 million dollars and its outstanding use of IMF credit currently
totals about 520 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The IMF okayed a 20-month stand-by credit on July 19, last
year, equivalent to about 548 million dollars, of which Bulgaria
drew only about 110 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Plunge on Inflation Concerns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 11 (Xinhua) -- New inflation worries fanned up
by March economic data sent the Dow Jones industrial average down
nearly 150 points today and erased all of 1997's gains.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 148.36 points to
6,391.69, down 134.38 for the week.
</P>
<P>
Broad-market measures also posted stiff losses after the bond
market slid, boosting interest rates to a nine-month high,
following this morning's reports on wholesale prices and retail
sales.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 6-to-1 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 444.36 million
shares a bit more than 426.35 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list fell 20.69 to 737.65, and
the NYSE's composite index fell 9.85 to 389.51.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index dropped 28.87 to 1,206.90, and the
American Stock Exchange composite index fell 7.03 to 556.16.
</P>
<P>
The Dow, which just a month ago was sporting a gain of nearly
10 percent on the year, is now down almost 1 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department reported that wholesale prices, excluding
food and energy, shot up unexpectedly. The so-called core rate
rose 0.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department, meanwhile, reported a modest 0.2
percent increase in retail sales for March, but nearly doubled its
initial estimate of February's consumer activity to a 1.5 percent
increase.
</P>
<P>
As bonds fell, the yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond rose to
about 7.16 percent, its highest point since July.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls for Help from Congress in Trade, Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today called on the Congress to ratify the Chemical Weapons
Convention and to give him fast-track authority he needs to expand
trade with Latin Americans.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made the remarks here before a luncheon of the American
Society of Newspaper Editors.
</P>
<P>
Citing the fact that Latin American nations had more trade with
Europe than the U.S. last year, Clinton said,"There is no reason
to think other nations will wait while we sit idle."
</P>
<P>
Saying that every president since 1974 has had the authority to
negotiate trade agreements under procedures requiring Congress to
accept or reject them without amendments, Clinton asked for the
same power.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's "fast-track" authority expired in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has sought to bring Chile into the
North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) which groups the U.S.,
Mexico and Canada.
</P>
<P>
The so-called fast-track authority would give Clinton the power
to conclude an agreement with Chile that Congress would have to
vote for or against without delay by making amendments.
</P>
<P>
"If we don't seize these opportunities, our competitors
surely will," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he urged the Senate to do "what is right" and ratify
the Chemical Weapons Convention before the treaty goes into effect
on April 29.
</P>
<P>
"If we fail to do it...we won't be there to enforce a treaty
that we have helped to write, leaving our military and our people
more vulnerable to a silent and sudden killer," he said.
</P>
<P>
The treaty, which has been signed by 161 countries and ratified
by 70 of them, bans development, production, stockpiling and use
of all chemical warfare agents and requires they be destroyed
within 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Opponents led by Chairman Jesse Helms of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee insisted that the treaty does not serve the
interests of the U.S. and are opposed to the ratification before
amendments to the treaty.

<HEADLINE> First Racial Suit against Agriculture Department Settled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- A southern Virginia farmer has
become the first of a group of black farmers to settle one of a
racial discrimination complaints against the Agriculture
Department.
</P>
<P>
Willie L. Chute, 38, had filed an administrative complaint
charging USDA officials with delaying his loan application because
of his race.
</P>
<P>
Chute's attorney said the case was settled on Thursday and
Chute received a "substantial payment" from the department.
</P>
<P>
The settlement was confirmed on Friday by Tom Amontree, press
secretary for Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman.
</P>
<P>
In February Glickman announced his intention to eliminate
within 120 days a longstanding backlog of 875 discrimination
complaints involving farm loan programs.
</P>
<P>
Chute had sought a 119,000-dollar USDA loan in 1993 to build a
poultry house to raise chickens under contract with a major
poultry business.
</P>
<P>
His application was approved but far too late to win the
contract. Federal officials upheld his complaint that the loan was
delayed for a year because he was black.
</P>
<P>
USDA investigators found that white farmers in Chute's county
typically waited 84 days for loan decisions, while black farmers
had to wait an average of 222 days. They also found that 84
percent of white farmers had their applications approved compared
to only 56 percent of blacks.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The dollar ended mostly higher
Friday, partly recovering losses of Thursday on healthy U.S.
economic data and no sign of Japanese intervention to defend the
yen and broad weakness in the mark.
</P>
<P>
In New York the dollar settled at 126.03 yen, up from 125.65
yen Thursday. The dollar cost 1.7201 marks, up from 1.7178. But
the dollar weakened slightly against the pound, which rose to
1.6284 U.S. dollars, up from 1.6234 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Traders began bidding the dollar higher in Europe after Asian
markets had closed and the possibility of Japanese intervention
diminished. Japan's Cabinet discussed the yen's weakness but took
no action.
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York compared with Thursday:
1.4603 Swiss francs, down from 1.4680; 5.7840 French francs, up
from 5.7785; 1,696.25 Italian lira, up from 1,695.75; 1.3982

<HEADLINE> Muslim Official Hints Rejection of Belgrade Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, April 11 (Xinhua) -- A senior Muslim official on
Friday said that the proposal by Yugoslavia on establishing
diplomatic relations with Bosnia is unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
"We are analyizing the document that the Yugoslav foreign
minister's special envoy handed to us and I think it is not
acceptable for Bosnia," said Mirza Hajric, who is an advisor to
Alija Izetbegovic, chairman of the Bosnian presidency.
</P>
<P>
Hajric told the local press that the proposal asks for
withdrawal of Bosnia's suit against Yugoslavia from the
International Court of Justice in The Hague before the
establishment of the bilateral diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready for the establishment of diplomatic relations
with Yugoslavia because it is useful for both countries but we
don't want to do it under conditions," Hajric said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the proposal was being studied by legal experts
and the final decision would be taken by the collective presidency
which consists of one representative each from Bosnia's three
ethnic nations.
</P>
<P>
Since the presidential decision is by consensus, it can be
blocked by any side raising objection.
</P>
<P>
Since the signing of Dayton peace accords, Bosnian and Yugoslav
leaders have on several occasions committed themselves to
establishing bilateral relations, but the process has been bogged
down on the issue of Bosnia's charge of aggression against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Bosnia has claimed that Yugoslavia has instigated the war in
Bosnia, and that if Yugoslavia is not guilty of the aggression, it
should not be afraid of debating in court.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Palestinians Renounce Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leaders have made
a clear statement to remain committed to thwarting terrorism, the
U.S. State Department said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told reporters that
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright held a meeting with a
visiting Palestinian delegation last night, and "she received very
clear, very specific assurances from the delegation that the
Palestinians remain fundamentally committed to thwarting
terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Reports said the Palestinian Authority had took measures
against extremists by helping Israel "track down an Islamic
militant terror squad" in Gaza. Palestinian security forces also
worked together with Israelis in Hebron to try to stem violent
clashes.
</P>
<P>
Burns said "that is quite positive" as security cooperation
between the two sides re-emerged, and the next step was to
reinvigorate the peace negotiations and to move them forward.
</P>
<P>
"The United States has put ideas this week before the Israeli
prime minister and the Palestinian delegation, and we hope that
they'll all reflect very seriously upon those ideas," Burns
said.
</P>
<P>
But analysts here said even if the United States succeeds in
bringing the two sides back to the table, there are no guarantees
the talks will not collapse again.
</P>
<P>
No one could be sure the Israelis would not take one more
preempting move before final status negotiations in the zero-sum
game, the analysts said.
</P>
<P>
They are now assured of Palestinian commitment to renouncing
terrorism, but they themselves made no signal that they would
abide by peace agreements between the Palestinians and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
The recent violent clashes erupted on the West Bank as a result
of Israel's decision to build Jewish homes in traditionally Arab
east Jerusalem. The clashes led to several Palestinians killed by
Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Burns admitted the peace negotiations between the Palestinians
and Israelis "are at an impasse."
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. objective is to revive them. And to do that, we've
suggested some substantive ideas that might bridge the gap between
the Palestinians and the Israelis," he said.
