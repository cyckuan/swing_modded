<HEADLINE> Israeli Businessman Sentenced to Imprisonment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Jerusalem District Court
sentenced here Sunday a Russian-immigrated businessman to six
years imprisonment and fined him 1.42 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The businessman, Zvi Ban-Ari, also called Gregory Lerner, was
charged with fraud and bribery. He allegedly tried to set up a
Russian-Israeli bank which Israeli authorities feared would be
used to launder money. He also allegedly defrauded Russian banks
of some 106 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ari was also suspected of attempting to bribe Industry and
Trade Minister Natan Sharansky, former prime minister Shimon Parez
and Labor Party Knesset (parliament) member Nissim Zvilli in
connection with his attempt to set up the Russian-Israeli bank.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ari's lawyer Yoram Sheftel argued in court that his client
was the victim of an organized campaign by Israeli prosecutors
and Russian authorities to stifle Russian enterpreneurs.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ari immigrated to Israel in 1989 and settled in
Ashkelon. He has donated millions of dollars to hospitals, schools,
and immigration absorption projects in Israel.
</P>
<P>
He was arrested nine months ago on suspicion that he defrauded
four Russian banks of about 106 million dollars. Court papers said
that the money had been transferred to Ben-Ari's company from the
banks.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia to Cut Oil Production by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia Sunday decided
to cut oil production by 300,000 barrels per day (bpds) starting
from April 1 following consultations with Venezuela and Mexico to
stop the fall of world oil price.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil producer and exporter,
decided to work together with Venezuela and Mexico to cut the oil
supply by between 1.6 million to two million barrels per day, a
statement by the Saudi oil ministry was quoted as saying by Kuwait
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The three countries will also coordinate with other members of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and
non-OPEC members in stabilizing the oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Oil ministers from the three countries met to hold
consultations in Riyadh to discuss the world oil market where
prices have fallen to a 10-year low.
</P>
<P>
The statement indicated that the overall reduction should last
through the end of the year although the three ministers did not
set a time frame.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia currently produces 8.76 million barrels per day
of oil according to a new quota adopted last year by OPEC in
Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
OPEC's Jakarta decision to raise output allocations by 10
percent and continued quota busting by leading cartel members,
especially Venezuela, have been blamed for triggering the
catastrophic 40 percent slide from last year's average price of 20
U.S. dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
OPEC pumped 28.7 million barrels per day in February or
1.2 million above its official 27.5 million ceiling.
</P>
<P>
Besides Saudi Arabia's 8.76 million barrels, Venezuela's
production stands at 3.3 million barrels per day to overproduce by
717,000 barrels.
</P>
<P>
Mexico, although not an OPEC member, is "prepared to
participate in a joint effort with other exporting countries to
stabilize the market," a joint statement by the three countries
said.
</P>
<P>
The three countries said they were acting in response to
low oil prices in the last few months.

<HEADLINE> Coalition Leaders Discuss Army Warning in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the three coalition
parties met here Sunday afternoon to evaluate a stern warning
issued by the Turkish Armed Forces.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's Motherland Party (ANAP) Chairman and Prime Minister
Mesut Yilmaz, Left Democratic Party (DSP) leader and Deputy Prime
Minister Bulent Ecevit and head of Democratic Turkey Party (DTP)
Husamattin Cindoruk gathered at the prime ministry to discuss
a statement issued by the Turkish Armed Forces Friday, which
attacked Yilmaz's earlier remarks on the military.
</P>
<P>
In the strongly worded statement, the military, which
considers itself the guarantor of Turkey's secular system, warned
Yilmaz that it will continue its fight against Islamic
fundamentalism.
</P>
<P>
The rather unusual statement of the military was a harsh
response to Yilmaz, who has expressed uneasiness over the
military's recent crackdown on Islamic fundamentalism.
</P>
<P>
During his recent visit to neighboring Georgia, Yilmaz warned
the Turkish generals not to meddle in government affairs.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't order the army to fight against fundamentalism. The
military should tend to its own business," Yilmaz said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The statement from the Turkish Armed Forces said: "No matter
what position or task is represented, no one... can display an
attitude or make any suggestion or comment that will discourage,
confuse, weaken or overshadow the determination of the Turkish
Armed Forces to struggle against separatist or fundamentalist
activities that target the country's security."
</P>
<P>
It added that "the fight against terrorism and Islamic
fundamentalism is the duty of everyone in this country who wants
to live freely and independently."
</P>
<P>
Despite the warning of the military that came ahead of next
week's military dominated National Security Council meeting,
Yilmaz told the private ATV early Saturday that he won't resign.
</P>
<P>
He said that his government will wage every kind of struggle
against Islamic fundamentalism within the rules of law and
democracy.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that "no one can bring Turkey again
into a trap of separation, darkness of fundamentalism and
backwardness of coup."

way back from the military operations against the outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK) in Yayladere town of Bingol province.
</P>
<P>
Kamci said that four soldiers died under the avalanche and
seven others were injured.

<HEADLINE> World Water Day Observed in Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian vice-minister of
water resources Abdureshid Dulane Sunday called on pertinent
bodies involved in the water sector to "redirect their efforts
towards the noble goal of sustainable ground water development".
</P>
<P>
The call came from the vice-minister when he was addressing a
meeting here to mark this year's World Water Day which falls on
March 22 under the theme of "Ground Water -- the Invisible
Resource".
</P>
<P>
Abdureshid said "ground water is the largest source of fresh
water which must be studied, abstracted, utilized and protected
on sustainable basis."
</P>
<P>
He told the participants that preliminary estimates indicated
that Ethiopia has about 2.6 billion cubic meter of ground water
potential.
</P>
<P>
He said, the ministry of water resources, in collaboration
with other public agencies involved in the water sector, will
strive to formulate a workable framework and develop a
coordination forum for the rational and sustainable exploitation
of the nation's ground water potential.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the occasion, representative from the United
Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) to Ethiopia Per Engebak
underlined the planned exploitation and protection of precious
ground water reserves as a key to local development and poverty
alleviation.
</P>
<P>
He said, today approximately 2.9 billion people are without
adequate sanitation around the world, adding that "we have to
make sure that ground water reserves are not compromised by poor
sanitation and surface contamination".

<HEADLINE> Assad, Annan Hold Talks on Regional Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
met Sunday afternoon with visiting U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan on the latest development in the region and ways to revive
the stalled Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The meeting attended by Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq
al-Sharaa also dealt with the situation in Iraq and ways to
implement the U.N. resolution 425, which calls for Israeli
withdrawal from south Lebanon without conditions, according to a
Syrian official source.
</P>
<P>
Syria's stance demanding unconditional implementation of the
resolution 425 remains unchanged after Israel put forward a
proposal calling for Lebanese security arrangements in exchange
for its troop withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Annan paid a visit to the
U.N. peace-keeping forces operating on the Golan Heights, which
were captured by Israel during the 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief was reported to have said that the need for
peace and stability has obliged the U.N. to confront escalating
complicated international threats.
</P>
<P>
He also indicated that the prime mission of the U.N. is to
maintain world peace and security as stated in the
U.N. Charter. The way the mission is being implemented, he said,
will have profound repercussions on "our future and our
legitimacy as well as the credibility of the international
community."
</P>
<P>
Annan said that he would spare no effort to support the task of
the U.N. force, urging the concerned parties to establish
peace. He added that he had put the Middle East peace process on
top of his agenda, indicating his support to U.S. efforts to
establish peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief is currently on a Mideast tour which has taken
him to Jordan, Egypt, Lebanon, and will take him to Israel and
Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East peace process has been stalled since March 1997
when Israel began construction of a controversial Jewish
settlement in Arab East Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Sudan to Contain Rising Exchange Rate of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The Sudanese Ministry of Finance
and Economy has announced that it will take economic measures to
contain the rising exchange rate of U.S. dollar against Sudanese
pound, the country's currency.
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried Sunday by local media, Sudan's Minister
of Finance and Economic Planning Abdel-Wahab Osman said his
ministry will take measures to control the overall demand for the
dollar.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will increase the supply of U.S. dollar by
encouraging exports and by closing the gap between the official
prices of dollars offered by state banks and exchange centers and
the black market ones, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate of U.S. dollar against the Sudanese pound is
rising steadily in the black market, reaching 2,030 pounds for one
dollar, the highest ever in 20 months.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the growth in the exchange rate was due
to speculations of traders and usurers. He asserted that the
coming days will witness a drop in exchange prices.
</P>
<P>
He denied that the government has entered the market as buyer
of U.S. dollar, causing a rise in the exchange rate. The
government did not buy dollars over the past 20 months, he said,
</P>
<P>
On his part, the Sudanese Undersecretary of State for Finance
and Economy, Hassan Ahmed Taha has attributed the rise in the
exchange rate to the increasing demand for the dollar and to the
present decrease in revenues from exports.

<HEADLINE> Half A Cup of Tea Doubles Pregnant Possibility: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- American scientists have
discovered that drinking half a cup of tea a day can double a
woman's chances of getting pregnant, The Sunday Times reported.
</P>
<P>
It is the latest piece of research suggesting the health
benefits of tea, the British newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
A 12-month study of 200 women who were trying to get pregnant
found that those who drank coffee or soft drinks were no more or
less likely to be pregnant but tea drinkers had twice the chance.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the study each woman completed questionnaires about
their intake of coffee, tea and soft drinks as well as other
factors that may influence the ability to conceive, such as
smoking, exercise and alcohol consumption.
</P>
<P>
Researchers from the Kaiser Permanent Medical Program in
California said they cannot fully explain the findings, but they
believed that tea may contain vital ingredients that help the
fertilized egg through the crucial first weeks of life.
</P>
<P>
Studies showed that polyphenolic compounds found in tea have
the ability to inhibit chromosomal aberrations which could
increase fertility by decreasing the number of nonviable embryos.
</P>
<P>
Tea also contains a substance called hypoxanthine, which is an
important component of fluid in a woman's ovaries that helps eggs
mature during the menstrual cycle, researchers said.

<P>
LONDON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- An international group of
scientists are planning to drill through the thick ice sheet
covering a vast lake in Antarctica in search of new life forms,
The Sunday Times reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Scientists from Britain, Russia and America expect to penetrate
the 2.5 miles of ice that sealed Lake Vostok, the largest of South
Pole's 70 underground lakes, using a heated sterile probe which
can release a submersible robot.
</P>
<P>
The probe is a prototype which NASA, the American space agency,
intends to send to Europa, one of Jupiter's moons where life is
thought to exist beneath its dense, protective ice sheets.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary drilling to within a few hundred feet of Lake
Vostok, formed millions of years ago, has uncovered microbes new
to scientists.
</P>
<P>
Some of the microbes have been revived after lying in suspended
animation for hundreds of thousands of years.
</P>
<P>
The scientists expect to penetrate Lake Vostok within two
years, when they hope to start analyzing the world's most isolated
aquatic environment.

<HEADLINE> Butler Hopes to Finish Arms Inspection in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 22 (Xinhua) -- U.N. chief arms inspector
Richard Butler said here on Sunday that he hoped to finish arms
inspection "quickly, objectively and scientificly."
</P>
<P>
Butler, chairman of the U.N. Special Commission on disarmament
in Iraq, known as UNSCOM, told a press conference that he could
feel a sense of new spirit in UNSCOM's relationship with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"I feel a sense of new spirit now prevailing in our
relationship. The degree of cooperation that Iraq has been
showing with the commission in all fields of inspection and
technical evaluation meetings is very high and very welcome," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the new spirit would continue. "If it
does, we can do our part of this job quickly, objectively and
scientificly and get it done to its end without the passage of too
much further time," he said.
</P>
<P>
Butler said he was very happy to be back in Baghdad, noting
this was the first time for him to be here since
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan took back to New York the
agreement that was reached with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
On February 23, Annan and Iraq signed a memorandum of
understanding on arms inspection in Iraq, in which Iraq agrees to
open its presidential sites to a special group comprising senior
diplomats and experts from UNSCOM and the International Atomic
Energy Agency.
</P>
<P>
Butler said he would hold talks with Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz and his technical and policy teams Monday and
Tuesday. Three UNSCOM commissioners from Finland, Japan and Italy
would accompany him in those talks, he said.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, he would hold discussions with Commissioner of
the special group established to inspect Iraqi presidential sites,
which would take place by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq knows very well that it has obligation to present to us
all relevant materials, we have obligations to verify those
objectively and scientificly and as quickly as possible," said
Butler, adding Iraq seems to be showing the required degree of
cooperation in this context.
</P>
<P>
Butler stressed that he and UNSCOM had not been reduced in
their ability to do their work. "On the contrary, we are
strengthened and we are able to do our work now", which is "very
important to me and our people in UNSCOM," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Technical Evaluation Meetings held in early
February have completed two files, namely those on special missile
war heads and chemical VX, and that meetings on biological file is
under way in Vienna and they would finish at the end of this
forthcoming week.
</P>
<P>
"On the status of our files, missile is very close to my being
able to give such a report, chemical is getting better and closer
all the time, biology is never being good," he said, adding that
he would submit his half-year report to the Security Council on
April 9.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the inspection of the eight Iraqi presidential
sites, he said there are 1,058 buildings in those sites. He
refused to reveal how long it would take to finish inspection of
those sites, but said "it would not take a long time."
</P>
<P>
On the role of senior diplomats appointed by Annan in the
special arms inspection group, Butler they were here to observe
correct conducts of both UNSCOM and Iraq, and they would not
interfere in the work of UNSCOM in any way.
</P>
<P>
He said it was not enough for Iraq just to say they had
destroyed all weapons of mass destruction, rather, they should
help UNSCOM to verify that.

<HEADLINE> Israel Says Reported U.S. Proposal Unacceptable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Israel said on Sunday that the
main clause of a reported United States proposal concerning
Israeli troop pullback in the West Bank is unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued after a cabinet meeting said that only
Israel can determine the scope of withdrawal from the West Bank
and its security needs.
</P>
<P>
Israeli cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh stressed that former
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher guaranteed that it is
up to Israel to decide its security requirements and scope of
withdrawal in a letter he wrote to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu last March.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has reportedly outlined an initiative which calls for
Israel to withdraw from 13.1 percent of the West Bank in several
phases over 12 weeks, with each pullback met by Palestinian
security gestures.
</P>
<P>
Reports have said that Israel intends to pull back from 9
percent of the West Bank, and maintains that the scope proposed in
the U.S. plan will inflict damage on its security.
</P>
<P>
Naveh, however, said that the Israeli government has not gone
so far as to officially reject the proposed U.S. plan.
</P>
<P>
"What we have in the Cabinet meeting is the opinion that was
expressed by all the ministers and all the factions of the
government," he added.
</P>
<P>
At the cabinet meeting, Netanyahu told the ministers that he
has urged U.S. President Bill Clinton not to go public with the
plan during their recent telephone discussions.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has agreed that the U.S. will not publicize the plan
before its Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross visits the region
due later this week in a bid to bridge the gap between Israel and
the Palestinians, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the press release denied reports that Israel has
agreed to resume negotiations with Syria from where they were left
by the former Labor government in exchange for Syria's support for
an Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish state has said that it is ready to pull back from
south Lebanon under the United Nations Security Council Resolution
425 if the Lebanese government agrees to its security requirements.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has rejected the offer, maintaining that the U.N.
resolution passed in 1978 after Israel's invasion calls for an
unconditional Israeli withdrawal from its land.
</P>
<P>
Syria, which is stationing 30,000 troops in Lebanon as peace
keepers and has a big say in key issues of the country, shares the
view with Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Syria is also faced with a tough task to negotiate with Israel
over the strategic Golan Heights, which was captured by Israel in
1967.

<HEADLINE> Pope Declares Memorial Day for Nigerian Monk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The visiting Catholic pontiff,
Pope John Paul II, has declared January 20 of every year as
Reverend Father Tansi Day by Catholics around the world in memory
of the Nigerian Cistercian monk.
</P>
<P>
The pope made the proclamation at Oba, near Onitsha in
southern Nigeria's Anambra State, where he conducted a special
mass to beatify Reverend Father Cyprian Michael Iwene Tansi.
</P>
<P>
The Anambra-born Cistercian monk died in 1964 at Mount Saint
Bernard Abbey, Leicester, England after a life of piety, prayer
and other heroic virtues since he left Nigeria in 1950.
</P>
<P>
He is the first west African on the way to sainthood.
</P>
<P>
The 77-year-old pope, who arrived in Nigeria Saturday, has
also called for reconciliation in Nigeria and reportedly asked
for the release of some 60 political detainees in the country.
</P>
<P>
Sources said the Nigerian government has promised to consider
the pope's appeal but there is so far no indication as to what
decision would be.

<P>
This is the pope's second tour to Nigeria. He visited the

<HEADLINE> PLO Hails Annan's Visit to Gaza as Historic Event </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The visit to Gaza by the United
Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan is a historic event, which
will help revive the stalled Middle East peace process, a senior
PLO official said in Gaza on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Asad Abdel Rahman, member of the Executive Committee of the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), termed Annan's visit as
"a precursor for a real U.N. effort" in advancing the peace
process and "a minesweeping ship for a U.S. initiative" which
reportedly calls on Israel to withdraw from 13.1 percent of the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Annan is due to arrive in Gaza on Monday for a two-day
visit. He will hold talks with Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat on ways of revitalizing the Mideast
peace process, the Palestinian-Israeli track in particular.
</P>
<P>
He will also visit a refugee camp in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian prisoners in a Nafha prison sent a
letter to Annan in the day, asking him to visit the prison and see
how they are treated by Israelis, according to Jerusalem Media and
Communication Center.
</P>
<P>
PNA Cabinet Secretary General Ahmed Abdel Rahman said in Gaza
on Sunday that the PNA hopes the regional trip due later this week
of U.S. peace envoy for the Middle East Dennis Ross will result in
success in breaking the deadlock of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Arab people, particularly the Palestinians, are waiting for
the positive position of the United States to force the Israeli
government to implement the signed agreements, he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on the U.S to pressure Israel into pulling back troop
from the West Bank, fulfilling its obligations enshrined in the
peace agreements and freeing all palestinian prisoners.

<HEADLINE> Liberia Violates UN Arms Embargo, ECOMOG Alleges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The west African peacekeeping
force ECOMOG has accused the Liberian government of violating the
United Nations arms embargo imposed on it in the height of the
country's civil war.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG force Commander Maj.-Gen. Timothy Shelpidi at the
weekend raised the question of arms supply to Liberian security
forces, the British Broadcasting Corporation reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Nigerian General, all arms and ammunition of
the warring factions should have been disarmed before the
Liberian elections last July.
</P>
<P>
He questioned why the Liberian police are carrying ak47
rifles, arguing such weapons are element for war front
operations.
</P>
<P>
The new weapons must be smuggled into the country, added the
ECOMOG chief, whose forces have been responsible for the security
of Liberia and the training of the country's army after the
elections.
</P>
<P>
But the Liberian government's reaction to Shelpidi's
accusations has been equally bitter, the report said.
</P>
<P>
President Charles Taylor was reportedly saying that all
security men in Liberia have every reason to be well trained and
armed in order to confront any eventuality, particularly because
of the security situation along Liberia's borders.
</P>
<P>
"If we are attacked by armed robbers, we have to be prepared
to respond," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Instead of elaborating how his security forces are armed, he
called on the United Nations to lift the arms embargo on Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The fresh row between Shelpidi and Taylor's government
followed the general's reaction to the recent harassment and
detention of some Nigerians by the national police in the
Liberian capital of Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
A group of Nigerian journalists and officials on their way
back from Sierra Leone enroute Monrovia were arrested more than
one week ago by heavily armed Liberian police, who suspected some
of the Nigerians were carrying drug with them.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian general described the action as a humiliation to
the people and government of his country.
</P>
<P>
There has long been a rift between Nigeria and the Liberian
government led by Taylor, who has been accused of supporting the
military junta and rebels in Neighboring Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
It may be partly because of the hostile posture of the Taylor
government, the Nigerian-led ECOMOG is planning to move its
headquarters from Monrovia to Freetown, Sierra Leone.

<HEADLINE> Algeria to Cut Oil Output By 50,000 Barrels Per Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Algeria, one of the world's top
oil producers, announced Sunday that it will cut its oil output by
50,000 barrels a day as from April 1 to help lift oil prices in
world markets.
</P>
<P>
Making the announcement at a news conference, Minister of
Energy and Mines Youcef Yousfi said that Algeria has spared no
effort to ensure the success of the joint endeavour of the
petroleum exporting countries, expressing hope that prices would
reach acceptable standards.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Sunday, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, two leading members of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), and
Mexico also announced plans to cut their oil output between 1.6
million to 2 million barrels per day as from April 1.
</P>
<P>
The market prices have been at a 10-year low.
</P>
<P>
OPEC's Jakarta decision last year to raise output allocations
by 10 percent and continued quota busting by leading cartel
members, especially Venezuela, have been blamed for triggering the
catastrophic 40 percent slide from last year's average price of
20 U.S. dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
OPEC pumped 28.7 million barrels per day in February or 1.2
million above its official 27.5 million ceiling.

<HEADLINE> Annan: No Comprehensive Regional Peace Without </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, March 22 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said here Sunday evening that there can be no comprehensive
regional peace without Syria's participation.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief made the remark at a joint news conference with
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Sharaa after talks with Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad on the regional issues, particularly the
stalled Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Annan called for the implementation of the U.N. Security
Council resolutions 242 and 338 demanding Israeli withdrawal from
occupied Arab land, and the resolution 425 which calls for Israeli
unconditional withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He described his talks with Assad and Sharaa as "valuable,
cordial, essential and comprehensive," adding that by visiting the
region, he was seeking to listen and to learn.
</P>
<P>
Annan said he was carrying no initiative for reviving the
Middle East peace process, adding, however, that he would take
into consideration what he had listened from the leaders of the
region upon his return to New York.
</P>
<P>
Hafez al-Assad emphasized during the talks that peace in the
region can only be realized on the basis of justice and the
complete restoration of the occupied territories to their owners.
</P>
<P>
Annan arrived here Saturday evening as part of his current
Middle East tour, which has already taken him to Jordan, Egypt and
Lebanon, and will take him to Israel and the Palestinian self-rule
territories.
</P>
<P>
His visits are aimed at helping reactivate the Mideast peace
process which has been stalled since Israel began construction of
a controversial Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem in March
1997.

<HEADLINE> Chernomyrdin: Government's Resignation No Catastrophe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The dismissal of the Russian
government was not a catastrophe and there was no crisis, Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said after resigning his post on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, President Boris Yeltsin dismissed the
entire Russian government and named Energy Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko as Acting Prime Minister.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin described the dismissal of the cabinet a natural
process in the renewal of authority, saying that his team had
worked in the most dramatic years in Russian history.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that his government has made mistakes, but
took credit for laying the legal foundations of and building
market institutions in Russia.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said it was his decision to tender resignation to
concentrate on preparations for the 2000 presidential
elections. President Yeltsin had "strongly supported" his
decision, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Slightly over two years are to go before the presidential
elections. I can't remain indifferent to the future of the
country," Chernomyrdin said.
</P>
<P>
He announced that he will be busy organizing and holding
elections in Russia, including the parliamentary and presidential
elections.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he would run for the president in 2000, he replied
that he still had time to think and make a choice. "In two years
or even earlier you will learn about this."
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin stressed that former First Deputy Prime Minister
Anatoly Chubais had written an application for resignation on his
own, and he did not understand why Yeltsin decreed the dismissal
of Interior Minister, Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Kulikov.
</P>
<P>
He promised the authorities would not depart from the course of
reform, adding that the dismissal of the government must not
unnerve Russian businessmen and bankers.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait's New Cabinet Sworn in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait's new Cabinet was
sworn in before Emir Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah here Monday,
asserting to press ahead with the national process of
construction and development.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said that the new government would not change
the domestic and foreign policies pursued by the previous
government.
</P>
<P>
After the sworn-in ceremony, Kuwait's Emir discussed with the
newly-appointed members issues of interest to Kuwait and wished
them the best in their mission, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The government was appointed Sunday night by the Emir with a
new member from the ruling Sabah family Sheikh Ali Salem Al-Ali
Al-Sabah who took the post as the Minister of Finance and
Communications.
</P>
<P>
The appointment raised the number of the cabinet members from
the ruling family to six including the Prime Minister, ministers
of foreign affairs, defense, interior and oil.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, six ministers exchanged portfolios and a new
ministry named Ministry of State for National Assembly Affairs
dealing with the parliament was established.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the post was occupied by former Islamic Affairs
and Justice Minister Mohammed Daifallah Sharar portrays the
Cabinet intention to deal effectively with the Islamic
parliamentary members, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The former Board Chairman and Director General of official
Kuwait News Agency Yusef Mohammed Al-Sumait became the new
information minister.
</P>
<P>
The former Information Minister Sheikh Saud Al-Sabah returning
as Oil Minister represents a challenge to the Islamic faction in
the parliament which calls for his exclusion, observers noted.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's last Cabinet resigned a week ago to show solidarity
with Saud Al-Sabah after some Islamic members of the parliament
demanded a no-confidence vote against him over display of
controversial books at an Arab Book Fair.

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang Herdsmen Survive Heavy Snow Accumulations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Urumqi, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Herdsmen living in the Bayanblak
District in Hejing County, the Xinjiang Ugyur Autonomous Region,
have braved heavy snowstorms over the past three months.
</P>
<P>
One local official said the disastrous conditions have
resulted in the death of three people and 8,462 head of cattle.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that the losses are small when compared to
previous snowstorms which have hit the district.
</P>
<P>
He pointed to the fact that a 1987 snowstorm killed more than
300,000 head of cattle.
</P>
<P>
Bayanblak District, a pastoral area, is located in the Tianshan
Mountains at an elevation of between 2,400-3,600 meters above
sea level.
</P>
<P>
The district's four townships and 11 state-owned pastoral farms
have a total herd of over 600,000 head of cattle.
</P>
<P>
Heavy snow since the beginning of this year has stranded more
than 12,000 families.
</P>
<P>
The local government has assigned 15 bulldozers to clear
snow-bound highways to facilitate the transportation of food,
flour, fuel and fodder.
</P>
<P>
Assistance provided by nearby cities and oil fields have
enabled herdsmen in the district to open some 80,000 ha of
pastureland.

<HEADLINE> World Women Top Sprinters Set to Challenge in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- American world champion Marion
Jones and Olympic winner Gail Devers are expected to come to
China's Chengdu on May 12 for an unprecedented world female
fastest sprinters challenge in the 100 meters against host dasher
Li Xuemei.
</P>
<P>
According to the Chinese Athletics Management Center, the
organizer of the race, the challenge will attract four or five
world top sprinters to decide who is the fastest woman runner in
the world, a similar case as the 150-meter challenge between
Canada's world 100-meter champion Donovan Bailey and American
200-meter Olympic winner Michael Johnson last June.
</P>
<P>
Shang Xiutang, vice director of the CAMC, revealed that they
had contacted all the top 10 sprinters in the world, and five of
them promised to turn up in the showdown in China's southwest city
Chengdu.
</P>
<P>
Zhanna Pintussevich of Ukraine and Sevatheda Fynes of Bahamas,
the world silver and bronze medallists, plus Susanthika
Jayashinghe of Sri Lanka, the world 200m runner-up, have settled
the deal with CANMC to run the race.
</P>
<P>
"Both Jones and Devers are likely to show up but Merlene Ottey
of Jamaica has turned down our invitation. It is not the matter of
appearence fee, it is because that the top three are unwilling to
run head-to-head in a commecial race, " said Shang.
</P>
<P>
"Tomorrow will be the last date for Jones and Devers to sign
the contract. The appearence fees are varied and I don't want to
give the exact figures, but comparing with the 150 meters
challenge, the total of appearence fee and prize money is far
more less," the Chinese official added.
</P>
<P>
A reliable source revealed to Xinhua however, the appearence
fee Jones demanded is about 40,000 U.S. dollars. Pintussevich
asked for 25,000 dls, Jayasinghe required for 15,000, and Fynes
about 10,000.
</P>
<P>
"The prize money for the winner will be decided on how much
money we can collect for the race. But the minimum figure should
be no less then 20,000 dls. We will lift up the prize money if we
can collect more money. So far, I'd like to say we are not lack
sponsors. " Shang said.
</P>
<P>
The 150 meters race last year offered Bailey and Johnson half a
million dls each for appearence fee, and one million for the
winner.
</P>
<P>
Shang said the female race will put eight persons on the track,
five foreigners and three Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Li Xuemei, who ran a fabulous 10.79 seconds, the second fastest
in the world last season, at the Eighth Chinese National Games
last October in Shanghai, is the quickest Chinese national to
challenge the coming world big names.
</P>
<P>
Li, who failed to qualify for the semifinals at the Athen
Worlds, shocked everyone two months later with a pair of
sensational sub-11-second performances. Her previous personal best
was 11.02.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident to face the world bests. I fear nobody. No
matter who wins the race, my goal is to give out all my best,"
said Li through a telephone interview today.
</P>
<P>
The guest sprinters will fly to Chengdu when they complete an
IAAF Grand Prix meeting ending on May 10 in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Before the challenge race, a variety of performances will be
arranged for spectators, and the race will be staged at an outside
stadium with 30,000 seats.
</P>
<P>
Shang said CAMC contacted the foreign sprinters through an
American company and the appearence fees were suggested by some
American professional sports agents according to international
standard.
</P>
<P>
CAMC also said it is not a problem for the International
 Amateur Athletics Federation to sanction the race.

CAMBERRA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Former Wimbledon champion Pat
Cash announced his retirement from tennis on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 32-year-old said he was forced to abandon his latest
attempted comeback from injury for lack of invitations to play
tournaments.
</P>
<P>
In 1997 he entered 35 events, but was invited to play in just
seven, and this year he was overlooked for a wild card at the
Australian Open in favour of younger competitors.
</P>
<P>
Cash won the 1987 Wimbledon trophy and inspired Australia to
Davis Cup success in 1983 and 1986. He rose to a career-high world

<HEADLINE> Report: Tens of Thousands Forced off Welfare for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Tens of thousands of families
in the United State are being forced off welfare as punishment for
not complying with tough new rules, The Washington Post reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Federal figures show that in one three-month period last year,
38 percent of the recipients who left welfare did so because of
state penalties for a variety of infractions that ranged from
missing appointments with caseworkers to refusing to look for
work, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The Post collected the statistics from welfare offices across
the country, that are among the earliest figures available on how
states are implementing the 1996 federal welfare law.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that welfare rolls have fallen 18 percent
nationally in the past year, both because of a strong economy and
welfare reform efforts.
</P>
<P>
The paper reported that state officials cite the high rate of
sanctions as evidence that the law is working as intended,
ferreting out welfare recipients who held unreported jobs or
getting the point across to recipients that no longer can they
receive aid indefinitely without preparing themselves for work.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the report said that advocates for the poor
are concerned that many states are imposing severe measures that
end benefits with no assurance that children will be fed or
properly housed.
</P>
<P>
In New York, a survey found that most people removed from the
state's welfare rolls have failed to move to legitimate jobs.
</P>
<P>
Only about 29 percent of former welfare recipients found
full-time or part-time work between July 1996 and March 1997,
according to the state study, according to a report in the Monday
editions of The New York Times.

<P>
BAGHDAD, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz met with Prakash Shah, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's
Special Envoy to Iraq, and his Deputy Fitren Adwardo on Monday,
the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Aziz welcomed Shah and expressed Iraq's firm stance on
cooperation with the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Shah, who arrived here Sunday, expressed pleasure to undertake
his six-month mission, saying that the Iraq-U.N. accord signed on
February 23 has improved relations between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the U.N. and its committees were working
within the framework of full respect to Iraq's sovereignty and
security.
</P>
<P>
Shah was appointed by Annan as his special envoy to Iraq early
this month with the aim of improving relationship between Iraq
and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Shah's arrival in Baghdad would meet the need for improved
lines of communication between the government of Iraq and the
U.N. Chief's office in order to prevent fledged crises from
happening.
</P>
<P>
Under the Iraq-U.N. accord over arms inspection, Iraq agreed to
open its eight presidential sites to a special group headed by
Janayatha Dhanapala, a Sri Lankan appointed by Annan.
</P>
<P>
The group comprised of senior diplomats appointed by Annan and
experts from the U.N. Special Commission on disarmament in Iraq,
known as UNSCOM, and the International Atomic Energy Agency.
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, Aziz held the first round of talks with UNSCOM
Chairman Richard Butler, who arrived here on Sunday. But no
details of their talks were available.
</P>
<P>
Butler, who is on a four-day visit to Baghdad, said at
Sunday's press conference that he would hold talks with Aziz on
Monday and Tuesday to discuss the outcome of the technical
evaluation meetings held early February, and inspections of Iraqi
presidential sites.

MANILA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- A single-engine, two-seater Cessna
private plane crash-landed Monday afternoon at a private airport
inside the Clark economic zone in the northern Philippine province
of Pampanga, the Philippine News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The report said the economic zone authorities declined to give
details on the crash-landing.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses were quoted as saying the plane somersaulted while
landing. But it was not immediately known whether the pilot was
injured.
</P>
<P>
Newsmen were stopped from entering the airport to take picture
of the plane, the report said.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday night, a Philippine Airlines Airbus 300 overshot a
runway on landing and plowed into a residential area in central
Bacolod City, killing three people on the ground and leaving
dozens of others injured.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Television said Monday that investigators
initially blamed the accident on possible pilot error.

<HEADLINE> French Socialists Win in Key Southern Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 23 (Xinhua) -- French Socialist Michel Vauzelle
has won the regional council presidency of the key southern
region of Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur (PACA) in a public backlash
against the alliance of right-wing politicians and the far-right
National Front (FN).
</P>
<P>
Vauzelle, who beat FN president Jean-Marie Le Pen and two
right wing candidates, will succeed right-wing outgoing PACA
council president Jean-Claude Gaudin.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Jacques Chirac will make a speech Monday
evening in which he is expected to condemn the alliance set up by
right-wing politicians with the FN in five regional councils.
</P>
<P>
In three other regions where the council presidents are being
elected, the Socialist candidate is leading in the Alsacian region
of Franche-Comte, results of the first round of voting show.
</P>
<P>
The right-wing Rally for the Republic (RPR) and Union for
French Democracy (UDF) have also vowed to fight FN in the election
of Paris regional council president, also being held Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Socialist-led left is expected to win the council
presidency of Paris, as the left won a narrow majority in the
pollings last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The alliance between the UDF leaders in five regions,
including the major industrial region of Rhone-Alpes where former
Defense Minister Charles Millon was re-elected council president,
triggered indignation from people of all walks of life in France.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-two percent of RPR and UDF supporters condemned the
alliance, while 35 percent said they understood.
</P>
<P>
President Chirac has personally asked Millon to resign from his
post, and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin described the alliance as
``a Faustian accord''.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 2,000 high school students demonstrated near the
regional council of Paris Monday afternoon, as the election for
the council president went on within the council building.

NEW DELHI, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Six people, including two women
and four children, were burnt to death when the plastic godown
where they were working caught fire in northwest Delhi Monday,
Press Trust of India (PTI) said here Monday evening.
</P>

The charred remains were found in the gutted godown near the
K-block area of Jahangirpuri in the city by fire brigade
personnel. Some other workers managed to escape by scaling the
wall.
</P>
<P>
The fire was caused by an oil leak from an aluminum furnace of
a rotor factory which soon engulfed the adjoining three plastic
godown makeshifts.
</P>
<P>
The dead, who were essentially rag-pickers, were grading the
plastic waste when the fire broke out.

WASHINGTON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The following are some major
news items in leading U. S. newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton began a 12-day trip to Africa,
the longest foreign visit of his Presidency and the first in a
series of trips to four continents in four months. Clinton's
journeys will keep him out of the United States for more than four
weeks between now and early July.
</P>
<P>
-- The Energy Department is now moving to find out more about
how radioactive waste from the nuclear weapons plant in Hanford,
Washington, moves through the soil. But some people are troubled
by another problem: how the department avoided the question for so
long and whether that reflects on its competence. A report
scheduled for release Monday cites warnings to the department
going back to 1989 that it needed to pay closer attention to the
issue.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- A coalition of some of the world's most powerful oil
producers said Sunday they will cut back production to stop a
sharp slide in petroleum prices, which have fallen to the lowest
levels in nearly a decade.
</P>
<P>
-- Russian President Boris Yeltsin Monday dismissed leading
members of his government including Prime Minister Viktor
Chenomyrdin and his deputies in a sudden shakeup, Russian news
agencies reported.

The Wall Street Journal:
</P>

searches of Saddam Hussein's palaces may begin shortly. Also in

Annan, who negotiated the recent accord that defused a brewing
military confrontation, and a corps of diplomats who are to

<HEADLINE> Harvard President on Role of Higher Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Harvard University President Neil
Rudenstine won warm applause today for a speech presented to
800-odd Beijing University teachers and students widely recognized
for meticulous appraisals of speakers.
</P>
<P>
Rudenstine and the Harvard delegation, which is visiting China
at the invitation of the Ministry of Education and Beijing
University, is participating in centennial celebrations marking
the establishment of the university, China's oldest institute of
higher education.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will also discuss opportunities for cooperation
with both Beijing University and Qinghua University, another
prestigious Chinese university.
</P>
<P>
Education Minister Chen Zhili met today with Rudenstine and his
entourage.
</P>
<P>
Rudenstine, the first active Harvard president to visit China,
referred to the trip as a "voyage of discovery."
</P>
<P>
Beijing University President Chen Jia'er noted that the two
universities have a long history of exchanges and that they share
similar interests in various academic fields. "Beijing University
is often referred to as 'China's Harvard', and vice versa," said
Chen.
</P>
<P>
Rudenstine, Harvard's 26th president and a senior scholar in
English literature, focused today's topic on the roles and
challenges facing higher education in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
He provided a brief review of Harvard's history of 361-odd
years and its long-standing ties with China, as well as the
development of the institution's Sinological studies. However, the
main focus of Rudenstine's speech centered on the societal role of
higher education.
</P>
<P>
University research contributes greatly to economic well-being,
said Rudenstine, adding that "a good education not only enables us
to be more professionally productive, but also to be more
reflective, inquisitive and insightful, as well as complete and
fulfilled human beings. Education helps scientists appreciate the
arts, and artists to appreciate the sciences. It also enables us
to gain a better understanding of connections between different
fields of learning."
</P>
<P>
Rudenstine also emphasized the importance for universities to
conduct "basic research".
</P>
<P>
Challenges a university often confronts include the need to
combine the collaborative efforts of knowledgeable scholars
concerning problems with international dimensions, and the
necessity to ensure the openness and inclusiveness of university
community as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The Harvard delegation also visited Qinghua University, an
institution known for its natural science and engineering
programs. Qinghua President Wang Dazhong introduced the visitors
to the institution's education and research programs and
Rudenstine made a brief speech at a Sino-U.S. environmental
protection workshop.
</P>
<P>
The Harvard delegation, which arrived in Beijing on March 21,
has also visited a number of famous historic sites, including the
Forbidden City and the Temple of Heaven.

<HEADLINE> Pyongyang Blames US for Failure of Four-Party Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Washington is to be blamed for
the deadlock in the second-round negotiation of the Four-Party
Talks to formally end the Korean War, a spokesman of the
Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea Foreign Affairs Ministry said
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The talks made no headway at all because the U.S. avoided
discussing the basic and essential issues," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. refused to discuss the withdrawal of its
troops stationed on the Korean peninsula and the possibility of
signing a peace treaty between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The six-day negotiations, which were held in Geneva and ended on
March 21, even failed to reach an agreement on the date of the
next round of talks.
</P>
<P>
"Our principles are the withdrawal of U.S. troops from South
Korea and the signing of a peace treaty," he added. "Putting the
principles aside, it's not possible to discuss other issues."
</P>
<P>
The future of the Four-Party Talks, which involve the U.S.,
China, DPRK and South Korea, and aim to seek stability and peace
on the Korean peninsula, depends on the attitude of Washington,
the spokesman stressed.
</P>
<P>
He added that Pyongyang would continue to make sincere efforts
to ensure the Four-Party Talks a success.

<HEADLINE> NPC Chairman Outlines China's Priority Tasks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), said
today that China will concentrate on three major tasks --
development, reform and stability.
</P>
<P>
Li briefed a visiting Belarussian parliamentary delegation on
the accomplishments of the First Session of the Ninth NPC. He noted
that the 1998 growth rate for the Chinese economy will approach
eight percent and the inflation rate will remain below three
percent. He pointed out that the said levels will ensure favorable
national economic development.
</P>
<P>
The new NPC chairman said China has implemented reforms over
the past 20 years and called for intensification of related
efforts.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that China will continue to maintain social
stability, and "will continue to properly deal with relationship
among reform, development and stability."
</P>
<P>
Li said the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of
China stressed the role of law in running the country, and added
that the NPC will further improve related legislation.
</P>
<P>
He said the NPC will ensure smooth implementation of the
reforms by formulating relevant laws on the basis of the
successful experiences of reform.
</P>
<P>
Anatoly Alexandrovich Malofeyev, speaker of the Belarussian
House of Representatives (lower chamber), and Pavel Shipuk,
speaker of the House of Republics (upper chamber), said they have
personally witnessed the success of China's reform effort.
</P>
<P>
They noted that Belarus has different national conditions but
hopes to draw on China's practical experiences.
</P>
<P>
The two parliamentary leaders offered and Li accepted an
invitation to visit Belarus.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Arafat Calls on Israel to Implement Signed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
President Yasser Arafat Monday called for increasing international
pressure on Israel to implement the signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
following their meeting at the presidential office here, Arafat
said he explained to Annan all the troubles that the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process is facing.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said he had discussed with Annan all the outstanding
issues in the peace process, including Israel's redeployments in
the West Bank, Gaza Airport, safe passage and prisoner release.
</P>
<P>
Arafat blamed the prolonged deadlock in the peace process on
Israel's failure to implement the Oslo agreements. He appealed to
the international community to exert more pressure on Israel
to implement the signed agreements so as to save and advance the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
"I am sorry to say that the Israeli government is insisting
not to implement accurately or honestly what has been signed and
what has been agreed upon. So we are in need of international
push, international initiative to save the peace process, to save
the peace of brave," he said.
</P>
<P>
At one point, Arafat asked Annan to use the same diplomacy in
solving the crisis over U.N. weapons inspection in Iraq last
month to help break the deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian peace
process.
</P>
<P>
But Annan moved quickly to play down any high expectation for
his mission here, saying he did not come to mediate and there is
sharp difference between the Iraq crisis and the peace process
here.
</P>
<P>
Expressing sympathy with the frustration on the part of the
Palestinian side, Annan urged the Palestinians not to lost hope
and keep faith toward the peace process despite all difficulties.
</P>
<P>
"I know that the road is difficult, that the peace process has
run into some difficulties. But I would hope you will not despair
and that you will persist and stay on the road, because I think
peaceful solution is a long-time solution," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who is on his first Middle East tour as the U.N. chief,
arrived here from Syrian capital Damascus where he discussed the
deadlock in the Israeli-Syrian and Israeli-Lebanese peace
tracks. Before visiting Syria, he had already visited Jordan,
Egypt and Lebanon to conduct the first-hand inspection of the
current state of the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief insisted that he did not bring with him any
specific peace plan on breaking the deadlock in the various
tracks of the Israeli-Arab peace process. But he stressed the
need of all parties implementing all relevant U.N. Security
Council resolutions, saying that "they are all binding."
</P>
<P>
He called on Israel and the PNA to work with the United
States, which is the leading mediator in the peace process. He
said he had discussed the difficulties in the peace process with
the U.S. administration before his visit to the region, and
Washington is very concerned about the peace deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Following his Gaza visit, Annan will travel on Tuesday to
Israel, the last leg of his current mission, to hold discussions
with Israeli leaders on the Middle East peace process.

BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua)-- Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing
said here today that China is ready to work together with
Yugoslavia to bring a friendly and cooperative Sino-Yugoslav
relationship into the next century on the basis of mutual respect,
equality and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks during a meeting here this evening with his
Yugoslav counterpart Nikola Sainovic, who was making a stopover in
Beijing on way to Shanghai for a working visit at the invitation
of the Chinese government.
</P>

Li said that Sino-Yugoslav ties have witnessed sustained,

has served as a guide to the growth of bilateral relations in all
fields.
</P>
<P>
Economic and trade links between the two countries have also
expanded, Li noted, adding that Sainovic's current tour of Beijing
and Shanghai will further reinforce bilateral economic ties and
trade.

Milosevic to Chinese President Jiang Zemin during the meeting.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
will form a new cabinet before April 10 when he plans to meet
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, a presidential aide
said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sergei Yastrzhenbsky, the presidential press secretary, said
that the new cabinet will be formed on the basis of constitutional
principles, not opinions of the majority in the State Duma (the
lower house of the Russian parliament).
</P>
<P>
He added Yeltsin would consult with different political forces
to choose a new prime minister to replace Viktor Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
The sacking of the government did not mean political crisis,
the press secretary said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian constitution, which was adopted in 1993, gives the
president sweeping powers to name and sack governments.
</P>
<P>
According to the constitution, Yeltsin must appoint a new
candidate for prime minister within two weeks of the old
government being dismissed. Then, the State Duma must consider the
candidacy within a week.
</P>
<P>
If the Duma refuses three times to approve Yeltsin's
candidates, he can make the appointment himself, dissolve the
assembly and call a fresh parliamentary election.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Inspector Holds Talks With Iraqi Deputy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 23 (Xinhua) -- U.N. chief arms inspector Richard
Butler Monday held talks with Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz on Iraqi files of its ballistic, chemical and biological
weapons.
</P>
<P>
The talks did not deal with inspecting Iraqi presidential
palaces as widely expected, according to Iraqi well-informed
sources.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf, Oil Minister
Amir Mohammed Rashid and a number of other Iraqi officials
attended the talks.
</P>
<P>
Butler arrived here Sunday on his first visit after
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan signed an agreement with Aziz on
peacefully ending the U.N.-Iraq crisis over arms inspection here
last month.
</P>
<P>
The agreement opened the way for the inspection of Iraqi
presidential palaces and averted a possible U.S. military attack.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain had threatened to launch military attack
on Iraq if it did not give full access to U.N. arms inspectors to
all the suspected sites, including the presidential sites, which
Iraq refused to allow the inspectors to enter on grounds of
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Butler, chief of the U.N. Special Commission on dismantling
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction (UNSCOM), Monday praised Iraq's
cooperation with members of his commission and affirmed that he
felt a new spirit of cooperation from Iraq, especially after the
U.N. signed the agreement with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Aziz affirmed last week that Iraq would cooperate with Butler
to enable him accomplish his mission, although Iraq could not
trust him because he tells lies deliberately and he is a
U.S. stooge.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton who
began his six-nation African tour on Monday, said in Accra,
Ghana, that democracy is one of the most important element to
lead to a new beginning of Africa.
</P>
<P>
In an address at the Independence Square in central Accra,
Clinton said that the U.S. wants to work together with Africa
toward prosperity but an important thing is to "nurture
democracy, knowing it is not perfect or complete".
</P>
<P>
As for prosperity, the visiting U.S. president, the first
setting U.S. president to be in African in the past two decades,
said that his country wants to increase trade with Africa.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said all the party leaders in the U.S. congress are
supporting the Africa growth and opportunity act passed shortly
before his African tour, which is aimed at opening markets,
building businesses and creating jobs in Africa.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, he said, America and African countries can
help each other by supporting the education of the African
people.
</P>
<P>
According to Clinton, Africa's gold, diamond and minerals have
been exploited by other nations for centuries and it's time for
Africa to use the rich resources for their own prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Africa used to fall mainly into francophone and anglophone
spheres of influence from Europe, which still can be seen
obviously across the continent.
</P>
<P>
Addressing thousands of Ghanaians, the U.S. president also
called for the development of democracy and prosperity in Africa
in an environment free from violence.
</P>
<P>
"Killing must stop if a new future is to begin," he told the
audience.
</P>
<P>
Clinton appealed African countries to protect their natural
environment for peace, prosperity and democracy to prevail.
</P>
<P>
"Africa is mankind's first home. We all came out of Africa. We
must preserve the magnificent natural environment that is left,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
While African countries are to learn how to fight against
drought, famine and global warming, Clinton pledged that the U.S.
will share with them the technology in this respect.
</P>
<P>
Clinton reaffirmed the U.S. determination to build partnership
with Africa, saying that the U.S. and African countries should
cooperate in fighting against such problems as international
crimes and terrorism, drug-trafficking, the degradation of
environment and the spread of diseases like AIDS and malaria.
</P>
<P>
Before the speech, Clinton reportedly had a closed-door
meeting with Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings.
</P>
<P>
Ghana is the first leg of Clinton's African tour. He is
scheduled to leave later Monday for Uganda and then Botswana,
South Africa, Rwanda and Senegal.

<HEADLINE> East Africa to Harmonize Labor Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Skilled workers in Kenya, Uganda
and Tanzania will be able to work in any of the three states when
an on-going program to harmonize labor laws is completed later
this year.
</P>
<P>
The weekly East African Monday quoted Andrea Manafee Singh,
International Labor Organization (ILO) Director for East Africa,
as saying "The program is in advanced stages as all three
countries have already made changes to their national labor
policies."
</P>
<P>
The program will also put into force measures to enforce child
labor provisions.
</P>
<P>
But Singh said that the three countries of the East African
Cooperation (EAC) are at different levels in labor management.
</P>
<P>
The ILO is offering expertise assistance to Kenya, Uganda and
Tanzania to ensure that they have labor policies which will
protect skills and offer easy access to jobs, Singh added.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Kenya's East Africa and Regional Cooperation
Minister Nicholas Biwott said that between 70 to 80 million
people in the EAC member states will benefit from business
activities and job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
The minister said with the establishment of EAC two years ago,
there will be free movement of goods and services within the
common borders.
</P>
<P>
The EAC will embark on the rehabilitation of outdated
infrastructures like railways, telecommunication and the common
air control services linking the three states.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the community will attract both foreign and local
investment, therefore, creating jobs for the expanding labor
market, he noted.
</P>
<P>
A common passport had been introduced to facilitate free
movement of people in the region, said Biwott, hailing the role
the EAC will play to other neighboring countries in east and
central Africa.

<HEADLINE> Power Supply in Dhaka to Improve Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Power goes off in many areas of the
Bangladeshi capital city three to four times a day due to a
shortfall in power generation, but the situation will improve
soon.
</P>
<P>
The city is facing a shortage of 190 megawatts as against the
peak hour demand of 625 mw, causing great inconvenience to the
residents, the Dhaka Electric Supply Authorities said recently.
</P>
<P>
The situation will improve late this month when gas is used in
power generation in the eastern part of the country, thus helping
generate 80 mw to 100 mw electricity every day, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Experts attributed the power shortage to such factors as the
falling water level at the Kaptai Hydroelectric Dam, in southeast
Bangladesh's Rangamati district, low gas pressure, and the closing
down of a power plant.
</P>
<P>
The country generates around 1,850 mw each day while the
national demand for power stands at 2,150 mw, according to Energy
Minister Nooruddin Khan.

<HEADLINE> China Strives to Control Space Debris </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese scientist said
recently that China is making great efforts to improve the
design of launch vehicles to decrease the volume of debris
accumulating as a result of space missions.
</P>
<P>
"China has improved the design of the orbital stages of Long
March 4 (LM-4) launch platforms developed to place sun-synchronous
satellites in orbit," said Yuan Jie, a scientist with the Shanghai
Academy of Spaceflight Technology (SAST). Yuan made the remarks
during an international space conference held here last week.
</P>
<P>
Yuan said the addition of residual propellant venting systems
eliminates potentially hazardous explosions while upper stages of
the LM-4 are in orbit.
</P>
<P>
"We have also adjusted the trajectory design of the LM-3 series
and have effectively shortened the orbital duration of upper
stages," said Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Rapidly accumulating space debris has threated human space
activities. With the relative velocity in a collision between
orbiting debris and space vehicles ranging from 3-15.6 km per
second, the hypervelocity of massive kinetic energy released
during the collision can destroy space vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Fragmentation resulting from explosions of the upper stages of
rockets using liquid propellant accounts for approximately 25
percent of the total volume of trackable debris.
</P>
<P>
"Residual propellants most often remain in the fuel tanks of
the upper stages of launch rockets following completion of a
mission. The inadvertent mixture of residual propellants will
result in an explosion of considerable velocity," said Yuan. "This
is especially common when thin bulkheads are used for upper stages
since propellants can easily mix due to the thin structure of the
component."
</P>
<P>
Yuan said that American Delta, French Ariane and Chinese LM-4
launch vehicles have all been subject to explosions which have
fragmented orbiting stages of the launch platforms.
</P>
<P>
"China maintains a positive attitude towards dealing with
orbital debris, and will continue to contribute to related issues
in line with prevailing conditions," said Yuan.
</P>
<P>
He added that the SAST is actively studying the mode of the
orbital debris in the low earth orbit (LEO) environment and is
developing data base to better understand the present status of the
issue.
</P>
<P>
"This particular basic Chinese research project will be highly
significant in prompting studies of issues surrounding orbital
debris," said Yuan.
</P>
<P>
The China Space Law Association, established in December
1997, will concentrate on international space laws and studies of
issues regarding orbital debris.
</P>
<P>
"The observatory operated by the Chinese Academy of Sciences
can be used to supplement cooperative international observations,"
Yuan said. He added that the introduction of feasibility
studies concerning China's participation in cooperative
international observations are under discussion.
</P>
<P>
"China's ultimate goal is to cooperate with major nations
involved in advanced space technology in order to effectively
solve the issues regarding orbital debris," said Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of larges pieces of space debris and millions of tons
of related medium-sized debris remain in orbit as a result of
the 3,800-odd space missions conducted by some 23 nations and
several international organizations over the past four decades.
</P>
<P>
The debris forms the new artificial "Orbital Debris
Environment".

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Reshuffles Entire Russian Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
has appointed Energy Minister Sergei Kiriyenko as acting prime
minister, just hours after sacking Viktor Chernomyrdin and
dismissing his entire government.
</P>
<P>
He also named the 35-year-old reformer to replace outgoing
Anatoly Chubais who was relieved of his duties as first deputy
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
A presidential spokesman said Monday that Kiriyenko will
perform the duties of prime minister pending the appointment of a
new office holder.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, in a flurry of decrees, Yeltsin fired the
entire government after meeting with Chernomyrdin in the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
The reshuffle came after Yeltsin strongly criticized the
government in weekend meetings for its chronic failure to pay back
wages and pensions to millions of Russians.
</P>
<P>
In a TV address following the surprise move, Yeltsin said
sacked Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin must "concentrate on
political preparations" for the 2000 presidential elections which
were of enormous importance to Russia.
</P>
<P>
Praising Chernomyrdin for doing "a great deal for Russia," the
president awarded him a second class order "for services to the
fatherland".
</P>
<P>
But Chernomyrdin insisted that he did not see himself as a
candidate to succeed Yeltsin in the next presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot be considered a candidate," he said in a speech
shortly after being fired.
</P>
<P>
On why he had decided to sack the government, Yeltsin said
that the cabinet failed to cope with a number of "key social
problems," and lacked vitality, initiative and new ideas.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president gave reassurances that the reshuffle did
not mean that Russia would change its economic and foreign
policies.
</P>
<P>
But so far, Russian foreign ministry officials have declined to
say anything about the president's decision.
</P>
<P>
According to Alexander Livshits, Yeltsin's deputy chief of
staff, Russia's economic policy will remain unchanged despite the
change in government.
</P>
<P>
He said the economic policy would continue along the lines
already set out by Yeltsin and his cabinet.
</P>
<P>
"The bases of the country's economic policy were set out in the
president's annual statement to the Federal Assembly, and will
direct economic policy through 1998 and the following years,"
Livshits said.
</P>
<P>
Under Russia's constitution, Yeltsin must name a new prime
minister in two weeks. The nomination must get the approval of the
lower chamber of parliament, the State Duma.

<HEADLINE> Bahrain Agrees to Extend U.S. Warplane Deployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 23 (Xinhua) -- An authorized source from the
General Headquarters of Bahrain's Defense Force said Monday that
Manama has agreed to allow the deployment of U.S. military
aircraft on its soil for a further 60 days.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain's official Gulf news agency quoted the source, whose
name was not given, as saying that Defense Minister Sheikh Khalifa
bin Ahmed al-Khalifa has approved Washington's request for the
extension after receiving a letter from his U.S. counterpart
William Cohen on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The consent of the State of Bahrain to this request comes
within the context of the agreement on defense cooperation signed
by the two friendly countries, and their eagerness to ensure the
peace, security and stability of the (Gulf) region," the source
said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Bahrain signed the defense agreement after the
1991 Gulf War against Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain has previously consented, both last year and at the
beginning of this year, to a number of requests concerning the
deployment of American military aircraft on its territory.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the U.S. deployed in Bahrain 36 warplanes,
all belonging to the U.S. Air Expeditionary Forces, as
part of Washington's military buildup in the oil-rich Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. aircraft joined other U.S. forces in the Gulf region
to supervise the enforcement of the no-fly zone (Southern Watch)
operation in southern Iraq and trade sanctions imposed by the
United Nations against Baghdad since the 1991 Gulf war.

ABU DHABI, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Qatar's Emir Sheikh Hamad bin
Khalifa al Thani left here Monday afternoon after wrapping up a
three-day official visit to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to
improve their ice-cold relations.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, the Qatari ruler met his UAE counterpart
Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan and senior UAE officials to
discuss "ways of further boosting bilateral relations."
</P>
<P>
He also discussed with the UAE side the latest developments in
the Gulf region in the wake of an accord on arms inspections
signed between Iraq and the United Nations last month.
</P>
<P>
This was Hamad's first visit to the UAE since he took power in
Qatar in June 1995 after ousting his father Sheikh Khalifa bin
Hamad al Thani in a bloodless palace coup.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Qatar and the UAE have been strained when
Abu Dhabi was blamed by Doha for hosting Sheikh Khalifa who tried
to reseize power from his son's hand.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Khalifa currently stays in Europe. Government officials
in Qatar say the former emir is welcome to return home, but only

Kipng'eno arap Ng'eny said on Sunday, the World Water Day.
</P>
<P>
A total of 584 water projects, 508 in the rural and 76 in
urban areas, have not been completed since 1992 due to lack of

financing, management and development of water resources, Ng'eny
said.
</P>
<P>
The new national water policy will "explain the financing
arrangements for water sector activities in order to increase
water coverage in the rural areas from 42 percent to 69 percent
by the year 2010," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, "User-pay principle should be applied as necessary
in the ministry's water supplies and appropriate tariffs set in
such a way that the schemes will be self-sustaining at all
times," he added.

<HEADLINE> S. African Companies Play Role in Zambian Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 23 (Xinhua) -- South African companies are
playing a positive role in Zambian economy, a senior official of
the South African Institute of International Affairs (SAIIA) said
recently.
</P>
<P>
Investment pledges from South Africa have reached 889.2
million Rand (177.84 million US dollars), easily surpassing those
of Britain, which has 607.62 million Rand (121.52 million US
dollars), local daily Sowetan Monday quoted Ian Taylor of SAIIA as
reporting.
</P>
<P>
Taylor attributed the phenomenon to a combination of two
factors. The first is the lifting of trade restrictions on South
Africa following the demise of apartheid in 1994, and the second
factor is the rapid and successful privatization of Zambia's
state enterprises under President Frederick Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
"By the end of 1997, Lusaka hopes to have around 90 percent of
the economy in non-state hands," Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
Under the leadership of the Chiluba's government, Zamiba's
poor image among investors has been slowly reversed and
confidence in the country rebuilt, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Taylor, several well-known companies in South
Africa have invested in Zambia. South Africa's African Oxygen
has bought 70 percent of Zambia Oxygen, he said.
</P>
<P>
Shoprite Checkers, one of the largest retailers in South
Africa, has opened six supermarkets in Zambia's strategic
locations, he added.

The Goethe University of Germany, which jointly discovered the
canoe with the UNIMAID in 1987, will also send an archaeologist to the
site.
</P>
<P>
Experiments done in Germany through the method of Carbon 14 show
that the canoe must have been made about 6,000 years ago, the oldest
on the African continent and about the second oldest in the world,
Izuakor said.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the excavation will take about one
week's time and that the canoe will be formally presented to the
public on April 5.
</P>
<P>
Thereafter, he said, it will be exhibited permanently in Damaturu,
the Yobe State capital, where a building has been made available by
the state government for that purpose.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the importance of the excavation, Izuakor said it will
afford Nigerians first hand knowledge of the human settlement in the
area as far back as 6,000 years.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the canoe was found shows that there were flowing
rivers in the area before the present times when all the rivers are
now replaced by shrubs or mud, he added.
</P>
<P>
Izuakor also noted that the canoe has the potential of attracting
tourists, scholars and intellectuals from all over the world.

JOHANNESBURG, March 23 (Xinhua) -- At least five people were
killed and 31 others, including several children, were injured in
a head-on collision between two minibuses and a car in a
Johannesburg suburb Sunday night, The Star daily reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
It was feared that the death toll could rise because some of
the victims were critically injured.
</P>
<P>
Although the cause of the accident had not been established,
it appeared that high speed and the unroadworthiness of one of
the vehicles involved might have caused the collision, the paper

<HEADLINE> Israeli Fighters Strike Hezbollah Positions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Israeli jet fighters Monday
morning struck Hezbollah positions inside the security zone in
south Lebanon, in retaliation for guerrilla attacks on Israeli
outposts there, the army announced.
</P>
<P>
The fighters raids Hezbollah positions in Soujud and other
areas at the eastern sector of the security zone and then returned
to their base safely, the army said.
</P>
<P>
However, there were no details available as to how many
fighters took part in the raids and if there were any casualties,
but the army said all Hezbollah targets were hit during the air
strikes.
</P>
<P>
The air raids were carried out after some Israeli troop
outposts in the eastern sector of the security zone were hit by
mortars fired by Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
The security zone in south Lebanon was quiet last week as
diplomtic efforts were being made over Israel-proposed compliance
with U.N. Security Council Resolution 425 and withdrawal from
there.
</P>
<P>
Senior Israeli officials met for several times last week to
discuss a withdrawal from south Lebanon, under increasing pressure
from both inside and outside. A proposal raised by Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and supported by Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu calls for security arrangements before the
pullout can be realized.
</P>
<P>
The arrangements include the security of Israel's northern
border and safety of the South Lebanese Army soliders and their
families, who have allied with the Israelis in fighting resistance
Muslim guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, leaders from Lebanon and Syria met in Damascus to
discuss the Israeli proposal, while U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan visited Lebanon and Syria in order to help the parties
concerned to strike a deal.
</P>
<P>
It would take time for all concerned to work out a formula, but
the fightings between Israeli troops and Hezbollah and other
resistance groups in south Lebanon could only increase tension
inside the security zone.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up the 1,100-square-kilometer security zone in 1985
in south Lebanon, allegedly to protect its northern security.

<HEADLINE> Banking Industry Assets Rise in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Total assets of Kenya's banking
system increased by 9.5 percent at the end of December 1997, the
East African Standard reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Loans and advances which account for 50 percent of the total
assets jumped by 13.5 percent to 208 billion Shillings (some 3.47
billion US dollars), the newspaper quoted the latest data from the
Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) as reporting.
</P>
<P>
Other major assets, namely holdings of government securities
and balances with the Central Bank make up 11 percent and eight
percent of all assets respectively.
</P>
<P>
Assets held by non-bank financial institutions declined from
15 percent of total assets of the banking system at the end of
1996 to eight percent at the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
CBK said assets quality deteriorated last year with the
proportion of non-performing loans to total advances rising by
three percentage points to 21 percent.
</P>
<P>
While the proportion of loan loss provision to non-performing
advances hiked by two percentage points to 48 percent at the end
of last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the profitability of the banking sector remained high
with the aggregate profits for 1997 mounting by 8.4 percent to
18.8 billion Shillings (some 313.3 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
CBK said that deposits held by banking institutions went up by
5.8 percent to 272 billion Shillings (4.53 billion US dollars) in
1997 and constituted 66 percent of total liabilities.
</P>
<P>
Six commercial banks held 63 percent of all deposits in terms
of market share while capital and reserves of the banking system
increased by 18 percent to 57 billion Shillings (950 million US
dollars) in 1997.
</P>
<P>
CBK said the ratio of capital and reserves to total deposits
at the end of 1997 stood at 22 percent, unchanged from the end of
1996 but substantially above the required minimum of 7.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> UAE Decides to Cut Oil Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)
joined other major world oil producers Monday by announcing a cut
in its oil output to shore up sagging oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Oil and Mineral Resources Abid bin Saif al Nasiri,
who is also president of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) said the UAE will trim oil production by 125,000
barrels per day (bpd) as of April 1.
</P>
<P>
"The UAE took this decision based on the willingness to
balance oil market and prop up crude prices which are in a
collapse neither serving interests of (oil) producing countries
nor of consuming countries," he told the official Wam news agency.
</P>
<P>
Abid praised Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and non-OPEC Mexico for
launching the output cut campaign. He called others, inside and
outside OPEC, to "follow to cooperate."
</P>
<P>
OPEC's two leading members Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, and
non-OPEC Mexico decided at the end of a two-day secret meeting
Sunday Saudi capital Riyadh to join forces to try to cut world oil
output by up to 2 million bpd from April 1 until the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
Oil ministers of the three countries said in a joint statement
that oil producers have so far agreed to cut surplus output by 1.1
million bpd and that more talks would be held in "the coming days"
with OPEC and non-OPEC producers to increase the cut.
</P>
<P>
If the agreement does materialize, it will be the first time
that world oil producers have managed to agree to lower output
with the aim of increasing oil prices.
</P>
<P>
World oil benchmark Brent crude has fallen from 19 dollars a
barrel to 13 dollars while the basket of OPEC crudes has crashed
down to 11 dollars since a flood of oversupplies swamped oil
markets due to OPEC's November decision to raise its combined
output ceiling by 10 percent to 27.5 million bpd this year.
</P>
<P>
The collapse was compounded by Iraq's return to oil markets
and a decline in crude demand due to a mild winter in the northern
hemisphere and Asia's economic turmoil.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: India's United Front Partner Pulls Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The Telugu Desam Party (TDP),
one of the constituents of the 14-party United Front (UF), Monday
broke away from the UF and nominated G. M. C. Balayogi, who got
support from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its allies, as
candidate for the 12th Lower House of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
TDP supremo N. Chandrababu Naidu on Monday also resigned from
the UF's convenership and pulled out the TDP from the front,
saying that his party would otherwise continue to maintain
equi-distance from the Congress and the BJP.
</P>
<P>
He charged that his party had not been consulted before the
front took a decision Sunday to back the Congress nominee for the
speakership.
</P>
<P>
Balayogi, a new MP from Andhra Pradesh, became the choice of
the ruling coalition for the speaker's post after the TDP leader
resigned as front convener and broke away from the UF.
</P>
<P>
Announcing Balayogi's candidature, Parliamentary Affairs
Minister Madan Lal Khurana said Prime Minister Atal Behari
Vajpayee spoke to Naidu over telephone Monday morning and got his
consent for his party nominee contesting the speaker's election.
</P>
<P>
"The chapter is over. We cannot support Congress under any
circumstances," TDP President and Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister
Naidu said.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether his decision would mean that he was
gravitating towards the BJP, Naidu asserted that he would continue
to be neutral towards the BJP.
</P>
<P>
The BJP has been trying to win over the anti-Congress TDP which
has 12 MPs in the House. Since the general elections, the TDP has
time and again said that it would oppose any Congress-led
government at the Center and it would remain neutral and
equal-distant from the Congress and the BJP.
</P>
<P>
In order to secure a victory in the confidence vote slated for
Friday, the BJP has also made great efforts to bring in more
constituents of the UF.
</P>
<P>
P. A. Sangma, who was tipped to be a consensus candidate till
the last moment, filed his nomination on behalf of the Congress
and the United Front minus the TDP and accused the ruling combine
of going back on its earlier commitment that he was the consensus
choice.
</P>
<P>
BJP President and Home Minister L. K. Advani said Monday that
the fielding of the TDP candidate for the House Speaker was a
major development and that he was sure that it would influence the
future course of events.
</P>
<P>
Harkishan Singh, senior leader of the Communist Party of India
(Marxist) (CPI-M), one of the UF constituents, said Monday that
TDP President Naidu's decision would have a disastrous effect on
the political scene in Andhra Pradesh and around the country. The
UF was formed to ward off the danger of the BJP, but now he took a
stand to go with the BJP.

<HEADLINE> Britain Supports Zambia's Anti-Smuggling Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Britain has given Zambia a grant
of 20 billion Zambian Kwacha (some 15 million US dollars) to
assist its anti-smuggling drive, Times of Zambia reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The latest Tax Amnesty Information Bulletin, published by the
Zambia Revenue Authority (ZRA), reveals that the grant will also
be used to improve the computer network between Zambia and her
neighbouring countries.
</P>
<P>
ZRA has also signed a memorandum of understanding with
neighbouring countries for a regular exchange of information to
combat the scourge and tax evasion in the region, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
Direct tax and value added tax (VAT) teams are being doubled
in size while an anti-smuggling squad is undergoing training in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, smuggling has increased at the borders,
putting many manufacturing companies in Zambia in a difficult
situation as their products cannot compete favorably with
smuggled goods which are priced much lower than the local ones.
</P>
<P>
The Bulletin said that electronic data by internet has been
put up to ensure all the smugglers are trapped.

<HEADLINE> Mahathir Calls for Investors' Open Mind to New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad Monday urged investors to keep an open mind and
understand the value of new and emerging technologies.
</P>
<P>
Although investors have to exercise prudence before they put in
a single ringgit (local currency unit) into their ventures, they
have to realize the tremendous rewards that could be brought about
by technologies such as intellectual property, he said at the
opening of a Smart Complex at Technology Park Malaysia here.
</P>
<P>
"If investors do not take the effort to understand the
technology, it is unlikely that they will invest. And if they do
not invest, not only will they eventually lose out, but the
country will have also missed an opportunity to increase its
wealth, raise gainful employment, educate the people and pursue
profitable follow-up technologies and corresponding products," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said potential investors should also realize that Malaysians
were capable of innovating, inventing, designing, manufacturing
and delivering on their promises.
</P>
<P>
The skills and ideas possessed by locals should not be
disregarded because of an inherent inferiority complex which
rejected everything local, the prime minister said.

-- Fifty-two percent of the French people voting for the
rightwing opposition RPR-UDF in the regional elections condemned the
alliance between the rightwing and the National Front
(FN), while 35 percent of them said they understand the reason
why the local leaders of RPR-UDF sought support from FN. Meanwhile,
FN president Jean-Marie Le Pen has asked the PRP-UDF to vote for him

-- The rightwing opposition is under the pressure of the National
Front before the election of the presidents of the regional

<HEADLINE> Iran Announces Cut in Oil Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced Monday to cut oil
output by 140,000 barrels per day (bpd) as of April 1 to join
other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) to save oil prices from further slump.
</P>
<P>
The official news agency IRNA quoted an official with the
National Iranian Oil Company as saying that the country has
decided to lower its oil output from 3.942 million bpd to 3.802
million bpd in order to create a steady oil market and attain a
viable price in the future.
</P>
<P>
Price for Iranian crude slumped to under 11 dollars per
barrel, some seven dollars less than that at the beginning of
1997, inflicting a heavy blow to the Iranian ailing economy, which
dreadly relies on oil incomes.
</P>
<P>
Ranking second inside the OPEC in terms of oil exports, Iran
used to produce 3.6 million bpd during the past years. Its quota,
however, was raised to 3.94 million bpd as of January 1 at the
130th ministerial meeting in Jakarta, Indonesia last November.
</P>
<P>
Oil experts have complained that Iran could not raise its
output to the level due to poor and out-dated facilities, and it
would suffer more losses when other OPEC members promote their
production.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Venezuela took the lead in
announcing crude output cuts, reportedly followed by Kuwait, the
United Arab Emirate and Algeria.
</P>
<P>
It was believed that the OPEC member's move would boost oil
prices on world markets, if their cooperation in the direction can
be maintained.

<HEADLINE> Coastal Erosion Renders 600 Homeless in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 23 (Xinhua) -- At least 600 people have been
rendered homeless and 30 houses washed away in the past three
months by coastal erosion in south Nigeria, Daily News Monday
quoted local Government Council Chairman Tony Uti as reporting.
</P>
<P>
Tony Uti said that the destruction caused by the coastal
erosion, which is now threatening communities on the coastline of
the river Niger in south Nigeria's Delta state, has also
destroyed food crops.
</P>
<P>
Unless urgent steps were taken to arrest the situation, the
communities might go into extinction, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The chairman said that interim measures taken by the local
government council, namely construction of local dams, have
proved ineffective. He called on the federal government for
assistance.
</P>
<P>
Both the state and federal environmental protection agencies
have been informed of the disaster, said Uti.
</P>
<P>
But he regretted that AGIP Oil Company which has been
operating in the area for more than 35 years has not deemed it
fit to assist.

<HEADLINE> Match Output Down in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Matches are retreating from the
daily life of people in big Chinese cities due to the wider usage
of lighters and gas and electric cookers.
</P>
<P>
According to China Economic Herald Tribune, China turned out
14.42 million boxes of matches during the January-October period
of 1997, down 11.2 percent from the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
Though matches are still popular in rural areas and small and
medium-sized cities, experts anticipated the annual output will
continue to slip.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper suggested the match manufacturers to keep their
market shares through improving box design and packaging since the
number of match box collectors are on the rise.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Central Bank Raises Certificate Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- To stabilize the rupiah currency
against the U.S. dollar and curb inflation, Bank Indonesia (BI),
the central bank, Monday raised BI Certificate (SBI) interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference here, BI Governor Syahril Sabirin
announced that all the short-term SBI interest rates, except the
overnight certificates which remained at 40 percent, will be
raised immediately.
</P>
<P>
For two-day SBI, BI raised the interest rate from 35 percent to
41 percent, while the three-to-six-day interest rate raised from
30 percent to 42 percent.
</P>
<P>
The interest rate of the one week SBI was raised from 25
percent to 43 percent, while the two weeks raised from 24 percent
to 44 percent.
</P>
<P>
The highest rise was the one month interest rate which
increased to 45 percent from 22 percent, while the two-month and
three-month interest rtes increased respectively from 20 percent
to 40 percent and from 19 percent to 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
The interest rates of six months and one year SBI were also
raised slightly from 18 to 20 percent and from 16 to 18 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
SBI is short-term rupiah-denominated obligations issued by the
central bank to drain excess liquidity from the market.
</P>
<P>
The central bank firstly raised its SBI rates on August 19,
1997 after monetary crisis hit the country and the value of the
rupiah dropped sharply against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
But, since September last year the BI have several times
lowered the SBI to relax the tight monetary policy in stages.
</P>
<P>
However, the rupiah has continued its fluctuation and the price
of basic commodities in the country has increased by 50 percent to
400 in the last three months.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah has lost more than 70 percent of its value against
the greenbacks in the past eight months.

<HEADLINE> Democratic Congo's Ambassador Seeks Asylum in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Ambassador of the Democratic
Republic of Congo to Zambia has opted to seek political asylum in
Zambia after he was recalled to his country last June,
state-controlled Times of Zambia reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Bongo Lega has been recalled to Kinshasa but
refused to go back allegedly for fear of being persecuted amid
accusations of being a relative of the former Zaire's late ruler
Mobutu Sese Seko.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Ngoyi Ngongo, new acting charge d'affairs of
the Congolese Embassy in Lusaka, as saying in an interview on
Sunday that the recalling affected all Congolese heads of
diplomatic and consular missions in many other countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that the recalling of ambassadors and consul-generals
started in June and ended in December last year.
</P>
<P>
Lega was asked on three occasions to travel to Kinshasa, a
call which he had not heeded up to now, he added.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted other sources from the Congolese Embassy here
as saying that Lega is still in Zambia illegally and is seeking
asylum from the Zambian government.
</P>
<P>
But when asked by the paper for a comment on Sunday, Lega at
first expressed ignorance over his removal but later explained
that he could not return to his country without money, saying the
embassy officials have gone for months on end without salaries.
</P>
<P>
But Lega denied any relationship between him and the late
ruler.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Cancels tax on Currency Purchase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- the Indonesian government on
Monday issued a decree revoking the five percent tax on every
purchase of foreign currencies scheduled to take effect March 23
(Monday).
</P>
<P>
The decision was declared by Finance Minister Fuad Bawazier,
official Antara News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Bawazier said that one of the reasons for revoking the tax is
that Indonesia's development and economy is not ready for the
implementation of such a tax.
</P>
<P>
The decree slamming a five percent tax for every purchase of
foreign currencies -- whether made by private individuals,
agencies, business groups, banks or official money changers -- was
issued on March 19 under a finance minister decree in a bid to
reduce speculation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the speculation on foreign exchange had resulted
in the weakening of the rupiah (national currency).
</P>
<P>
The rupiah has lost more than 70 percent of its value against
the U.S. dollar since July last year when the monetary crisis hit
the country and other Southeast Asian nations.

<P>
MOSCOW, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
said Monday that the resigned Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin
must "concentrate on political preparations" for the 2000
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
In a TV address following his surprising dismissal of the entire
government, Yeltsin stressed that the 2000 elections are of
enormous importance to Russia, so he had instructed Chernomyrdin
to concentrate on political preparations for these elections.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said Chernomyrdin "has done a great deal for Russia."
He awarded Chernomyrdin a second class order "for services to the
fatherland."
</P>
<P>
Just hours after firing the government, Yeltsin named Fuel and
Power Minister Sergei Kiriyenko acting prime minister and first
deputy prime minister to replace outgoing Anatoly Chubais.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said the government reshuffle does not mean that Russia
will change its economic policy.
</P>
<P>
On why he had decided to sack the government, Yeltsin said the
cabinet failed to cope with a number of "key social problems." He
said the government lacked vitality, initiative and new ideas.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem
left here Monday at the end of a three-day official visit to Egypt
aimed at repair strained relations between the two Mediterranean
countries.
</P>
<P>
In an apparent attempt to placate Arab apprehensions over the
growing Turkish-Israeli military links, Cem told Egypt's Nile
TV Sunday night that the fears were "unwarranted and
exaggerated."
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes the subject is a bit over-exaggerated," Cem said in
an interview with the English-language TV station.
</P>
<P>
"I respect their (Arab) sensitivity," he said, maintaining that
the military cooperation agreements signed between Israel and
Turkey are parallel to similar deals signed by Ankara with other
27 countries, including 19 Muslim countries.
</P>
<P>
"It (Turkish-Israeli cooperation) is not directed against
anyone," said the minister, rejecting Arab criticism that Turkey
and Israel are seeking a revival of policy of alliance in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Israel have signed two military cooperation
agreements, triggering off outcry from Arab and Islamic countries,
which feared that Turkey was allying itself with Israel against
Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Cem said that the current government in Ankara has brought the
relations with the Arab countries and the Muslim world to the
highest level compared to two decades ago. Turkey "is doing much
better now with Iran, Iraq and Syria," he added.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Cem had talks with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak, Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri and Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa on bilateral ties and regional issues. He also
conveyed a verbal message from Turkish President Suleyman Demirel
to Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
This was the first official visit to Egypt by a Turkish foreign
minister since December 1993 and the highest-level one since
Demirel visited Egypt last September.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks Finish at Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- A strong performance by Telstra
installment receipts led the Australian share market to a new
record close Monday, despite other industrials weakening on fears
of the inflationary effect of a new oil agreement.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index closed 4.1 points higher at 2779.3,
0.1 point more than the previous highest close reached on
September 25 and October 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
This came despite news that major oil-producing countries are
working on an agreement to lower the supply of oil to strengthen
that commodity's low current price.
</P>
<P>
Steve Negrine, a stock market expert, said the news prevented
the local market from matching strong U.S. stock rises, as it
triggered fears of inflation.
</P>
<P>
The news prompted a fall on the Sydney Futures Exchange's Share
Price Index, which closed three points down to 2794.0.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index fell 0.9 points to 4792.4, the main
bright spot being telecommunications giant Telstra Corp, whose
interim receipts Monday hit the 4.00 Australian dollar mark for
the first time, before closing seven cents up at 3.98 Australian
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Among the banks, Westpac rose 15 cents to 10.75 Australian
dollars, ANZ added two cents to 10.17 Australian dollars, National
Australia fell 10.7 cents to 21.50 Australian dollars and
Commonwealth dropped nine cents to 18.20 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The all resources index rose 9.2 points to 1169.4.
</P>
<P>
Aside from the oil stock rises, resources giant BHP added 17
cents to 15.75 Australian dollars and global miner Rio Tinto
matched London losses to close 20 cents lower at 19.70 Australian
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The gold index fell 2.3 points to 1095.7 as the bullion price
closed at 292.40 U.S. dollars, almost a dollar up on Friday's
close of 291.45 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
National turnover was 297.41 million shares at a volume of
640.42 million U.S. dollars, with falls of 601 outnumbering rises
of 521.

</P>
<P>
In a presidential decree, Yeltsin also named the 35-year-old
reformer first deputy prime minister to replace outgoing Anatoly
Chubais who was relieved of his duties as first deputy prime

</P>
<P>
Russian Presidential Spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said
Kiriyenko was named first deputy prime minister but will perform
the duties of prime minister pending the appointment of the a new

Kiriyenko, an ally of First Deputy Prime Minister Boris
Nemtsov, was appointed minister of fuel and power in November 1997
when Nemtsov left the post to concentrate on his job as first
deputy prime minister.
</P>
<P>
In a flurry of presidential decrees, Yeltsin fired the entire
government after meeting with Chernomyrdin in the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said he will temporarily assume the duties of prime
minister, but asked government ministers to remain on their job
until a new cabinet is formed.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Slightly Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar meandered
through quiet trading Monday, taking its cue from the Japanese yen
to close slightly higher.
</P>
<P>
The currency finished the local session in Sydney at 66.36 U.S.
cents, up from 66.20 locally late Friday.
</P>
<P>
Scott Hill, foreign exchange manager with Macquarie Bank, said
the yen was "still very much a dominant factor" in Australian
dollar foreign exchange trading.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar had begun the session on a stronger note,
opening at 66.47 U.S. cents but soon slipped back when the U.S.
dollar lifted against the yen.
</P>
<P>
Su-Lin Ong, an economist, said the risk to the Australian
currency remains skewed to further downside in the near term, amid
New Zealand dollar weakness, and continued domestic rate cut
speculation.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar finished the local session at 86.67 yen
from 86.12 yen previously, and at 1.2144 marks from 1.2122 marks.

<HEADLINE> Computers Becoming Important Part of Chinese Family Life (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, March 23 (Xinhua) -- When 40-year-old Yuan Yi returns
home each day in Fuzhou, the capital of east China's Fujian Province,
the first thing he does is turn on the computer to check on e-mail
from his friends.
</P>
<P>
Yuan became attracted to computers in 1996, and since then they
have been the most important part of his life. He spends two or
three hours every night at his computer, studying English, getting
the news, sending e-mail, or attending to business.
</P>
<P>
Seldom does he use a pen or pay attention to TV at night, and
says he could lose just about anything -- but his computer. Every
month he spends two or three hundred yuan on the Internet and
considers that quite cheap because he can greet friends overseas
repeatedly for the cost of a domestic telephone call.
</P>
<P>
Yuan is not the only person in Fuzhou surfing the Net. Hundreds
of families here have personal computers and many use a variety of
networks like Internet and Chinanet, for study, watching VCDs, or
playing games, and this has greatly enriched their lives.
</P>
<P>
To meet the needs of the growing number of computer-lovers,
manufacturers are making a great effort to provide more
convenient software. Fujian Educational Publishing House recently
came out with an electronic edition of Foreign and Domestic
Literary works, with the help of a computer company and has plans
for greater involvement with a computer firm to publish more of
these books.

Children are also attracted to computers and middle school
students are learning to use them more. Even if they do have a
negative impact when children spend too much time on games,
harming their health and their studies, experts point out that the
computer is the instrument of the new information age.
</P>
<P>
The computer follows in the footsteps of the earlier "three big
items", the Chinese reference to TVs, refrigerators, and cassette
recorders when incomes grew in the 1980s, and buying computers is
in vogue in urban areas, especially in the larger cities.
</P>
<P>
China has become the largest personal computer market in the
Asia Pacific region, and in the past two years, sales of personal
computers in China have shot up 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Computers are mainly the tool of the families of intellectuals
or specialists, but one official from the Electronics Ministry
predicts that, with the improvements in the standard of living and
the further use of computers, more people will welcome this new
family member.
</P>
<P>
When one looks at the 20 million TV sets sold every year in
China, the official says, it indicates great potential for
computers.
</P>
<P>
In urban parts of China, there are 3 computers for every 100
families, and in large cities like Beijing and Shanghai, the
figure is 5, and the Chinese government is working out policies
to support the development of the computer industry.

CAIRO, March 23 (Xinhua) -- A police lieutenant colonel and
three conscripts were killed Sunday night when their car were
attacked by four unidentified gunmen in southern Egypt, the Middle
East News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The ambush of police patrol took place in the city of Beni
Mazar, Minya, 180 kilometers south of Cairo, a hot bed of Muslim
militant violence over the past years.
</P>

As the gunmen, driving a van, tried to escape to nearby
plantations, they opened fire into the street, wounding 10
passers-by and two policemen.
</P>
<P>
One of the attackers was also wounded, an official security
source as quoted as saying, but they vanished into plantations.
The police were then launching a crackdown to "round up the
culprits."
</P>
<P>
This was the first major terrorist attack since six Muslim
militants massacred 58 foreign tourists and four Egyptians in the
historical resort of Luxor on November 17, 1997.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Decides to Cut Oil Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait has decided to cut oil
production by 125,000 barrels per day starting from April in a
joint effort to rescue oil prices, Kuwait News Agency said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti move came after Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Mexico
announced to work with oil producers to slash crude output by
between 1.6 million and 2 million barrels per day (bpd) to prevent
a price collapse.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's Former Oil Minister Issa Al-Mazzidi was quoted as
saying Sunday that Kuwait is keen to stop the slide in world oil
prices and decided on the cut following contacts with fellow OPEC
(Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) members and other
oil producers.
</P>
<P>
The minister and other members of the former government, who
resigned on March 16, had been asked to carry on their duty until
a new Cabinet was appointed Sunday night by Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh
Jaber AL-Ahmed AL-Sabah.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's OPEC quota was raised to 2.19 million (bpd) from the
start of this year.
</P>
<P>
The cut has been agreed in line with the accord Saudi Arabia,
Mexico and Venezuela clinched on Sunday on a joint effort by OPEC
and non-OPEC oil producers to stablize oil prices, Al-Mazzidi said.
</P>
<P>
This followed an oil glut in recent months that has depressed
oil prices on world markets to nine-year lows, as a result of the
Saudi Arabia-led initiative last November to raise OPEC production
ceiling by around 10 percent to 27.5 million bpd.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia decided on Sunday to reduce oil output by 300,000
bpd from the current 8.76 million bpd starting from April 1.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another important Gulf oil producer, the United Arab
Emirates, announced Monday to cut its crude oil output by 125,000
bpd.
</P>
<P>
Persistent quota violations by certain OPEC members, the
financial crisis in southeast Asian countries and a mild northern
hemisphere winter have dragged oil prices down below 12
U.S. dollars a barrel from more than 18 dollars in last November.
</P>
<P>
The very low prices have caused a significant reduction in the
revenues of all producers and may cause the Gulf oil producers a
downturn in economic growth from an expected 5 percent to around 2
percent this year.

<HEADLINE> Gene Linked to Cancer Spread Cloned in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Israeli researchers have
discovered and cloned a human gene responsible for the production
of an enzyme that plays a major role in the spread of tumor
cells, local daily The Jerusalem Post reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report said the research unit, headed by Professer Israel
Vlodavsky from Jerusalem Hadassah Hospital, produced a genetically
engineered version of this crucial enzyme.
</P>
<P>
The achievement is expected soon to play a major role in
predicting which secondary tumors would be the most aggressive
and would therefore require more powerful treatment.
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough could also lead to the development of enzyme
inhibitors that could prevent tumor cells from proliferating, and
drugs for other diseases.
</P>
<P>
More than half of newly diagnosed cancer patients have
secondary tumors, or metastases, which are often undetectable and
can cause death. Virtually all deaths from cancers of the colon,
breast, and many other organs are caused not by the primary tumor
but by its offshoots elsewhere in the body.
</P>
<P>
Malignant cells usually invade blood vessels and pass into the
extracellular matrix. Vlodavsky's work, which began 15 years ago,
proved that the ability of tumor cells to invade their
surroundings depends on the activity of a cellular enzyme called
heparanase, which breaks down a main component of the vascular
wall called heparan sulfate.
</P>
<P>
Compounds that inhibit heparanase were found to inhibit the
spread of metastasis in lab animals. The gene was found to be
inactive in healthy people. In cancer patient, it "wakes up". And
the enzyme is especially prominent in people with aggressive
cancers.
</P>
<P>
Vlodavsky said that their work has paved the way for the
development of molecular probes and antibodies for the early
detection of tiny metastases of tumor cells in plasma, urine, and
other tissue and fluids.
</P>
<P>
Working with the genetically engineered enzyme, he believed
they can develop heparanase inhibitors to halt the ability of
secondary tumor cells and activated lymphocytes to break out of
blood vessels and reach their target organs.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Bans Fuel Exports by Road to Boost Shipping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 23 (Xinhua) -- A recent Kenyan government move
to ban the export of petroleum products by road to Somalia, Sudan
and Ethiopia is expected to promote shipping between ports of
Mombasa, Kismayu and Mogadishu, East African reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The ban, affecting the export of drummed automotive gas oil
and gasoline, comes shortly after the Kenyan government was
suggested to build an oil jetty linked to the Kisumu pipeline
terminal to ease the bulk loading of oil tankers.
</P>
<P>
The ban, announced by Kenya's Energy Minister Chrisanthus
Okemo, demanded that bunker sales be made direct onto barges from
oil jetties, according to the weekly newspaper.
</P>
<P>
A survey revealed that drums of petroleum products now are
being loaded into light vessels and large dhows destined for
Somali ports.
</P>
<P>
Shipment to the now landlocked Ethiopia is expected to go
through the Red Sea port of Djibouti while Sudanese consignments
will be shipped direct to Port Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's Mombasa city, a leading port in east Africa, has
witnessed active shipment of varied merchandise to war-torn
Somalia over recent years. At least 12 light vessels calling from
Somalia to offload or load cargo last year.
</P>
<P>
Business between Somalia and Mombasa reached its peak during
UN military and relief operations which saw shipment of thousands
of tons of relief food and fuel to Mogadishu and Kismayu.
</P>
<P>
Despite civil strife that has plagued Somalia, Somali ports
continue to attract business from neighboring east African ports
and from the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
The ports of Merca, Kismayu and Mogadishu reported a high
number of ship calls towards the end of last year.

<HEADLINE> Ethnic Language Flourishes In China's Largest Ethnic Group (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The language of the largest
minority of China's 55 ethnic groups, the Zhuang nationality, is
now a major part of its daily life, from folk songs to newspapers
and books, even though the group had no unified language just four
decades ago.
</P>
<P>
Schools in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, in the
Southwest, have textbooks in the Zhuang language alongside Chinese
and English textbooks.
</P>
<P>
There are about 18 million Zhuang people. Guangxi, where they
live in compact communities, has 15 million.
</P>
<P>
The ancient Zhuang language, dating back some 1,300 years, had
no unified or standard form until 1957, when the Chinese
government approved a plan for a standard Zhuang language which
was drafted by Zhuang linguists.
</P>
<P>
Du Zaijing, a linguist and member of the Zhuang ethnic group,
says, "The alphabets of the Zhuang language we're using now is
standardized Latin which is easy to teach. And it retains our
ethnic characteristics and is very popular."
</P>
<P>
For the past four decades, the Zhuang language has spread a
lot, according to Li Zhenqian, vice-chairman of the Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region, who says that elementary and middle schools in
23 cities and counties conduct lessons in both Zhuang and Chinese.
</P>
<P>
About 700,000 rural Zhuang youngsters have become literate
through the study of their ethnic language in the past few years,
and a language teacher at the Luocheng County Ethnic Middle School
in Guangxi, Tan Liuyan, says, "I get a feeling of pride when I
give lessons in the Zhuang language to the children here."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- China used 2.36 billion US dollars
worth of foreign capital in February, an almost 2 percent decrease
from a year ago, according to Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) figures.
</P>
<P>
MOFTEC's Foreign Investment Department says that China approved
1,109 more foreign-funded enterprises last month, 1.93 percent
more than for the same month in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The newly approved contracts for February were worth 2.52
billion dollars, up 23.69 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the first two months, China approved 2,195 foreign-funded
enterprises, a 9.82 decrease from the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
New contracts grew 10.17 percent to 4.84 billion US dollars for
the two-month period, and capital actually used increased 2.22
percent to 4.6 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-four percent of the 1,636 projects newly approved in
the first two months got the investment from Hong Kong, Macao,
Taiwan, Japan, the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore,
Indonesia or Korea.
</P>
<P>
These investments were worth 2.84 billion dollars.

MOSCOW, March 23 (Xinhua) - Russian President Boris Yeltsin
reshuffled the entire Russian government on Monday, firing Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and other senior government officials.
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin said in a brief announcement that Yeltsin himself
will temporarily serve as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
"The Russian Federation government is hereby dismissed,"
Yeltsin said in a decree he signed after returning to the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
Before dismissing the entire government, Yeltsin relieved First
Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais of his duties "in view of
transfer to another job."
</P>
<P>
In another decree, Yeltsin sacked Interior Minister Anatoly
Kulikov, also "in view of transfer to another job," and his duties
are to be performed by his first deputy Maslov.
</P>
<P>
But Yeltsin asked other government ministers to stay on their
job. "Government ministers are asked to continue their duties
until a new government is formed," Yeltsin said. "I will
temporarily act as prime minister."
</P>
<P>
Before issuing the decree to fire Chernomyrdin, Yeltsin had
talks with the prime minister and awarded him the order "for
services to the fatherland" for his work in the government.
</P>
<P>
First Deputy Premier Boris Nemtsov said the decision to fire
the government was taken by Yeltsin alone.
</P>
<P>
"It was a decision of the president and I have nothing else to
add," Nemtsov was quoted by Interfax as saying.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Former First Lady on "Family Assets" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Former First Lady
Imelda Marcos admitted Monday that she is seeking the presidency
to protect "the assets" amassed by her family during the past 20
years.
</P>
<P>
Imelda admitted this during a presidential debate which started
late Sunday night and lasted until Monday morning, the Philippine
News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court upheld in January a 12-year sentence against
the former first lady by a local court, raising alarm that the
Marcoses could lose millions of dollars in assets stashed away in
Swiss and other foreign banks.
</P>
<P>
Although Imelda has filed a motion for reconsideration with the
Supreme Court, she sounded desperate to keep her "family's wealth"
in the debate.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, she expressed optimism that she could evade the
Supreme Court ruling on sending her to jail for 12 years and the
Swiss tribunal's decision to turn over her "family assets" to the
Philippine government.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government has been working on the return of the
500 million U.S. dollars in gold deposits and foreign currency
deposits in banks of Switzerland after former president Ferdinand
Marcos was ousted.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Senate recently uncovered evidence indicating
that the Marcos assets could reach as high as 2 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss Tribunal ruled last year to transfer the Marcos
deposits to the Philippines. However, it required that the money
can only be placed in an escrow account to be released to the
government if Imelda is convicted in connection with the money in
a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
Imelda expressed her desperation, even as she announced that
she is questioning the Swiss tribunal decision and the planned
transfer of her "family assets" before the International Court of
Justice in Hague.
</P>
<P>
But she was quick to add that she will distribute to the
Filipino people part of her late husband's wealth, as demanded
under Ferdinand Marcos' last will.

<HEADLINE> Relief Food in Tanzania Destroyed by Pests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Pests have destroyed more
than 150 tons of relief food in west Tanzania's Tabora Region,
according a survey conducted recently by local newspaper Daily Mail.
</P>
<P>
The amount of grain, provided by the Prime Minister's Office,
has been infested by weevils and grain borers, the newpaper Monday
quoted the survey as reporting.
</P>
<P>
The grain, stored in warehouses belonging to Caritas, has
arrived in the region at the end of last year as part of 500 tons
released by the Prime Minister's Office as emergency food
supplies to victims of floods in the region.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that since the Prime Minister's Office did not
provide money for the distribution of the food, and Caritas was
itself burdened with other responsibilities, effective allotment
of the relief food became a difficult task.
</P>
<P>
John Mbele, Caritas Co-ordinator in Tabora, admitted that some
of the maize had been destroyed by pests in warehouse and said
that he is expecting money from his headquarters in Dar es Salaam
to meet the costs of distributing the relief food in Nzega
District starting this week.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Book On Government Restructuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- A book released today in China,
prepared by a team of scholars from the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences, systematically sums up the government restructuring in
one province.
</P>
<P>
Hainan province, China's largest special economic zone,
initiated government institutional restructuring ten years ago and
has slashed the number of government departments by more than 50
percent, and government employees by 37 percent.
</P>
<P>
This accords with the government restructuring plan that was
just approved by the National People's Congress, says Xing Bensi,
editor-in-chief of "Seeking Truth" Magazine, who says the practice
will provide experience for other provinces.
</P>
<P>
It also proves the necessity and feasibility of the reforms,
according to Gu Jiaqi, a central government official.
</P>
<P>
Some experts say that Hainan's economy has been growing fast
and its social stability has been maintained, thanks to the
reforms, which made the government serve business.
</P>
<P>
Hainan has introduced a legal and welfare system and set up a
number of non-government intermediary agencies to speed up the
reform process.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 23 (Xinhua) - Russian President Boris Yeltsin
reshuffled the entire Russian government on Monday, firing Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and other senior government officials.
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin said in a brief announcement that Yeltsin himself
will temporarily serve as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
"The Russian Federation government is hereby dismissed,"
Yeltsin said in a decree he signed after returning to the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
Before dismissing the entire government, Yeltsin relieved First
Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais of his duties "in view of
transfer to another job."
</P>
<P>
In another decree, Yeltsin sacked Interior Minister Anatoly
Kulikov, also "in view of transfer to another job," and his duties
are to be performed by his first deputy Maslov.
</P>
<P>
But Yeltsin asked other government ministers to stay on their
job. "Government ministers are asked to continue their duties
until a new government is formed," Yeltsin said. "I will
temporarily act as prime minister."
</P>
<P>
Before issuing the decree to fire Chernomyrdin, Yeltsin had
talks with the prime minister and awarded him the order "for
services to the fatherland" for his work in the government.
</P>
<P>
First Deputy Premier Boris Nemtsov said the decision to fire
the government was taken by Yeltsin alone.
</P>
<P>
"It was a decision of the president and I have nothing else to
add," Nemtsov was quoted by Interfax as saying.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Palestinians to Monitor Israeli Settlements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 23 (Xinhua) -- In an extraordinary move in the
Middle East peace process, the United States and the Palestinians
will join hands to monitor Israeli settlement activity, local
daily Haaretz reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a source close to the Israeli-Palestinian
peace negotiations as saying that a joint American-Palestinian
committee will be set up to supervise the Israeli settlement
building and land expropriations in the West Bank in an attempt to
renew the deadlocked peace talks.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first time the Americans have set up a joint
forum with the Palestinians to keep an eye on Israeli activity.
</P>
<P>
The source said that the committee would also monitor Israeli
construction in East Jerusalem, even though this was not explicit
in the American promise to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
He added the Americans have agreed that the settlement issues
will not be included in the peace initiative they plan to publish
following the upcoming visit to the region by Dennis Ross, the
U.S. Middle East peace envoy, in order to make it easier for
Israel to accept.
</P>
<P>
Instead, there has been an agreement in principle that Israel
will give either the U.S. or Jordan a written commitment that it
will significantly reduce settlement activity. The Palestinians,
who originally demanded a complete halt to settlement activity,
have agreed to accept this.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. was reportedly proposing that Israel hand over 13
percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians in the second troop
redeployment in order to salvage the collapsing peace process.
</P>
<P>
However, the plan was snubbed by Israel, which said the 13
percent redeployment will be rejected outright. There seems going
to be a serious confrontation over the U.S. plan.
</P>
<P>
A senior leader of the American Jewish community had made it
clear to the U.S. President Bill Clinton that he would give full
backing to the Israeli government on this issue.
</P>
<P>
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have been stalled for over a
year over Israeli Jewish settlement expansion and the extent of
next Israeli troop withdrawal in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israel insisted that a pullback from 9 percent of the area is
the maximum that can be undertaken without endangering security.
But the Palestinians demand for at least a 20 percent withdrawal.

<P>
SHANGHAI, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's suburbs are absorbing
a larger sum of investment in water control construction to
enhance their ability against the elements.
</P>
<P>
Improved irrigation and drainage facilities have enabled the
suburban area to provide two million tons of grain and 700,000
tons of vegetables annually to China's largest commercial and
financial center.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 220 million yuan of rural water control funds was
earmarked to improve irrigation and drainage on 33,333 ha. of
grain-growing land and increase the disaster-resistant capacity of
6,666 ha.
</P>
<P>
Another 50 million yuan has poured in for upgrading the
irrigation and drainage facilities in vegetable-growing
areas. Currently, some 3,333 ha. of vegetable growing area has
adopted spray irrigation and over 266 ha of fields uses dip
irrigation.
</P>
<P>
The suburban areas have made headway in introducing
power-engined irrigation and drainage technology. A flood control
project costing an investment of 170 million yuan is under

<HEADLINE> Listing of S. African Insurance Giants to Spur Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 23 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is poised for
a new era of prosperity when assurance giants Old Mutual and
Sanlam go public, The Star daily reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Financial experts predicted that with the "demutualization" of
the two companies, about 65 billion Rand (13 billion U.S.
dollars) will be injected into the economy.
</P>
<P>
The process -- due to start toward the end of the year in the
case of Sanlam and at the end of 1999 for Old Mutual -- is
expected to unleash a major spending spree, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
It quoted independent research as showing that the spending
will have an enormous impact on both the manufacturing and
leisure industries.
</P>
<P>
Wisely managed, the spending could propel South Africa into a
new era of prosperity, stimulating growth and creating jobs.
</P>
<P>
This is where Sanlam's economists think money from the sale of
Sanlam shares could go:
</P>
<P>
-- 25 percent on big household items such as stoves, TVs and
audio equipment;
</P>
<P>
-- 25 percent on semi-durables such as clothing and footwear;
</P>
<P>
-- 20 percent on home improvements;
</P>
<P>
-- 10 percent on transport and accessories;
</P>
<P>
-- 10 percent on travel and holidays.
</P>
<P>
In Cape Town, where Old Mutual and Sanlam have their head
offices, preparations for demutualization are proceeding
smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Both companies have set up helplines to answer queries.
Sanlam's is currently manned by 80 specially trained people. When
the demutualization process reaches it peak, about 500 people
will man the helpline.
</P>
<P>
George Rudman, Sanlam's senior general manager and project
leader for demutualization, said the demutualization would not
affect the benefits accruing to existing assurance policies.
</P>
<P>
"Many of our policy holders want to know where the money for
the shares is coming from," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In a mutual society, a portion of the profits are retained.
This is known as free reserves. It provides working capital as a
cushion, giving policy holders additional security."
</P>
<P>
"The shares are created by converting the free reserves into
share capital."
</P>
<P>
Both Sanlam and Old Mutual are working around the clock to
ensure that their policy holders are kept informed of
developments.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- China's Education Ministry will
encourage Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan to take college exams for
self-taught people.
</P>
<P>
The number of people in the three regions wanting mainland
university degrees is increasing, according to Pan Guiming,
director of the Self-Teaching Higher Education Exam Center. He
says that studying at a mainland university is one way to learn
more about the motherland, and the most convenient way is to take
part in a self-teaching program.
</P>
<P>
The program encourages all Chinese, regardless of sex, age,
ethnic affiliation, or education level, to take university courses
via radio or TV and to take exams.
</P>
<P>
Since the program began in 1981, some 20 million people have
signed up for the exam, and 1.8 million have obtained university
certificates. It has helped solve the problem Chinese universities
have in not being able to provide enough opportunities for 1.2
billion people.
</P>
<P>
Pan says that China opened the exam to Hong Kong residents in
1994 and Hong Kong education authorities will be responsible for
their own affairs this year. He has urged Taiwan authorities to
lift restrictions on Taiwan residents taking part in the exam on
the mainland.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 23 (Xinhua) -- To seek common development and
prosperity, better developed Guangdong province in south China has
been working hard to promote economic cooperation with other parts
of the country.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the province invested 60 million yuan to help
southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region resettle 20,000
poverty-stricken farmers.
</P>
<P>
In the same year, the two areas held a trade fair and signed 60
items of economic cooperation projects, with the total investment
reaching 1.75 billion yuan. Abundant natural and labor resources
in Guangxi attract a group of enterprises in Guangdong to make
investment there.
</P>
<P>
It is also an important task for Guangdong to support the
construction of the Three Gorges Project, according to provincial
officials. By the end of 1997, the province has invested more than
150 million yuan for resident resettlement projects, including 50
million yuan of free aid.
</P>
<P>
Inland areas are also keen on cooperation with Guangdong. In
1997, officials and experts from Guangxi, Yunnan, Hebei, Sichuan
and Shandong investigated in Guangdong and signed a group of
economic cooperation projects.
</P>
<P>
Some enterprises in Guangdong annexed and purchased some inland
firms, and a large number of inland enterprises entered Guangdong
for development.
</P>
<P>
The economic and technological cooperation zone, having the
participation of six provinces and three municipalities from
central and south China, has made great progress in restructuring
assets and attracting overseas investment, according to the
provincial officials.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Thai state enterprises suffering
huge losses will be merged, privatized or even closed, a
government official said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The official from the Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives
Ministry said these measures will be applied to the ministry's
eight enterprises which have registered accumulated losses of
1.672 billion baht (about 44 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry has already approved the plan for the
shakeup and closures, said the official, who refused to be named.
</P>
<P>
He said failures of the enterprises have been caused by many
factors, including political interference which usually results in
the appointment of ineligible persons to the management.
</P>
<P>
But he said, "It is all right to say that state enterprises
under this ministry are in the red because of poor management and
corruption. It should also be noted that privatization is not
always the answer. Sometimes, privatization means only a change of
name while the organization is still run by disqualified people.'
</P>
<P>
He said the measures are part of the country's deepening reform
aimed at streamlining the public and private sectors.

<HEADLINE> Finding New Jobs For Chinese Textile Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Some 350,000 Chinese textile
workers got new jobs in 1997 through efforts of their employees
and labor departments, according to a recent national textile and
labor meeting in the city of Yinchuan, the capital of the Ningxia
Hui Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The textile sector, which is both the best representative and
the most difficult sector of China's state-owned industries, was
selected at last year's central economic conference as a starting
point for more reforms in state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The conference was held by the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China and the State Council in Beijing in
December. It set a goal of destroying 10 million spindles in three
years' time and reducing the number of textile workers by 1.2
million.
</P>
<P>
Various textile mills and labor departments across the country
have been trying to lend a helping hand to those who are laid off.
Many cities have increased work on labor markets and have set up
reemployment centers where workers can get information,
consultation, or training for new jobs.

<HEADLINE> Armed Forces Ready to Foil Aggression: Pak President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani President Muhammad
Rafiq Tarar warned on Monday that his country's desire for peace
must not be mistaken for weakness and vowed that the Pakistani
Armed Forces are prepared to thwart any aggression.
</P>
<P>
"Our armed forces are ready to give telling response to any
foreign aggression," Tarar declared in an address at the Pakistan
Day Parade held here Monday morning to mark the historic Pakistan
Resolution 58 years ago.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan's highly professional armed forces are
equipped with the latest weaponry. "Laden with the spirit of
sacrifice imparted by their faith and religion, our armed forces
are always prepared to counter enemy's attack."
</P>
<P>
"The defense of Pakistan is in very strong hands," he said.
</P>
<P>
Following independence, he said, Pakistan has experienced
several ups and downs. "We have faced many external and internal
challenges throughout our 50 years of independence."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, he said, is still confronted with great challenges.
</P>
<P>
"The anti-social elements are hell bent to disturb peace and
order in the country and the bad economic situation is hampering
the process of national progress and development," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president urged the need for unity among the nation to face
all these challenges.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan believes in the policy of coexistence and
wants to have good and friendly relations with all countries,
particularly its neighbors. But, he reiterated, "This should not
be considered as our weakness."
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan's pursuit of peaceful use of nuclear energy
should not be doubted. "We consider that the acquisition of
nuclear energy is necessary for the national progress and national
development."
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan's nuclear program is absolutely meant for peaceful
purposes," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people including President Tarar, Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif and chiefs of the three services of the armed forces
watched the one-and-half-hour-long joint services parade which
started at 9 a.m. (local time) and comprised marching and
mechanized columns.

<HEADLINE> China to Revise Star Hotel Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, March 23 (Xinhua) -- China plans to revise its star
hotel standards and put them into effect as of May 1, according to
an on-going trans-century hotel management seminar here today.
</P>
<P>
The major difference between the old and new standards is that
the latter enables hotel managers to have more choices in
providing services.
</P>
<P>
Business hotels, for example, must have business floors, but
not necessarily swimming pools, whereas tourist hotels must have
swimming pools, but not necessarily business floors.
</P>
<P>
China started star hotel practice in 1988. However, the unified
standards no longer meet the need of a diversified tourist market.
</P>
<P>
The revised standards will have more than 70 items of choices
instead of the original 40-odd for hotels to apply for star
qualifications.
</P>
<P>
Star assessment will also cover office buildings, apartments,
and villas that involve foreign participation, sources said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysians Urged to Make Sacrifices in Tackling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Supreme Head of
State Tuanku Ja'afar Monday called on his people to continue with
their sacrifices and strive with full determination in tackling
the economic woes the country is facing.
</P>
<P>
They should refrain from resorting to any action that will give
rise to problems and suspicions but to heighten their resolves in
facing the current challenges, the King said in his Royal Address
when opening the Fourth Session of the Ninth Parliament here.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the currency and share market turmoil which had
affected economic growth, the people must not deny the positive
measures the government initiated so far, Tuanku Ja'afar said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the people to remain patient in facing the situation,
saying they must have total confidence in the government.
</P>
<P>
He said "With these strength and positive measures we have been
able to deal with the national economic slowdown without having to
rely on foreign assistance or international financial
institutions."
</P>
<P>
The King was confident that under the able leadership of Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad, the people and the government would
have the capability to survive the present economic woes.
</P>
<P>
"Although Malaysia was hit by the financial exchange rate
crisis and the worsening share market since 1997, I am confident
that the people and the government under Mahathir will be able to
meet these unexpected economic challenges," the King said.
</P>
<P>
He said: "In the present scenario it is necessary for people
from all walks of life to avoid wastage, reduce unnecessary
spending, increase savings and invest in sectors which guarantee
profitable returns in the long term."
</P>
<P>
The King said the government would continue to exercise control
to ensure a more prudent public sector spending by reducing the
federal expenditure this year.
</P>
<P>
"Efforts to maintain a strong growth must continue based on
improved productivity, especially from the competitive and the
technologically oriented aspect of human resource development," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said there must be focus on efforts to strengthen the
country's balance of payment by encouraging the people to use
more local products and services, improve the local productivity
sector, exercise thrift and boost export promotion.
</P>
<P>
The King said steps should also be taken to increase domestic
savings to finance the economic sector and avoid dependence on
foreign loans.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia would ensure that its trade and investment
liberalization policy would be carried out in stages and would
also strive for a more liberal export market for local products.
</P>
<P>
He said the government would continue with its strategic and
vital infrastructure development despite the spending cuts.
</P>
<P>
The King's Royal Address also touched on education, health,
rural development, environment, international relations, unity and
consumerism.
</P>
<P>
He urged members of both houses of Parliament to carry out
their duties and responsibilities with sincerity and integrity in
the interest of the country and the people.
</P>
<P>
He concluded the Royal Address with an appeal to the people to
demonstrate their undivided loyalty to their beloved country and
to ensure continued peace and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who is also
Finance Minister, is expected to announce additional measures to
speed up economic recovery during the current session.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,183 questions mostly on the economic problems had
been submitted for oral replies during the session.
</P>
<P>
Several Bills brought forward from the past session will also
be debated during the session.

<HEADLINE> SAARC Trade Negotiations Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The third round of trade
negotiations under the SAARC Preferential Trading Arrangement
(SAPTA) slated for late March has been postponed, a senior
secretary from the Kathmandu-based SAARC Secretariat confirmed
Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said the third round of negotiations was put off because
delegates of some member countries are being involved in meetings
at home.
</P>
<P>
But he could not tell right now the rescheduled time for the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
No other officials could be reached for comment as the SAARC
Secretariat is closed Monday on the occasion of Pakistan Day.
</P>
<P>
Besides Pakistan, the SAARC groups Bangladesh, Bhutan, India,
the Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The third round of trade negotiations should have been
completed in January 1998, but was delayed because the meeting of
the commerce ministers of the SAARC countries slated for February
was rescheduled for April.
</P>
<P>
The previous two rounds of negotiations have offered more than
2,000 items of products for tariff cuts ranging from 10 percent to
50 percent.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the SAARC countries have decided to move from the
SAPTA to a South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) preferably by 2001.

<HEADLINE> Acute Groundwater Shortage in Bangladesh Imminent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Unplanned and excessive withdrawal
of groundwater has caused the water-table to go down to such a low
level in most parts of Bangladesh that an acute groundwater
shortage might be imminent in the summer, press reports said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
This concern was aired by speakers at a national seminar on
groundwater resources held in Dhaka Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Describing the current groundwater condition as an emergency
situation, the speakers said that withdrawal of groundwater more
than the actual recharge level was transforming many shallow
water-table areas of the country into deep table areas.
</P>
<P>
As a result of this, at least half of the country's shallow
tubewells ran the risk of being rendered redundant during the
prolonged summer, thus further deteriorating the water crisis,
they noted.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the random use of groundwater needed to be reviewed
and re-examined as soon as possible in the light of the increasing
threat of arsenic and other toxic contamination in the
groundwater, they added.

<HEADLINE> Indian Prime Minister Calls for Consensus Politics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Atal
Behari Vajpayee has called for consensus politics and giving up
what he called the harmful path of confrontation.
</P>
<P>
He said in a national telecast here Sunday night that there
could be no progress if the practice of blocking one another
continued. The country should come out of this destructive habit.
</P>
<P>
The newly constituted 12th lower house of the parliament is
scheduled to start its first session here Monday and Vajpayee will
have to prove his majority on the floor during the session.
President K. R. Narayanan appointed Vajpayee the new prime
minister last week and asked him to show his majority in the
parliament within 10 days after his swearing-in on March 19. The
Vajpayee government is a minority government and it will face an
acid test in the show of strength in the house.
</P>
<P>
Reminiscent of his appeal for consensual politics in 1996 when
he headed a similarly placed government, which only lasted 13
days, Vajpayee said, "Our mad race to pull down one another by
fair and foul means has sullied India." In the past two years,
India has witnessed the change of three prime ministers. Vajpayee
was forced to resign as the prime minister only after 13 days in
office due to his failure to muster enough support in the house on
May 16, 1996.
</P>
<P>
In his telecast, Vajpayee also spelt out the priorities of his
government: Increasing food production so that the country could
be free of hunger in a decade, expanding both the physical and
social infrastructure sectors rapidly to equip them to act as
engines for growth and job generators and formulating a national
water policy.
</P>
<P>
Reciprocating an offer from his Pakistani counterpart, Nawaz
Sharif, to "go the extra mile" in order to promote good
neighborliness between the two countries, Vajpayee said India
wants to be friends with all.

YANGON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has been making great
efforts to set up more safe drinking water projects since the 1997
UN Water Conference and has realized a 60-percent safe drinking
water coverage in the whole country.
</P>
<P>
Official newspaper the New Light of Myanmar Monday said the

Program of Operation.
</P>
<P>
With bilateral and multi-lateral aids and UN agencies'
cooperation programs, Myanmar has already built water facilities
such as 12,670 deep tubewells, 18,997 shallow tubewells and 31
village piped water supply systems, benefiting over 14 million
rural inhabitants.

<HEADLINE> Fires in Indonesian Province Cause Heavy Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The three-month-long fires in
Indonesia's East Kalimantan Province have caused 2.2 trillion
rupiah (220 million U.S. dollars) in material losses, a local
government official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Parts of the province continued to be ravaged by fire Sunday as
residents in the provincial capital, Samarinda, were again forced
to don face masks, Head of the Environmental Impact Management
Agency Awang Faroek said in Samarinda, according to reports
reaching here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The fires, which started in January this year, have ravaged
127,770 hectares of brush and forest, officials estimated.
</P>
<P>
The material losses do not include damage to the province's
rich forest biodiversity and long-term health costs to people
living in the province, Awang said.
</P>
<P>
He said nearly 40 percent of fire-ravaged forests are in areas
owned by timber estate companies. Financial losses in the timber
estate areas are put at about 738 billion rupiah (9,500 rupiah to
the U.S. dollar at the current exchange rate).
</P>
<P>
But, Awang said, the area which suffered the highest losses is
the Kutai National part of the Kutai Regency, with more than 790
billion rupiah in financial losses despite the fact that the area
of burned forest totaled only 39,542 hectares, or 30 percent of
the total forest burned in the past three months.
</P>
<P>
Although the total area burned is relatively "small" compared
to the province's total forest areas of more than 21 million
hectares, Awang said the impact could be more far-reaching than
last year's fires.
</P>
<P>
At least 300,000 hectares were ravaged by forest and brush
fires in Sumatra and Kalimantan islands last year. In East
Kalimantan Province fires destroyed 37,092 hectares of forest.
</P>
<P>
The disaster sent smog all over Southeast Asia, inflicting more
than 1.3 billion dollars in smog damage to Indonesia, Malaysia and
Singapore, 90 percent of which was attributed to short-term health
costs.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the health impact, Awang said that in February and
March this year more than 5,000 people in Samarinda were inflicted
with smog-related illnesses and diseases induced by a lack of
clean water.
</P>
<P>
At least 3,404 people suffered respiratory ailments and 1,052
came down with diarrhea while hundreds of others got pneumonia,
eye irritations and asthma, he said.
</P>
<P>
Awang said concerted efforts to put out and contain the fires
have been made by the provincial administration in cooperation
with local people and the Armed Forces.
</P>
<P>
Another effort would be a labor-intensive firefighting program
sponsored by the U.N. Development Program, under which, some 1,000
people would be involved in fighting fires for two consecutive
weeks with daily wages of 7,500 rupiah, he said.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Welcomes Pardon for Ranariddh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan said on Sunday that the royal
pardon, which lifted a 35-year jail term and a 54-million U.S.
dollar fine for the prince, had removed obstacles from the ongoing
peace process and was expected to lead to free, fair and credible
election in the country.
</P>
<P>
The amnesty extended by the Cambodian King lifted a military
court verdict against the prince, who was tried in absentia.
</P>
<P>
The prince, who left the country after a military confrontation
last July, was found guilty by the Court of smuggling weapons into
Phnom Penh and collaborating with the outlawed Khmer rouge.
</P>
<P>
The royal pardon enabled the prince, who is still in Bangkok,
to return to Cambodia to participate in the elections scheduled
for July 26.
</P>
<P>
Under Cambodian election laws, a candidate is required to stay
in Cambodia for at least one month before the registration date,
which was postponed until April 20.
</P>
<P>
The Thai foreign Minster also mentioned the displaced
Cambodians who escaped fighting in the country and are now staying
in Thailand's border provinces.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that all political forces, including the displaced
Cambodians in Thai camps, should be allowed to take part in the
election at home as part of guaranteeing that the election is free
of fear and intimidation.

republic gained independence in 1991, Moldova's national
television station reported.
</P>
<P>
Starting from 7:00 a.m. (0500 GMT), voters went to more than
2,000 polling stations around the country. Over 200 foreign
observers and 1,000 Moldovan observers monitored the election at
major polling stations.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen special polling stations were set up on the west bank
of the Dnestr for Moldovan inhabitants on the other side of the
river in Moldova's breakaway Dnestr territory who wanted to
vote. Russian-speaking inhabitants had self-proclaimed a republic
in the Dnestr territory.
</P>
<P>
The election, which ended at 9:00 p.m. (1900 GMT), went on
peacefully in most areas of the country, the national TV reported.
</P>
<P>
Some Moldovan inhabitants in the Dnestr territory, however,
were blocked on their way to cross the river to vote, said Dumitru
Nedelcu, chairman of the Central Electoral Committee.
</P>
<P>
The Moldovan parliament needs those political forces which can
ensure stability and prosperity of the republic, said Moldovan
President Petru Lu Cinschi after voting at the Number One Polling
Station in the capital Chisinau.
</P>
<P>
The president reiterated that he will respect the choice of the
people and cooperate with the political forces coming into the
parliament.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment Flows Into Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 23 (Xinhua) -- More than 11 billion U.S. dollars
in foreign funds is flowing into Thailand as part of international
moves to help improve the country's finances and productivity,
particularly expansion of exports.
</P>
<P>
The International Finance Corporation of Thailand (IFCT)
announced here Monday that Thai exporters expect to obtain at
least 11.55 billion dollars in foreign financial support.
</P>
<P>
Recoiling from last year's losses, exporters and importers have
found new hope in promises by the world's leading financiers of
low-interest loans, the announcement said.
</P>
<P>
Late last year, the Federation of Thai Industries (FTI)
estimated that the country's export industry needed 400 billion
baht (about 1.05 billion dollars) to ease cash flow problems.
</P>
<P>
But now exporters need a minimum of 500 billion baht (about 1.3
billion dollars) in long-term funds to overhaul manufacturing and
boost competitiveness, according to FTI.
</P>
<P>
Joining the efforts for significant financial contributions to
Thailand are Abn-Amro Bank of the Netherlands and the Dresdner
Bank of Germany.
</P>
<P>
The two are core members of as many as 50 leading international
financial institutions that are to provide 2 billion dollars in
syndicated loans to the Thai government.
</P>
<P>
The amount, aimed at helping Thai exporters, is being arranged
by the two banks. The contract is scheduled to be signed on April
1.
</P>
<P>
Abn-Amro Bank is also considering lending 8 million dollars to
Thai exporters of food, textiles, jewelry and ornaments. The terms
and conditions are under consideration.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. ExIm Bank recently agreed to lend 1 billion dollars to
Thai exporters who need to import raw materials from the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached when Thai Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai visited the United States last week. The signing of the
agreement is expected soon.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has lent 2.3 billion dollars, of which 2 billion
dollars will be used to increase exporters' capital and the rest
to support labor training programs in a bid to reduce
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Other institutions that offer support include the Japanese
Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund and the Bank of Abu Dhabi.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Decides to Reduce Oil Export to Stablize Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Mexico has decided to reduce
its oil export by 100,000 barrels per day to stablize the
international oil price, according to an Energy Ministry statement
released Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement among Mexico, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela
signed here Sunday, from April 1, Mexican oil companies will
adjust their plans and reduce the export to 1.74 million barrels a
day.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican Energy Ministry and oil companies will continue to
keep an eye on the world market and manage to take necessary
measures to stablize the price, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Since the outbreak of the oil pricing crisis, the Mexican
government has called more than once for meetings between oil
producers and consumers to reconciliate and take actions to
stablize the international market.
</P>
<P>
The agreement among the three countries, which was an outcome
of two days of discussions, also asked Saudi Arabia and Venezuela
to reduce their production by 300,000 and 200,000 barrels a day
respectively.

<HEADLINE> Russia Urged to Give Priority to Aviation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Russia's presidential aide, Evgeny
Shaposhnikov, has said Russia should give priority to developing
its airplane manufacturing industry instead of automobiles.
</P>
<P>
A Russian weekly issued Sunday quoted Shaposhnikov as saying
that the Russian policy of blindly going after the development of
its automobile industry is a "stupid strategic mistake."
</P>
<P>
He said while Russia has no chance to catch up in the
automobile sector with its foreign counterparts in the foreseeable
future, Russia's comparatively advanced airplane manufacturing
industry can serve as a locomotive to propel an overall industrial
development.
</P>
<P>
Due to the lack of large-scale state investment, the research
and development of Russian aviation products was stagnant,
Shaposhnikov said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, he said, Russian airplanes lag behind
international standard and barely any country would like to buy
Russian planes. Under such circumstances, foreign airplane
manufacturers are intensifying their effort to penetrate into the
Russian market, Shaposhnikov added.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Adopts Flexible Policy on Assets Auction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Finance Restructuring
Authority (FRA) has adopted a more flexible policy to allow
bidders for the core assets of the 56 closed finance firms to
choose what they want, the Nation newspaper said Monday.
</P>
<P>
This is believed to be part of the authority's efforts to
attract more buyers for the assets.
</P>
<P>
As earlier planned, bidders for the core assets of the 56
defunct finance companies will be auctioned in package, which
means bidders will be forced to buy both good and bad assets.
</P>
<P>
But later, FRA officials realized the strategy will not fit a
market where potential bidders want only good assets, since they
are convinced the Thai economy could take years to fully recover.
</P>
<P>
The FRA therefore decided to sell the assets according to
classification.
</P>
<P>
However, the bidders who receive the privilege must be willing
to spend at least 10 billion baht (250 million U.S. dollars) at
the auctions.
</P>
<P>
The FRA had auctioned part of the non-core assets of the 56
shut-down companies, namely vehicles and antiques, last month. The
core assets auctions are expected to start in April.
</P>
<P>
The book value of the 56 companies' assets is estimated at 866
billion baht (21.7 billion U.S. dollars), but they are expected to
be auctioned at discount ranging from 30 to 60 percent.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Finding Magic In Romance Of Latin Dance (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Fan Xingxia, who is
seventy-plus, holds from time to time an attractive lady and
gliding across the polished floor of a glittering ballroom to the
pulse of a rhumba rhythm in Zhengzhou, capital of central China's
Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
Fan took part in the finals of the Second China International
Standard Ballroom Dance Contest for Amateurs. And, he's brought
along 11 family members, his sons, daughters, sons-in-law,
daughters-in-law, grandsons, and granddaughters to take part in
the contest. His wife does all the support work.
</P>
<P>
And the family went home with a grand total of four medals and
12 cups in the Latin dance competition, and five family members
are chosen as members of the national team.
</P>
<P>
Fan is a retired railway official of the local bureau who began
to study Latin dance in his 60s. "I was fascinated by the passion
of Latin dance immediately," this patriarch of the dancing family
explains, "The magic of Latin dance is its communicating without
words." He says it created endless emotions for him.
</P>
<P>
After six month of training in a class, he took part in a
provincial contest and came in sixth. This completely unexpected
success intensified his love for the dance, and he not only danced
at class, but at home as well, and wanted his wife to be his
partner.
</P>
<P>
But his wife put her foot down: "I thought he was crazy. At
this age, dancing like that. I never imagined."
</P>
<P>
His second son reacted in a similar fashion even though he
teaches sports and is in good shape. "He showed no interest at all
at that time," Fan says resignedly.
</P>
<P>
But, when Fan went to visit his eldest son and daughter-in-law
in another city, he gave an impromptu performance, and the couple
were hooked, and they joined Fan in learning to dance.
</P>
<P>
When ballroom dancing was re-introduced into China at the
beginning of the 1990s, it quickly became a fashion in big cities
like Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, where people can now be
seen dancing in the squares and parks early in the morning.

<TEXT>
<P>
Then the family began to spend more time practicing at home,
which was usually permeated with the festive feeling. Everybody
was attracted to the dance floor. Even Fan's wife couldn't oppose
him any more and said, "I found he was younger, more joyful and
romantic".
</P>
<P>
Dance has now become a common language for the family. They
discuss dancing techniques and improve their dancing skill. At a
provincial contest in 1994, they took nine titles.
</P>
<P>
"The soul of Latin dance lies in its primitive style and modern
rhythm," Fan says, "It is good-looking but not easy to learn. If
it isn't done well, the person looks like a foreigner dancing the
yangko," he explains, using a popular form of rural folk dance to
make his point.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, the family has spent no small amount on
refining their dancing. In 1994, it cost each of them 10 days and
360 yuan, nearly half their monthly income, to study with a
professional dancer from Britain. And in 1995, Fan's second son
and his wife spent 300 yuan per hour learning several new steps
from a national champion.
</P>
<P>
In the process, the family has gained some fame, and the home
is often packed with people from other parts of the province who
have come to learn.
</P>
<P>
So, Fan and his second son started a training class and he says
with typical zeal, "Our aim is not to make money. Those who can
not afford the fee are welcome to attend the class."
</P>
<P>
In the last seven years, the family has participated in 18
contests at home and abroad, and won 11 championships. Fan's
granddaughter was enrolled in the Beijing Dance Academy, and the
second son and his wife, the second daughter and her husband, and
a ten-year-old grandson were chosen for the national team.
</P>
<P>
This means that the backbone of the family dance team is gone
and the job of running a training class is now the responsibility
of Fan and his wife. But, "Anyone interested in Latin dance is
always welcome here in our family," he says cheerfully.

COLOMBO, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka has adopted a new
traffic plan for its capital city Colombo in the wake of security
threats by the Tamil rebels.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Inspector General of Police Colombo H.M. Sirisena Sunday
specified roads along which heavy vehicles could travel when
entering Colombo city, according to the official Daily News
Monday.
</P>
<P>
These vehicles entering Colombo's high security zones such as
Colombo Fort, the city's business center and Kollupitiya where the
President's official residence is located and other areas where
VIPs reside, should carry a permit.
</P>
<P>
Such permits can be obtained by submitting a duly perfected
printed application form along with the originals and photo copies
of specified documents such as identity cards of the driver and
cleaner and documents concerning the vehicle itself, the paper
said, adding when Tamil laborers are employed in the vehicle,
they should have a certificate from the Rural Officer of his
residential area.
</P>
<P>
The Tamil rebels have been fighting a 15-year war for a
separate state in the north and east of the country
</P>
<P>
The two recent explosions in Colombo made by the Tamil rebels
had used the heavy vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Around 20 suicide cadres of the Tamil rebels with four
bomb-laden vehicles are in Colombo to assassinate VIPs, according
to press reports here.

<HEADLINE> Computer: New Dowry Item In Traditional Culture (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Miao Cuihong, an accountant in
the rural city Xishan, in Jiangsu Province, surprised her
parents-in-law when they saw a computer among the traditional
items like furniture and household goods in her dowry.
</P>
<P>
Miao explained that she wanted to improve her professional
skills and her office had already being computerized.
</P>
<P>
"I also plan to hook up to the Internet to broaden my
horizons," she added.
</P>
<P>
And, when she told her parents that she wanted a computer as
her dowry item, they didn't hesitate to buy her one, she
said. This story has caught the interest of people studying
Chinese marriage customs.
</P>
<P>
According to those customs, the bridegroom's parents are
responsible for the couple's housing and the bride's family are
responsible for the daily necessities that the daughter brings to
the husband's family.
</P>
<P>
But, the contents of the dowry have changed over time. In the
past, when rural people lived in fairly harsh conditions, they
usually chose grain and clothing for their soon-to-be-married
daughter, reflecting their desire to protect her from hunger and
cold.
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s, farm implements and livestock became popular
items, as people hoped that the daughter's life could be improved
through hard work.

<HEADLINE> Computer: New Dowry Item in Traditional Culture (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the 1960s, as the standard of living improved, bicycles,
watches, sewing machines, and radios became popular items.
</P>
<P>
By the 1970s and '80s, when China was becoming more modernized,
adoring parents were ready to spend their hard-earned cash on
electric appliances, and the washing machine, television, and
refrigerator took off.
</P>
<P>
More recently, as some farmers have not only made money but
become better educated as well, books and bookcases have begun to
appear on the dowry list, and some wealthier families even have a
separate study in the newlyweds house.
</P>
<P>
Huang Tienan, the editor-in-chief of Nanjing's "Oriental
Culture Weekly" says that he and many other Chinese sociologists
share the belief that computers are an inevitable item in Chinese
dowries.
</P>
<P>
First, they reflect the marked improvement of the standard of
living, because a computer, which costs at least 5,000 yuan (600
US dollars), or about a year's income for an average farmer in
Jiangsu, is clearly a symbol of wealth.
</P>
<P>
Second, they reflect the changes in rural concepts. In the
past, marriage gifts were practical in nature, but have now become
less obviously so, reflecting a strong desire to learn.
</P>
<P>
The use of a computer means getting special knowledge, while
the love of the machine indicates an improvement in the education
level. In Jiangsu, which is a fairly prosperous area, computer
schools have sprung up in villages, according to some reports.
</P>
<P>
Many people believe that these changes are really
encouraging.

<HEADLINE> Witnesses on Cause of Sunday Philippine Air disaster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Witnesses said the Philippine
Airlines Airbus 320 flew too fast when it was landing, therefore
overshot the runway and killed at least three people on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
Manila Standard and Philippine Daily Inquirer Monday quoted
taxi driver Fred Jaluyan and airport employees as saying that
Sunday night they saw the plane coming into the Bacolod city
airport "too fast".
</P>
<P>
However, the real cause of the air accident was not yet known,
although the black box of the ill-fated plane had been recovered.
</P>
<P>
The jet, flying from Manila to Bacolod city in the central part
of the country, overshot the runway and plowed into a busy
commercial area at about 7:45 Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
The plane destroyed some 30 houses and split apart a nightclub.
Three people had been identified dead and the number of the
fatalities may go up.
</P>
<P>
The 121 passengers and six crew members aboard the jet were all
safe although in panic. Some 70 injured including passengers and
people on the ground had been sent to different hospitals.
</P>
<P>

the wing-tips and the engines were sheared off. The engine were
found 200 meters away from where the plane was resting on its
belly.
</P>

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- WTA Tour Chief Executive
Officer Bart McGuire said on Sunday that the women's tour rejects
the men's recent proposal of more joint tournaments.
</P>
<P>
He said in Key Biscayne that he doubted the women would get
equal treatment, and suggested the women's game was better served
in a spotlight of its own, not sharing the stage with the men.
</P>
<P>
ATP Tour Chief Executive Officer Mark Miles was hoping to
increase the number of joint events around the world by seven to
nine tournaments.
</P>
<P>
Not including the four Grand Slam tournaments, there are two
major combined events: last week's at Indian Wells and this week's
Lipton Championships. Three other smaller events also feature
men's and women's play: Sydney, Tokyo and Rosmalen.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Jeremy Wotherspoon of Canada
claimed the World Cup 1,000m title by winning the final races of
the season in Milwaukee, the United States on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Wotherspoon won his fourth race of the season in one minute,
10.76 seconds to finish at 280 points, 30 more than Dutchman Jan
Bos, who finished fifth in 1:11.48.
</P>
<P>
Norway's Adne Sondral, who earlier won his first World Cup
1,000m race of the season in Milwaukee, finished second in
1:11.12, seven-hundredths ahead of third-place Sylvain Bouchard of
Canada. Bouchard finished third in the Cup standings.
</P>
<P>
American Christine Witty won the final women's 1,000m race of
the season in 1:17.08, 32-hundredths ahead of Germany's Sabine
Volker.
</P>
<P>
Canada's Catriona LeMay-Doan grabbed a share of the women's
World Cup season title by finishing third in 1:17.44 -- barely
missing the runner-up finish that would have given her sole
possession of the title.
</P>
<P>
As a result, LeMay-Doan shared the World Cup season crown with
Germany's Franziska Schenk, both with 270 points. Schenk, who did
not race in the finale, won three times this season. LeMay-Doan
won twice.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Germany's SPD Gets Another Boost at Local Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Germany's main opposition Social
Democratic Party (SPD) got another boost to its bid to win the
next German national elections in September this year after
scoring big gains at the municipal elections in the German state
of Schleswig-Holstein Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to preliminary computer projections, the SPD won
about 42.4 percent at the Sunday vote in the northern German state
which borders Denmark, up 2.9 percent from its standing at the
1994 local elections.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the huge victory scored by the SPD just three
weeks ago at the state parliament elections of the neighboring
Lower Saxony state had played a key role in improving the party's
performance at Schleswig-Holstein Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Lower Saxony vote also helped to project its current state
premier Gerhard Schroeder to be the SPD's candidate to challenge
Germany's veteran Chancellor Helmut Kohl in the general elections
on September 27 this year.
</P>
<P>
Kohl's ruling Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party, however,
also managed to report gains at the local vote Sunday by winning
39.1 percent, up 1.6 percent from its 1994 standing.
</P>
<P>
The biggest loser has proved to be the ecologist Greens party
which won just 6.8 percent of the Sunday vote, down 3.5 percentage
points from what it got in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The Greens, which is seeking to form a coalition government
with the SPD in Bonn after the September general elections, has
become increasingly unpopular recently after publishing an
election platform calling for dramatic tax increases to raise the
country's gasoline prices to about five marks (2.7 U.S. dollars)
per liter in 10 years in a bid to protect environments.
</P>
<P>
The Free Democratic Party (FDP), now the junior partner of
Kohl's center-right ruling coalition in Bonn, improved its
performance only modestly by winning 4.8 percent compared with 4.4
percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The FDP has been struggling with a confidence crisis recently
for fears that it could be thrown out of the federal parliament
where parties must win at least 5 percent at the general elections
in order to be seated.

<HEADLINE> Report: Alcohol, Drugs Contribute to Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Nearly half the men and women
on probation in the United States were under the influence of
alcohol or drugs when committing crimes, the Justice Department
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The first national survey of probationers, conducted for the
Bureau of Justice Statistics, found that 46.8 percent of
probationers had used either alcohol, drugs or both at the time of
their offense.
</P>
<P>
This was lower than the figure among incarcerated criminals at
the time of their offenses -- 60 percent; among state prison
inmates, the figure was 49 percent.
</P>
<P>
Among probationers, 40 percent had consumed alcohol when they
committed their crimes and 14 percent used drugs.
</P>
<P>
The number of probationers consuming alcohol at the time of
their offense was comparable to that of jail inmates, 41 percent,
but higher than that of state prisoners, 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
But drug use by probationers during their crime was far below
the figures for jail inmates, 32 percent, or state prisoners, 36
percent.
</P>
<P>
The most commonly used drug was marijuana. Among all
probationers, 67 percent said they had used marijuana or hashish
at least once in their lives. Fewer probationers had used drugs
such as cocaine, stimulants, hallucinogens, barbiturates, heroin
or other opiates.
</P>
<P>
Of all probationers, 35 percent admitted they had at least once
consumed as much as a fifth of a gallon of alcohol in one day --
the equivalent of three six-packs of beer or three bottles of
wine.
</P>
<P>
According to the most recent data, there were nearly 3.2
million adults on probation as of December 31, 1996 -- double the
1.6 million adults incarcerated.
</P>
<P>
Probation is used as a lesser penalty than imprisonment, for
less serious crimes or criminals with no or few prior convictions.
Very rarely does a sentence in such cases include prison time,
followed by probation.

<HEADLINE> Egypt-Qatar Summit to Mend Ties: Qatari Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The upcoming summit between Qatari
Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al-Thani and Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak will help mend the bilateral ties, Qatari ambassador
in Cairo said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will improve the political and economic ties of the
two countries and enrich the assets of their historical relations,
Manei Abdel Hadi Al Hageri said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The Qatari emir is expected to arrive here on Monday. His visit
is also part of the continued consultation and coordination with
Mubarak, Hageri said.
</P>
<P>
Hamad's Egyptian trip is widely viewed as a fence-mending
effort.
</P>
<P>
The relations of the two Arab countries soured in 1996 when
Qatar alleged Egyptian involvement in a failed coup.
</P>
<P>
The ties got worsened after Cairo boycotted the Middle East and
North Africa Economic Conference hosted by Doha last November and
its expulsion of Egyptian laborers.
</P>
<P>
A summit meeting mediated by Saudi King Fahd between Hamad and
Mubarak at the end of last year failed to bridge the gap between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
But a thaw has seemed to set in the relations after the two
sides signed an agreement earlier this month to allow Egyptian
laborers back to finish their contract terms in Qatar.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Government to Continue Fight Against Islamic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz and his coalition partners decided to continue their fight
against Islamic fundamentalism after a five-hour meeting Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made after a meeting held among Yilmaz, also
Chairman of Turkey's Motherland Party (ANAP), Left Democratic
Party (DSP) leader and Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit and
head of Democratic Turkey Party (DPT) Husamettin Cindoruk Sunday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The coalition leaders discussed a statement issued Friday by
the Turkish Armed Forces, which attacked Yilmaz's recent remarks
on the military, and decided to try to defuse the tensions with
the military over the crack down on the Islamic fundamentalism.
</P>
<P>
The National Security Council was expected to discuss the
dispute between the military and the government on March 27.
</P>
<P>
In a strongly worded statement issued Friday, the military,
which considers itself the guarantor of Turkey's secular system,
warned Yilmaz that it would continue its fight against Islamic
fundamentalism.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz recently warned the Turkish generals against meddling in
government affairs. "I didn't order the army to fight against
fundamentalism. The military should tend to its own business," he
said on Tuesday.
