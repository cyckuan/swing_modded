NO GOOD TECH PROFIT GOES UNPUNISHED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The irony of this week's plunge by the Nasdaq
index was the New Economy market getting a dose of the Old Economy
market's medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Investors committed to traditional value plays have found to
their recent dismay that no good profit goes unpunished on Wall
Street. Even respectable performances by Old Economy blue-chippers
get hammered by money managers when otherwise respectable profits
are only a tad under expectations.
</P>
<P>
   This week, however, the Dow Jones industrial average recovered
spectacularly from a near-death experience, while Nasdaq struggled
to keep from going into a death spiral. The Dow was up almost 820
points Wednesday and Thursday, while Thursday's 135-point gain in
the Nasdaq recovered about 30 percent of what it lost the first
three days of the week.
</P>
<P>
   A snapshot from Wednesday's trading was perhaps a telling
example of how dramatically the tables have been turned. The
venerable financial institution and Dow component J.P. Morgan,
valued at only 11 times earnings, rose 6 percent. Across the way at
Nasdaq, techno-darling Yahoo, which was trading at 1,600 times its
earnings, saw its stock fall 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Was this turnabout a sign that fundamentals are catching up with
New Economy stocks? Not so as you can tell. The tech-laden Nasdaq
swooned even as one of its strongest components, Oracle, reported a
good profit gain. The Dow's pyrotechnics, meantime, have come in
the absence of any extraordinary revelations. Because most Dow
companies are the same sound enterprises they were last week, their
resurgence could be a sign that value is back in vogue.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq's 466-point clobbering from Monday to Wednesday was a
loss of more than 9 percent from Friday's record 5,049 close, and
Thursday's rebound came just in time to avoid a descent into
correction territory.
</P>
<P>
   Could Nasdaq's rocky week signal a leak in the high-tech bubble?
It's too early to tell, but the abrupt sell-off may mean investors
have begun to heed warnings about the dangers of speculation. Thus,
it may not represent the buying opportunity other Nasdaq market
breaks have offered.
</P>
<P>
   This high-tech stock slide extends far beyond America. Markets
in Asia and Europe as well have seen their tech sector battered
this week. Hong Kong's top securities regulator was prompted
Wednesday to echo recent warnings by his U.S. counterpart,
exhorting investors to evaluate profitability prospects before
buying a ompany's stock.
</P>
<P>
   One seeming anomaly may be instructive. Seven of Nasdaq's 10
most active issues Wednesday were up. This may be meaningful
considering how Nasdaq's dramatic rise in recent years has been
fueled by relatively few stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Although Nasdaq comprises almost 4,800 stocks, only 35 accounted
for three-quarters of last year's 85 percent gain. Because some of
those premiere issues were prominent gainers Wednesday, this could
signal further weakening of the rest of the index's stocks.
</P>
<P>
   If so, the speculative dot-com mania could be winding down even
as Nasdaq's best companies remain good investments. The strength of
Nasdaq's leadership has more than made up for its narrowness. This
week's message may be that Nasdaq's structural weakness has become
too severe to be masked by the high-flying fortunes of a handful of
its components.

GAS IMPACT ON BUDGETS FAR EASIER THAN IN '80S 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LIDIA KELLY  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Drivers who see only rising gas prices ahead are forgetting to
look in the rear-view mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Current prices are only 56 per cent of their level from the
early 1980s after adjusting for infla tion.
</P>
<P>
   Even more significant, the hit on our pocketbooks is much gen
tler than it was two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, 15 gallons of gas cost $20, 10 percent of the average
weekly per capita income of $200 in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Arizonans paid the same amount for gas but spent
only 4.5 percent of their income.
</P>
<P>
   ``Energy costs are a smaller portion of total costs than they
were in the '80s,'' said Tracy Clark, associate director of the
Arizona State University Eco nomic Outlook Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of expanding auto mation in our lives, there have been
more efficiencies making people less sensitive to energy prices
than 20 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, with gas prices hitting an all-time high in Arizona this
week, some perspective on gas prices may do little to cool angry
motorists.
</P>
<P>
   For the second time in less than a month, a convoy of inde
pendent truckers rolled through the streets of the nation's capital
Thursday, seeking relief from fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate cause of higher prices has been the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Coun tries' year-old decision to cut
production, after the cartel suf fered several years of low prices.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been soaring oil prices that have hit consumers
on all sides: higher airfares, higher prices to deliver FedEx
packages, and even lower prices for their stock investments.
</P>
<P>
   But why is gas in Tucson an average 3 cents a gallon higher than
in Phoenix? Car owners in the state's rural areas pay an average
$1.65 a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   George Gaspar, who has fol lowed the petroleum industry for
decades at Milwaukee-based Rob ert W. Baird &AMP; Co., said differ
ences in sticker prices at the pumps are spurred by four fac tors:
</P>
<P>
   Competition: The more gas stations in the neighborhood, the
greater the likelihood of lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   Storage capacity: Some stations have larger storage tanks, which
means they can stock more gas that they pur chased at lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   Refineries: Some that supply gasoline have higher wholesale
prices than others.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation costs: The far ther the fuel travels from a
refinery, the higher the price at the pump. That doesn't hold true
for a place like San Francisco, whose higher cost of living can
cels out the lower price of fuel from nearby refineries.
</P>
<P>
   The disparity between Phoenix and Tucson prices shows the impact
of refineries, said Paul Oves, vice president for public affairs at
Tosco, which owns 350 Circle K convenience stores in Arizona, most
of which operate a gas station.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Tucson had lower prices than Phoenix, Oves said,
because Phoenix is supplied by California refineries and Tuc son by
western Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Some California refineries have been hit by fires that de pleted
their holdings, resulting in higher prices. Texas suppliers have
been operating smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   Now, when the shortage has touched all parts of the country,
competition has taken over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suppliers are much more ag gressive in Phoenix than in Tuc
son,'' Oves said. ``(The disparities) are strictly a function of
the competitive nature of the market.''
</P>
<P>
   The remote stations in the rural areas suffer the most. Gas
sellers pay a price that is im posed by the jobbers, or delivery
companies, to which they have to add at least 3 to 5 cents to cover
fixed costs.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the demand for fuel has not decreased, said Bruce John
son, director of external affairs at Atlantic Richfield Co..
</P>
<P>
   He added that after the March 27 meeting of OPEC, gas prices
should go down. But it may take awhile before lower numbers reach
the pump.
</P>
<P>
   The reduction in supply had caused the oil companies to draw on
their inventories, bringing them down by 15 percent from a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Daily consumption in the United States exceeds import and
domestic production by 600,000 barrels a day, approximately the
monthly fuel usage in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Even if OPEC decides to in crease its production, the oil will
go first to rebuild inventories, which could take three months
under the most optimistic sce nario, Gaspar said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's pretty difficult be cause everybody else in the world
is scrambling for oil,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Only after inventories are be ing rebuilt would street prices
start to fall significantly.
</P>
<P>
   If crude oil prices, now float ing above $30 a barrel, fell to
$25 to $26, gas prices should drop by about 12 cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then you need to remem ber that summer is coming and the
demand will increase,'' Gas par said. ``So, the earliest prices may
start coming down is early fall.'' &QL;

HMOS WARN OF HIGHER PREMIUMS

<P>
   HMOs went on the attack Thursday, warning that health care costs
in Arizona will skyrocket and coverage will suffer if consumers are
given the right to sue their health plans.
</P>
<P>
   Executives of Humana, PacifiCare and Blue Cross and Blue Shield
of Arizona made the dire predictions after three HMOs agreed
Wednesday to support a right-to-sue provision that could be
introduced Monday in the Arizona Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's a bad policy,'' said Geoff Jaroch, a spokesman
for PacifiCare, which estimates that premium costs for the HMO's
members would climb 4 percent to cover the health provider's
anticipated legal liability.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't feel it brings any value to employers or their
employees who would pay for it,'' said Humana President William J.
Howard, adding that premiums for Humana's 85,000 members could jump
10 percent to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross/Blue Shield opposes liability protections for
consumers as a public policy issue. It would support a compromise
over such legislation if an appeals process for resolving
consumers' concerns remained mandatory, said Richard Hannon, the
health plan's senior vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers leading the fight for a right-to-sue provision were
rankled by the HMOs' efforts to sink the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a blatant last-minute attempt to sabotage a reasonable
agreement that will bring more protections to the consumer,'' said
Rep. John Verkamp, R-Flagstaff.
</P>
<P>
   The HMOs were using ``scare tactics'' to convince lawmakers that
costs would climb well beyond the 4.5 percent estimate that the
plans initially suggested, said Sen. Ann Day, R-Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Intergroup, Cigna and United Healthcare struck a
deal with the Arizona Trial Lawyers Association opening the door
for a right-to-sue amendment to be added to House Bill 2600. The
amendment would allow Arizonans in employer-sponsored group health
plans to sue their health maintenance organizations, with the
option of bypassing a system for appealing HMO decisions.

</P>
<P>
   Intergroup and United Healthcare signed on to the agreement
because consumers say they want more accountability from plans they
pay into. Cigna didn't comment.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers who sue an HMO would have to show that the health plan
acted in bad faith in denying or delaying a claim. The idea is to
steer consumers away from lawsuits and into the appeals system,
where about half of all disputes are resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Other HMO executives cited concerns over a March 9 Joint
Legislative Budget Committee report on the financial impact of
HB2600. Cost estimates prepared a year ago for the Arizona
Department of Administration said it would cost the state $31.2
million in 2002 to renegotiate employee health contracts to include
services mandated under the wide-ranging bill.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jane Hull is concerned about the cost of HB2600 on state
health contracts, spokeswoman Francie Noyes said.
</P>
<P>
   Delaying the effective date of a new law could help lessen the
state's financial impact, if such a measure became law.
</P>
<P>
   Hull, who hasn't committed to signing or vetoing the bill and a
right-to-sue amendment, would prefer to see such legislation
require that the appeals process be exhausted before a lawsuit
could be filed, Noyes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are her concerns, but this doesn't mean she will sign
it,'' Noyes added. &QL;

BMW TO ABANDON ROVER CARS AND SELL LAND ROVER TO FORD

<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Six years and nearly $6 billion after
buying the Rover Group, BMW of Germany abandoned the British
automaker Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   BMW essentially gave Rover's money-losing car business to a
little-known group of British investors. And it negotiated a deal
to sell the Land Rover line of sport utility vehicles to Ford Motor
Co. for just under $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really can't think of a better group of brands and products
than the Land Rover Group,'' Jacques Nasser, Ford's chief
executive, said at Ford's headquarters in Dearborn, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Ford already owns another venerable British brand, Jaguar, and
Nasser said that Jaguar and Land Rover dealers worldwide would
probably team up to sell more of both brands. ``We've always
referred to the Range Rover as the Jaguar of off-road vehicles,''
Nasser said. ``They fit together in a showroom very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's moves by BMW marked a retreat from a strategy of
getting bigger and broader, at a time that rivals around the world
are merging and forming alliances.
</P>
<P>
   The ownership upheavals came as a shock to Rover's 30,000
workers in Britain as well as to the British government, which has
been hoping to salvage one of Rover's main factories with a
taxpayer subsidy of around $220 million.
</P>
<P>
   BMW, based in Munich, bought Rover in 1994 in the hope of
expanding beyond its market for luxury vehicles and of keeping up
with larger competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The steps Thursday represented a reversal for BMW and more
uncertainty for Rover's workers, whose new boss will be Alchemy
Partners, an investor group that includes a former Rover executive,
Kevin Morley.
</P>
<P>
   Because nearly half of BMW's shares are controlled by the Quandt
family of Germany, which has so far rejected all overtures, BMW's
independence seemed assured for now. But analysts say the pressures
are increasing. Volvo of Sweden sold its car business last year to
Ford. And earlier this week, the Agnelli family of Italy agreed to
sell 20 percent of Fiat to General Motors.
</P>
<P>
   Though BMW did not disclose the terms, Alchemy Partners is
expected to pay little, if any, money up front, and BMW will assume
many of Rover's debts.
</P>
<P>
   BMW said the expense of shedding the Rover car business would
cost about 3.15 billion euros, or $3.06 billion. As a result, BMW
will report an annual loss of about $2.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   BMW was officially silent Thursday on the future of Land Rover,
the profitable and growing sport utility business, but was expected
to announce the deal on Friday. Nasser discussed the deal with
reporters gathered in Dearborn Thursday after the boards of Ford
and the BMW Group approved a memorandum of understanding on the
sale.
</P>
<P>
   The jettisoning of Rover came as a relief to the parent
company's investors, who have viewed the British car line as a
black hole for money.
</P>
<P>
   Rover lost more than $1 billion in 1998 and $1.2 billion in
1999. Its annual car sales plunged 24.9 percent last year, to
251,000 vehicles.

 FRANKFURT, Germany: 251,000 vehicles.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In further fallout from the Rover developments, BMW dismissed
three of its top executives, the second big boardroom shake-up in
13 months. The three executives, responsible respectively for
marketing, production and research and development, had been named
to the board in February 1999 and were supposed to oversee the
integration of Rover and BMW.
</P>
<P>
   Joachim Millberg, who became chief executive after the ouster
last year of Bernd Pischetsrieder, appears to have been the main
architect of Thursday's moves and will remain.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Reitman, an automobile analyst in London with Merrill
Lynch, said Thursday that BMW's future would be brighter now that
it has freed itself from Rover. ``It has a massive effect on BMW,
in the sense that it removes a significant problem,'' Reitman said.
But he added, ``What it doesn't answer is the issue they themselves
have been talking about _ the need for scale.''
</P>
<P>
   Excluding Rover, BMW's profit margins are the highest of any car
manufacturer in the world except for Porsche. Reitman estimated
BMW's profit margin at 12 or 13 percent, based on American rather
than German accounting standards. By contrast, he said, the
Mercedes business of DaimlerChrysler has a profit margin around 8.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   But BMW faces assaults in the luxury market from the Audi unit
of Volkswagen AG, Volvo and Jaguar, owned by Ford; and of course,
DaimlerChrysler.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts are skeptical that sheer size is the basis of
success. But large size can make it easier to distribute research
and development costs over more vehicles and achieve economies of
scale.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal announced Thursday, Alchemy will take over
Rover's unprofitable line of midpriced sedans, including the more
expensive Rover 75, and will acquire Rover's big factory at
Longbridge, near Birmingham, which has been in danger of closing
for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of trying to build smaller cars through Rover, BMW will
revive a strategy it discarded years ago and design a new line of
cheaper cars under the BMW brand. That is a reversal: BMW
executives have strenuously argued that they did not want to
``stretch'' their prized brand with cars that sell too cheap.
</P>
<P>
   In an odd twist, BMW indicated that it would also give Alchemy
Partners the line of Mini subcompacts produced by Rover. Yet it
said it would retain the redesigned ``new Mini'' that is due out
later this year.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear exactly what will happen to Rover, but there were
signs Thursday that it would disappear as a brand name. In a
statement Thursday, Alchemy Partners said it would reintroduce
Rover as the MG Car Co. _ adopting the MG marque acquired years ago
by Rover's owner then, British Leyland.
</P>
<P>
   Under BMW's previous chief executive, Pischetsrieder, the
company committed itself to becoming bigger and capable of
competing in the largest and fastest-growing segment of the market
_ medium-priced mass-market cars. But the plan turned disastrous.
The rising value of the British pound, in relation to the falling
euro, made British cars expensive in Continental Europe and open to
competition from Volkswagen and GM's Opel subsidiary. Rover also
failed to reduce its costs and the size of its labor force. On top
of all that, its midsize car models suffered declining popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Though many experts said the sale of Rover was overdue, some
analysts contend that BMW and the Quandt family were so concerned
with protecting their independence that they missed opportunities.
``It is the Quandts' biggest mistake,'' said Markus Pluemer, an
analyst with WestLB Research in Duesseldorf.
</P>
<P>
   ``G.M. or Ford would have been willing to pay an enormous
premium for Rover,'' Pluemer said. Had BMW been willing to trade
off 20 percent of its shares, he added, it could have preserved its
independence, raised billions in extra capital and tapped the
expertise of companies already making mass-market cars.
</P>
<P>
   Georg Stuerzer, an analyst at Hypovereinsbank in Munich, said
BMW could navigate on its own. Noting that shares of
DaimlerChrysler had plunged in the last year, Stuerzer argued that
BMW may have been well advised to focus on luxury cars. ``The
experience of Porsche gives us an indication,'' he said. ``If size
were indicative of operating margins, then Porsche should have the
lowest margins in the industry. But it has the highest.''

NEW RAFT TO PLY COLORADO
 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by N.Y. Times News Service

 By PETER CORBETT
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic 
<TEXT>
<P>
   An electric-powered raft will surge into white water next month
in a test run to silence critics of motorboats in the Grand Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   For more than two decades, environ mentalists have clashed with
com mercial river outfitters in a noisy debate over oar-power vs.
motors of any kind.
</P>
<P>
   And the ruckus isn't likely to end soon, despite outfitters
experiment ing with quieter, pollution-free elec tric motors and
switching from two-stroke internal combustion en gines, which spew
more fumes and oil, to four-stroke engines.
</P>
<P>
   An electric-powered raft will depart April 3 from Lees Ferry for
the 275-mile trip down the Colorado River.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's progress, but it's still not a wilderness experience
when you have a motor getting you through there,'' said Rob Smith,
Sierra Club South west staff director.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Club, Grand Canyon Trust and other environmental groups
want to rid the Canyon of motorized rafts, which carry the bulk of
river runners.
</P>
<P>
   Outfitters say they need motors to ease congestion and to give
time-strapped passengers a chance to see the entire stretch of
river in a week, half the time of an oar trip.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the divisive issue has long-term implications for
the Can yon, wilderness protection, the $25 million-a-year
river-running in dustry and Arizona tourism in gen eral.
</P>
<P>
   Braving the Colorado's white water to raft through the mile-deep
geolog ical wonderland is one of America's premier outdoor
adventures.
</P>
<P>
   Grand Canyon National Park offi cials recently backed off the
issue because there was no consensus on a solution, said Maureen
Oltrogge, a National Park Service spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The service recommended eliminat ing motors in 1979, but
Congress halted the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the service shelved efforts to revise a plan to
address motor use and a controversy over private vs. commercial
river-use per mits.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen commercial river companies, half based in Arizona,
carried 19,090 passengers through the Canyon last year, said Mark
Grisham of Grand Canyon River Outfitters Association.
</P>
<P>
   Motorized rafts carried about 77 percent of them at an average
price of $218 per day, he said. Oar trips cost $215.
</P>
<P>
   Motors allow the outfitters to run the river at different speeds
so the boats aren't all bunched together, Grisham said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith of the Sierra Club argues that outfitters prefer motors
because it allows them to ``pump a lot of people through the Grand
Canyon.''
</P>
<P>
   Outfitters bristle at the criticism. They consider themselves
environ mentalists who have worked for decades on protection of the
river.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Seyler of Phoenix-based Ari zona River Runners Inc. says
the opposition is coming from ``right-wing-type environmental
groups.''
</P>
<P>
   He points to the voluntary conver sion to four-stroke engines
and, ultimately, electric motors, as indica tive of the outfitters'
commitment to reducing noise and emissions.
</P>
<P>
   Grisham said Canyon outfitters have converted 85 percent of
their engines to four-stroke and will complete the switch next
year, costing about $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Next month's test will involve a second-generation electric
motor mounted on a 36-foot raft. Grisham said a diesel generator
will recharge batteries for the motor, which puts out the
equivalent of 21 horsepower, about a third less powerful than the
standard four-stroke engine.
</P>
<P>
   Recharging the batteries is the weak link in the system. The
outfitters association is pursuing development of fuel cells that
could ultimately power the boats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The driving motivation is to see if technology can help us
solve the noise issue,'' Grisham said, adding that the outfitters
want to be ``good neighbors in the Canyon.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, it may be up to Congress to settle the issue as part
of wilder ness designation for the Canyon, said Oltrogge of the
Park Service.

AFTER 50 YEARS, DEVELOPER BARNEY KARBANK'S STRATEGY STILL STANDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK P. COUCH  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Real estate developer Barney Karbank doesn't
waste his good fortune at casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Karbank's luck, like his money, is too valuable to throw at
slots.
</P>
<P>
   So when Karbank's children treated him and his wife to a 50th
wedding anniversary celebration last December in Las Vegas, Karbank
bet a measly 25 cents, won $20 and stopped when the winnings were
gone.
</P>
<P>
   It's a safe bet that Karbank doesn't waste profits from small
wagers that pay off big. He usually heads straight to the bank.
</P>
<P>
   At 76, Karbank has been helping shape Kansas City for one-third
of the city's life _ developing property in all corners of town,
helping assemble the ground for the Truman Sports Complex, serving
on the Kansas City Plan Commission.
</P>
<P>
   For five decades, Karbank has survived the booms and busts of
real estate with a simple strategy: build and hold.
</P>
<P>
   Karbank occasionally buys a building, rarely sells and never
refinances a property once it's paid off. He has never lost a
parcel to foreclosure, he said, nor has he sold one to avoid a
creditor's noose.
</P>
<P>
   His office near the top of One Kansas City Place lets him survey
vast chunks of the property he has developed over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's at the top of the industrial real estate market heap in
Kansas City,'' said Roger Cohen, a former Karbank partner who now
heads his own firm.
</P>
<P>
   Even outsiders recognize that Karbank sits at the summit of
Kansas City's market.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when New York real estate and gambling impresario
Donald Trump was considering the purchase of the Flamingo Hilton
Casino, he asked Karbank to join the venture. The boat sits at the
edge of a Karbank property, one of more than 100 totaling several
million square feet.
</P>
<P>
   As with his recent trip to Vegas, Karbank didn't risk much with
Trump, passing on the offer. Karbank said he preferred to focus on
the warehouses and production plants he rents to other companies.
</P>
<P>
   But visiting Trump's lofty New York offices capped a remarkable
journey for Karbank, the son of a fish market operator.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started without money, without education, without family
connections,'' said Karbank, who uses a cane because of a childhood
bout with polio.
</P>
<P>
   Karbank's father urged young Barney to consider the real estate
business after noticing that customers who were developers wore the
best clothes and drove the nicest cars.
</P>
<P>
   So he became an unpaid clerk for James B. Welsh Realty. In 1947
he joined Charles F. Curry Co., where he learned such niceties of
the trade as pushing brooms, running errands and selling houses.
</P>
<P>
   For Karbank, the experience was an education in what he didn't
want to do, and he vowed to find a corner of the business that was
a better fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided I wanted to own buildings that were as passive as
possible, and that was mostly industrial properties,'' Karbank
said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1950 he paid $25 for a desk and a swivel chair in Curry's
office and started B.A. Karbank &AMP; Co. He was 26 years old.
</P>
<P>
   He traveled to a conference in Chicago in 1952 that helped set
the course of his career. At the meeting he met Trammell Crow, a
budding legend in real estate circles, and had dinner with another
developer, Max Phillipson, whose bullish outlook revved Karbank's
ethic of hard work.
</P>
<P>
   Back in his hotel room that night, Karbank couldn't sleep, so he
flipped through the pages of the Saturday Evening Post. Gazing at
an advertisement for Borg-Warner Corp., Karbank noticed that the
company was next door to the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning he made a cold call on Borg-Warner executives,
offering to construct a building for the company's Kansas City
operation. The Borg-Warner executives said they had decided the
previous day to proceed with a Kansas City expansion.
</P>
<P>
   They sent Karbank back to Kansas City to meet a local
Borg-Warner employee. Back home, another coincidence: that
Borg-Warner official remembered attending third grade with Karbank.
</P>
<P>
   Luck and hard work paid off. Karbank constructed his first
building _ a structure at 2615 Holmes St. He charged Borg-Warner
$410 a month on a 12-year lease. The first $400 covered the
mortgage payment and $10 paid for a life insurance policy to pay
the mortgage in case he died.
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't a profit in that deal. But Karbank still owns the
building and rents it for at least $2,500 a month _ long after
paying off the debt.
</P>
<P>
   The build-and-hold strategy lets him drive a Mercedes and run
his real estate company like a bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of lending people dollars, we're lending people bricks
and mortar,'' Karbank said.
</P>
<P>
   While other developers borrow money against properties, Karbank
has used his leverage to build relationships with tenants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not merchant builders,'' Karbank said. ``If you're going
to come to the dance with us, you're going to leave the dance with
us.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, General Electric Co. rented space from Karbank but
concluded that the property didn't fit its needs. Karbank said he
let the company out of its lease without a penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Karbank said he could afford to let General Electric off the
hook because lease payments from other properties could bridge the
gap while he sought a new tenant. It also put him in good graces
with General Electric, which now occupies several Karbank-owned
properties.
</P>
<P>
   General Electric has been an important relationship that Karbank
has nurtured for decades.
</P>
<P>
   One of his original GE contacts resulted from a death-defying
visit to the doctor nearly 25 years ago when he had an allergic
reaction to an iodine solution used in a kidney test.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a violent reaction,'' Karbank said. ``They really
thought I was a goner.''
</P>
<P>
   The physician revived Karbank, ``but he was so concerned he sat
there with me until I came back to life,'' Karbank said.
</P>
<P>
   In the conversation that followed, the doctor offered to
introduce Karbank to a GE division manager who was coming to town.
Karbank accepted the offer, which eventually led to a deal with
General Electric.
</P>
<P>
   Such constant deal making _ even at death's door _ doesn't
surprise colleagues in the industry. Veteran Kansas City developer
Chuck Hunter simply said, ``It's in his blood.''

HMOS WARN OF HIGHER PREMIUMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DELLA DE LAFUENTE  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HMOs went on the attack Thursday, warning that health care costs
in Arizona will skyrocket and coverage will suffer if consumers are
given the right to sue their health plans.
</P>
<P>
   Executives of Humana, PacifiCare and Blue Cross and Blue Shield
of Arizona made the dire predictions after three HMOs agreed
Wednesday to support a right-to-sue provision that could be
introduced Monday in the Arizona Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's a bad policy,'' said Geoff Jaroch, a spokesman
for PacifiCare, which estimates that premium costs for the HMO's
members would climb 4 percent to cover the health provider's
anticipated legal liability.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't feel it brings any value to employers or their
employees who would pay for it,'' said Humana President William J.
Howard, adding that premiums for Humana's 85,000 members could jump
10 percent to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross/Blue Shield opposes liability protections for
consumers as a public policy issue. It would support a compromise
over such legislation if an appeals process for resolving
consumers' concerns remained mandatory, said Richard Hannon, the
health plan's senior vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers leading the fight for a right-to-sue provision were
rankled by the HMOs' efforts to sink the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a blatant last-minute attempt to sabotage a reasonable
agreement that will bring more protections to the consumer,'' said
Rep. John Verkamp, R-Flagstaff.
</P>
<P>
   The HMOs were using ``scare tactics'' to convince lawmakers that
costs would climb well beyond the 4.5 percent estimate that the
plans initially suggested, said Sen. Ann Day, R-Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Intergroup, Cigna and United Healthcare struck a
deal with the Arizona Trial Lawyers Association opening the door
for a right-to-sue amendment to be added to House Bill 2600. The
amendment would allow Arizonans in employer-sponsored group health
plans to sue their health maintenance organizations, with the
option of bypassing a system for appealing HMO decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Intergroup and United Healthcare signed on to the agreement
because consumers say they want more accountability from plans they
pay into. Cigna didn't comment.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers who sue an HMO would have to show that the health plan
acted in bad faith in denying or delaying a claim. The idea is to
steer consumers away from lawsuits and into the appeals system,
where about half of all disputes are resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Other HMO executives cited concerns over a March 9 Joint
Legislative Budget Committee report on the financial impact of
HB2600. Cost estimates prepared a year ago for the Arizona
Department of Administration said it would cost the state $31.2
million in 2002 to renegotiate employee health contracts to include
services mandated under the wide-ranging bill.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jane Hull is concerned about the cost of HB2600 on state
health contracts, spokeswoman Francie Noyes said.
</P>
<P>
   Delaying the effective date of a new law could help lessen the
state's financial impact, if such a measure became law.
</P>
<P>
   Hull, who hasn't committed to signing or vetoing the bill and a
right-to-sue amendment, would prefer to see such legislation
require that the appeals process be exhausted before a lawsuit
could be filed, Noyes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are her concerns, but this doesn't mean she will sign
it,'' Noyes added. &QL;

GAS IMPACT ON BUDGETS FAR EASIER THAN IN '80S 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LIDIA KELLY  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Drivers who see only rising gas prices ahead are forgetting to
look in the rear-view mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Current prices are only 56 per cent of their level from the
early 1980s after adjusting for infla tion.
</P>
<P>
   Even more significant, the hit on our pocketbooks is much gen
tler than it was two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, 15 gallons of gas cost $20, 10 percent of the average
weekly per capita income of $200 in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Arizonans paid the same amount for gas but spent
only 4.5 percent of their income.
</P>
<P>
   ``Energy costs are a smaller portion of total costs than they
were in the '80s,'' said Tracy Clark, associate director of the
Arizona State University Eco nomic Outlook Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of expanding auto mation in our lives, there have been
more efficiencies making people less sensitive to energy prices
than 20 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, with gas prices hitting an all-time high in Arizona this
week, some perspective on gas prices may do little to cool angry
motorists.
</P>
<P>
   For the second time in less than a month, a convoy of inde
pendent truckers rolled through the streets of the nation's capital
Thursday, seeking relief from fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate cause of higher prices has been the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Coun tries' year-old decision to cut
production, after the cartel suf fered several years of low prices.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been soaring oil prices that have hit consumers
on all sides: higher airfares, higher prices to deliver FedEx
packages, and even lower prices for their stock investments.
</P>
<P>
   But why is gas in Tucson an average 3 cents a gallon higher than
in Phoenix? Car owners in the state's rural areas pay an average
$1.65 a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   George Gaspar, who has fol lowed the petroleum industry for
decades at Milwaukee-based Rob ert W. Baird &AMP; Co., said differ
ences in sticker prices at the pumps are spurred by four fac tors:
</P>
<P>
   Competition: The more gas stations in the neighborhood, the
greater the likelihood of lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   Storage capacity: Some stations have larger storage tanks, which
means they can stock more gas that they pur chased at lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   Refineries: Some that supply gasoline have higher wholesale
prices than others.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation costs: The far ther the fuel travels from a
refinery, the higher the price at the pump. That doesn't hold true
for a place like San Francisco, whose higher cost of living can
cels out the lower price of fuel from nearby refineries.
</P>
<P>
   The disparity between Phoenix and Tucson prices shows the impact
of refineries, said Paul Oves, vice president for public affairs at
Tosco, which owns 350 Circle K convenience stores in Arizona, most
of which operate a gas station.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Tucson had lower prices than Phoenix, Oves said,
because Phoenix is supplied by California refineries and Tuc son by
western Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Some California refineries have been hit by fires that de pleted
their holdings, resulting in higher prices. Texas suppliers have
been operating smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   Now, when the shortage has touched all parts of the country,
competition has taken over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suppliers are much more ag gressive in Phoenix than in Tuc
son,'' Oves said. ``(The disparities) are strictly a function of
the competitive nature of the market.''
</P>
<P>
   The remote stations in the rural areas suffer the most. Gas
sellers pay a price that is im posed by the jobbers, or delivery
companies, to which they have to add at least 3 to 5 cents to cover
fixed costs.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the demand for fuel has not decreased, said Bruce John
son, director of external affairs at Atlantic Richfield Co..
</P>
<P>
   He added that after the March 27 meeting of OPEC, gas prices
should go down. But it may take awhile before lower numbers reach
the pump.
</P>
<P>
   The reduction in supply had caused the oil companies to draw on
their inventories, bringing them down by 15 percent from a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Daily consumption in the United States exceeds import and
domestic production by 600,000 barrels a day, approximately the
monthly fuel usage in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Even if OPEC decides to in crease its production, the oil will
go first to rebuild inventories, which could take three months
under the most optimistic sce nario, Gaspar said.
</P>
<P>

GAS IMPACT ON BUDGETS FAR EASIER THAN IN '80S 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LIDIA KELLY  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Drivers who see only rising gas prices ahead are forgetting to
look in the rear-view mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Current prices are only 56 per cent of their level from the
early 1980s after adjusting for infla tion.
</P>
<P>
   Even more significant, the hit on our pocketbooks is much gen
tler than it was two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, 15 gallons of gas cost $20, 10 percent of the average
weekly per capita income of $200 in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Arizonans paid the same amount for gas but spent
only 4.5 percent of their income.
</P>
<P>
   ``Energy costs are a smaller portion of total costs than they
were in the '80s,'' said Tracy Clark, associate director of the
Arizona State University Eco nomic Outlook Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of expanding auto mation in our lives, there have been
more efficiencies making people less sensitive to energy prices
than 20 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, with gas prices hitting an all-time high in Arizona this
week, some perspective on gas prices may do little to cool angry
motorists.
</P>
<P>
   For the second time in less than a month, a convoy of inde
pendent truckers rolled through the streets of the nation's capital
Thursday, seeking relief from fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate cause of higher prices has been the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Coun tries' year-old decision to cut
production, after the cartel suf fered several years of low prices.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been soaring oil prices that have hit consumers
on all sides: higher airfares, higher prices to deliver FedEx
packages, and even lower prices for their stock investments.
</P>
<P>
   But why is gas in Tucson an average 3 cents a gallon higher than
in Phoenix? Car owners in the state's rural areas pay an average
$1.65 a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   George Gaspar, who has fol lowed the petroleum industry for
decades at Milwaukee-based Rob ert W. Baird &AMP; Co., said differ
ences in sticker prices at the pumps are spurred by four fac tors:
</P>
<P>
   Competition: The more gas stations in the neighborhood, the
greater the likelihood of lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   Storage capacity: Some stations have larger storage tanks, which
means they can stock more gas that they pur chased at lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   Refineries: Some that supply gasoline have higher wholesale
prices than others.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation costs: The far ther the fuel travels from a
refinery, the higher the price at the pump. That doesn't hold true
for a place like San Francisco, whose higher cost of living can
cels out the lower price of fuel from nearby refineries.
</P>
<P>
   The disparity between Phoenix and Tucson prices shows the impact
of refineries, said Paul Oves, vice president for public affairs at
Tosco, which owns 350 Circle K convenience stores in Arizona, most
of which operate a gas station.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Tucson had lower prices than Phoenix, Oves said,
because Phoenix is supplied by California refineries and Tuc son by
western Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Some California refineries have been hit by fires that de pleted
their holdings, resulting in higher prices. Texas suppliers have
been operating smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   Now, when the shortage has touched all parts of the country,
competition has taken over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suppliers are much more ag gressive in Phoenix than in Tuc
son,'' Oves said. ``(The disparities) are strictly a function of
the competitive nature of the market.''
</P>
<P>
   The remote stations in the rural areas suffer the most. Gas
sellers pay a price that is im posed by the jobbers, or delivery
companies, to which they have to add at least 3 to 5 cents to cover
fixed costs.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the demand for fuel has not decreased, said Bruce John
son, director of external affairs at Atlantic Richfield Co..
</P>
<P>
   He added that after the March 27 meeting of OPEC, gas prices
should go down. But it may take awhile before lower numbers reach
the pump.
</P>
<P>
   The reduction in supply had caused the oil companies to draw on
their inventories, bringing them down by 15 percent from a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Daily consumption in the United States exceeds import and
domestic production by 600,000 barrels a day, approximately the
monthly fuel usage in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Even if OPEC decides to in crease its production, the oil will
go first to rebuild inventories, which could take three months
under the most optimistic sce nario, Gaspar said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's pretty difficult be cause everybody else in the world
is scrambling for oil,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Only after inventories are be ing rebuilt would street prices
start to fall significantly.
</P>
<P>
   If crude oil prices, now float ing above $30 a barrel, fell to
$25 to $26, gas prices should drop by about 12 cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then you need to remem ber that summer is coming and the
demand will increase,'' Gas par said. ``So, the earliest prices may
start coming down is early fall.'' &QL;

WOMEN PLEAD GUILTY TO $1.58 EMBEZZLEMENT FROM BANK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOYCE SMITH  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Two former employees at a Westport bank
facility pleaded guilty Thursday to a decade-long embezzlement of
about $1.58 million that, among other things, financed gambling
sprees and vacations in exotic locales.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Harris, 46, and Evelyn J. Morgan, 45, both of Kansas City,
waived indictment and pleaded guilty to single counts of felony
embezzlement by an officer of a federally insured bank, according
to Stephen L. Hill Jr., U.S. attorney for the Western District of
Missouri. The women appeared before U.S. District Judge Fernando J.
Gaitan Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Bank of America, which now owns the bank at 331 Westport Road,
had no comment on the embezzlement. The bank operated under several
different names and owners over the course of the embezzlement
scheme.
</P>
<P>
   According to the FBI, this wasn't a typical embezzlement.
</P>
<P>
   Most embezzlers work alone, not in teams. And although most
embezzlers are caught in a matter of months, this scheme went on
for 10 years. Moreover, the women had to confess to bring it to the
bank's attention.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most unusual factor was that the women stole the
funds independently, then began to cover for each other.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan, the vault teller, and Harris, the backup vault teller,
both had worked for the banking facility for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   According to court records:
</P>
<P>
   Starting in 1989 and continuing until their termination in March
1999, the women worked together to steal varying amounts of money
directly from the bank's vault. They concealed each other's thefts
through false records that allowed cash shortages to go unnoticed
during audits of the vault.
</P>
<P>
   Each woman said they took about half of the money that was
embezzled for personal use.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan was the first of the pair to pocket the money. But when
she took a vacation, Harris tried to balance the vault and came up
$19,000 short.
</P>
<P>
   While Harris suspected Morgan, she didn't report her. Instead
Harris took $10,000 herself and covered for the missing funds on
the vault blotter.
</P>
<P>
   When Morgan returned from vacation, Harris asked if she knew
about the shortfall. Morgan said she did.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, Harris asked Morgan if she knew the vault was
short another $10,000. Morgan said she did.
</P>
<P>
   From then on the two were in a partnership to plunder the bank.
</P>
<P>
   To keep from getting caught, at least one of the women had to be
there nearly every day. During audits, they filled out ``cash out''
tickets for the amounts they had taken to cover up the shortage.
</P>
<P>
   Harris used some of the funds to take friends on trips to Las
Vegas, the Bahamas, and Mexico. She gambled as much as $30,000 a
trip on cruises. She bought a new Cadillac, was building a new
home, and invested in a mutual fund.
</P>
<P>
   Harris's husband was out of town most of the time on business,
she said, so he did not notice that she was flush with extra cash.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Gorin, attorney for Morgan, said his client did not spend
any of the funds on herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``She could have bought a big house, a sailboat, vacations,
diamonds, but she didn't,'' Gorin said. ``She used the funds to
help people out.''
</P>
<P>
   The embezzlers' closest call came in 1996, when the bank
facility lowered the vault limit at the Westport branch. At the
time they had already stolen more than $900,000, according to court
records. The embezzled funds were insured by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp.
</P>
<P>
   They began using ``cash in transit'' tickets in addition to the
``cash out'' tickets to conceal their theft.
</P>
<P>
   By late 1998, however, both were struggling with their guilt.
They agreed to turn themselves in and went to Hill's office with
their attorneys. The bank terminated them in March 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got started on something that just snowballed and when
they realized how bad it was they decided to make things right and
turn themselves in,'' said Kurt Marquart, attorney for Harris.
``Their conscience was bothering them.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill asked the FBI to investigate. Even though the women were
pleading guilty, evidence needed to be presented to show that they
would have been convicted in a court of law.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you have to reconstruct what happened,'' said Jeff Lanza,
special agent for the FBI in Kansas City. ``Given the situation of
the bank changing hands several times made it a little more time
consuming.''
</P>
<P>
   The women did not keep track of the total funds they took. But
the FBI and the bank used the ``cash out'' and ``cash in transit''
documents to come up with the $1.58 million figure.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plea agreement, it is estimated the women could each
serve 30 to 37 months in prison. They also could be subject to
restitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point they knew it was going to be discovered,'' Lanza
said. ``It must have been very difficult for them to carry it for
so long.''

EDITORIAL: SOFT ON CAMPAIGN FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, March 17:
</P>
<P>
   With each fund-raiser, this year's New York Senate race offers
new and brazen lessons in the nature of unrestrained political
money-raising. Both Hillary Rodham Clinton and Rudolph Giuliani are
scrambling for funds, speeding into the history books as
participants in what is expected to be the costliest race ever for
the U.S. Senate. Each new fund-raising gimmick expands the coffers
of these two candidates even as it chips away at their reputations.
The public is left to worry that big donors will be seeking a
payback later.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the first lady has spent a good deal of time this week
trying to explain away questions about a recent fund-raiser by
Pakistani-Americans who wanted President Clinton to visit Pakistan
and were willing to contribute $50,000 in individual donations to
Hillary Clinton in hopes she would help arrange it. She told the
Pakistanis she agreed that the president should go, and told the
press a few days later that if anybody thought contributions to her
were a route to influencing him, that was ``dead wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   By now, however, she should know that appearance matters,
especially as she paves the first campaign trail for a president's
wife. As such she has a special obligation not to peddle, or even
appear to peddle, her connection to her powerful husband. She needs
to be more sensitive to the timing of her fund-raisers and should
make it clear to donors that their gifts will not buy her
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Next came the news that Giuliani had set up a ``victory''
committee to collect largely unregulated soft money, to compete
with a similar committee that Clinton established last year.
Giuliani had delayed for several months, thus raising hopes that he
would find a way to head off a soft-dollar-for-soft-dollar
competition with Clinton. Only a few weeks ago the Clinton and
Giuliani campaigns exchanged somewhat testy letters about the
possibility of a negotiated campaign-finance truce. The exchange of
notes, however, never led to the talking stage, and each side is
now busily blaming the other for the breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani talks about leveling the playing field, but there is
only one real way to do so at this stage. That is for both sides to
find a way to junk the soft-money provision that distorts the
nation's campaign finance laws by pretending the money is going to
the national parties when it is really intended to assist the
candidates. These his-and-her ``victory'' committees may be a
victory only for special interests. New York's Senate candidates
are political superstars, who should have no trouble raising money
under the regular federal limits.

EDITORIAL: GRAPPLING WITH THE TEACHER SHORTAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, March 17:
</P>
<P>
   The governor's office and both houses of the New York State
Legislature have responded to the state's impending teacher
shortage with a flurry of proposals aimed at attracting people into
the profession, keeping them on the job longer and directing
qualified teachers where they are most needed _ to low-performing
schools. Although the most comprehensive plan so far has come from
the Senate majority leader, Joseph Bruno, other participants have
some impressive ideas. But it is important that the various
measures be targeted to benefit the poorest students.
</P>
<P>
   The shortage is especially perilous in New York City, which
could lose as many as 50,000 of its 78,000 teachers to retirement
in the next five years. The Senate proposal offers several methods
for preventing the drain, the most crucial of which is a pension
incentive that allows senior teachers who would ordinarily retire
at age 55 to pay their pensions into an annuity and continue
teaching without an earnings limitation. In addition, the Senate
plan offers a $10,000 salary bonus for master teachers who become
nationally certified, and includes a provision that would allow
teachers to retain the seniority they now lose when they move from
neighboring states into New York. The Assembly version, meanwhile,
usefully proposes financial incentives to teachers who volunteer to
work in low-achieving schools. Both Gov. George Pataki and Bruno
have wisely offered plans that would defray the cost of college
tuition for new college graduates who turn to teaching. Brno has
suggested offering $3,400 cash grants.
</P>
<P>
   Both houses have wisely proposed expanding the Tuition
Assistance Plan, which helps many prospective teachers attend
college. But it is crucial that the Legislature remove the cap that
was placed on the program several years ago when times were lean.
Every dollar counts for students who are struggling to stay in
college.

CENTRAL CONNECTICUT TESTS IOWA STATE
</HEADLINE>
  (ADDS last graf with UCLA beating Ball State; ADDS UCLA as
Maryland's opponent in fourth graf from end.)

 By JACK CURRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ They stared up at the giant scoreboard hanging
from the ceiling, still hoping. One, two, three heads popped up
from Central Connecticut State's huddle wanting to believe that
they still had a chance to shock Iowa State and the college
basketball world.
</P>
<P>
   But the chance that had been very real five and a half minutes
earlier when the score was tied had evaporated. The Blue Devils
were 30 seconds from losing to Iowa State, 88-78, in the first
round of the NCA A tournament's Midwest Regional at the Metrodome,
so looking at the scoreboard provided no hope, regardless of how
many heads popped up from the huddle.
</P>
<P>
   No one expected this game between the second-seeded Cyclones and
the 15th-seeded Blue Devils to be competitive. Central Connecticut
was behind by 19 points in the first half, and coach Howie
Dickenman warned his players that they were looking at the
possibility of a 50-point blowout. No one expected a comeback, but
it came. The comeback came because the Blue Devils (25-6) played
harder and smarter and the Cyclones (30-4), who play Auburn next,
on Saturday, relaxed too early.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had to play this game again, I wouldn't want to play
them again,'' Iowa State's Marcus Fizer said. ``They were really
anxious to beat us.''
</P>
<P>
   Iona felt the same way about Maryland. Like Central Connecticut,
the 14th-seeded Gaels were trying pull off an upset. But they were
pummeled, 74-59, to finish their season in a frustrating manner.
</P>
<P>
   When the Iowa State game was over, Fizer, the All-American who
had muscled his way to 27 points against a 2-3 matchup zone,
located the Central Connecticut starters, shook their hands and
patted them on their heads. Fizer looked exhausted with sweat
pouring off his bald head and his arms dangling by his sides. More
than exhausted, Fizer looked relieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great game,'' Fizer told the Blue Devils. ``Great game.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Central Connecticut wanted more. When Dickenman and three
players trudged into the interview area, Rick Mickens (19 points)
and Victor Payne had moist eyes and John Tice (21 points) answered
questions as if he were undergoing root canal work.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils wondered what might have happened if they had
not fallen behind by 18 points only eight minutes into the game in
their first NCAA tournament appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tied the score, 69-69, and that's all fine and dandy, but
we lost the basketball game,'' Dickenman said. ``That was a
winnable basketball game for us.''
</P>
<P>
   After Mickens streaked in for a layup to even the score, 69-69,
with 6 minutes 13 seconds left, the 50 fans who had trekked from
New Britain, Conn., to see the Blue Devils hugged and high-fived in
their seats. The Blue Devils' mascot, who was in his third game
ever because the school did not have a costume until this month,
clapped. Iowa State, not wanting to become just the fourth No.
2-seeded team to falter in the first round, frowned.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next five possessions, the Cyclones uncorked a 12-0
burst.
</P>
<P>
   Jamaal Tinsley, the Brooklyn native who did not play high school
basketball, was the reason the Cyclones prevailed, not Fizer.
</P>
<P>
   Tinsley, who slithered inside for 26 points and six assists and
also had six rebounds and four steals, started the run with a
driving layup and finished it by swishing a 3-pointer. The Cyclones
were 5 for 7 in those fateful four minutes, while the Blue Devils
were 0 for 3 with a turnover. Fizer was 0 for 0.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won the game and they kept the ball out of my hands,''
Fizer said. ``It proves it's not just me making the shots.''
</P>
<P>
   After Tomas Brookins' running 3-pointer at the buzzer sliced
Central Connecticut's deficit to nine points at halftime, Dickenman
gave an impassioned speech. He challenged his players to dive for
loose balls, to prevent transition baskets and to play defense for
35 seconds of every possession. But his team did not do enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no moral victories,'' Dickenman said. ``We came here
to win this basketball game. We didn't come to play close.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first game, Auburn built an 18-point bulge over Creighton
in the second half but then needed Mamadou N'Diaye to block Ben
Walker's 3-point attempt with 2 seconds remaining to win. The
seventh-seeded Tigers (24-9) gave the 10th-seeded Blue Jays (23-10)
a chance to even the score when Daymeon Fishback inexplicably
tossed a full-court pass to N'Diaye that sailed over the 7-footer's
head. The Blue Jays got the ball back under their basket with 3.8
seconds left. They inbounded the ball to Walker, who had to turn
and hoist up a shot that N'Diaye's long arm swatted away.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game should have been over,'' Auburn coach Cliff Ellis
said. ``I'm glad that we survived.''
</P>
<P>
   Auburn played without Chris Porter, its best player, who was
suspended by the NCAA for accepting $2,500 from an agent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before the game was nine minutes old, Maryland led by 23-4. At
one point in the first half, Iona went more than nine minutes in
which the Gaels scored just one field goal. Iona shot 33.3 percent
from the field for the game, including 4 of 19 from beyond the
3-point arc. It is obvious why Maryland (25-9) romped.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing the way we started,'' said coach Jeff
Ruland. ``The way we started, instead of like Cinderella, it was
more like Tinkerbell.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Gaels (20-11) chopped the deficit to nine on Tariq
Kirksay's layup with six and a half minutes remaining in the first
half, the Terrapins were never in danger of relinquishing the lead.
Maryland was bigger, quicker and more confident, which is why the
Terrapins cruised on a night when they made 21 turnovers. Terence
Morris had 22 points for Maryland, which will play the UCLA on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   After Ruland called a timeout in the second half, he was so
disappointed that he shouted ``that's embarrassing.'' But Ruland
complimented his team after the loss for rebounding from a 6-9
start this season and praised Kirksay, who scored 24 in his final
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never gave up, we turned it around,'' said Kirksay, whose
voice choked up as he bowed his head and wept.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA 65, BALL STATE 57
</P>
<P>
   The sixth-seeded Bruins used a 15-0 streak to erase a one-point
deficit and tame 11th-seeded Ball State. Jaron Rush had two 3-point
field goals in an explosive run that turned a 33-32 deficit into a
47-33 bulge for the Bruins (20-11), who then hung on when the
Cardinals got within four. Jason Kapono had all 17 of his points in
the second half for UCLA while Duane Clemens scored 16 for Ball
State (22-9).

<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS - They swore it would be different this time. Their
practices were tougher, they claimed. Their preparation was better,
they said. Their focus was sharper. They vowed not to overlook
their opponent.
</P>
<P>
   And the UCLA Bruins were right - right as a Jason Kapono
3-pointer. There was no lethargy, there was no indifference, and
there was no first-round loss.
</P>
<P>
   Kapono drained three 3-pointers early in the second half to fuel
UCLA's 66-57 victory over Ball State on Thursday in the Metrodome.
The Bruins will play No. 3 seed Maryland in the second round
Saturday at approximately 5:15 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year the players were complacent, this year we're
hungry,'' senior forward Sean Farnham said. ``It's night and day
between last year and this year, from the coaches to the players to
the managers and t he trainer. We haven't accomplished anything
this year. This is our chance to get it turned around.''
</P>
<P>
   They did it with Kapono's 17 second-half points, nine of which
sparked a 14-0 surge that gave the Bruins control. They did it with
a stifling zone defense. They did it with dominant rebounding,
excellent ball movement and enough perimeter shooting to counteract
Ball State's 2-3 zone - the same zone Detroit Mercy used to upset
UCLA last year.
</P>
<P>
   What a difference a Kapono makes - and a sense of urgency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't talked about (Detroit), but it's been a motivating
factor,'' point guard Earl Watson said. ``We have a lot of
motivation coming into this tournament, a lot of unfinished
business.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins started well and took a 9-4 lead when Watson charged
through the defense for a layup. Three possessions later, JaRon
Rush buried a 3-pointer, then Jerome Moiso grabbed his own miss and
hit a soft jumper from the left baseline. When Rush tossed an
alley-oop pass to Dan Gadzuric for a mammoth one-handed dunk, the
Bruins had an 18-9 lead with 8:30 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Then their bad habits returned. Watson's errant alley-oop pass
to Rush off the backboard became Cedric Moodie's lay-up at the
other end - and a four-point swing.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a 20-9 lead, UCLA's margin was 18-11, and the
momentum shifted for the remainder of the half.
</P>
<P>
   Rush missed a 15-footer on UCLA's ensuing possession. Then Ray
Young missed an ill-advised jumper. Gadzuric's turnaround gave the
Bruins a brief 22-20 lead, but Ball State countered with Moodie's
3-pointer from the left wing. With 1:18 left in the half, the
Cardinals had their first lead.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Jackson ended the half with a 3-pointer from the left
corner, increasing Ball State's lead to 26-22. UCLA had scored four
points in the final 8:30, most of its against the Cardinals' zone
defense.
</P>
<P>
   The second half began as the first ended. Theron Smith hit a
difficult jumper from the left baseline to give Ball State a 28-22
lead. The Bruins countered with a Moiso dunk, then went scoreless
for five posse ssions against the Cardinals' zone defense. The
problem wasn't execution - UCLA was plenty patient - as finishing
what they started. Both Gadzuric and Moiso failed to convert short
jumpers.
</P>
<P>
   With 16:40 left, Kapono broke UCLA's drought. He buried a
3-pointer from the left wing - his first basket of the game. After
a Ball State miss, Kapono drained one from the right wing. The
baskets gave the Bruins a 30-28 lead and forced a Ball State
timeout.
</P>
<P>
   The teams exchanged baskets for several minutes, then Kapono
struck again - this time from the right corner off a crosscourt
pass from Watson. The basket gave UCLA a 39-33 lead, and the
momentum it had lost in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Kapono) is one of the top freshmen in the country,'' Ball
State coach Ray McCallum said. ``He's a shooter, but he can do a
lot of other things.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's defense continued to smother the Cardinals each time they
entered the lane. Their fifth-consecutive scoreless possession
became a Rush 3-pointer from the left wing that expanded UCLA's
lead to 42-33. Evidently, Kapono's accuracy was contagious.
</P>
<P>
   A few seconds later, reserve Matt Barnes found Rush for another
3-pointer, and the lead was 45-33. The Bruins turned a Ball State
turnover into a Barnes dunk, and the lead was 14 points.

SPORTS COLUMN: THORNTON KEEPS PEACE ON THE COURT FOR ST. JOHN'S
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. _ Late Wednesday evening Darlene Grimes was
talking about the hectic week she had already had. While her son,
Bootsy Thornton, was in Tucson leading St. John's to a narrow
first-round victory in the NCAA basketball tournament, Grimes was
back in Baltimore, where she is a medical assistance specialist.
</P>
<P>
   Grimes goes from hospital to hospital helping patients fill out
insurance paperwork. The hardest part this week has been carrying
around the heavy silver trophy her son won last week as the Big
East tournament's most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   The trophy has become a great conversation piece. On Monday she
took it to Johns Hopkins University Hospital, where doctors, nurses
and patients admired it and offered their congratulations. Then
Tuesday it was off to Liberty Medical Center. Thursday she was
taking it to Union Memorial Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took it with me when I got my shoes repaired,'' she said,
laughing.
</P>
<P>
   In each place, faces lighted up because Darlene Grimes' face was
glowing. This was a happy story. Thornton was born in East
Baltimore, where he attended Dunbar High School and played for the
school's famed basketball program. He played at Tallahassee
Community College for two seasons before coming to St. John's. His
success is the story of a Baltimore youngster's thriving.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means a lot to me that he's made it this far,'' his mother
said by telephone. ``Since he was 8 years old this has been his
dream. He wanted to play college basketball, wanted to play in the
NBA. I wanted him to get a good education and be an artist. I never
thought he'd get this close.''
</P>
<P>
   What she is most proud of, she said, is her son's independent
mind. Earlier in the season, when teammates wore Band-Aids on their
cheeks to commemorate Erick Barkley's NCAA suspension, Thornton
went Band-Aid-less. With so many athletes sporting diamond studs in
their ears, Thornton refuses.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, Thornton, in his typiacally cool fashion, bailed
St. John's out of a potential nightmare first-round elimination. He
hit key shots, grabbed critical rebounds and handed out timely
assists, and, finally, hit the last two points of the game.
Unfortunately for Thornton, a remarkable senior season _ one that
included a dramatic basket to beat Duke _ has been overshadowed by
NCAA investigations and daily disclosures surrounding Barkley, his
backcourt mate. For all his on-court accomplishments, Thornton
achieved national attention last weekend for a locker-room
altercation. He and Barkley exchanged heated words at halftime of a
Big East tournament semifinal game. Pushes nearly came to shoves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made the paper that day,'' Thornton said with a hint of
humor. ``No matter how many good games I had, I never seemed to
make the back page; but one little negative thing happened and I
get headlines, `Erick and Bootsy Fight.' That bothered me a
little.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he and Barkley are friends, not just teammates. ``If
it's just on court and not off the court, it carries over on the
court,'' he said. ``So you have to have a great off-the-court
relationship as well as on-court.''
</P>
<P>
   Thornton's real first name is Marvis. His mother, who separated
from Bootsy's father and was married several years ago, said when
she was pregnant she and Bootsy's father had debates over how they
would name the baby. ``At first he said he wanted the name Marvis,
because his name is Marvis and his father's name is Marvis; then he
said he didn't care,'' she said. ``I was thinking about naming him
Teon Terrell Thornton.''
</P>
<P>
   His father changed his mind again. ``So we named him Marvis
Thornton III,'' Grimes said. ``But I just couldn't call him Marvis.
So I tried to come up with different nicknames.''
</P>
<P>
   She settled on one inspired by Bootsy Collins, the trendsetting
bass player for Parliament-Funkadelic, the band that laid the
foundation for generations of rappers. ``I really liked him,'' she
said. ``I remembered songs he made that I liked, like
``Flashlight.'''
</P>
<P>
   Thornton is familiar with his namesake. ``I know he was back in
the day with George Clinton and everybody; people going to
concerts, wearing shiny suits,'' he said. ``Bootsy Collins wearing
those big star glasses _ that's what caught my attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Two decades later the nickname is fitting. Thornton has assumed
the bass player's role for St. John's. He moves without the ball,
deftly uses space, and has an economy of movement that keeps the
offense going. When nerves begin to fray, the understated Thornton,
standing in the back of the rhythm section, exhorts teammates to
keep a cool head, to channel the anger and frustration into the
game. Thursday night, he provided desperately needed offense,
scoring 20 points, handing out three assists and grabbing seven
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been the quiet, behind-the-scenes guy _ a calm guy
who gets the job done,'' he said. So far it has worked. The tempest
continues, the investigation continues. Bootsy Thornton is still
keeping steady time.

ST. JOHN'S: BASKET AND STEAL WIN IT VS. NORTHERN ARIZONA
</HEADLINE>

 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUSCON, Ariz. _ After six weeks of investigations and a Bootsy
Thornton-Erick Barkley fight at halftime of a Big East tournament
game, who would have thought a 15th-seeded team would rattle
second-seeded St. John's in the West subregional of the NCAA men's
basketball tournament Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   But that's what Northern Arizona did before St John's prevailed,
61-56.
</P>
<P>
   Lavor Postell hit a driving runner in the lane with 10.9 seconds
remaining in the game to regain the lead at 57-56. He then hit the
free throw to complete a 3-point play as St. John's went up by
58-56, and the Lumberjacks, with their band of 3-point shooters,
had one last chance.
</P>
<P>
   Ross Land, one of the nation's deadliest 3-point shooters, got
the ball on the arc and squared up but Barkley's right hand slapped
the ball loose. Barkley scrambled for the ball, and with 2.6
seconds left went to the line and the Lumberjacks' stirring bid for
an upset before a hometown crowd was over.
</P>
<P>
   The Lumberjacks had won 14 of their last 15 games and the Big
Sky Conference championship by mastering the art of 3-point
shooting. For the third year in a row, Northern Arizona had led the
nation in 3-point percentage _ a 39.4 percent this season _ and
boasted the fifth-most-accurate long-range bomber in NCAA Division
I history, the senior Land.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Storm muscled its way to a 28-25 lead at halftime, but
the Lumberjacks were staying close because of a 2-point shotmaker:
Northern Arizona's 7-foot center Dan McClintock. Land and his
backcourt mate, Adam Lopez, zipped passes into the agile big man,
who drop-stepped around 6-foot-7-inch Anthony Glover for a variety
of bank shots and jump hooks.
</P>
<P>
   McClintock scored eight of Northern Arizona's first 15 points
and finished the half with 10 points and five rebounds. He also
helped the Lumberjacks control the offensive boards so that Land
and company had second and third attempts.
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't matter. Northern Arizona shot 37.9 percent,
hitting just 2 of 11 from beyond the 3-point arc.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Storm, however, had its own troubles offensively despite
shooting 46.4 percent from the field. After speaking to NCAA
investigators on Monday and in his view being cleared by them,
Barkley had said he could compete without worrying about the
investigation. But he shot very tentatively in the first half,
finishing 0 for 5 and barely drawing rim on two occasions. Postell,
who was also interviewed by investigators, was an equally dismal 1
of 5.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of those two, St. John's relied on the inside slashing
of Thornton, Reggie Jesse and Glover. The threesome managed only
one offensive board and were out-rebounded by 19-13, but they kept
going right at McClintock. They combined for 11-of-16 shooting as
Thornton scored 10 points and Jesse and Glover added seven and six
points, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue 62, Dayton 61
</P>
<P>
   The Boilermakers kicked, overthrew and traveled with the ball _
19 turnovers _ and allowed Dayton to think about a first-round
upset. ``With about seven or eight minutes in the game, I asked
Jaraan if he was going to make a shot today,'' Purdue coach Gene
Keady remembered asking his senior guard Jaraan Cornell.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for coach and Boilermakers, Cornell sank three
3-pointers in the final nine minutes and sixth-seeded Purdue
endured 11th-seeded Dayton in a barely officiated brawl between two
bump-and-shove teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an ugly game, but it was a hard-fought game where both
teams deserved to win,'' said Keady, whose 22-9 team will face
third-seeded Oklahoma on Saturday. ``We hung in there and made some
great defensive plays at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers (22-9) used a couple of free throws to take a 56-55
lead with 3 minutes 7 seconds left in the game after the
Boilermakers' Brian Cardinal had been whistled on the offensive end
for tossing a forearm shiver in the lane. When Dayton guard Brooks
Hall intercepted Carson Cunningham's pass at half court and took it
in for a layup and a 58-55 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But Cornell, a 38 percent shooter, flashed to the top of the key
and hit his third 3-pointer and 13th point of the game. Cardinal,
who scored 15 points in the half, followed his fellow senior with
another 3-pointer from the right wing, and the Boilermakers had a
61-58 lead with 1:20 left.
</P>
<P>
   Keady and Purdue had to sweat out a grinding finish _ Yuanta
Holland slipped inside for a layup on an inbounds pass to bring the
Flyers within 61-60 with 40 seconds left. Then Purdue's Greg McQuay
missed one of two free throws with 23.6 seconds left. When Hall
launched a runner from the lane that bounded off the rim and into
the lane, he followed it and came up with the ball. He also was
fouled.
</P>
<P>
   Hall hit the first of his one-and-one, but missed the second.
This time Cardinal came out of the pileup with the ball and was
sent to the line.
</P>
<P>
   But Cardinal, too, missed the front end of the one-and-one. The
Flyers had 3.2 seconds to go 90 feet and get off a game-winning
shot. Flyers guard David Morris caught the ball before half court,
dribbled left, and launched a 40-footer with the 6-foot-8-inch
Cardinal on his hip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a bump on him and he didn't get a good shot,'' said
Cardinal, who led the Boilermakers with 18 points. ``When he
released that ball, I was like, `Oh my gosh.' I was praying it
didn't come close, and it didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Dayton coach Oliver Purcell said: ``They let us play. It was a
war.''
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma 74, Winthrop 50
</P>
<P>
   The Sooners (27-6) raced off to a 39-23 halftime lead behind
deadly 3-point shooting and cruised over the 14th-seeded Eagles.
They shot 51 percent, made 10 of 21 from beyond the arc and had
five players in double figures _ led by J.R. Raymond's 14 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously you want to win your first-round game _ the thing I
was most impressed with was how we won,'' Oklahoma coach Kelvin
Sampson said. ``I thought our halfcourt defense was tremendous. We
defended the 3-point line and kept them from running sets. We did
not let them do what they wanted to do. And we have kids who can
shoot the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   For the second consecutive year, the Eagles (21-9) exited after
the first round by wilting under the Sooners' halfcourt defense.
They shot 26 percent and made a dismal 2 for 20 on 3-pointers.

UCLA GETS PAST BALL STATE

LAPD, D.A. COOPERATE ON RAMPART SCANDAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK ORLOV 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _  &UR; T &LR; he LAPD and the District Attorney's Office
resumed cooperating in the Rampart Division corruption case
Thursday but Police Chief Bernard C. Parks and District Attorney
Gil Garcetti kept up their personal attacks on each other.
</P>
<P>
   It remained unclear whether the dispute over cooperation ever
was real or whether it was merely an escalation in the political
brinkmanship Parks and Garcetti have engaged in for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But the days of high tension since Garcetti publicly accused
Parks of freezing county prosecutors out of the case have left the
credibility of the investigation in question.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is out of control and I think it's irreparable,'' county
Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky said. ``My thoughts are the controversy
is not serving the people of the city in the least bit. The public
interest has to be put first. Both men are being diminished by
this.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's amazing is that here are two smart, intelligent men
with more than 50 years of public service and it's all gone by the
wayside because they decided to get in this fight. It's sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressured by Garcetti and others, the Los Angeles Police
Commission has scheduled a special meeting for today to consider
ordering Parks to work with Garcetti an issue that now seems
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Garcetti spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons said the LAPD provided
investigative information Thursday to prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our concern all along has been getting the information we need
to make criminal investigations,'' Gibbons said. ``As long as they
are cooperating, that's what we needed to see. The most important
thing is the LAPD working with us, and that resolves any dispute.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview at the LAPD's Parker Center headquarters, Parks
said he was ``set up'' by Garcetti, who went public with his claim
the chief had refused to provide any new investigative information
to the District Attorney's Office.
</P>
<P>
   He said he never refused to work with Garcetti but believed they
had reached agreement weeks ago on a plan for the LAPD to give its
reports to the U.S. Attorney's Office, which would turn over
evidence about criminal violations of state law to the local
prosecutors _ a claim Garcetti dismissed as a ``red herring'' to
cover up the decision to freeze out his office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this was a carefully orchestrated effort by (Garcetti)
when he woke up one day and found himself in a runoff election for
his seat,'' Parks said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never told him that we would not cooperate with his
office. But what we were looking for was a proper procedure to
handle the cases that we all had agreed to. I was set up by him and
his campaign to look as if we were not willing to cooperate.''
</P>
<P>
   But Garcetti, in a telephone interview from an undisclosed
location outside of Los Angeles, vehemently denied any attempt to
embarrass Parks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me make it very clear that since the moment it became
clear to us through his written communications he was no longer
going to be cooperating with us on the investigation of possible
state crimes, I have endeavored behind the scenes to convince him
he was legally obligated to cooperate with us,'' Garcetti said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not only me, it was the chief law enforcement officer
of the state, Attorney General Bill Lockyer, in a conference
call.''
</P>
<P>
   Parks offered a completely different account, saying he outlined
the approach he would take of working through the U.S. attorney and
it was generally agreed to.
</P>
<P>
   The chief also pointed to a Feb. 23 news conference, in which
Garcetti took part, where it was announced U.S. Attorney Alejandro
Mayorkas and the FBI would be joining the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we would have a task force, like we did on the
Buford Furrow case, and that we would be funneling all our
information to the U.S. Attorney's Office, and they would work with
the D.A. to determine where cases should be filed.''
</P>
<P>
   Furrow is accused of a series of crimes in the shooting spree at
the North Valley Jewish Community Center in Granada Hills last year
and the killing of a postal worker.
</P>
<P>
   Parks cited a memo he received from Mayorkas' office offering
advice on how to present ``clean'' cases to prosecutors, meaning
they would not see any self-incriminating statements officers were
required to make as part of the internal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the U.S. Attorney's Office refused to comment on
the procedures to be used in the Rampart case. Lockyer has said
Parks is required by law to cooperate with Garcetti.
</P>
<P>
   Garcetti left the city Wednesday afternoon for what was
described as a ski vacation. He denied that and said he would be
back in his office today. He would not say where he was calling
from.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbons, his spokeswoman, pointed to differences between Rampart
and the Furrow case, in which a federal prosecution was allowed
because one of his alleged victims was a postal worker.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   ``Our concern is Parks is talking about giving it to the U.S.
Attorney's Office first,'' Gibbons said. ``He has an obligation,
legally, to give it to us at the same time. He can give his entire
investigation to anyone he wants, but it has to come to us at the
same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is up to this office to decide who to prosecute and when to
file charges. We could have filed charges and then lost the cases.
We want to make sure we have ironclad cases. We are looking for a
broad-based case that goes to the heart of the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   But Parks said he believes that the LAPD has given the District
Attorney's Office at least three good cases, one of which does not
involve testimony from Rafael Perez, the former anti-gang officer
who has admitted to stealing cocaine, beating and shooting
suspects, planting evidence and lying in court to win convictions
of suspected gang members.
</P>
<P>
   After publicly scolding both Garcetti and Parks on Wednesday,
Mayor Richard Riordan sent letters urging them to work together
professionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am convinced that we can only achieve our mutual goals of
justice and accountability if we put any personal feelings aside
and resolve to work cooperatively with all parties,'' Riordan said.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter to Parks, he said the Police Department has to
cooperate with the local prosecutors, and he told Garcetti that the
department would cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   Parks said he also plans to write to Garcetti, saying his
officers will continue to provide the information requested.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Parks said prosecutors have not requested much
information in the past two months and he remains unconvinced that
Garcetti has assigned 30 deputy district attorneys to the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Garcetti disputed that, saying deputy district attorneys have
asked for specific information and have been told by LAPD
investigators that they were told not to provide the information.

L.A. GETS ITS IRISH UP AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT MONROE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;   &UR; L &LR; OS ANGELES _ Erin go downtown!
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since 1992, Los Angeles will host a St.
Patrick's Day parade Friday featuring Irish dancers, a dozen
marching bands and public transit officials beating snakes out of
the city. The Los Angeles fire officials organizing the parade said
it's a chance for Los Angeles to catch up to the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Los Angeles is one of the last major cities in the free world
not to have a St. Patrick's Day parade, and we decided to change
that,'' fire Capt. Rich Hanson said.
</P>
<P>
   The last parade was in Century City, drawing some 20,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's parade, which will start at 11:30 a.m. at City Hall, is
the centerpiece of events taking place citywide that will include
an Irish food cook-off at James Monroe High School in Sepulveda and
a City Hall ceremony put on by Rose of Tralee, a Toluca Lake Irish
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Monroe Culinary Arts teacher Eleanor Schuster said her students
will serve Irish dishes such as boiled beef and cabbage, scones and
roast chicken to about 80 dignitaries and school staff members.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, all but two of the 170 students preparing the meal
are Latino, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rose of Tralee's president, Terry Anderson, said this year will
be a special treat for his organization because the City Hall
crowning of the Rose of Tralee among 15 area debutantes will
actually take place on St. Patrick's Day. In recent years, the
125-year-old event has taken place on the Friday nearest the
holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson added that the new millennium might mark a changing era
for Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a new kind of downtown,'' Anderson said.
``Maybe it's time for a new kind of parade. I think it can really
snap, crackle and pop.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Allene Buchanan, membership chairwoman of the
Glendale-based Southern California Irish Network, predicted the
event will grow over time. Members of the police Emerald Society,
an affiliate of the network, will play bagpipes in the parade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will happen because everyone likes to celebrate St.
Patrick's Day whether they're Irish or not,'' said Buchanan, whose
250-member group educates the public on Irish heritage. ``It's a
long time in coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles has hosted St. Patrick's Day parades as recently as
the 1980s but those sputtered out after a few years, said organizer
and Los Angeles fire Capt. Richard Andrade. Before that, he could
find none in this century. He said this parade already has garnered
more than 90 sponsors almost entirely by word of mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last two weeks it has just skyrocketed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This parade will feature Mayor Richard Riordan, Police Chief
Bernard C. Parks and Fire Chief William Bamattre as grand marshals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference in this parade is this is more like the old
East Coast parades where the police and fire departments play a
heavy role,'' Andrade said.
</P>
<P>
   St. Patrick's Day parades are a staple of East Coast and Midwest
cities. Arguably the most famous is in Chicago, where the city dyes
the Chicago River green.
</P>
<P>
   Andrade said no such plans are afoot for the trickling Los
Angeles River.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty much already green,'' he said.

KAPLER NOT JUAN, WHICH ISN'T ALL BAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ Rampant bitterness overflowed from Juan
Gonzalez this week. It was only a matter of time until the damaged
pride surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   Juan did not want to be traded. He was stunned when it happened.
Even more stunning was the absence of fan backlash after the Texas
Rangers dealt a two-time MVP who already has Hall of Fame
credentials.
</P>
<P>
   After months of putting on a happy face, Gonzalez decided to
lash out at the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Juan said they can't win without him, and he may be right. Juan
also said the Rangers' organization is no longer sensitive to the
needs of Latin players _ on that, he couldn't be more wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the best Latin players in the game, Pudge Rodriguez and
Rafael Palmeiro, both signed below market-value contracts because
of a desire to stay in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Juan, however, will continue to have his say from Detroit. The
bitterness won't stop now.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Rangers' new right fielder is 24-year old Gabe
Kapler. Everything Juan Gonzalez was and is as a ballplayer, Kapler
is not.
</P>
<P>
   That vast difference begins with the obvious _ a feared and
accomplished power hitter now plays for the Tigers. At the plate
this season, Kapler will be a work in progress, with an emphasis on
``work.''
</P>
<P>
   Kapler is all about that, and certainly all about all-out
hustle. There will be no ground ball he won't attempt to beat out.
There will be no line drive to right field that won't be charged
like a World War II Marine attacking an enemy bunker.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, this is kinda like a war,'' Kapler said Thursday.
``People are depending on you getting to that line drive _ the
pitcher, your teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live in fear of letting people down, including myself. Any
ball hit to right field, I take it personal if I don't make the
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, the difference from Juan is so immense that comparisons
are not worth mentioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juan is one of the great players of the game _ there is
nothing to compare at this point,'' Kapler said. ``I just want my
teammates and the fans to like what they see from Gabe Kapler.
Anytime I let them down, it will never have been because of a lack
of effort.'' ''
</P>
<P>
   Peer pressure in baseball is constant and often harsh.
Ballplayers watch each other, and they compare and measure, not
only the talent level, but also the heart size. Kapler was a rookie
last season with the Tigers. He didn't quite live up to the
expectations of some. When the Gonzalez trade was made in November,
Kapler was not just another name in the deal. He was immediately
nominated to replace Juan in right field.
</P>
<P>
   Don't think the Rangers' veterans weren't watching closely as
spring training opened three weeks ago. To Kapler's credit, he has
aced the initial test.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm totally impressed with him,'' first baseman Palmeiro said.
``Kapler plays the game the right way _ very hard at all times. And
his passion for baseball really comes through. All that hustle is
natural. You can tell none of it is forced. It's just him.''
</P>
<P>
   From left fielder Rusty Greer: ``You can't ask him to fill
Juan's shoes, and we're not. But the fans can come to the ballpark
every day and watch a good young talent play the game very hard.
(Kapler) only has a year in the big leagues. Give him a little
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro likes the fact young center fielder Ruben Mateo will be
sandwiched in the outfield between Greer and Kapler. ``Ruben knows
to either go hard all the time or you're going to look out of place
in this outfield,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, about the Kapler bat. He was given the day off Thursday
from Grapefruit League play, but so far his offense has been solid.
The average is .300, with four extra-base hits in a 9-for-30
effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just scratching the surface right now,'' said Rudy
Jaramillo, the team hitting instructor. ``But when you're working
with a combination of talent and desire to improve, it's always a
pleasure.''
</P>
<P>
   Kapler hit only .245 with the Tigers in his rookie season. But
the 18 home runs, 22 doubles and four triples suggest much
potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got no offensive goals for the season, but one thing I
will do is improve every year,'' Kapler said. ``And I want to be
held accountable on that part. If you don't see year-to-year
improvement, let me hear about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The new right fielder is no Juan. In some ways, that's not bad
at all. nn

MIHM'S EMOTIONS SURFACE AFTER LONGHORNS' VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Texas center Chris Mihm had held his emotions
inside until after the Longhorns defeated Indiana State on Thursday
in the first round of the West Region.
</P>
<P>
   After the 77-61 victory, the emotions all came bubbling to the
surface in the team's locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a tough two and a half days,'' said Mihm, who was
late coming to postgame group interviews after he gathered himself.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Mihm learned shortly before the team boarded a jet
for Salt Lake City that his maternal grandmother had died during a
visit to the Mihm's home in West Lake Hills. The funeral is Monday
in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   ``She hadn't been sick or anything,'' Mihm said later in the
hall outside the team's quarters. ``That's what makes it so hard to
take. It's been really tough on me to try and put it aside, but I
love this team so much that I really want to be there for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing in the NCAA Tournament is such a great experience.
I've tried to put (his grandmother's death) aside and enjoy it, but
every once in a while, it creeps back in. I haven't been in much of
a laughing mood lately.''
</P>
<P>
   Mihm also was not at his best physically. He battled a
101-degree temperature overnight and said after the game he felt as
though he still had some fever.
</P>
<P>
   Because of foul problems, Mihm played only 11 minutes in the
second half. He scored 16 points, with eight rebounds and blocked
two shots, though he was officially given only one reject. He said
he found it especially rewarding that the Longhorns survived his
minutes on the bench during a crucial period in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone stepped up and did what it took,'' he said. ``I was
really pleased the way they took over the game and really handled
it the whole time I was out.'' MUONEKE'S TECHNICAL Texas forward
Gabe Muoneke dunked a pass from point guard Ivan Wagner with 10:48
left to give Texas a 56-44 lead. After Muonoke came down, he pumped
his arm and yelled, which he often does in similar situations, but
this time he was assessed a technical foul.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana State's Michael Menser sank both technical free throws
and a 3-point shot on the ensuing possession for a five-point
swing. A little more than a minute later, Indiana State crept
within 56-51.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (official) said I was taunting, but I didn't let it bother
me,'' Muoneke said. ``If (the call) had been justified, it probably
would have bothered me. But we're all human and he made a little
bit of a mistake. I've got great teammates who help keep me in the
game, and I didn't want to cause this team to lose that way.''
BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ Texas point guard Ivan Wagner's 10 assists tied his career
single-game high and set a school record for an NCAA Tournament
game, breaking the mark of nine by B.J. Tyler in a 91-77
first-round victory over Western Kentucky in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   _ Led by Chris Owens' 7-for-7 performance, the Longhorns shot a
season and team NCAA Tournament-record 61.2 percent, bettering the
58.5 percent performance the '91 Longhorns shot in a 73-65
first-round victory over St. Peter's.
</P>
<P>
   _ Chris Mihm's one official blocked shot put him at 90, tying
his single-season record set during his freshman year.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rick Barnes' NCAA Tournament record is now 3-7; UT is 8-2 in
the first round since the field expanded to 64 teams in 1985 nn

ANOTHER GIANT FALLS: MAVERICKS ROUT SPURS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ARTHUR GARCIA 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Tuesday night, the Beast in the East went down.
Thursday night, the NBA champs never had a chance to get up.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas Mavericks clamped down on the San Antonio Spurs early
and never let up, whipping the defending league champions, 110-88,
in the Alamodome.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks (27-37) have taken care of three NBA heavyweights
in a span of five days, with a 111-90 rout of Indiana, which owns
the best record in the Eastern Conference, coming on Tuesday. The
Mavs started their three-game winning streak by topping Phoenix,
currently tied with the Spurs for fourth in the West, on Saturday.
Thursday night snapped a seven-game losing streak in the Alamodome,
dating to April 21, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes to show you, you never know where your wins are going
to come from or your losses,'' Mavericks coach Don Nelson said.
``We could have thrown in the towel before these three games, but
this team kept its spirit and good things have happened. It's
happened three times now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks played with more confidence as the game wore on,
quickly moving the ball along the perimeter to negate San Antonio's
formidable inside advantage. Spurs twin towers David Robinson and
Tim Duncan were reduced to mere spectators, netting only 10 points
combined after halftime, as Mavs' 3-pointers rained down from all
corners.
</P>
<P>
   The 3-point barrage was especially pronounced in the third
period, with the Mavs initially protecting and eventually extending
their 14-point (59-45) halftime advantage. Erick Strickland and
Steve Nash deflated the Alamodome crowd with a 6-for-6 showing from
behind the 3-point line in the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're making every one of your shots and they are
missing most of theirs, that can get frustrating for the other
team,'' said Nash, who scored 10 points and handed out 11 assists.
``When we saw that happening, we did a good job of taking advantage
and did enough damage to convince (Spurs coach Gregg Popovich) to
pull on the reins a little and rest his guys for whoever they play
next.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs (41-24) and Mavs play again Tuesday at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavs sank 12 of 23 3-pointers, with Strickland making five,
Dirk Nowitzki three, Nash two and Michael Finley a pair. Strickland
finished with a game-high 26 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shot the 3 extremely well,'' Nelson said. ``We got it out
of double teams and the ball movement was crisp and the most
important thing, we were making our shots.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs, coming off an emotional high after Sean Elliott
returned from a kidney transplant on Tuesday, couldn't find a
spark. Finley didn't take it easy on Elliott, sinking four jumpers
over the Spurs forward, who didn't check back into the game after
playing eight minutes in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Spurs have yet to regain their championship form this
season, they hadn't taken many beatings like this. The 22-point
margin tied the season's previous-largest loss set Dec. 3 (102-80)
at Detroit and the Mavs nearly matched the Spurs' opponent scoring
high (111 by Houston). The most points the Spurs had allowed after
three periods before Thursday night was 83. The Mavs had 92 going
into the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the worst games I've see us play,'' Robinson
said. ``We had terrible defense. We had terrible offense. There's
not much good that can be said about this game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavs got after the defending champs early, with Finley and
Strickland scoring 10 each as they built a 34-22 lead after the
first period. Three of Finley's four jumpers came from at least 18
feet. Strickland did half of his damage from the line, sinking all
five of his free throws.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started defensively,'' Strickland said. ``We shaped our
focus defensively to stop them. We're a very confident team, but to
come in here and play like this is a little surprising.''
</P>
<P>
   While Mavs owner Mark Cuban didn't rate Thursday night's win as
the biggest under his yet-to-be official tenure, he said it ranks
right up there.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I loved about it is how we played at the defensive end,''
Cuban said. ``We created a lot of opportunities for ourselves with
our rebounding and defense.'' nn

UTAH'S PRAYER FINDS BASKET, TOPS BILLIKENS
</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Utah, redefining the meaning of ``winning ugly,''
ended Saint Louis' magical postseason run with a 48-45 victory in
the first-round of the NCAA Midwest Region on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore reserve guard Jeff Johnsen sank a 25-foot 3-point
prayer to beat the shot clock with 1:41 remaining to give the
eighth-seeded Utes (23-8) a 46-44 lead with 1:41 remaining. The
Billikens (19-14), who won four consecutive games to gain
Conference USA's automatic bid, had a chance to tie, but Dave
Fergerson's 3-pointer bounced out.
</P>
<P>
   The victory moves Utah into the second round Saturday. The Utes
will face top-seeded Michigan State, a 65-38 winner against
Valparaiso in the first game of Thursday night's session.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were fortunate when Johnsen threw that shot in,'' said Utah
coach Rick Majerus, whose team played the second half without
injured starters Jeremy Killion and Nate Althoff. ``I couldn't be
more proud of the effort our players gave. With all the injuries,
we had guys playing out of position all over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   The teams combined for 37 turnovers, 31 field goals and missed
23 of 41 free throws. Saint Louis was 9-of-22 from the line.
MICHIGAN STATE 65, VALPARAISO 38
</P>
<P>
   Top-seeded Michigan State, playing a frenetic and focused
defense, started their Final Four quest with a commanding victory.
The Spartans had a 20-3 lead before the Crusaders had their second
field goal. The Crusaders got within 37-24 early in the second half
before the Spartans went on a 17-3 run to close it out.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State (27-7) turned Valpo into Zero. The Crusaders set
a Midwest Regional record for fewest points scored. Valparaiso
(19-13) missed 14 of its first 15 shots to start the game. Starting
the second half, the Crusaders missed 14 of their first 18. For the
game, Valpo shot 25 percent, had six assists and 13 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense got our offense going,'' said Michigan State
senior guard Mateen Cleaves, who had a team-high 15 points and
eight assists. ``We did a great job on defense. That got our fast
break going. We pretty much picked up off our offense with our
defense.'' SYRACUSE 79, SAMFORD 65
</P>
<P>
   Samford couldn't find a way to stop Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   The Orangemen had four players in double figures and made 54.7
percent of their shots in an opening-round victory. The
fourth-seeded Orangemen (25-5) will play fifth-seeded Kentucky
(23-9) in Saturday's second round. The Wildcats beat St.
Bonaventure, 85-80, in double overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just kept making shots that kept breaking our heart,''
Samford senior forward Will Daniel said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs, one of the nation's top shooting teams, trailed
41-37 early in the second half. Samford's Princeton-like offense
couldn't match the Orangemen, who made 16 of 24 second-half shots
(.667 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Jason Hart and Preston Shumpert each had 17 points for Syracuse,
while Etan Thomas had 16 points, seven rebounds and four blocked
shots. nn

LAWMAKERS PROPOSE ALASKAN EMBARGO, END OF GAS TAX

<P>
   &LR;  LOS ANGELES _ You don't have to tell Deborah Morgan that gas
prices are going up quickly; she's reminded almost every day at
work.
</P>
<P>
   The 28-year-old mother of four pays as much as $100 a week to
fill the tank of the car she uses to deliver pizza and other
dinners for Bambino's Restaurant, a popular eatery in the San
Fernando Valley community of Canoga Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prices keep skyrocketing, it's ridiculous,'' said Morgan,
who pointed out that tips and delivery fees aren't increasing as
quickly as gas prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like they're cheating people out of their money,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Being an election year, politicians across the state are jumping
on the gas-price-bashing bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., on Thursday called for a
moratorium on oil company mergers and a reinstatement of the
prohibition on Alaskan oil exports in an effort to put a lid on
rising gasoline prices.
</P>
<P>
   In Sacramento, Assemblymen Tom McClintock, R-Granada Hills, and
Tony Strickland, R-Camarillo, proposed the repeal of California's 8
percent gas tax, and urged their colleagues in Washington to repeal
an 18-cent increase in the federal excise tax.
</P>
<P>
   Strickland also vowed to pay back some taxpayers. The Ventura
County assemblyman will be at a Chevron gas station in Thousand
Oaks, northwest of Los Angeles, on Friday to give customers the
state tax back on any gas they buy.
</P>
<P>
   All of this comes at a time when the cost of gasoline at
California pumps rose by more than 28 cents from February to March
alone, according to a study released this week by the Automobile
Club of Southern California. The average price of a gallon of
self-serve regular unleaded gas was $1.74.
</P>
<P>
   Small businesses across the region are feeling the pinch of
higher gasoline prices.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Fagan, owner of Byrne Home Furnishings in Burbank, said the
freight carriers that deliver furniture to his store from the
factories in North Carolina have begun charging a surcharge of 4
percent on deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   The freight carriers are attributing the charge directly to the
increase in gasoline prices, Fagan said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, he is holding the line on price, but he said he cannot
do so forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, you're going to have to reflect all of your
increases in costs and pass it along to the customer,'' Fagan said.
``That's the way business is; if you want to make your margins,
you're going to have to pass it on.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman Artan, manager of MacEnerneys Stationers in Studio City,
said his store also is holding the line on price increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been paying for the gasoline our drivers use
ourselves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Guy Starkman, vice president of operations at Studio City-based
Jerry's Famous Deli Inc., said the company is feeling the impact of
higher gas prices because it makes at least 100 deliveries a day
across Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pay $6,000 to $10,000 per month for gasoline,'' Starkman
said. ``It will hurt us, but our customers won't feel it. I can't
add a dollar to a price of a sandwich.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxer also called for the public release of secret corporate
documents she said prove the companies' involvement in price
discrimination. The documents are referenced in Federal Trade
Commission filings and show a pattern of price discrimination
against the West Coast, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Oil companies have denied any price discrimination or price
fixing.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer sent a letter Thursday to FTC Chairman Robert Pitofsky
asking the commission to demand two conditions before it approves
the proposed merger between BP Amoco and Los Angeles-based Atlantic
Richfield Co.: Release of the documents and a restriction on
exports of oil produced in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer said she also plans to introduce legislation when the
Senate reconvenes next week to restore the prohibition on exports
of Alaskan oil. The ban, first put into place in the 1970s, was
lifted in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Other federal lawmakers, including Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore.,
are taking a different approach at the same goal, urging President
Clinton to halt Alaskan exports by declaring an economic emergency.
And still others, such as McClintock and Strickland, are calling
for a repeal on federal taxes on gas.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer said repealing the federal excise tax would hurt
California.
</P>
<P>
   ``California would lose, in just two years, $1.7 billion in
highway funds,'' Boxer said. ``It would be a total disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   She proposed instead to place a moratorium on oil company
mergers until the volatility in the price of oil eases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly these mergers are responsible for higher prices,''
Boxer said Thursday. ``BP Amoco has been engaged in price
manipulation, and it has adversely affected California consumers.''

BRUINS' BARNES DELIVERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS - Perhaps the suspensions and the injuries and the
lineup shuffles and the random substitution patterns actually
helped UCLA's late-season charge.
</P>
<P>
   At least, that's what Bruins coach Steve Lavin believes.
</P>
<P>
   Most coaches strive for consistency in their starting lineups
and their substitution patterns. But Lavin believes the flux has
forged depth and resiliency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, you have five (starters) and five bench warmers,''
Lavin said. ``But with this team, every player knows he could be
called on at any moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, that man was reserve forward Matt Barnes, who
had six points and four assists and helped spark UCLA's 65-57
first-round victory over Ball State.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matt gave us a big lift,'' Bruins assistant Jim Saia said.
``He was huge.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes played just three minutes in the first half - not enough
to find his rhythm. But when Dan Gadzuric committed his third foul
with 15 minutes left and UCLA leading 32-31, Barnes checked in and
turned the game.
</P>
<P>
   Stationed at the foul line (high post) in UCLA's zone offense,
Barnes attacked the basket and made crisp passes to wing men JaRon
Rush and Jason Kapono for 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   With Barnes was on the court for five minutes, UCLA's one-point
lead expanded to 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just needed to get warmed up,'' Barnes said. ``In the first
half, I was in (for three minutes) and out. I just needed to get
warm. Then I tried to attck (Ball State center Lonnie Jones). He's
a shot blocker, and we had to attack him. He got one of my shots,
but we couldn't let him control the tempo.''
</P>
<P>
   Band man: As promised, Kapono unveiled a custom-made headband
for the NCAA Tournament. It was a bright yellow version of the
white and black issues he's worn throughout the season.
</P>
<P>
   And it didn't last long.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dormmates' mom used spray paint, and that turned it loose
and saggy,'' Kapono said. ``It was hanging by my ears. It turned a
band on my head into an earpiece.''
</P>
<P>
   Kapono tossed the yellow and grabbed a white headband a few
minutes into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Pass happy? Another source of UCLA's late-season success has
been its propensity to pass before dribbling.
</P>
<P>
   Check the numbers: In a nine-game stretch from early-January to
mid-February, the Bruins didn't have a 20-assist game.
</P>
<P>
   In their last nine regular-season games, they had at least 20
assists four times.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, they had 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've become pass-oriented,'' Saia said. ``Our past teams
created more off the dribble. There was a reason why. We had guys
like Baron Davis and Toby Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we thought this team would be more effective offensively
if we were pass-oriented. That's been a big thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Not again: Gadzuric had 10 points and grabbed 12 rebounds
despite a mildly sprained left thumb suffered Wednesday in practice
- an injury that rekindled bad memories for Lavin.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he got hurt, part of me was thinking, `That's par for the
course,''' Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins played without their starting center for most of the
past three tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Jelani McCoy played sparingly in the Elite Eight
against Minnesota because of a bruised sternum. In 1998, McCoy quit
the team weeks before the tournament. Last year, Gadzuric was out
with a knee injury.

2 DEPUTIES ARE SHOT WHILE SEEKING ARREST OF EX-BLACK PANTHER 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Two sheriff's deputies were shot and seriously wounded
near downtown Atlanta late Thursday night while serving a warrant
at the home of a Muslim cleric who was known in the 1960s as H. Rap
Brown, a leader of the Black Panther party.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Fulton County Sheriff's Office said they did
not know whether Brown, now known as Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin, shot
the two deputies. The gunman escaped after being wounded by one of
the deputies, and sheriff's officials said they were looking for
Al-Amin. They released a description of the man that seemed to
match that of the former militant.
</P>
<P>
   An intense manhunt was under way in a four-block area of
southwest Atlanta surrounding Al-Amin's mosque and home. SWAT teams
and police dogs searched homes in the area, at one point following
a trail of blood that led to an empty house.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff Jackie Barrett said the deputies were serving a warrant
issued in suburban Cobb County for aggravated assault and weapons
possession. The deputies were shot with a semi-automatic weapon
when the door was opened, she said. Both men were wearing
bulletproof vests; one was in critical condition and the other in
guarded condition at Grady Memorial Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin has lived in Atlanta for about 25 years, leading the
Community Mosque and running a small grocery store. In the 1960s
and 70s, he led the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee and
was justice minister of the Black Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, a neighborhood resident accused Al-Amin of shooting him
but later recanted, saying police had pressured him into making the
identification. Al-Amin's lawyer said at the time that police were
looking for any excuse to charge Al-Amin with a major crime.

PROGRAM BACKS INDEPENDENT FILMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARLA MATZER ROSE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  BEVERLY HILLS _ In the first effort of its kind to bolster
Hollywood's film industry, federal officials said Thursday they are
initiating a loan guarantee program for independent productions
that could trigger up to $100 million in funding during its first
year.
</P>
<P>
   The program by the Export-Import Bank of the United States is
limited to members of the American Film Marketing Association, a
trade group of the independent film industry, and qualified
lenders. It will generally provide 90 percent of the financing for
films with budgets between $1 million to $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   The program is similar to loan guarantees the bank offers
industries whose products or services are exported.
</P>
<P>
   Independent projects _ those not financed by major studios _
employ about 150,000 people. The industry encompasses giants like
Walt Disney Co.-owned Miramax down to small, low-budget operations
that churn out cheap movies for TV and direct-to- video.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Film Production Guarantee Program we are announcing today
will create jobs, promote international trade and contribute to the
artistic legacy of American film,'' said Sen. Barbara Boxer,
D-Calif., during a news conference in Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   It will provide a boost to an industry that already ranks among
the nation's leading export industries and job providers, she said.
</P>
<P>
   By providing a guaranteed ``safety net'' for banks, the
Export-Import Bank expects to make more money available for
production, thus stimulating more film jobs in the U.S. and Los
Angeles county.
</P>
<P>
   While claims this measure will solve the problem of ``runaway
production'' to Canada and elsewhere, producers and representatives
of the Los Angeles film office are optimistic about the program's
effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you make it easier for producers to stay here, it's
good,'' said Morrie Goldman, spokesman for Los Angeles'
Entertainment Industry Development Corporation, who called the
announcement a positive sign.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Morgan, chairman of AFMA and a longtime foreign sales
agent for independent films, said the program sends an important
signal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure the government has really taken our industry that
seriously, even though we're one of the top export industries in
the nation,'' Morgan said. ``I consider myself a citizen of the
world _ I travel all over _ but as an American and a native
Angeleno ... I think this signals that the film industry is a
valued American business.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Clegg, vice chair and chief operating officer of the
export bank, said coming up with the right program was a tough
battle that took several years.
</P>
<P>
   Here is how the program works. An independent producer finances
his film by preselling it to distributors around the world prior to
the start of production. Based on the track record of the movie's
producers, director and stars, international distributors calculate
how much they will pay to show the film, then sign a contract with
the producer for that amount.
</P>
<P>
   The producer then takes those contracts to a bank to secure a
loan.
</P>
<P>
   Many banks are skittish about lending against contracts from
``secondary markets'' in places such as Russia and Southeast Asia,
where the currency is volatile.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, many producers can only get a loan equal to the amount of
their contracts with major markets such as Western European
countries.
</P>
<P>
   The EIB will, with a number of conditions attached, guarantee to
banks that they will be covered for any losses. For example, if
there is a currency crisis in a foreign country before the film
comes out, the bank will not be at risk of losing its money.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers and producers are first in line to benefit from the
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a perfect example of someone who will benefit,'' Morgan
said. ``I presell rights; when I put money into a film, I'm the
last one out. The banks get paid before me.''
</P>
<P>
   The EIB won't put banks out of business, since it will be
providing a guarantee rather than a loan. The bank will be the
entity that submits the proposal and interacts with the EIB.
</P>
<P>
   Only independent, non-studio financed pictures will be eligible
for the program. Producers are required to show that at least half
their financing is coming from overseas, and guarantee a 50 percent
``American content'' to the production, which includes pre- and
post-production.
</P>
<P>
   The program therefore doesn't guarantee that movies will shoot
in the U.S., but it does encourage it.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these countries around the world are coming up with
incentive programs, and this can't totally combat that,'' said
Morgan. Both she and Goldman said, though, that most producers,
actors and crew prefer to stay in California when at all possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still a ways to go, but these little baby steps
help,'' Morgan said.

RAGGED ZAGS REKINDLE THEIR TOURNEY FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. _ For awhile, it looked as if Gonzaga had returned
to the NCAA tournament just to do some dirty dancing.
</P>
<P>
   Goodness knows, it was not all pretty.
</P>
<P>
   With senior swingman Mike Nilson on the bench with a ruptured
Achilles tendon and their rotation on a leash short enough to choke
the breath out of them, the Bulldogs were piling up turnovers
faster than a crew of Pillsbury Dough Boys. They were in danger of
imploding.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crowd wasn't safe,'' senior guard Matt Santangelo said.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the first half, Louisville ran up a seven-point
lead, and somehow it seemed like all the karma and all the magic
and all the deja vu all over again just wasn't going to happen this
time for the Bulldogs.
</P>
<P>
   But then what would we know?
</P>
<P>
   These are the Zags, right?
</P>
<P>
   Ornery, determined, hard-nosed with a winner's mentality. Did
someone dare suggest the Zags were almost down and out in Round 1
of this year's NCAA tourney because of a little first-half hiccup?
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, it was only seven points, and the reason we were down was
because we were doing some things that are very uncharacteristic
for us,'' Santangelo said afterward, with a grin, but not all that
sweet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been down in games before. We knew once we settled down,
we'd be all right. Seven points is not anything to start calling
home about.''
</P>
<P>
   No, that would have been very premature.
</P>
<P>
   And as much as the Zags like the serenity and security of their
Bing Crosby-John Stockton-neat-little-city-by-the-river out there
in Washington's Inland Empire, they just didn't figure it was time
to head back. Yet.
</P>
<P>
   We could get used to this, couldn't we?
</P>
<P>
   Or, rather: We have gotten used to all this Gonzaga stuff. It's
not really March Madness anymore as much as it's Zag Madness.
</P>
<P>
   And here they go, here we go again.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, riding the same No. 10 seed they used as a
jet-propulsion magic carpet one year ago, the Zags refused to let a
mess of 24 turnovers shoot down their latest mission.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the second half, the Zags turned up the heat on
No. 7-seed Louisville, riding senior shooting guard Richie Frahm's
31-point blastoff and nifty defense to, yes, another ``upset''
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 49-48, Louisville's Quintin Bailey was off on a
breakaway only to find his dunk attempt stuffed from behind from
Frahm. The momentum shift was enormous as Frahm broke back down
court, taking a pass on the right baseline from Santangelo and
burying a 3-point grenade.
</P>
<P>
   In the stands at the McKale Center, the legions of Gonzaga fans
erupted in glee.
</P>
<P>
   The Zags' lead was 52-48 and they were not done salting this one
away.
</P>
<P>
   Back down under the Louisville basket, it looked as if
Louisville coach Denny Crum had reason to be miffed when the Zags
roughed up one of his shooters. But without a call against Gonzaga,
Crum and his bench were instead whistled for a technical when the
refs called a foul on Reece Gaines on the Zags' next possession.
</P>
<P>
   Frahm hit one of the two free throws, and the Zags never looked
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was just huge. It was more than just a five-point
turnaround,'' Santangelo said. ``That was a huge shift in momentum.
It got the crowd back into it. It got Richie playing with a lot of
emotion and with high energy, and it lifted the team up.
</P>
<P>
   ``When one of your players goes out and makes a play that's pure
effort, that wasn't about skill. That just pure heart that got that
done, and it let us open up a little bit of a lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, that would explain the circus alley-oop jam Casey
Calvary threw down from a pin-point pass from Frahm to push the
Zag's lead to 58-52. And it would explain Calvary's ensuing blocked
shot _ the one that sent a Louisville jumpshot attempt into orbit
north towards Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the second half was rolling to a close, Louisville
had folded up its cards, crumbling under a 37-percent shooting
performance while the Zags, led by Frahm, hit for 57 percent.
</P>
<P>
   By the end, the turnovers were a mere footnote to the way Frahm
shot the Zags out of trouble and the way the entire team buckled
down to get the job done.
</P>
<P>
   But what else would you expect from these guys?
</P>
<P>
   ``This group is made up of a lot of winners,'' coach Mark Few
said.
</P>
<P>
   Which means the Zags are not done.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is actually nice to get that one win out of the way,''
Santangelo said. ``There's a little bit of weight off our
shoulders, but we didn't come here to play and get one win and go
home. We came to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kind of have a chip on our shoulder. We're still fighting
for a little bit of respect, I feel.''
</P>
<P>
   We know how it is with these guys. We've all been here before,
as in exactly one year ago. That's when the 10th-seeded Zags
knocked off seventh-seeded Minnesota at KeyArena and then rolled
through No. 2 Stanford and Florida in the Sweet 16 before falling
to UConn in the Elite Eight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of comforting to be the 10 seed playing the 7
seed, truthfully,'' Santangelo said. ``I just felt very comfortable
with it, like we had been in this position before.''
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the motivation against Stanford a year ago was immense.
The West Coast Conference champs wanted to prove something. The
Zags know the Cardinal like the back of their hands.
</P>
<P>
   But what the heck. If this year's No. 2 seed waiting for the
Zags is St. John's, the Zags say bring them on. They've been down
this yellow brick road before.

PEPPERDINE MAY HAVE EDGE IN QUICKNESS

<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. - It's fitting that the Buffalo Naval and Service
Park is adjacent to the Mainland Midland Arena, where Pepperdine
opens the NCAA Tournament tonight against Indiana in the East
Regional.
</P>
<P>
   The battleships on display provide an appropriate reminder for
what the Waves must do to beat the Hoosiers: Aggressively defend
Indiana guard A.J. Guyton, attack on offense and, most important,
not be intimidated.
</P>
<P>
   Tipoff is scheduled for 7:20 PST. Pepperdine (24-8), the West
Coast Conference regular-season champion, is making its first
appearance in the tournament since 1994 and 12th overall. Indiana
(20-8), the sixth seed, finished fifth in the Big Ten.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a quick, aggressive, well-put-together team,'' Indiana
coach Bob Knight said. ``It's a team that I'd like to watch play.
Now how much I'm going to want to watch them tomorrow night, I'm
not sure. But they're a team that, if I was going to go watch a
team, this is one I'd enjoy watching.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, this is the NCAA Tournament, and if the Waves weren't
sure about the magnitude prior to arriving here, they are now.
</P>
<P>
   The electric buzz around the city, abundance of national media
and the beautiful, vast arena they'll play in are impossible to
overlook.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely going through our head right now,'' said
sophomore guard Brandon Armstrong, the Waves' leading scorer. ``But
we had a good season this year, we played a tough schedule, been in
some big games. So, once (we get settled), it will calm down.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong is a big reason Pepperdine is here, averaging 14.1
points in his first year playing with the Waves. He, along with
point guard Tezale Archie and reserve guard Craig Lewis, give
Pepperdine a versatile, three-pronged look in the backcourt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indiana's probably more physical then we are, but I think our
quickness is to our advantage,'' said Lewis, who averages 7.7
points off the bench. ``We'd like to get the game up-tempo, try to
pressure the ball and take the ball out of the hands of their main
players and make some other players (handle it).''
</P>
<P>
   If the Waves manage more than 70 points against Indiana, they'll
have a chance. The Hoosiers are 6-6 when allowing opponents more
then 70 points.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana's best player is senior A.J. Guyton, the Big Ten co-
player of the year and a first team All-American. Guyton, 6-2,
presents a number of problems defensively. He's a darting,
penetrating guard equally strong from the outside as on drives to
the basket. Indiana is 13-4 when Guyton scores 20 or more points,
and he's at his best in big games, averaging 24.1 points this year
against nationally ranked teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's obviously the key to their team,'' said Pepperdine coach
Jan van Breda Kolff.
</P>
<P>
   But there are others to watch out for. Kirk Haston, a 6-10
center, averages 15.8 points and point guard Michael Lewis,
Indiana's career assists leader, is averaging 10.5 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's their unsung hero,'' van Breda Kolff said.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves, who spent considerable time in practice this week
concentrating on Guyton, will use their fullcourt press to minimize
the time Indiana has in halfcourt sets. When the ball is in
Guyton's hands, they want to force him to the sidelines. Although
he's a terrific scorer, he is just an adequate ballhandler.
Pepperdine forward Tommie Prince, its best defender, will guard
Guyton most of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have to do is limit his touches and stay aggressive on
defense like we have all year,'' Prince said.

ANEES: NO SALE? NO SWEAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA - Alex Hassinger doesn't seem to be distracted. Anees
certainly doesn't seem to be.
</P>
<P>
   The trainer and his big horse concentrated on getting ready for
the 2-year-old champion's first start of the season even as his
ownership underwent a change - and a change back - this week.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Saudi Prince Ahmed Salman's Thoroughbred Corp.
announced it had sold a 50 percent interest in Anees to Silicon
Valley executive David Shimmon for a reported $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, Shimmon, a newcomer to the racing scene,
had paid $2 million for a colt at the Barretts March sale in Pomona
to match the record auction price for a 2-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday, the Anees sale was reported to have fallen through
under unclear circumstances, Shimmon backing out even though the
horse passed a veterinarian's check. Thoroughbred Corp. racing
manager Richard Mulhall did not return telephone calls seeking
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, preparations went on for the first step toward
the Kentucky Derby for Anees, a son of 1990 Derby winner Unbridled
and grandson of 1978 Triple Crown runner-up Alydar.
</P>
<P>
   After having his training interrupted for three weeks in January
by a left hind foot bruise, delaying the start of his 2000
campaign, Anees is scheduled to run in the $250,000 San Felipe
Stakes at Santa Anita on Sunday. Jerry Bailey replaces retired
jockey Gary Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition is expected to consist of Fusaichi Pegasus (Kent
Desormeaux), the $4 million yearling purchase; The Deputy (Chris
McCarron), the Irish-bred Santa Catalina Stakes winner; Commendable
(Chris Antley), trained by D. Wayne Lukas for Bob and Beverly
Lewis, and Promontory Gold (Corey Nakatani), who is 2 for 3 in turf
races for Bobby Frankel.
</P>
<P>
   None of the four had beaten winners by Nov. 6, the day Anees
rallied from 14th to win the Breeders' Cup Juvenile at Gulfstream
Park at 30-1 odds.
</P>
<P>
   But because of Anees' winter setback, and the assumption he
won't be 100 percent fit for Sunday's 1 1/16-mile race, both
Fusaichi Pegasus and The Deputy are expected to go lower in the
betting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably would have liked one more race before this one,''
said Hassinger, who will have to hope this race and the April 8
Santa Anita Derby are enough to get Anees ready for the May 6
Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the ultimate goal with this horse is to have him at
his best in the Kentucky Derby,'' Hassinger said. ``Just as last
year we wanted him at his best, if he was good enough, for the
Breeders' Cup. I think the program we set up for him last year was
perfect, from his maiden win to the Norfolk (Stakes) to the
Breeders' Cup. And I think this program we have set up is very
similar. I think the mile-and-a-16th, mile-and-an-eighth,
mile-and-a-quarter (progression) is a perfect scenario.''
</P>
<P>
   Hassinger is confident that Anees, because of his light frame
and his running style, can get into racing shape faster than most
horses. He's also certain Anees is good enough to compete in the
Derby, something many trainers are still trying to prove with their
3-year-olds in a year when the Triple Crown picture is slow to come
into focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can really make a call on it (the Derby),''
Hassinger said the week after Mighty upset Captain Steve in the
Louisiana Derby and Hal's Hope edged High Yield in the Florida
Derby to become the first 3-year-old male to win two graded stakes
this season. ``I think there's three, four, five horses who seem
very interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Hassinger thinks those horses include Surfside, the leading 3-
year-old filly, although her Santa Anita Oaks victory Sunday was
less impressive than future-book bettors would have liked to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has one important factor (going for her): She keeps
winning,'' Hassinger said. ``It's really hard to take a lot away
from her.''
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, Hassinger thinks the ``interesting'' 3-year-olds
include Anees. The rest of us can decide for ourselves Sunday when
he races for the first time since the Breeders' Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Also this weekend: In what might be termed the horseback Ryder
Cup, four-man teams representing the United States and Europe will
compete Saturday at Santa Anita in the third International Jockey
Challenge.
</P>
<P>
   It's Chris McCarron, Laffit Pincay, Pat Day and Mike Smith for
Team USA, which won the competition in 1998 with a dramatic 1-2-3-4
finish in the final race, and Frankie Dettori, Kieren Fallon,
Michael Kinane and Gerald Mosse for Team Europe, which evened the
score in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The teams assign riders to horses in races 3 through 5, and the
competition will be settled on a points basis. Santa Anita will
offer a special pick-four bet.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the tragedy: The California Horse Racing Board continues
to investigate the accident that killed jockey J.C. Gonzalez last
Sept. 9 at Fairplex Park.
</P>
<P>
   Among the revelations so far: Gonzalez's mount, Wolfhunt, whose
breakdown triggered the accident, was treated legally with
cortisone and two other therapeutic drugs two days before the race
after veterinarian John Araujo found inflammation in a foreleg; and
Araujo was fined $200 for failing to report the medications as
required.
</P>
<P>
   The eventual findings could determine whether there will be
legal action by Gonzalez's family, which has used the Public
Records Act to acquire the preliminary necropsy report on Wolfhunt
produced at UC Davis.

BAKER'S RETURN SPARKS SONICS TO SEASON SWEEP OF GRIZZLIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Vancouver Grizzlies have probably seen enough of
the Sonics for one week.
</P>
<P>
   Vin Baker, on the other hand, apparently had seen enough of his
closet and the Sonics' training room. Baker stepped out of street
clothes Thursday and back into the lineup after missing two games
with a strained left hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics then yanked the welcome mat in KeyArena and bounced
the Grizzlies, 117-103, in the teams' second meeting in four days.
The victory was the Sonics' fourth against Vancouver, completing a
season sweep that included a 113-103 victory Monday at General
Motors Place.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the Sonics spared no offense _ and not much defense,
for that matter _ in sending Vancouver to its 10th straight loss.
The Grizzlies, who shot 54 percent, made an occasional threat but
the Sonics remained in command from the time both teams peeled away
warmup gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those professional wins,'' Sonics coach Paul
Westphal said. ``It was a game you had to take care of, and we
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Westphal's crew maintained its sixth-place standing in the
Western Conference playoff picture. The Sonics are behind three
games in the loss column to idle Phoenix (40-23) for the fifth seed
and are still within striking distance of fourth seed San Antonio
(42-23).
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics are ready for a Pacific Division showdown Saturday as
the Portland Trail Blazers visit KeyArena.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary (Payton) and I were talking in the showers,'' Sonics
guard Vernon Maxwell said. ``We have to make a statement in that
game. We haven't beaten those guys all year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics' record against winning teams is 16-19, but they
usually flex a little muscle against subpar opponents. Thursday
night, the Sonics improved to 23-7 against losing teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're supposed to beat those guys, but we knew it was going to
be a tougher game,'' center Horace Grant said. ``We can't take
these teams under .500 for granted. We lost to Atlanta here (on
Feb. 25). We learned our lesson.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics led by double digits most of the second half, but the
Grizzlies twice got to within seven. Each time the Sonics answered
Vancouver's run with a quick score. A Brent Barry 3-pointer put the
Sonics ahead 108-98 with 1:26 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't remember the last time we guarded anybody,'' Vancouver
coach Lionel Hollins said. ``We're just not guarding. I don't know
if we can get back to guarding people before the season ends, but
we have a few days to work on it.
</P>
<P>
   Barry finished with 21 points, and Payton led the Sonics with 30
points and 16 assists. Baker's game obviously wasn't hurt by the
time off. Despite picking up his fifth foul with 5:14 to play in
the third, Baker had 21 points and seven rebounds in 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have a lot of discomfort,'' Baker said. ``The time
off helped my knees a lot. It gave my legs a chance to rest so it
was like starting over again. ... I was really overzealous. It was
a nice rhythm.''
</P>
<P>
   As rhythm goes, the Sonics began the game much like their
meeting earlier this week. Payton fueled a dominant first quarter
by hitting seven of his first 10 shots. The Sonics' offense simply
ran through the Grizzlies' defense with Payton and his teammates
driving hard to the basket.
</P>
<P>
   With Payton resting on the bench, the Sonics' offense bogged
down at the start of the second quarter. The Grizzlies took
advantage of lagging defense as well and scored eight consecutive
points to pull within 40-34.
</P>
<P>
   A Greg Foster jumper then started a quick 7-3 run that put the
Sonics back in front 47-37. Payton later made two free throws that
gave the Sonics a 64-54 advantage just before the end of the
second.
</P>
<P>
   Payton tallied 23 points by halftime and the Sonics led 64-57 at
that point.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics jumped out to a 40-26 lead in the first, the most
points Seattle had scored in a quarter all season. The 40 also tied
a Vancouver record for the most points allowed in one period.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle shot 73 percent in the opening frame and 54 percent for
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They put the ball in the basket but we were able to find more
ways to get the ball in the basket,'' Westphal said. ``We did what
we had to do.''

uncrowded waiting rooms, uninterrupted office visits and an office
staff that knows the patients. Nearly a decade after President
Clinton's failed effort to remake health care in America, the
health care market is remaking itself. For those with insurance or
the money to pay for health care, there is evolving a two-tiered
system. One tier is made up of doctors who have cut their prices at
the insistence of health insurers and who make up for the reduced
prices by increasing their volume. The other tier is made up of
those who offer time and attention _ but at a cost. By Lawrence K.

   MAPLE-SYRUP (Whitingham, Vt.) _ Early spring quickens in this
state's southern mountain hamlets with the first rising curls of
wood smoke from roadside sugar houses and the sweet fragrance of
newly boiled amber maple syrup served pure and plain in thin paper
cups. Unlike a winery, a sugar house gets just one chance a year to
prove the mettle of its maple with fresh tastings for amateur
connoisseurs: for only about 45 days in the spring, when the nights
are cold and the days are warm enough to coax the sap to flow. And
it is a fleeting opportunity for tourists to experience the
small-town spell of a pancake breakfast flapped by the local Lions
or an afternoon luncheon or ham supper prepared a la maple by
groups like the Ladies Benevolent Society of Whitingham or the E-Z
Riders Snowmobile Club. Vermont is, after all, the top producer of
maple syrup in the United States, with 370,000 gallons last year,
or more than a third of all the maple syrup in the country. By

   PEOPLES-SYMPHONY (new York) _ The most persistent complaint
among potential classical music listeners _ and regular
concertgoers as well _ is that ticket prices for the best-known
ensembles and soloists are so high as to discourage
experimentation. But there are venues that offer knowledgeable
listeners superb music at budget prices. One of the most notable is
the Peoples' Symphony Concerts, which for a century have been
giving knowledgeable listeners a break. Founded in 1900 by Franz X.
Arens, an immigrant conductor who found high ticket prices
objectionable even then, Peoples' Symphony these days presents
mostly recitals and chamber music in a schedule balanced between
established performers and promising newcomers. This season, the
Juilliard, Guarneri and Colorado String Quartets and the pianists
Ignat Solzehnitsyn and Orli Shaham have already appeared on the
series. Tickets now cost dollars rather than pennies, but the
prices remain remarkably low. A subscription to six Saturday
evening concerts costs $19, with single tickets going for $5. By

KAPONO SPARKS UCLA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS - They swore it would be different this year. Their
practices were tougher, they claimed. Their preparation was better,
they said. Their focus was sharper. They vowed not to overlook the
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   And the UCLA Bruins were right - right as a Jason Kapono
3-pointer. There was no lethargy, there was no indifference, and
there was no first-round loss.
</P>
<P>
   Kapono drained three 3-pointers early in the second half to fuel
UCLA's 65-57 victory over Ball State on Thursday before 20,127 in
the Metrodome. Winners of seven consecutive games, the Bruins will
play No. 3 seed Maryland on Saturday in the second round - a round
further than last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't a relief,'' UCLA guard Earl Watson said. ``I'd say
it's a step forward. We came in here thinking we had to win six
games (to win the national title). Now we have to win five.''
</P>
<P>
   For that they can thank Kapono, the smooth-shooting freshman.
Scoreless in the first half, he had 17 points in the second -
including the 3-pointers that helped turn a 28-22 deficit into a
47-33 lead with 11 minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jason's our leading scorer, and when he started going, that
brought the whole offense along,'' said Bruins forward JaRon Rush,
who made three 3-pointers himself and finished with 14 points. ``He
gave us the spark.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins made 6-of-11 3-pointers in the second half. They
outrebounded Ball State 46-34. They had four players in double
figures, and their zone defense held the Cardinals to 35.8 percent
shooting. In charg ing to the 14-point lead, they played with the
same energy and efficienc y used to upset Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   But turnovers and bad foul shooting turned the apparent rout
into a close game, and with three minutes left, Ball State trailed
55-51. Kapono hit four free throws in the final minutes to seal the
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't the type of game we planned on playing,'' Kapono
said. ``It was a funky first-round tournament game. We weren't
nervous, but we had a tough time getting a feel. JaRon and I hit
some 3s, and then o ur post guys got some looks.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins (20-11) started well and held an 18-9 lead when their
bad habits surfaced. Watson's errant alley-oop pass to Rush off the
backboard became a Ball State lay-up - and a four-point swing.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a 20-9 lead, UCLA's margin was 18-11, and the
momentum shifted for the remainder of the half.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Gadzuric's turnaround gave the Bruins a 22-20 lead, but Ball
State countered with Cedric Moodie's 3-pointer from the left wing.
With 1:18 left in the half, the Cardinals had their first lead.
Reserve guard Patrick Jackson ended the half with a 3-pointer from
the left corner, increasing Ball State's margin to 26-22. UCLA had
scored four points in the final 8:30.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very calm at halftime,'' Rush said. ``We got loose
defensively and let them come back. But we've been in those
situations before. We didn't panic.''
</P>
<P>
   The second half began as the first ended. Ball State's Theron
Smith hit a difficult jumper from the left baseline for a six-point
lead. The Bruins countered with Jerome Moiso's dunk, but they went
scoreless for five possessions against the Cardinals' zone defense.
</P>
<P>
   With 16:40 left, Kapono broke the drought, and brought out.
First, he buried a 3-pointer from the left wing - his first basket
of the game. After a Ball State miss, Kapono drained one from the
right wing.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the Bruins had a 30-28 lead and Ball State called time
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame we let Kapono get away from us,'' Ball State
guard Mickey Hosier said.
</P>
<P>
   The teams exchanged baskets for several minutes, then Kapono
struck again - this time from the right corner off a crosscourt
pass from Watson.
</P>
<P>
   The 3-pointer gave UCLA a 39-33 lead and the momentum it had
lost in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``(At halftime) I told (Kapono) to let the game come to him,''
Watson said. ``When he started doing that, it opened up everything
we wanted to do. Once Jason got started, our team got started.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's defense smothered the Cardinals each time they entered
the lane. Their fifth-consecutive scoreless possession became a
Rush 3-pointer from the left wing - and a nine-point lead. A few
seconds later, reserve Matt Barnes found Rush for another
3-pointer, and the margin was 45-33.

LAVIN BARELY HOLDS OFF CRITICS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS - You could sense the critics circling Steve Lavin
as though he were a candy-filled pinata, waiting for their chance
to take another whack.
</P>
<P>
   For eight-and-a-half minutes Thursday night, UCLA's season
looked like it was going to pieces. The Bruins couldn't crack Ball
State's 2-3 zone and were defending their basket like the Keystone
Cops.
</P>
<P>
   Almost as quickly as you can say Detroit Mercy, the Bruins
frittered away an 18-9 lead. They made Ball State's zone look like
Temple's, missing 11 of their final 13 shots before intermission to
fall behind 26-22.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA appeared clueless on offense and disorganized on defense.
It looked like last year's game against Detroit Mercy (a 56-53
loss) all over again. From 1,500 miles away you could feel Pauley's
posse turning its louring eyes to Lavin.
</P>
<P>
   That the Bruins came out in the second half and built a double-
digit lead before settling for a too-close-for-gloating 65-57 win
will appease Lavin's critics a little.
</P>
<P>
   But probably not a lot.
</P>
<P>
   With the possible exception of Kentucky's Tubby Smith, there
might not have been a lonelier winning coach on the opening day of
the NCAA Tournament than Lavin.
</P>
<P>
   Say this for the Bruins' fourth-year coach: Sometimes it looks
like he has about as much control over his players as Alan
Greenspan does the Dow Jones industrial average. But whatever he
said at halftime on this night clearly got UCLA back on track.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins found the seams and gaps in Ball State's zone and
their shooting rhythm quickly followed. Behind the hot hand of
freshman Jason Kapono, who contributed all 17 of his points in the
second half, the Bruins embarked on a 15-0 run in the sixth minute
to wrest the lead away from the Cardinals for keeps.
</P>
<P>
   Kapono made one of his four baskets from beyond the arc in that
span. JaRon Rush added two 3-pointers to open the inside
effectively for Jerome Moiso, Dan Gadzuric and Matt Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   As far as strategies go, it was a lot more effective than the
one guard Earl Watson employed in the first half; he stubbornly
kept lobbing alley-oop passes for highlight finishes. They turned
out to be grenades that blew up in the Bruins' faces. None did more
damage than the off-the-backboard pass Watson threw to Rush in an
effort to extend UCLA's lead to 20-9 in a manner that would raise
the roof of the Metrodome.
</P>
<P>
   The ball bounced long, Ball State got it and Cedric Moodie drove
for a layup at the other end to start the Cardinals on a 17-4 run.
</P>
<P>
   Some coaches would have yanked Watson right away and filled his
ear with loud wisdom. Indiana's Bob Knight might have gone a lot
farther than that. Lavin left Watson alone to figure it out
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Different strokes for different folks.
</P>
<P>
   After the game a contrite-sounding Watson said any stern lecture
Lavin delivered would have merely been echoing his inner voice. ``I
don't need coach Lavin to tell me I need to keep things simple,''
said Watson, who had nine of his 12 assists in the second half.
``If the plays went down, obviously it would have been a great
spark for our team.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the Bruins learned there can be exhilaration in
simplicity. Because if they aren't really careful with the ball
Saturday, they'll get strangled by Maryland's pressure defense. ``I
know I have to handle the ball better against Maryland,'' Watson
said, ``or we're going to be down by 10 or 15 points.''
</P>
<P>
   It would help, too, if Moiso could shoulder part of the
rebounding load. On Thursday he finished with one defensive
rebound. Gadzuric grabbed 12.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike last year, the Bruins have a second chance to impress the
naysayers. They can only hope they make more of it than they did
Thursday, when they allowed Ball State more points on putbacks than
they got.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, as Lavin was quick to point out, is the Bruins
survived and advanced. He also said the nail-biting game against
the 11th-seeded Cardinals ``went kind of the way we expected.''
</P>
<P>
   That is probably not going to impress Bruins fans much. A No.6
seed is supposed to go into a first-round game expecting to put
away its opponent handily, not let it hang within two baskets of
the lead with a little over two minutes remaining.
</P>
<P>
   But we digress. UCLA's victory Thursday was its seventh in a row
so, yes, one basketball winning streak in L.A. remains alive. But
not for much longer unless the Bruins practice what Lavin is going
hoarse trying to preach.

UCLA FINDS COMFORT ZONE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS - Talk about advanced notice. UCLA saw this coming
for a year. Its first-round opponent - in this case, Ball State -
was going to play a zone defense. After watching Detroit Mercy zone
the Bruins into early elimination last year, how could Ball State
not give its zone a shot?
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent half our practice time this week on zone offense,''
said Bruins assistant Jim Saia, who oversees the offense. ``We
(begin ital)knew(end ital) they were going to zone us.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, Ball State started the game in a man-to-man defense
and switched to its 2-3 zone midway through the first half. The
logic was solid: The Cardinals weren't as big as UCLA and could not
stop the Bruins inside, so why not play a compact zone and force
them to score from the perimeter?
</P>
<P>
   Detroit did it. Gonzaga did it earlier this year, as well, in a
16-point victory at Pauley Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bruins were ready. After a sputtering first half, they
found their groove and shot their way into the second round with a
65-57 victory Thursday in the Metrodome.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers tell the story: In the second half, UCLA shot 55.6
percent from the field, 54.5 percent from 3-point range and had 12
assists. They whipped the ball inside and out, over the zone and
through it. One sequence, which ended with a JaRon Rush 3-pointer,
featured five bullet passes to open men.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked on the zone offense all week,'' Rush said, ``so we
knew exactly what to do: Get the ball into the middle and hit the
corners.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins were so effective, they actually forced Ball State
out of the zone, a dramatic change from the events of last March.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first half, we weren't really in the flow,'' Saia said.
``We were settling for jump shots. I thought, `Oh, no, it's deja
vu.' But we finally got some rhythm shots (from Rush and Jason
Kapono), and we got the ball moving from side to side.''
</P>
<P>
   For Saia, the results were especially gratifying.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had no problems with the zone except in the Gonzaga
game, and now I think we're prepared for all kinds of zones,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Against Detroit, we had a hard time attacking it. But the
coaching staff has helped the guys so that now I think we can
attack zones better than at any time since we've been together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every zone has holes, you just have to know where to find
them. We educated the players about where the gaps in the zone are
and what passes are open. Now they can instantly recognize where to
attack. Zones are beatable.''
</P>
<P>
   Point proven.

   What now for Kim Dae Jung, who restored South Korea's fortunes,
bolstered its democracy, tried to make friends with the communist
North _ and yet stands to be rejected by many voters when his
country goes to the polls on April 13? When he was decisively
elected South Korea's president in 1997, he was considered
something of a maverick, but nevertheless the right man for the
time and the job. &QL;

   Now there is a cheaper way for business travellers to fly on a
private jet. On March 9 a new Internet travel agent,
flightserv.com, launched ``Private Seats'' to allow people to buy
individual seats on chartered private jets. Starting April 17,
flights between New York and Atlanta will cost $900, only $40 more
than a business-class seat on Delta Airlines. The private jet in
America may be the last luxury toy for big boys. But in the land of
the car pool, the plane pool just might take off. &QL;

   It is Kosovo time again. Even if the passage of a year since
NATO's decision to bomb the Serbs out of Kosovo were not prompting
retrospection, thoughts would anyway be turning towards that
luckless corner of the Balkans. The place is a mess, and the risk
is that NATO, having won the war, is about to lose the peace. &QL;

   The museums of the world are full of other countries' art.
Unfortunately, this happy state of affairs was not always brought
about in the proudest of circumstances. Much museum art was
acquired by dubious means, if not by outright looting. So it is
with the controversial Elgin marble sculptures in the British
Museum. Should they be returned to their original home, Greece? In
such matters, alas, the answer isn't set in stone. &QL;

is now more than six weeks into the longest, biggest white-collar
strike in American history. The strike has exposed the growing gap
in America's skilled classes. For many of the engineers, the bigger
change has been the way that Seattle man has given way to Redmond
man in Seattle's hierarchy. The explosive growth of Microsoft,
Amazon.com and other ``new economy'' firms has left the Boeing
engineers looking old and poor. &QL;

   The half-dozen Southern primary contests that took place this

important role in the coming general election than is recognized.
And it could mean that, whatever his current problems, the race is
still George W. Bush's to lose. After years in which the South was
a GOP stronghold, the Democrats have found a way into the fortress.
Bush, like Sherman, has to sweep it. &QL;

family's retirement nest egg has been squandered on unexpected
legal expenses. Such are the facts the Clinton household might
provide to the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a huge $100

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: PETA milks its sacred cows
 &HT;    (Eds: Please note the clarification of a previous column at the
end of this column.)
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Good news. Beer is health food.
</P>
<P>
   To thank for this welcome intelligence, we have, oddly, the
organization People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.
</P>
<P>
   PETA took to running ads -- since dropped -- that mimicked the
milk mongers' famous ad featuring milk mustaches on over-hyped
celebrities. Where the dairy industry asks, ``Got milk?'', the
animal rights folks asked, ``Got beer?''
</P>
<P>
   The ads were to run in college newspapers, just one more sign
that today's youth are a sorry lot. When I was in college, we
didn't need any prodding to drink beer. What is the world coming
to?
</P>
<P>
   PETA busily insisted that it wasn't really promoting campus
boozing but meant only to discourage the nation's youth from
falling into the wastrel ways of imbibing milk. PETA spokesfolk say
college kids are savvy enough to get the right message without
thinking PETA really-really wanted them to start pouring beer over
their Cap'n Crunch.
</P>
<P>
   The better choice for college students, PETA says, is soy milk.
PETA is serious about that.
</P>
<P>
   Dairy industry people insist that a happy cow gives more and
better milk than a peeved one, so farmers, far from annoying their
herds, are doing all they can to jolly up the ladies.
</P>
<P>
   PETA, however, has got it into its head that 1) actual milk is
bad for you _ the fat, you know _ and 2) milking cows is animal
abuse, a sort of bovine sexual harassment in the workplace, I
guess.
</P>
<P>
   This sets up a bit of a problem. Inasmuch as, if we shouldn't
milk cows then we certainly shouldn't eat them _ eating them is
even more abusive _ just what are we to do with all these cows?
Perhaps, given PETA's sensitivity, take up a collection to send
them to St. Tropez and wish them happy grazing.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, hearing of the ads,
came utterly unglued. (Did you notice I didn't write ``udderly''?
Do I get credit for that?)
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for MADD said her organization was concerned and
appalled, which, when you think about it, MADD usually is.
</P>
<P>
   Neither PETA nor MADD is known for its sense of whimsey, so what
we had there for a moment was a clash of titans, as two the
nation's most monumentally earnest organizations collided. It was
as if the Anti-Saloon League and the Ethical Culturalists were
fighting it out on World Wrestling Federation. The action was
briefly amusing and, whichever outfit prevailed, not much harm
would be done.
</P>
<P>
   The only disappointment in all this is that PETA shied from
declaring beer-drinking what it actually is -- liquid
vegetarianism. Maybe those ads are in works.
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: In a recent column, I cited President Clinton's claim that
13 children a day die from gunshots, some 4,700 annually. ``Youths
and children'' would be more accurate, and Clinton's numbers were a
year or so out of date. Based on data from a 1998 report by the
Center for Health Statistics, the daily average was 11.5, or about
4,200 a year, aged 19 and younger.

   RICKY-MARTIN (Albany, N.Y.) _ Tom Jones and Ricky Martin, who
are scheduled for separate performances in New York's capital city
Monday, are both hip-swivelin' superstars, ridin' high at the top
of the charts and sure to woo female fans. And while there's no
denying that Martin, 28, is hot, the 59-year-old Jones isn't ready
to relinquish his crown just yet. In fact, his latest single, ``Sex
Bomb,'' is a major hit in Europe. By GREG HAYMES. (For release

   FILM-REVIEW-ERIN (Undated) _ In the delightful legal-eagle movie
``Erin Brockovich,'' Julia Roberts brings her corn-fed ebullience
to the brassiest, most irresistible role she has had in years.
Tramped-up in necklines that head south, hemlines that head north
and cleavage that heads everywhere, Roberts' titular heroine is the
sort of ballsy broad who knows what she's got and uses it without
apology. Yet she's still, somehow, Julia Roberts _ the girl next
door with with the self-effacing laugh who can play a hooker and
still seem wholesome. By AMY BIANCOLLI.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-CUP (Undated) _ Such a sweet, soft-hearted film is
``The Cup'' that you might want to bring your 4-year-old to see it
_ it's rated G, it boasts a scrappy juvenile protagonist and it
features significantly less violence than either ``Pokemon'' or
``Power Rangers.'' The catch is, it's in Tibetan and Bhutanese.
Either junior has to be fluent in Asian languages or old enough to
read subtitles at a fevered clip. By AMY BIANCOLLI.
</P>
<P>
   GEORGE-CARLIN (Undated) _ The actor George Carlin is now an
institution. Closing in on age 63, the artist did not really find
his voice until the 1980s, long after his bit on the seven words
you can't say on television got him in trouble with the mainstream
suits. Then came cable. No cable, and Carlin would have remained a
funnyman on the fringe. By MARK McGUIRE.

   CARDAMOM (Undated) _ India's ``Queen of Spices'' is indeed

aromatic, spicy-sweet and warm flavor goes well in both hot and
cold foods. By LISA STEVENS.

   SPRING-BREAK (Albany, N.Y.) _ Students used to hold up signs

   LIGHTING (Undated) _ Whimsical lighting is made of any

 &HT;    Racetrack may provide safer haven than freeways in Atlanta
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ ``You must have found something unusually
interesting in the newspaper,'' she said while I stirred no-calorie
sweetener into my third cup of coffee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's this series about everybody in Georgia driving about 50
miles an hour above the speed limit,'' I answered. ``Maybe it will
get the public riled up to do something about insanity on our
highways.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean somebody besides us thinks they ought to enforce the
law?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure,'' I admitted. ``The politicians seem to be on
the side of speeders.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd think public officials would be more concerned about
high speeds killing and injuring people and accidents increasing
the cost of insurance,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember when our semi-city son moved from Washington back to
Atlanta and the insurance on his car almost doubled?'' I asked.
``They told him Atlanta is about the most dangerous place in the
country to drive an automobile.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they got the city confused with Atlanta Motor
Speedway,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt it,'' I replied. ``After reading this series, I think
I could give up gardening and take up another hobby.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd certainly go for that,'' she said. ``What hobby do you
have in mind?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Stock car racing,'' I replied. ``If we didn't have beans to
can and Silver Queen to cut off, we could spend our Saturdays at
Senoia Raceway.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're being facetious,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No I'm not. People my age and older drive on Ga. 400 all the
time. They routinely do 90 and 100 mph. According to a motor sports
writer of my acquaintance, that's about the same as average speeds
at Dixie Speedway, where cars have roll bars and drivers wear
helmets. It's safer than going to Buckhead for dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you're stretching it a bit,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I'm not. Race drivers are sober when they're on the track.
They're not gossiping or selling insurance on cell phones.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do get irritated when we're in the HOV lane, and somebody on
our bumper blinks their lights and blows their horn unless we are
doing at least 80 or 90,'' she said. ``Isn't the speed limit 55 mph
on interstates within a city?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, yes,'' I said, ``but if Indianapolis can have the 500, I
guess we can have the Ga. 400.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen to what it says in the paper: `The number of Georgians
convicted of speeding 90 to 99 miles per hour nearly tripled in the
1990s. Drivers who do 100 increased more than 80 percent.'''
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper said more than 80,000 Georgians were busted at 90
mph or faster in the past 10 years, with 10,000 traveling 100 mph
or faster. The record-holder was clocked at 152 mph on Interstate
85 in DeKalb County. Nearly 600 people in the metro area are killed
every year. ``Don't they have traffic cops like we do here in
Fayette County?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're mostly observers,'' I explained. ``The theory is that
stopping drivers in 90 mph traffic causes accidents.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people must get injured and killed when wrecks happen
at those speeds,'' she replied. ``Maybe the newspaper series will
get the public stirred up and force our elected officials to do
something about it,'' I said. ``When we read that automobiles and
trucks kill 42,000 a year while it took 10 years of Vietnam to kill
58,000, it's time to do something as simple as enforcing the law.''
</P>
<P>
   For my money, gun control, the Confederate flag and teacher
tenure can take a back seat until road carnage is under control. In
today's political climate you may be wasting time writing
legislators, but you can write, call or e-mail a very powerful
governor, who has sworn to uphold the law, which as last I heard,
includes speed limits.

 &HT;    Daytona Beach Bike Week had everything _ and some fine racing
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Half a million bikers roared into this
town for Bike Week 2000.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen were shipped home in coffins. Untold numbers
of motorcyclists went home in bandages and casts.
</P>
<P>
   That left several hundred thousand bike riders who left town
with good memories, souvenir T-shirts, thinner wallets and ringing
ears.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Harleys racking their pipes for a solid week
becomes exhausting, as it were.
</P>
<P>
   For a relative handful, Daytona Beach Bike Week is about the
best motorcycle racing this nation has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest, Bike Week is about booze, breasts and
exhibitionism. See and be seen. Party time.
</P>
<P>
   The daily Main Street parade of bikers and trikers is a fantasy
show of two- and three-wheeled machines and their bizarre owners.
</P>
<P>
   Some bikers exercised improper traffic judgment after a night of
swigging beer while watching wet T-shirt and cole-slaw wrestling
contests at local clubs.
</P>
<P>
   While police paid particular attention to bared breasts, they
ignored both men and women whose bare butts protruded from black
leather chaps.
</P>
<P>
   A chap named Bob was featured in a front-page photo in the
Daytona Beach News Journal leaning on his ape-hanger handle bars
with his glistening fanny on display.
</P>
<P>
   Bike Week is like Mardi Gras with motorcycles for most people
who make the annual March pilgrimage to Daytona Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The best part of Bike Week, in my opinion, is located inside the
Daytona International Speedway where the American Motorcycle
Association kicks off its racing season on the Speedway's 3.56-mile
road course.
</P>
<P>
   These motorcycle racers reach the same speeds as NASCAR racers
except they do it while dragging knees and elbows leaned over on
two wheels without the benefit of four fat tires, steel cages, roll
bars and four-point seat harnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Why the Daytona Speedway does not pack the stands for Superbike
racing like it does for Winston Cup racing is a mystery. Race fans
looking for physics-defying thrills and skills cannot do better
than motorcycle road racing.
</P>
<P>
   One reason the Daytona Speedway fills every available seat for
NASCAR races is because nearly everyone drives a car. They can
relate to a stock car race.
</P>
<P>
   That does not explain why 75 percent of the motorcycle riders
who come to Bike Week ignore some of the best motorcycle road
racing in the world. Their motorcycling interests must be geared to
chrome, fringed leather and loud pipes, not to high-speed
performance and state-of-the-art technology.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere in the Speedway pits during Bike Week is just the
opposite of the non-stop revelry on Main Street.
</P>
<P>
   Pit crews are constantly studying computer printouts and tearing
down and rebuilding their race bikes.
</P>
<P>
   Motorcycle manufacturers who sponsor race teams spend millions
of dollars preparing just for Daytona each year.
</P>
<P>
   Tire manufacturers develop special dual-compound tires just for
the Daytona races to accommodate track conditions that include more
high-speed left turns than right turns.
</P>
<P>
   There's an atmosphere of serious anticipation in the pits that
builds until the final checkered flag is thrown.
</P>
<P>
   If Bare-Bottom Bob missed this year's 200-mile Superbike race,
he missed one of the most exciting motorcycle races he ever held in
America, and that's saying a lot.

 &HT;    Researchers say it's true: Weekends get more rain
 &HT;    By Dale Dempsey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Question: What do you call it after two days of
rain in most cities?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: Monday.
</P>
<P>
   It's no joke. Researchers at Arizona State University have found
something golfers have always suggested: It rains more on weekends.
The study found there is as much as a 22 percent greater chance of
rain on Saturdays and Sundays than during the week.
</P>
<P>
   The culprit could be pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Smog, formed when nitrogen oxides and particulate matter mix
with sunlight, builds up through the work week, when there are more
cars and trucks on the road. By the weekend when people are driving
less, the researchers think, this buildup can cause a cloud-seeding
effect. The result: rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew that cities have an effect on local weather,'' said
Randall Cerveny, one of the study's authors. ``But nobody had ever
looked at the in-between area of large-scale regional weather. We
appear to be affecting global weather on a scale that is comparable
to El Nino.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Cerveny and research partner Robert Balling were
studying weather patterns on the East Coast, the pattern could
apply to the Midwest as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are just looking at that right now,'' Cerveny said.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers studied daily rainfall from 1979 to 1995. A
seven-day pattern emerged, with rain amounts steadily increasing
Thursday through Saturday, then falling off Sunday through
Wednesday. Cerveny and Balling found the same kind of seven-day
cycle in pollution levels, leading to the hypothesis that man-made
emissions affect the weather on a regional basis.

 &HT;    Hand planer has its pros and cons
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Along with all this back-and-forth over planers and
jointers on the Internet comes a fellow who wants to know if he can
finish his pieces with a hand plane and avoid sandpaper.
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, is the method made popular by James Krenov in
his series of highly inspirational, persuasive and sometimes
mean-spirited books. If you haven't read any of them, you should.
Chief among them are ``The Fine Art of Cabinetmaking'' and ``The
Impractical Cabinetmaker.'' Krenov pursues woodworking more as a
religion than a vocation. He spends days deciding how to match two
pieces of wood for cabinet doors. He uses only wooden planes of his
own making, and he avoids sandpaper.
</P>
<P>
   His work is astonishing; jewel-like. There is no mistaking a
Krenov cabinet.On the other hand, as is usual with fanatics, it is
his way or the highway. He takes thinly veiled, nasty little
pot-shots at other noted woodworkers.
</P>
<P>
   His repertoire is also the most limited of any of the big-name
woodworkers, confined almost entirely to small display cabinets,
freestanding or wall hung.
</P>
<P>
   Krenov's books enraged a small cult of planemakers, and it's
easy to see why. Of all the evolutions in woodworking, none is so
physically and emotionally satisfying as using a well-tuned plane
with a razor-sharp iron. Having made that plane yourself, to fit
your hands only, makes it that much better.
</P>
<P>
   As for wood with the finish left by that well-tuned, razor-sharp
smooth plane, it is incomparable. A plane iron cuts; sandpaper
abrades. Fine Woodworking magazine once ran an article on the
subject, with microscopic photographs of smooth-planed and
fine-sanded wood. The sanded wood was furry and indistinct. The
planed wood was mirror-like, every nuance of figure enhanced as if
with a spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   So why doesn't everybody work that way? 'Cause 't'ain't easy,
McGee.
</P>
<P>
   You have to become the Horowitz of the smooth plane, a virtuoso
among virtuosos, to plane a board so perfectly that you don't leave
a little cut here, some tearout there.
</P>
<P>
   It helps if you learn to use a scraper. Scrapers are remarkable
little tools; easy to use, hard to prepare for use. A good Sandvik
scraper cost about $5 last time I looked, and if you spend some
time learning to get the hook worked into the edge, it will do a
remarkable job of cleaning up these defects, especially tearout.
</P>
<P>
   But until we all get our doctorates in the construction and use
of smooth planes, the sandpaper makers will continue to rake in the
money.

   TECH-FUTURE _ LOS ANGELES _ Americans participated in two great
migrations in the 20th century. First, they moved by the millions
from farms to cities, seeking jobs, and after World War II, they
moved again, this time from central cities to suburbs. In the new
century, yet another demographic pattern may emerge: immigrants and
young people will leave suburbs everywhere to find work in the
nation's booming high-tech clusters. Certain states, including
California, Texas, New York, Florida and Georgia, will get a surge
of growth from Asians, Hispanics and others seeking jobs, while the
majority will become relatively whiter, older and less prosperous.
Will we become, in essence, two countries, one old, white and
slow-growing and the other younger, multicultural and more
entrepreneurial? (Geewax, Cox News Service).

   TECH-FUTURE _ LOS ANGELES _ Americans participated in two great
migrations in the 20th century. First, they moved by the millions
from farms to cities, seeking jobs, and after World War II, they
moved again, this time from central cities to suburbs. In the new
century, yet another demographic pattern may emerge: immigrants and
young people will leave suburbs everywhere to find work in the
nation's booming high-tech clusters. Certain states, including
California, Texas, New York, Florida and Georgia, will get a surge
of growth from Asians, Hispanics and others seeking jobs, while the
majority will become relatively whiter, older and less prosperous.
Will we become, in essence, two countries, one old, white and
slow-growing and the other younger, multicultural and more
entrepreneurial? (Geewax, Cox News Service).

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Americans, always eager for a better life, picked
up and moved in two great waves in the last century. First,
millions left the farm for the city. Then, after World War II,
masses abandoned cities for the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as a new century begins, another great migration may be
under way: millions are heading for the nation's high-tech hotbeds.
These booming cities, such as San Jose, Seattle, Atlanta, Los
Angeles, Austin and others, are attracting both foreign immigrants
and young domestic migrants who want to go where new technologies
are generating jobs.
</P>
<P>
   These cities tend to be clustered in a handful of states,
including California, Texas, New York, Massachusetts, Washington
and Georgia. In those states, the populations are becoming more
ethnically diverse and entrepreneurial. The younger residents of
these fast-paced tech centers are having children, starting
businesses and leading the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in the rest of the country, the population is getting
older. With more than 70 million baby boomers inching closer to
retirement, most states will see a surge in senior citizens
starting in 2011, when the oldest boomers hit 65. As more boomers
die off, the population of many states will decline.
</P>
<P>
   These demographic trends mean that the United States may be
starting to split into two nations. One country, Tech America, will
have 10 to 15 states, each characterized by its youth,
multi-cultural diversity and entrepreneurial zeal. The other
country, Traditional America, will be older, whiter and less
prosperous.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, the impact of that divergence is hard to predict.
Perhaps the residents of Traditional America will be satisfied
living in the shadow of Tech America. Maybe they will appreciate
the wealth being generated in the go-go states, wealth that will
fund Social Security and Medicare and hold down tax rates.
</P>
<P>
   But younger workers in Tech America may resent seeing so much of
their income going to the gray heads living elsewhere. Even today,
the Social Security tax is the single largest tax for most workers.
In the future, young tech workers may want to see more of their tax
dollars going toward education and road building. They may want
more open immigration laws and bigger free trade zones than
Traditional America would like.
</P>
<P>
   Political arguments over how to use scarce government resources
``used to be split between Democratic cities and Republican
suburbs,'' said William Frey, a demographer and senior fellow at
the Milken Institute, a research group here. In the 21st century,
``the divisions will be between the 'melting pot' and the
'heartland' states,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Frey was among those presenting data at the Milken Institute
2000 Global Conference here this month, which focused on economic
and demographic changes around the world.
</P>
<P>
   A theme that emerged was that while new technologies can lead to
higher standards of living for everyone, the relative gap between
tech-haves and tech-nots is widening, whether on a global level or
at home.
</P>
<P>
   Countries with high levels of education, sophisticated
telecommunications systems and abundant computers tend to be far
richer than those without such advantages. For example, North
America is one of the wealthiest places on Earth, and it's also the
most wired. In 1999, about 57 percent of Americans and Canadians
had access to the Internet, either at home, in school or at work.
Meanwhile, in Africa, the world's poorest continent, only about 1
percent of the population had Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, economists at the conference were cheery about
the financial prospects for tech-laden North Americans. But on the
African continent, ``optimism is hard to find,'' a Milken Institute
study concluded.
</P>
<P>
   While the digital divide is widening between nations, gaps also
exist within countries. Heavily wired cities such as Atlanta, San
Francisco, Austin, San Jose, Seattle, Washington D.C., Boston and
Dallas have booming economies and surging populations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology and immigration tend to complement each other,''
Frey said. When tech companies start growing quickly, they draw
both young domestic migrants seeking high-paying jobs and
low-skilled foreign workers. Most immigrants are not educated
enough to take tech jobs, but they flock to tech centers anyway, he
said, because boom towns ``need more people to do service work,
like nannies and gardeners.''
</P>
<P>
   Not every tech center draws foreigners, he noted. Cities such as
Ann Arbor, Mich., and Raleigh, N.C., have tech-led economies, but
lack large numbers of immigrants. But those cities draw other young
people, such as college students, who can fill service jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, though, cities with fast-growing technology
companies are attracting both young Americans and foreign workers.
For example, between 1990 and 1998, metro Atlanta drew 440,668 new
residents, as well as 68,515 immigrants, according to Milken
Institute data.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in parts of the Midwest and New England, populations
have been stagnant or even declining. In North Dakota between 1990
and 1998, the population fell slightly as young people moved away.
The percentage of the state's population over age 65 rose to 14.4,
compared with Georgia's 9.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   States with rapidly aging populations include Iowa, Kansas,
Maine, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota and West Virginia.
Those states have few tech hot spots within their borders. But the
states with relatively young populations, such as Utah, Texas,
Georgia, New Mexico and California, have booming technology
centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The places attracting both immigrants and domestic migrants
are doing so because of their dynamic economies,'' Frey said.
``What that translates into is younger people with greater needs
for education and consumer markets.'' In other words, residents of
these states will need more schools for their families, more roads
for their shopping centers and more global connections.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Tech America will coalesce to create a powerful voting
bloc remains to be seen. But last week, a bipartisan group of 18
members of Congress gave a hint of what may be coming. The
lawmakers representing high-tech districts in California, Texas,
Virginia, Washington state and Georgia joined forces to push for a
sharp increase in visas for highly skilled foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
   While traditional labor groups oppose immigration to fill U.S.
jobs, the high-tech House members are sponsoring legislation to
boost to 200,000 the number of visas granted each year to
well-educated foreigners such as engineers and computer
programmers. That would be up from 107,500 currently allowed for
2001. Among the supporters were bedrock conservatives as well as
liberals, united in the belief that their tech-heavy states will
benefit from more immigration.
</P>
<P>
   As Rep. Lloyd Doggett, a Democrat from Austin, said, tech
companies need to attract ``the best and brightest, not only from
all over the country, but from all over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Traditional Americans may eventually feel run over by
hard-charging Tech Americans could shape the political battles of
the early 21st century.

LEASE OR BUY? A LOT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU'LL USE THE TRUCK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To buy or to lease: that is the question consumers must consider
before they're ready to acquire a new vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to trucks or sport utility vehicles, it may appear
that leasing is a better deal. But depending on how you will use
the vehicle, leasing could be a costly mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Leasing a vehicle does offer an attractive monthly payment with
no down payment usually required. These factors would seem to make
leasing a better option than buying, which normally requires both a
down payment and a higher monthly payment.
</P>
<P>
   With leasing, however, you never do own the vehicle. And therein
lies the problem. Two of the predetermined conditions of a leased
vehicle are that there is a set number of miles allowed (go over
that limit and you pay for each and every mile) and the vehicle
must be returned in good condition.
</P>
<P>
   With a truck or SUV, especially the new breed that mixes the two
types of vehicles, chances are you'll be enjoying it so much,
you'll go over the stated mileage limit. And that could be very
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Also, it's likely you will abuse the truck or SUV more than you
would if you owned a car. That situation could be expensive when it
comes to turning in the vehicle. Jack Gillis, a noted consumer
advocate and author of ``The Ultimate Car Book'', notes ``when it
comes time to turn in the car, it has to be in top shape _
otherwise, you'll have to pay for repairs or body work.''
</P>
<P>
   Comparing leasing vs.buying, Gillis warns consumers: ``Don't be
deceived _ in general, leasing costs more than buying outright or
financing. When you pay cash or finance a car, you own an asset;
leasing leaves you with all the headaches and responsibilities of
ownership with none of the benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   As an example, Gillis provides the overall cost of leasing and
financing a vehicle with a price tag of $22,000 over three and six
years. Gillis says holding the vehicle for three years, leasing has
an overall cost of $12,941.64 while financing costs $11,879.83. If
you hold the vehicle for six years, the cost of the lease jumps to
$25,883.28 while the price of ownership jumps only to $15,898.51
</P>
<P>
   Gillis says the example used for leasing has a residual value
(the value of the vehicle at the end of the lease) of about 54
percent after three years and 36 percent after six years. Few
vehicles have a 54 percent value after three years, so, should you
still wish to lease, it is wise to check a current Blue Book of
residual values to see what the future value of the vehicle in
question will be.
</P>
<P>
   If leasing still appeals, Gillis offers a few tips:
</P>
<P>
   --Find out the annual mileage limit. Don't accept a contract
with a lower limit than you need.
</P>
<P>
   --Avoid ``capitalized cost reductions'' where you are asked to
essentially put up a down payment to lower monthly costs.
</P>
<P>
   --Ask about early termination fees. Between 40 and 60 percent of
four-year leases terminate early.
</P>
<P>
   --Retain your option to buy the car at the end of the lease at a
predetermined price.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ultimate Car Book 2000'' is filled with good advice for
anyone considering buying any vehicle.

TRY REGROUTING BEFORE COVERING TILE SHOWER STALL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, March 19, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My shower stall is 37 inches square, tiled with a formed pan
of what looks like concrete. The house is 35 years old. Now, water
is leaking through the grout and dripping into the basement. Can I
put a sheet of acrylic or Formica along the three sides of the
shower to stop the leak?
</P>
<P>
   LARRY ROOT, Stow, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes. I suggest you contact a company that puts acyrlic shells
over old tubs; such a company also will handle a shower. I think
that would be better than Formica; for one thing, the shell for the
shower is in one piece.
</P>
<P>
   While you can do this, why cover up good tile? Consider
regrouting the tile to stop the leak, or regrout between tile and
shower pan edge. First, line the shower with curtains or other
waterproof tarps, then shower up a storm to see if the leaks
continue; if they do not, you know it's the grout that needs
redoing. If the leaks continue, it may mean the pan is leaking;
have a pro check it out.
</P>
<P>
   To redo the grout, chip and gouge it out (there are tools for
this purpose; one is calld a grout ripper) and insert new grout.
After the grout sets, apply a tile sealer to make the grout
waterproof. If that works, you'll be set for another 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   If it doesn't, and the pan doesn't leak, then the shell would be
OK.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I had a roto man clean out the roots in my sewer line, but he
only bored a small hole in the root-filled line, not clearing it
totally. He suggested high-pressure water to clean the rest. But
the city feared that the high pressure might damage the line, and
suggested chemicals to do the rest of the roots. What are those
chemicals, and what is best to do?
</P>
<P>
   LINDA CRONIN, Peabody, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. The chemicals are one, copper sulphate, a potent poison, sold
by chemical supply stores and some lumber stores. Put in the line,
the chemical will kill the roots and allow them to decay, when they
can be washed away by a low pressure stream or ordinary use of the
sewer. This will take quite a while.
</P>
<P>
   The recommended dose is 5 pounds of copper sulphate in the
sewer. Put it in the cleanout, not in a fixture. Place part of the
dose and allow time for crystals to dissolve before adding. When
the sewer is cleared, it can be maintained clear by treating with
one pound of cppper sulphate every 3 months.
</P>
<P>
   Before you do this, I suggest you find a Roto-Rooter man (they
advertise a lot and are widely available) to see if the line can be
entirely cut out. If not, go with the chemical. If the problem
persists no matter what you do, consider rebuilding the line or
removing some of the trees.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am finishing my basement, and I wonder if could put in an
indoor-outdoor carpet with rubber backing? We have allergies, so I
have to be careful what goes down there. What is an alternative to
carpeting?
</P>
<P>
   J.A., Lexington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. The indoor-outdoor carpeting is a synthetic, so should be OK,
but be sure to check it out. But do not use rubber backing, nor any
rubber pad of any kind. This rubber is a vapor barrier, and you
cannot use a vapor barrier like that on a cellar floor; water vapor
will get trapped under it and condense into water. The carpeting
will allow water vapor to go up through it; so will the pad if it
is a synthetic jute, which also may be non-allergenic.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative is vinyl tile or ceramic tile. Then you can put
non-allergenic area rugs down. In the greater scheme of things, I
think the indoor-outdoor carpeting will give the best service at
the best price.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have to replace my garage roof, a corrugated asphalt
roofing that failed after 10 years. I forget its name, but it
should have lasted more than 10 years. It is a one-slope roof, 21
by 32 feet, with a 3 or 4/12 pitch. Can I use shingles, or roll
roofing? A neighbor has a similar slope with shingles, and is
always replacing blown-off shingles.
</P>
<P>
   DAN TRASK, Essex, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. I too forget the name of that asphalt corrugated roofing, but
when it came out many years ago, it looked (and was touted) to be a
great barn roofing.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, you could put on a rubber roof that will give good
service. Roll roofing will be OK, too, but may not last beyond 10
years. That 3 to 4/12 pitch is OK for shingles. I would specify as
heavy duty a shingle as practical, and an organic (not fiberglass)
one. In fact, the roofing makers are touting a hurricane resistant
shingle, but all asphalt shingles are self-sealing and resistant to
high winds. I'll bet your neighbor's shingles (the ones that are
flying off) are fiberglass.
</P>
<P>
   I would opt for the shingles; they will look better and are
probably less expensive than the rubber roof.

   They're the hottest vehicles in the marketplace, and, while
sales of SUVs reportedly are a little soft right now, that's not
stopping manufacturers from introducing even more models. About the
only companies that haven't produced an SUV are Volkswagen and
Porsche _ and both are about to enter the market.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with sport utilities is deciding what an SUV means
to you. Is an SUV a monstrous Ford Excursion or a Suzuki Grand
Vitara or perhaps a Jeep Grand Cherokee? Even the manufacturers
don't help: the new BMW X5 is called a sport activity vehicle by
its maker.
</P>
<P>
   During the winter months, SUVs are particularly attractive.
Their four-wheel-drive capabilities, coupled with their greater
road clearances, enable them to handle whatever snowstorms Mother
Nature tosses our way better than regular cars.
</P>
<P>
   The new BMW X5 was the clear winner in a recent test of vehicles
by the New England Motor Press Association. For the first time in
its three-year history of evaluating winter vehicles, the NEMPA
members' selection was unanimous.
</P>
<P>
   NEMPA jurists especially liked the way the BMW blended real
world off-road capability with some of the best creature comforts,
yet retained the intrinsic fit, feel, and finish of the marque in a
totally new vehicle. Among comments by members were ``BMW X5 _ a
great mix of sedan and SUV''. . .``a 5-Series with a better seating
position and as much fun to drive as any of BMW's cars,''. . . and
``clearly a winter techno-achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   Pretty high praise, but at a price of $51,000-plus, this vehicle
isn't for everyone. Which is why there's such a wide selection of
SUV types out there. Shoppers will find models from the Kia
Sportage with a list price of $14,445 on up to a Range Rover at
around $60,000.
</P>
<P>
   New this year is the Ford Excursion, the biggest SUV yet; it can
easily carry nine passengers. It's so big that it won't fit in most
garages, yet sales are doing quite well. Giving it a run for the
money are the newly redesigned Chevrolet Suburban and GMC Yukon
(formerly the Suburban), until now the largest SUVs. The newly
redone GM models are stiffer, quieter, more comfortable and more
powerful than earlier versions.
</P>
<P>
   The Nissan Xterra is also new with a price range of $17,300 to
$25,500. This is a vehicle designed definitely for the young,
active lifestyle. If you're looking for hot rod performance in an
already great SUV, the Mercedes-Benz ML55 is the one to have. It
can do 150 miles per hour, handle corners, and still handle the
utility of an SUV.
</P>
<P>
   Also new this year is a revamped Infiniti QX4. The 2001 model,
which has just been introduced to the market, offers more power, is
stronger, quieter and luxurious.
</P>
<P>
   In checking out SUVs, it's best to remember that not all are
created equal. Some are designed for off-road use while others are
for highway driving. Some have full-time all-wheel drive while
others offer a choice of two- or four-wheel drive.
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking at cargo capacities, some can handle just
about everything you toss at them, others can't handle any more
cargo than a regular sedan.
</P>
<P>
   The safety issue is a major concern. SUVs can, and have, rolled
over. Those warning stickers inside SUVs are there for a good
reason. Because of their relatively high center of gravity, SUVs
don't hold the road like automobiles, which are lower and closer to
the surface. For this reason, taking a sharp turn to avoid
something or going fast around a corner can cause an SUV to roll
over.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest danger in owning an SUV is overconfidence _
the attitude that these vehicles can go anywhere, do anything.
Drivers need to drive these vehicles with care.
</P>
<P>
   Other sport utility winners in the New England Motor Press
Association's winter vehicle test were the Toyota Land Cruiser,
which tied with the Range Rover 4.6 HSE in the full-sized category;
the Lexus RX300 in the compact class and the Nissan Xterra in the
mini-SUV class.
</P>
<P>
   Not all winners were SUVs, which proves you can have a winter
vehicle with all-wheel-drive without going the SUV route. In the
all-wheel-drive class winners were the Audi A8 sedan; the Volvo V70
XC in the wagon class; and the Porsche C4 in coupe. The best people
mover was the Chrysler Town &AMP; Country Lxi all-wheel-drive minivan,
and the Subaru Outback received the value award.
</P>
<P>
   Winner of the pickup class was the Toyota Tundra. The Ford
Excursion received the extreme vehicle award.

CROSSOVERS TAKE A TURN IN HOT MARKET

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Is it a car, truck, SUV, or minivan? That was the question
when DaimlerChrysler first introduced the PT Cruiser at the Detroit
Auto Show in January, 1999. Now, we have the answer, well make that
answers.
</P>
<P>
   It's a truck, says DaimlerChrysler. If only all the vehicles now
in production or coming out soon were that easy to categorize. But
as the line between car, truck, sport utility and minivan has
blurred, and the era of crossovers has taken hold, that matter is
further confused by the recent EPA ruling that deems the PT Cruiser
a car. Meanwhile, the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration, which administers the corporate average fuel
economy program (CAFE), says that, for now at least, Chrysler can
call the Cruiser a truck.
</P>
<P>
   It is this ever-changing, vibrant segment of the automotive
industry that is fueling the continued growth in sales and products
being offered by the many manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the X5, BMW's entry into the sport-utility field,
isn't called a sport utility vehicle but, rather, a sports activity
vehicle. BMW wanted a vehicle that would ride and handle like one
of its cars, yet also offer the advantages of a sport utility
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Not too long ago, trucks were basically designed for their
payload and what they could do in a work environment. Pickups were
judged by their cargo bed and how many sheets of 4x8 plywood,
sheetrock, or other goods they could carry.
</P>
<P>
   Pickup trucks gained popularity in the late 1970s as
manufacturers made the trucks more car-like in ride, conveniences,
and features. Then, in the 1990s, along came the sport utility
vehicle _ designed to carry people, go anywhere, do just about
anything, and have a good-sized cargo area.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in this new century, there's a blending of sport utility
and truck to meet the wishes of a new generation of buyers.
</P>
<P>
   There's a good reason for these changes. The truck market is
fast overtaking the car market, with some analysts predicting that,
by 2002, trucks will outsell cars. Trucks already are entrenched at
the top of each year's list of best-selling vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturers see a new generation of buyers coming along.
Ford feels its No. 1 priority is to make all its vehicles
``aspirational to the next generation.'' One Ford executive said,
``You have to make sure the vehicle brands connect emotionally to
the next generation. You cannot just provide technology and
performance, you need to connect emotionally.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford, for example, sold 1.10 million cars and 2.31 million
trucks in 1999. Even with those figures, Ford envisions problems.
For example, its market share for trucks slipped from 29.9 percent
in 1998 to 28.2 percent in 1999. Ford blames some of that slippage
on the company being too slow to retool for new vehicles. It hopes
to regain its market share with the introduction of new models this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Ford is spending more than $1 million surveying buyers of sport
utility vehicles to find out who they are and what they want in an
SUV. They found many with the attitude that ``I can do anything I
want to do.'' So Ford is developing the ``Ford Outfitters. No
Boundaries'' theme for its vehicles and dealerships.
</P>
<P>
   New models coming soon from Ford are the Explorer Sport Trac,
Explorer Sport two-door, and F-150 SuperCrew sport utility pickup.
These vehicles with traditional cargo boxes and sport utility
cabins are aimed at the buyers who like the outdoors environment;
they are models that can go anywhere and carry all sorts of outdoor
gear. The Sport Trac, which is an Explorer with a short bed,
includes a fold-out bed extender, nautical bed cleats for tying
down equipment and mud-proof rubber floor coverings. Its cab has
full-sized room for five passengers. This makes the Sport Trac both
a pickup and an SUV.
</P>
<P>
   Chevrolet is taking the SUV-pickup idea one step farther with
its upcoming Avalanche. This vehicle will compete head-on with the
Ford Sport Trac, but will also offer a sliding door between the
cabin and the cargo bed, which will allow people to haul even
bigger loads with the back seats folded down.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan's new Xterra comes with features such as bike-carrying
racks both inside and outside the vehicle, compartments to stow
muddy boots and outdoor gear, and a boast that it can go anywhere.
Some dealers have even put a premium price on the Xterra, since it
is a hot seller in the current market.
</P>
<P>
   All the manufacturers are rushing to get their new models out.
General Motors originally planned to hold off on new models of its
Chevrolet S10 and GMC Sonoma lines but has decided to rush extended
cab versions for these vehicles into production this summer. Nissan
is hoping to boost sales by bringing out a more macho design of its
Frontier in July.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of these models are being designed to draw in younger
buyers. Toyota's StepSide sport truck is one. ``This StepSide model
was conceived to broaden the appeal of Tacoma by attracting a
significantly younger, more style-conscious buyer,'' said Don
Esmond, general manager of Toyota Motor Sales. To make this model
more attractive, Toyota dropped the base price by almost $1,200 to
$13,750.
</P>
<P>
   The Tacoma compact pickup is an important part of Toyota's
overall truck strategy. Its platform lends itself to new
derivatives. ``The Tacoma StepSide is one such derivative that will
help us attract a younger buyer base. Look for more in the near
future,'' said Esmond.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota, which last year came out with its first full-sized
pickup, the Tundra, now can't keep up with the sales demand. Toyota
is going to increase production at its Indiana plant so that it can
build 300,000 Tundras by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   With the Tundra, Toyota became the first foreign company to
actively compete with American full-sized pickup trucks. In the
2001 model year, it will enter the full-sized sport utility field
with the Sequoia.
</P>
<P>
   For 2000, General Motors completely redesigned its Chevrolet
Tahoe/Suburban and GMC Yukon/Yukon XL (GMC has replaced the
Suburban name with Yukon). Rather than make them larger, as Ford
did with its huge Excursion, GM just made these models better. All
are based on the Silverado pickup platform and have stiffer bodies
for better ride and handling. While the Yukon XL and Suburban may
not be a large as the Ford Excursion, for 2000 they offer more
passenger room than last year.
</P>
<P>
   Early reports on the Chrysler PT Cruiser give it good marks for
performance and people- and cargo-hauling. Road &AMP; Track reports
``While the PT Cruiser definitely stands out in the crowd on
styling, it runs with the pack in performance. The clincher is
interior flexibility.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons DaimlerChrysler puts the truck mark on the
Cruiser, and other manufacturers push small pickups is not for
profit, but for CAFE (Corporate Average Fuel Economy). With
automobiles, the average CAFE requirement is 27.5 miles per gallon
for all the company's makes. For trucks, it is 20.7 miles per
gallon, and since many trucks get poor mileage, selling lots of
small pickups allows makers to meet the CAFE requirements without
being fined while still being able to sell big profitable trucks
with big fuel appetites.
</P>
<P>
   Having the EPA say the PT Cruiser is a car means Chrysler will
have to make some changes for tailpipe emissions standards. Having
the National Highway Safety Administration allow Chrysler to call
it a truck helps the company meet the CAFE standards. One federal
definition of a truck is that it has seats that can be removed for
cargo.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler isn't the first to have this dual ruling. The
Lexus RX 300 is a car by EPA standards, and a truck by NHTSA.
</P>
<P>
   Dodge has upped the ante among the more practical pickup trucks
with the Dodge Dakota Quad Cab. Already the biggest in-class
compact pickup, the new Quad Cab adds four full-sized, front-hinged
doors. The rear doors even open almost 90 degrees for more
convenience. And while Dodge has shortened the bed to 5.25 feet
from the regular Dakota's 6.5 feet, it has added an optional Bed
Extender. This lengthens the bed when needed, and, when it's not in
use, it creates a smaller cargo area to contain loose items that
otherwise might move about the bed. A few years ago, a less than
6-foot bed would not have been considered acceptable or marketable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know how many segments there are in the light truck
category,'' says George Murphy, Ford division general marketing
manager, but we do ``think there are still a few opportunities to
define a segment with a new vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   And there seems to be no end to the ever-growing sport utility
field. This year there are 46 different SUV models on the market
alone, and, by 2005, industry analysts predict more than 70
different models of SUVs will be competing for your dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The next Mitsubishi Montero, due in dealer showrooms this month,
has a totally new design. It gives up its truck frame construction
for the unibody design common on car platforms. This will give the
vehicle a quieter ride. Among new features is a third row of seats
that folds flat into the floor. In earlier models, these seats
folded against the windows and took up cargo space.
</P>
<P>
   In the small sport utility field, General Motors, with its
Chevrolet Tracker, expects annual sales to reach 500,000 units this
year, up from 440,000 last year. Coming out this year, are the Ford
Escape, Mazda Tribute, Hyundai Santa Fe, and a redesigned Toyota
RAV4. Already in showrooms are the Suzuki Grand Vitara (sister to
the Tracker), Honda CR-V, Jeep Wrangler, Subaru Forester, and Kia
Sportage.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Brooks, Tracker brand manager, sees sales of the new
model, with an optional 155-horsepower V-6 engine and new trim
packages, increasing by 25 percent and predicts a potential market
for small SUVs of 1 million units in three to four years.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the confusion as to what constitutes a sport utility
are the new breed of models, exemplified by the BMW X5 and the
Lexus RX 300, neither of which looks like your typical SUV. In
these days of high gasoline prices, one compelling reason to look
at one of these is fuel economy. The Lexus RX 300 with 4WD has an
EPA rating of 19 mpg in the city, and 22 mpg on the highway. The
BMW X5 gets 13 mpg in the city and 17 on the highway.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors will soon be introducing its versions of this new
breed of SUVs with the Pontiac Aztec and Buick Rendezvous. GM,
which recently took full ownership of Saab, said it plans to
produce a Saab sport-ute based on the Rendezvous platform.

A SENSE OF SECURITY, YET A CONCERN FOR SAFETY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Safety: It's something you can't ignore when thinking about a
truck or sport utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Safety is one reason many buyers turn to an SUV. Most feel safe
driving one, especially the larger ones, with all that bulk around
them. Many SUVs are also built on a truck frame for added strength,
rather than the unibody construction used in cars. SUVs and most
trucks are also higher off the road, providing better visibility
(unless you're in a car riding behind one _ a major complaint of
non-SUV owners). Another way SUVs and trucks provide safety is on
models equipped with all-wheel-drive, providing a secure footing on
slippery surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   But the way these vehicles handle has become a major safety
concern. All SUVs come with warnings of possible rollovers. While
any vehicle can tip in a sudden manuever, such as trying to avoid
another vehicle, sport utilities are particularly prone to this
because of their design _ being higher off the road.
</P>
<P>
   The rollover issue came to a head when Consumers Union, after
placing vehicles through a double-lane change emergency avoidance
test, labeled the 1995 and '96 Isuzu Trooper and the 1998 Suzuki
Samura as unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Owners of an SUV should be aware that the vehicles tend to be
top heavy _ some more than others _ and care should be taken while
making sharp turns or in emergency situations. Also, drivers should
be careful when using antilock brakes in such a situation.
Anti-lock brakes require a vehicle to be going in a straight
direction during an emergency-braking situation. A sudden twist of
the wheel during braking could cause the vehicle to become
unstable.
</P>
<P>
   Owners of any truck should look for safety features such as
front and side air bags, ABS, and child safety features; trucks
often lag behind automobiles in safety equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Not all SUVs are created equal. Some are designed to go
anywhere, do just about anything; others are designed just for the
road. Some have full-time four-wheel-drive designed to send power
to which wheels need it; others, with part-time four-wheel-drive
are designed only for use on snow or off road, not for high-mileage
highway driving.
</P>
<P>
   However, many manufacturers are adding additional safety
features.
</P>
<P>
   Land Rover recently introduced an Active Cornering Enhancement
on its Discover series that reduces body lean to make the vehicle
more responsive under cornering situations. It is a $2,000 option.
(Land Rover also produces an interesting book comparing all SUVs,
including drivetrains, off-road capabilities, and pricing. Copies
are available at dealerships.)
</P>
<P>
   A concern to non-SUV owners is the fear of being hit by a
sport-utility and having the vehicle ride up over the smaller car.
Mercedes-Benz has placed bumpers on its M series SUVs at the same
level as cars to avoid those situations. The Lincoln Navigator has
a secondary bumper system underneath to also prevent similiar
accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Ford will introduce air bags to protect occupants' heads in the
event of a rollover in Explorers and other models next year. The
air bags provide a curtain that will inflate over front and side
windows and stay inflated for up to 6 seconds to cushion driver's
and passenger heads long enough to outlast a multiple rollover.
Most air bags deflate immediately after opening; only Mercedes-Benz
has side air bags that stay open a few seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The Ford system uses sensors, which measure how far the vehicle
is tipping. If a rollover is imminent, inflators are triggered,
filling a long air bag on each side of the vehicle with cool gas.
Ford says the new bags are not connected with any federal
investigation, but found that 80 percent of its owners said they
wanted such a feature.
</P>
<P>
   Rollovers are the most common fatal truck accident. The National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration is now working on a scoring
system to tell consumers how likely different SUVs are to roll
over.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ultimate Car Book 2000'' by Jack Gillis (A HarperResource
Book, $19.95) offers many safety tips and has a rollover rating
guide.

A BOUNTY OF PICKUPS TO BOGGLE THE MIND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GRIFFITH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A pickup truck zips by you on the highway and you barely notice.
Oh, just another pickup truck, you think.
</P>
<P>
   On that level, a pickup truck is a pickup truck is a . . .
</P>
<P>
   But suppose that one day you decide that you need one . . . or
an SUV?
</P>
<P>
   Well here's some advice. It's free, and it might save you from
being overwhelmed when you go out looking at trucks. Do your
homework first.
</P>
<P>
   That's it.
</P>
<P>
   Homework? Yes. Because buying a truck or SUV can be a lot more
complicated than walking onto a lot and saying, ``I'll take that
one.'' Of course, that's exactly what you eventually want to do,
except that you want to know all about ``that one'' before you
point at it.
</P>
<P>
   The configurations available in trucks and SUVs can boggle the
mind. A good bit of self-evaluation of your wants, needs and
pocketbook can cut down a lot of time and frustration in trying to
make those decisions at a dealer's.
</P>
<P>
   For example: Let's say you want a Ford SUV. Do you want small
(the soon-to-be-available Escape), regular (Explorer), large
(Expedition), or extra large (Excursion)? Or would you prefer a
2-door Explorer Sport or the new Explorer Sport Trac (is it an SUV
with a small pickup bed? Or is it a pickup with an extra-large
four-door cab and small bed)?
</P>
<P>
   Are you confused yet?
</P>
<P>
   We haven't even begun to talk about two-wheel-drive vs.
four-wheel-drive or trim levels. Explorer, alone, comes in 13
configurations.
</P>
<P>
   If you walk into a dealership big enough to offer all the
variations on these themes, instead of a symphony, that sound in
your ears will be a cacophony of confusion.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, we'll offer a recent trip to Liberty Chevrolet in
Wakefield. Salesman Jim Marino provided a guided tour through the
Chevy line, along with some interesting tidbits.
</P>
<P>
   One: Trucks (including SUVs and minivans) make up 85 percent of
the dealership's sales.
</P>
<P>
   Two: Sales seem to be rising at approximately the same rate as
the price of gas.
</P>
<P>
   Three: I saw sticker prices from $12,815 (a base S-10 with the
radio deleted) to $50,000 (one of the custom conversion vans the
dealership is renowned for selling).
</P>
<P>
   The points here are that trucks are continuing to outsell cars
and bigger continues to be the better seller.
</P>
<P>
   Marino was overseeing the maneuvering of a 2000 Suburban
($44,000) onto the showroom floor. ``That sticker doesn't even
include all the extras you see on it,'' he says, gesturing to the
ski bag attached to the roof rack, the custom bicycle rack attached
to the trailer hitch and a protective bra on the front.
</P>
<P>
   ``That stuff is all there so you can see what's available as
dealer-installed options,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For all the time it took to place the Suburban in line on the
showroom floor, don't expect it to stay there long.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the last Suburban we have out of 12,'' said Marino of
the new millenium edition of the heavyweight champ of the Chevy
lineup. ``We sold five before any arrived, then we had more three
sold before the next shipment of five arrived and two more went out
the day they did come in.. And these weren't stripped: They were
$42-43,000 units.'' Still, that price was without the optional
moonroof now offered on the Suburbans for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Chevrolet redesigned its full-sized pickup for the
first time in more than a decade, a big step because the model was
a solid No. 2 seller in the market (behind Ford's perennial No. 1
F-150).
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the old C/K designations, the Chevy pickups now are
called Silverado (formerly the top trim line on the older body
styles).
</P>
<P>
   Want one? Which one? Here's where you realize that all pickups
aren't created equally and no two on the lot are the same.
</P>
<P>
   Let's run down a checklist of decisions to be made in picking a
pickup. Each choice is much more significant than ``paper or
plastic?''
</P>
<P>
   1. Regular cab or extended cab (all extended cabs soon will have
four doors).
</P>
<P>
   2. Box (that's the bed). Three choices here: Fleetside long box
(97.6 inches _ long enough for that 8-foot sheet of plywood or
wallboard); Fleetside short box (78.7 inches long) or Sportside box
(also 78.7 inches long, but narrowed considerably for the flared
rear fenders. Of course, you can buy the chassis-only version and
send it out for a custom box.
</P>
<P>
   3. Trim level. There's standard, an LS upgrade, and on top-end
models, an LT (as in leather) option.
</P>
<P>
   4. 1500 series (1/2 ton) or 2500 series (3/4 ton).
</P>
<P>
   5. Two-wheel drive or 4WD.
</P>
<P>
   6. Transmission. 5-speed manual, 4-speed automatic, heavy duty
versions of each are optional on the 3/4-ton trucks.
</P>
<P>
   7. Engine. Vortec 4300 V-6, 4800 V-8, 5300 V-8, 6000 V-8. If the
numbers are confusing, move the decimal point three places to the
left and you have the size in liters: 4.3, 4.8, 5.3 and 6.0.
</P>
<P>
   8. 2WD or 4x4.
</P>
<P>
   9. Dress-up accessories. Sliding rear window, running boards,
splash guards, tonneau cover, bed liner, off-road package.
</P>
<P>
   10. Suspension. Standard, heavy-duty, off-road, ride-control.
</P>
<P>
   11. Packages. Trailering, off-road, snow-plow prep.
</P>
<P>
   12. And more: You do have to talk such minor details as colors,
extra doors, perhaps a sliding rear window or traction contol in
addition to four-wheel drive.
</P>
<P>
   So the next time you see a pickup truck, you might be looking at
a one-of-its-kind vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Now, about that homework . . .

   If the line between cars-trucks-and SUVs is blurred, here's one
special edition that will be unmistakable: Ford's Harley-Davidson
F-150 pickup. Up to 7,500 of the $32,995 trucks will be built,
beginning on April 10 at Ford's Ontrario Truck Plant. It will be a
4x2 SuperCab (black, naturally) with Harley-Davidson orange
pinstriping, a chrome grill and a flareside box topped by a hard
shell tonneau.
</P>
<P>
   Under the hood will be a 5.4-liter Triton V-8 producing
260-horsepower and turning massive 20-inch tires. The suspension is
lowered one inch with special shocks and (naturally) sport-tuned 3
1/2-inch slash cut exhaust tips.
</P>
<P>
   Inside will be more of the H-D touch, including a dashboard
ornament, black leather-trimmed seats, and a ``spun metal''
instrument cluster. Additional options are slim: a six-disc CD
changer ($400), sliding rear window ($125) and engine block heater
($90) are it.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's George Magro says, ``This is the first of more exciting
products to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, special editions aren't anything new. Ford continues
its Eddie Bauer edition with the Expedition and Explorer, and Chevy
has a neat Warner Brothers Edition of its extended-length Venture
minivans,

   Word out of the Geneva Auto Show is that Dodge will stop using
Cummings diesel engines in its big Ram pickups in favor of a
Mercedes-Benz diesels. The change should begin with the next
generation Ram pickup, scheduled out in 2002 as a 2003 model . . .
GM reported record retail truck sales in February _ 227,298 units,
up 20 percent and the third straight month of double-digit growth
in truck sales . . . DaimlerChrysler reported February minivan
sales up 26 percent from a year ago. Dodge trucks were up 9 percent
. . . The folks at Nissan were happy with truck sales up 61.7
percent versus February, 1999 . . . Nissan Pathfinder buyers will
be equally happy to hear that the 2001 SUV (it went on sale March
15) will have a bunch of updates, most notably a beefier V-6 that
should solve complaints about it being underpowered. The new
3.5-liter V-6 is based on the technology used in the acclaimed
Maxima V-6. How big a change is it? The 3.3-liter V-6 in the 2000
model put out 170 horsepower, the new version is 240 when coupled
to an automatic transmission and 250 with the 5-speed manual.

MINIVANS MAINTAIN THEIR POPULARITY, VERSATILITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a television ad for an SUV which shows a man working out
in a gym being embarrassed by a public address announcement that
could identify him as the owner of a minivan.
</P>
<P>
   Is owning a minivan a stigma now? Apparently the manufacturer
buying this advertisement thinks so.
</P>
<P>
   However, owning a minivan is really nothing to be ashamed of.
The new minivans not only are great people-carriers, but also
cargo-movers, too. Consumer Reports compared the Honda Odyssey,
Volkswagen Passat wagon and Jeep Grand Cherokee for handling the
goods needed for a camping trip. The Odyssey minivan swallowed up
all the goods, the Jeep left a lot behind.
</P>
<P>
   The New England Motor Press Association rated the Chrysler Town
&AMP; Country minivan, which has all-wheel-drive, as its favorite for
winter driving.
</P>
<P>
   Minivans also offer a car-like drive, better handling, and _
very important in these days of high gasoline prices _ better fuel
economy than SUVs or trucks. And there's nothing embarrassing about
saving money at the pump. Minivans also offer more safety features
than some trucks or SUVs. The Ford Windstar, Toyota Sienna, and
Honda Odyssey are all highly rated in crash tests.
</P>
<P>
   Among other reasons for choosing a minivan is interior
flexibility to accommodate various seating arrangements and cargo,
as well as ease of entry. Almost all minivans now have dual sliding
doors, some of which are electrically controlled. The upcoming 2001
DaimlerChrysler products will include not only electrically
controlled dual sliding doors, but also an electric rear door as
well.
</P>
<P>
   While the minivans can offer lots of cargo space with seats
removed, check how easily this can be effected before selecting a
model. Some seats are easier to remove than others.
</P>
<P>
   A popular feature introduced this year on General Motor's
minivans are entertainment centers to keep passengers in the back
seats entertained on long trips. These are becoming more popular on
other makes as well, and units can be easily added to existing
minivans.
</P>
<P>
   For 2000, there are some 17 minivan models to choose from.
Fortunately for shoppers, many of these models are twins. The
Chrysler Town &AMP; Country, Voyager, and Dodge Caravan are similar; as
are the Pontiac Montana, Oldsmobile Silhouette and Chevrolet
Venture; so, too, are the Nissan Quest and Mercury Villager. The
Dodge Caravan is the top-selling model, and Consumer Reports rates
the Honda Odyssey tops.
</P>
<P>
   And, as Consumer Reports notes in its Sport Utility Special
($5.95 on newsstands), ``While not as popular as they once were,
minivans are far from dead.''

FEATURES TO CONSIDER WHEN TRUCK SHOPPING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why should you buy a truck-like vehicle? Conveniences,
flexibility, and safety are three good reasons. Trucks, according
to manufacturers, fall into three categories: pickups, sport
utilities, and minivans.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the things you should be considering when
shopping:
</P>
<P>
   Premium or regular: With gasoline prices nearing $1.80 a gallon
for premium fuels, check out the octane needs of the vehicle you
are looking at. Many SUVs require premium fuel. There are plenty
good SUV models which take just plain old regular octane gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Size: Your personal preferences will determine what size vehicle
you need. Are the truck's features only going to be used
occasionally? What will you be hauling: Lots of kids, cargo, or
some other combination? A pickup with a larger cab and an open
cargo bed could be used for family activities as well as hauling
yard trash or camping gear. A minivan might also serve your
purposes just as well. Consumer Reports found it could pack more
goods in the back of a minivan than a Jeep Grand Cherokee. The
Subaru Forester is a great choice for people who aren't looking for
a huge mass of vehicle, but one that offers all the plusses of an
SUV without being a gas-guzzler.
</P>
<P>
   Interior space: Newer pickup truck models which have rear
seating are now the rage. But not all these vehicles are created
equally when it comes to space. Even some supercab styles may offer
cramped seating for rear-seat passengers. Sport utilities come in
every size imaginable. If you really want space, consider the new
Chevrolet Suburban Tahoe or GMC Yukon. These are real people
carriers, and with rear seats removed, you can place sheets of
plywood on the floor inside. If you really need lots of room, look
to the Ford Excursion, with room for nine passengers plus cargo.
But size can be deceiving. Automobile magazine notes the Excursion
is only slightly bigger inside than the Suburban, and, because of
its size, cannot carry as much payload.
</P>
<P>
   Doors: The four-door pickup is here. But watch those doors. Some
are full-sized _ just like on cars _ and even open like car doors;
others are smaller and may only have door latches on the inside.
Consumers should also note how wide the doors open. The Dodge Quad
has rear doors that open to 90 degrees, making it easier to put
cargo as well as passengers in the back. The upcoming Chevrolet
Avalanche is designed to include a fifth door that opens onto the
bed, allowing extra-long items to be placed on an otherwise short
bed.
</P>
<P>
   Many minivans now have two side sliding doors which are
electrically controlled. The Chrysler Town &AMP; Country will soon
sport not only two electrically controlled side doors but also an
electrically controlled rear door.
</P>
<P>
   On SUVs, the Chevrolet Suburban and GMC Yukon are the only
models with a choice of rear doors. Buyers can choose between a
lift gate or a side-hinged rear cargo door.
</P>
<P>
   What drive? Two-wheel, four-wheel, all-wheel, part-time or
full-time: These are the choices. Just about every pickup truck and
SUV is available with a standard two-wheel-drive, similar to cars.
</P>
<P>
   Permanent four-wheel-drive vehicles have no two-wheel drive
option; these systems are effective in snow and mud and have a
differential that shifts power to wheels needing it. A low-range
drive is usually also found on these vehicles for off-road
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   All-wheel-drive handles all road conditions automatically. Power
is shifted between wheels as needed. No low-range drive is offered
on these models.
</P>
<P>
   Part-time four-wheel-drive operate on the road in
two-wheel-drive. If conditions call for four-wheel-drive, the
driver must select that mode with a lever or switch. Vehicles with
part-time 4WD do allow for ``shift on the fly'' to engage the
system. However, on these vehicles, the four-wheel-drive mode is
not suitable for use on dry pavement.
</P>
<P>
   Warranties: Check out what is covered on your vehicle and for
how long. Isuzu has expanded its powertrain warranty to 10 years,
120,000 miles on its Amigo, Rodeo, Trooper and VehiCross to cover
engine, transmission, steering assembly, suspension and axles.
Adjustment and maintenance items are not covered. The warranty is
only transferable to members of the original owner's family,
otherwise it reverts to a three-year, 50,000-mile warranty.
</P>
<P>
   Suspension: Isuzu's Rodeo and Amigo now have smart suspensions,
a new semiactive suspension system previously used only on luxury
cars and the Lexus LX470. The system increases comfort and reduces
oscillations in body roll. It is standard on models with Ironman
package and the top trim level of the Rodeo. It is not available on
the Trooper.
</P>
<P>
   On SUVs based on a car platform, the ride is much smoother than
on a vehicle with a truck platform. ABS: Antilock brakes prevent
lockups and provide straighter, quicker braking.
</P>
<P>
   Construction: Trucks originally were built on a solid frame,
cars on a unibody frame. The new Mitsubishi Montero has switched
from a frame construction to a unibody one for a more car-like
ride. In 1996, 31 of the 32 SUVs on the road had a truck platform;
by 2006, it is predicted that there will be 70 SUV nameplates, with
37 having truck-based platforms and 33 having car bases.
</P>
<P>
   Cargo bed: Once there were but two choices for pickups _ short
(6 feet) or long bed (8 feet). Then manufacturers built compact
pickups with narrow beds. Now come the blended pickup/SUV with even
shorter beds. &QL; 
 &QL; 
(Notes: Minivans are almost all front-wheel-drive. Chrysler Town &AMP;
Country and the Dodge Caravan have all-wheel-drive options. Only
the Chevrolet Astro and GMC Safari are rear drive. All-wheel-drive
options are available on these models . . . Mercedes Benz has a
solid four-wheel independent suspension on its sports utilities,
giving these models a more carlike ride than othe SUVs.)

THE ALMOST TOO-PERFECT TRUCK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GRIFFITH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The military is great for creating acronyms that make their way
into our everyday lives.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, ASAP (as soon as possible) and NLT (not later
than) were part of my first orders for reporting to basic training.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, military vehicles such as the venerable Jeep and
Humvee, tried and proven by military use, have become popular
crossover civilian successes.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Ford unveiled a military adaptation of its heavy duty
F-350 Super Duty Crew Cab pickup complete with the appropriate
acronym COMBATT (Commercially Based Tactical Truck). Just
wondering: Does a Ford poohbah think of the acronym and adapt a
vehicle to fit it or does a team develop a vehicle and then have
brain(?)storming sessions for the name?
</P>
<P>
   It's obvious that this vehicle will give a whole new meaning to
``Built Ford Tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Gurminder Bedi, vice president, Ford North American Truck, said,
``Ford has a long, proud history of supplying vehicles to the US
military and other branches of government. In addition, this
program allows us to explore technologies that we may be able to
adapt to our regular production trucks.''
</P>
<P>
   Really now? Couldn't this become the ultimate Urban as opposed
to the Suburban?
</P>
<P>
   I can see plenty of civilian applications that would make this a
sensational daily driver.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, it will have a powerful onboard computer with an
advanced global positioning satellite navigation system, night
vision system, collision warning system and upgraded electrical
system, proving 12-volt, 24-volt and 110-volt power.
</P>
<P>
   Wow. I can use the computer to write stories while sitting in
traffic on the Central Artery. After all, I see other folks
applying makeup, reading books &AMP; papers or talking on the phone as
they inch along.
</P>
<P>
   The advanced GPS means never having to say I got lost on the way
to an assignment. (Well, it means I'd at least know where I am,
though not necessarily where I'm going).
</P>
<P>
   Night vision. It will certainly help spot and avoid those deer
and coyotes that are starting to dot our urban landscapes.
</P>
<P>
   The collision warning system should be a great addition.
Imagine! It will go off a split second before I get rammed by a Big
Dig 18-wheeler whose driver has been highway hypnotized while
trying to set the records for most loads of fill delivered in an
eight-hour shift.
</P>
<P>
   And imagine the stereo system you could install with that
110-volt electrical system!
</P>
<P>
   The truck also can be outfitted with a covered pickup box and
seats for carrying troops (in this case reporters). I can imagine
the paper renting out this truck to convey its army of reporters
and photographers for such big events as the Ryder Cup, political
conventions and the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   I'm starting to think I want to open a dealership for this
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   It also will have upgraded suspension, electronically controlled
high performance shock absorbers, supplemental air springs, a
central tire inflation system and 37-inch tires with a run-flat
capability.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know about you, but I'm signing up for a long-term road
test through Big Dig country. It sounds like a match for Boston's
spring potholes.
</P>
<P>
   You can't doubt it's perfect. Ford even says ``The vehicle's
ride height, tire pressure and firmness automatically adjust to the
challenging dirving conditions a military vehicle encounters.''
</P>
<P>
   The demonstration truck is said to have met or exceeded the
ratings of existing Army vehicles while carrying greater payloads.
It's designed to be able to ford 30-inch deep water and operate in
temperatures from 50 below zero to 120 degrees Fahrenheit.
</P>
<P>
   I have some questions for Ford before I trade in my 1961 Falcon
on this baby.
</P>
<P>
   1. How much a month to lease one?
</P>
<P>
   2. Will it run on regular gas?
</P>
<P>
   3. Does the camouflage paint job mean no one can see me coming?
</P>
<P>
   4. Can I get it with heated seats?

 &HT;    Evangelical leader to speak at conference
 &HT;    By Kathy Whyde Jesse
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CENTERVILLE, Ohio _ For evangelical Christians, the directive is
clearly laid forth in the Gospels. It's their job to spread the
word of Jesus Christ to ``unreached peoples,'' even people of other
faiths.
</P>
<P>
   The year 2000 has given that evangelization effort new urgency
as Christians celebrate the second millennium of Christ's birth. In
the past 10 years, grass-roots prayer movements have sprung up,
linking individual Christian churches with ``unchurched'' corners
of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those efforts have been coordinated through AD2000, a
Colorado Springs-based organization that provides information and
resources to evangelistic efforts around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Bush, the group's international director, will speak about
that effort this weekend at Fairhaven Church. His appearance is
part of the church's twice-annual International Missions
Conference. The conference is a resource for other local churches,
according to the Rev. David Smith, pastor of international
ministries.
</P>
<P>
   Evangelism is more important to Christians and Muslims than to
any other religious group, according to William Shea, a theology
professor at St. Louis University. ``Conservative, evangelical
Christians believe salvation is attained only through faith in
Christ,'' he said. ``The 19th and 20th centuries have been
high-water marks in the attempt to convert the world.''
</P>
<P>
   At AD2000, the motto is ``A Church for Every People and the
Gospel for Every Person in the Year 2000.'' The organization was
started in 1995 by Bush, an Argentinian-born evangelist.
</P>
<P>
   It's an ecumenical effort, he says, with Presbyterians, Southern
Baptists, Anglicans and others working together.
</P>
<P>
   At its Web site, www.AD2000.org, the stated goal is to reach 2.2
billion people in 1,739 ethnolinguistic groups by the end of the
year. The methodology is precise: ``Prayer teams'' travel to the
area to take photographs and make maps to bring back to their
congregations. Then, the prayer effort begins. Churches can also
``adopt'' specific groups of people whom they support through
visitation, prayer, money and other resources. Bush says these
efforts have netted ``over 50,000 pieces of information on 110
countries.''
</P>
<P>
   A particular geographical focus is what Bush calls the ``10/40
window'' _ an area of North Africa, the Middle East and Asia that
is between 10 degrees and 40 degrees north latitude. Bush says this
region contains the world's least evangelized and poorest people.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, Bush says, 21 million people have prayed for the 62
nations in this area, and about 200 prayer teams have travelled to
pray on site.
</P>
<P>
   The 4,000 members of Fairhaven have adopted the Mien people of
Asia. Prayer, money and other resources flow to Mien Christians who
are evangelizing non-Christian Miens.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the people in this part of the world are Buddhist,
Muslim or Hindu. Bush avoids use of the word ``conversion,'' but
``the Scripture says very clearly that there is no other name ...
by which man can be saved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to communicate the fact that God loves them,
that Jesus loves them and died for them. Their greatest spiritual
need is the Lord Jesus Christ.''

 &HT;    Papal apology fine, but too forgiving
 &HT;    By Steve Gushee
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last Sunday, the pope asked the world to forgive countless
Christians of sins committed in the name of the Roman Catholic
Church. But he exonerated the Church itself of all responsibility
for those sins.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II wants to have his cake and eat it, too.
</P>
<P>
   The general confession by the head of a church with more than a
billion members is an extraordinary act of good conscience and
political courage.
</P>
<P>
   At a Mass in St. Peter's Church in Rome, the pope apologized for
the calamity caused by seven categories of sins committed through
the course of the Church's history.
</P>
<P>
   The list included, specifically or by inference, sinful acts
done during the Crusades, at the Inquisition, against Jews, women,
gypsies, minorities and human rights in general.
</P>
<P>
   But the pope insists those sins were committed by individual
Christians only, never by the Church.
</P>
<P>
   That's like saying Phillip Morris employees make cigarettes, but
the company doesn't. The position is silly and dangerous. Unless
the pope recognizes that the Church has, on occasion, intentionally
led members to sin, true reform is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, millions of Catholics believed they were following
the teaching of the Church when doing many of the things for which
the pope now apologizes. That's because the Church has
systematically taught and enforced many of them.
</P>
<P>
   But Catholic theology argues that the Church is holy and can do
no wrong. That is a theologically important point about the divine
nature of the Church, but it ignores the very human dimension of
the institution. Conveniently, it lets the Church off the hook for
virtually anything.
</P>
<P>
   One prominent Roman Catholic priest thinks the pope should have
made it clear that the children of the Church in need of
forgiveness included popes, cardinals and clergy. He believes the
pope was badly served by the Church's bureaucracy which, like all
bureaucracies, exists to preserve its own power.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pope had a great idea that some in the Vatican are
obscuring with a fog machine,'' said the Rev. Thomas Reese, editor
of the Jesuit weekly magazine, America, in a New York Times article
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In other circumstances, there is essentially no distinction
between the pope and the Church. Catholic theology claims that
where the pope is, there is the Church. When the pope speaks, the
voice of the Church is heard.
</P>
<P>
   And that Church taught Crusaders to slaughter Muslims, directed
Catholics to put Jews into ghettos and gave members the context in
which to relegate women to second-class citizenship. Those are
notorious acts the pope now sloughs off as the individual sins of
the faithful.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this is the first pope brave enough to acknowledge that
Christians have committed grievous sin on behalf of the Church.
That's a remarkable and welcome admission.
</P>
<P>
   But his confession suggests that when a pope, the vicar of
Christ and leader of a billion Catholics, has erred, he is just
another Christian. That's nonsense.

   The  &UR; New York Times News Service &LR;  is planning an expanded
weather package, with a planned starting date of Monday, March 20,
to be transmitted Sunday, March 19. The package, consisting of a
weather map as a graphics file and a text file to accompany the
map, is available to graphics clients of the News Service.
</P>
<P>
   The new map grows to 4 columns in width (52 picas), from 3, and
is 6 inches deep; the old was 4\ inches deep. This new size permits
the insertion of cloud cover information, previously a separate
map, and the addition of many new cities (see list below).
</P>
<P>
   The map is available both in color and in black and white.
Because the map is much more detailed, we have devised an entirely
new palette of colors to make it easier to read the added
information.
</P>
<P>
   A sample of the new map is available at Wieck, Newscom,
Presslink and AP's GraphicsNet.
</P>
<P>
   Some papers using the old map may need extra time to make the
transition to a 4-column format. We will, for a limited time,
produce a 3-col version of the new map, but with only some of the
new map's additional cities.
</P>
<P>
   A summary of this information is included in each day's Graphics
Budget.

&HT;     TOM JONES NOT READY TO SURRENDER TO THE RICKY MARTIN CRAZE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, March 19)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By GREG HAYMES  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ He's a hip-swivelin' superstar singer.
</P>
<P>
   He's ridin' high at the top of the charts.
</P>
<P>
   He's roarin' into New York's state capital Monday night, where
he's sure to deliver an explosive, high-energy show that's
guaranteed to have his female fans swooning in the aisles.
</P>
<P>
   His name is Ricky Martin ... and Tom Jones.
</P>
<P>
   While sexy, Latin, la-vida-loca-livin' Man of the Moment Ricky
Martin is wowing fans at the Pepsi Arena on Monday, his counterpart
from a generation ago, Tom Jones, will be knocking out his
followers at Proctor's Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   To most, it might seem to be the passing of the torch from a
once-glorious, high-wattage crooner to the next generation's
musical sex symbol.
</P>
<P>
   And while there's no denying that Martin, 28, is hot, hot, hot
right now, Jones isn't ready to relinquish his crown just yet.
Although he launched his career way back in 1965 with the smash hit
``It's Not Unusual,'' the 59-year-old Jones isn't just a sex symbol
for grandmothers.
</P>
<P>
   Jones hasn't released an album of new material in the United
States since his underrated ``The Lead and How to Swing It,'' was
released in 1994. And his last bona-fide hit was in 1988, when he
scored with a remake of Prince's ``Kiss,'' backed by the
electro-dance combo Art of Noise.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's hard to tell here in America, Tom Jones' career is
hotter than it's ever been in Europe. His latest single, ``Sex
Bomb,'' is a super-smash hit. It's currently No. 7 on the charts in
Germany, No. 4 in Spain and Austria, No. 3 in Belgium, No. 2 in
Italy and No. 1 in France and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, his current European album, ``Reload,'' is also in
the Top 10 in every one of those countries.
</P>
<P>
   The album _ which unfortunately is not yet scheduled for a U.S.
release _ finds Jones in a collaborative mode, as he shares the
microphone with such partners as Van Morrison, the Pretenders'
Chrissie Hynde (on a razor-sharp rendition of Iggy Pop's ``Lust For
Life''), Barenaked Ladies, Stereophonics (on Randy Newman's ``Mama
Told Me Not to Come'') and Simply Red's Mick Hucknall, to name a
few.
</P>
<P>
   The first single from the album, a hot-wired remake of the
Talking Heads' ``Burning Down the House'' recorded with the
Cardigans, was a smash all across Europe, too.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, after almost a year on the charts, Martin's
self-titled English-language debut album is still securely in the
Top 50 of Billboard's best-selling album chart. So far, the album
has sold more than 7 million copies.
</P>
<P>
   And while the inescapable ``Livin' La Vida Loca'' was one of the
best-selling records of last year, Martin's follow-up single,
``Shake Your Bon-Bon,'' was only a modest hit, failing to crack the
Top 20.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's spectacular live performances have turned more than a
few non-believers into fans, however. His electrifying performance
last year at the Grammy Awards show was an absolute career-making
moment, winning him the adoration of millions of TV viewers as well
as superstar Madonna, who immediately concocted a duet with the
Latin sensation.
</P>
<P>
   Although Martin didn't take a trophy home with him at last
month's Grammy Awards ceremonies, his performance was something of
a three-ring circus, complete with aerial acrobats, slinky,
barely-clad dancers and even an actual ring of fire.
</P>
<P>
   The charismatic Martin also wowed television viewers with his
first-ever television special, ``One Night Only,'' which aired on
CBS in November. The concert, recently released as a home video,
was filmed outdoors in New Jersey's Liberty State Park with the New
York City skyline as a backdrop, and while the spectacle was
undeniably dazzling, Martin's considerable singing talents often
seemed overshadowed by his nonstop gyrations and the
everything-to-excess production values of the performance.
</P>
<P>
   As successful as both singers have been, their careers have been
dominated by their sexy, larger-than-life images rather than their
musical talent. And Jones' experience in combating the public's
perception of him could serve as a cautionary tale to the
up-and-coming sex symbol Martin, who is igniting quite a
combustible reaction among his fevered fans these days.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the early days of Jones' career, when he was churning
out his initial string of hit records _ including ``What's New,
Pussycat?,'' ``The Green, Green Grass of Home'' and ``Delilah'' _
Jones worked his primarily female, underwear-tossing fans into a
frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that in my case, the image overshadowed the talent in
a lot of people's eyes. I've had to get over the whole panties
thing,'' explained Jones during an interview a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one time in the '70s, I'd read reviews of my shows where
the writers wrote about how many pairs of underwear were thrown.
Sometimes, the writers were so busy documenting the crowd's frenzy
that my voice would not even be mentioned in the review. They'd be
reviewing the audience's reaction instead of my performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole panties thing really got out of hand. I used to not
exactly encourage it, but go along with it,'' Jones admitted.
``Pick them up, wipe the brow and do the business, you know?''
</P>
<P>
   ``But if people throw things at me now, I don't pick them up.
They just stay where they land. And believe me,'' he adds with a
resounding laugh, ``sometimes the stage is quite littered.''

&HT;     `THE CUP' RUNNETH OVER WITH DELIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Such a sweet, soft-hearted film is ``The Cup'' that you might
want to bring your 4-year-old to see it _ it's rated G, it boasts a
scrappy juvenile protagonist and it features significantly less
violence than either ``Pokemon'' or ``Power Rangers'' (Uh, what
doesn't?). The catch is, it's in Tibetan and Bhutanese. Either
junior has to be fluent in Asian languages or old enough to read
subtitles at a fevered clip.
</P>
<P>
   That being said, ``The Cup'' offers proof positive that films
need be neither obvious nor vulgar to woo the viewer's attention.
This little film about soccer-crazed Tibetan monks exiled in India
bewitches without being pushy, relying on none of the usual
moviemaking conventions to nudge the story along.
</P>
<P>
   Put ``story'' in quotes: What plot there is concerns nothing
more labyrinthine than a bunch of young monks scheming to watch the
1998 World Cup. No fatal catastrophes befall them along the way, no
moments of violence or heartbreak or deus-ex-machinal plot twists.
We don't even see much soccer _ brief snatches of two televised
games, total.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ``The Cup'' delights on its own, offering an unsentimental,
unexpectedly prankish view of a world not quite cut off from
Western civilization. Filled with actual Tibetan monks, the film
was written and directed by Khyntese Norbu, a Bhutanese filmmaker
doubly known as one of the most important incarnate lamas in the
Tibetan Buddhist tradition.
</P>
<P>
   He's not the only one with an interesting resume: Among the
cast, the press kit explains, is the fourth reincarnation of an
18th-century Buddhist master, a ceremonial hierarch so daunting
that ``it was challenging to find a Tibetan actor willing to
wrestle with him.'' (The press kit also explains that one cast
member ``has never washed his hair.'')
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the film is Jamyang Lodro as Orgyen, the puckishly
naughty novice monk who sneaks off into the woods for nocturnal
rendezvous with a village television set. There he watches World
Cup soccer games with his confreres, who eventually get caught and
disciplined. But it isn't long before Orgyen and his mates have
convinced the monastery's aged Abbot (Lama Chonjor, an actual
abbot) and stern disciplinarian, Geko (Orgyen Tobgyal, an incarnate
lama and Jamyang Lodro's father), for permission to rent a boob
tube and satellite dish to watch the finals.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the plot _ granted, a bit thin. But the movie's charm
boils down to its honeyed mix of East and West, the exotic and the
mundane: the sight of monks, their rust-red robes gathered around
their ankles, chasing a soccer ball in the dirt; an old lama who
turns empty Coke cans into devotional candles; the monks who pore
over smuggled sport magazines; Orgyen's room, a shrine to soccer
players, or his undershirt emblazoned with the name and number of
Brazilian superstar Ronaldo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cup'' pairs its young monks' pop-cultural savvy with the
old Abbot's quiet endurance of exile (``Do you think these monks
will know what Tibet was really like?''), a counterpoint familiar
to any tale of immigrants abroad: As Americans know full well,
whippersnappers assimilate. Lengthen their hair, paint freckles on
their cheeks and swap their robes for rosaries, and Geko's
misbehaving monks could be Catholic boys launching spitballs at
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Warren's bright, straightforward cinematography captures
both the harsh Indian landscape of jagged mountains and wide,
yellow fields of grass (the film actually was shot in Bhutan) and
the humdrum details of life in the monastery. Norbu seemed to
realize, while making the film, that Westerners would comprise his
main audience, and he lets the movie dwell on tidbits: the making
of tea, the twisting of wicks, the shaving of heads.
</P>
<P>
   Humor sneaks in with little fanfare. When a newcomer asks Orgyen
why he can't watch World Cup matches during the day, the young monk
quips: ``It's something to do with the world not being flat.''
</P>
<P>
   Later on, while the abbot mulls the monks' request to rent a TV,
he ponders the illogic of two civilized nations ``fighting over a
ball.'' As Abbot asks Geko what the winner receives, he pours a cup
of butter tea. And as the old man raises the vessel to his lips,
Geko answers: ``A cup.'' They smile. We smile. The film smiles,
too, as peacefully and contemplatively as a monk in prayer.

   ATLANTA _ Police today identified former Black Panther leader H.
Rap Brown as the man who shot two deputies in Atlanta Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators showed one of the wounded deputies a photo
line-up, which included pictures of Brown, now know as Jamil
Abdullah Al-Amin. Deputy Algernon English identified Al-Amin as the
shooter, Atlanta Police Chief Beverly Harvard said.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Chief C.B. Jackson said Al-Amin was charged with two
counts of aggravated battery in connection with the shootings.
Al-Amin had not been captured by early afternoon. The Atlanta
police are leading the investigation into the shooting. Jackson
heads the department's criminal investigation section.
</P>
<P>
   The two Fulton County sheriff's deputies were shot by a
.223-caliber assault rifle late Thursday when they attempted to
serve a warrant on Al-Amin at an address in West End, said Capt.
David Chadd of the Fulton County Sheriff's Department.
</P>
<P>
   The deputies saw a black Mercedes parked in front of the
address, Harvard said. The deputies ordered the driver to show his
hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, here they are,'' the man in the Mercedes said as he opened
fire, English told investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting occurred at the intersection of Oak Street and West
End Place, in the street near a grocery store run by Al-Amin.
</P>
<P>
   The two deputies were taken to Grady Memorial Hospital. They
both underwent surgery, which concluded shortly after 1 a.m., and
were in the intensive care unit, said Barbara Vogel, a hospital
night administrator.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Kinchen was in extremely critical condition after being
shot in the abdomen and leg. English, listed in serious condition,
was shot four times _ twice in the left arm, once in the left thigh
and once in the right side.
</P>
<P>
   Both deputies were wearing protective vests as well as a metal
plate inside the vest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ballistic shield may have saved English's life,'' Cook
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the kind of guy you want backing you up,'' Corporal John
Watson of the Fulton County Court Services said of English. Watson
said English had been in working in warrant services for about six
months.
</P>
<P>
   The deputies had been attempting to serve a Cobb County warrant
when the shooting started, said Chadd.
</P>
<P>
   Fulton Sheriff Jacqueline Barrett said it was ``almost an ambush
situation they walked into.''
</P>
<P>
   The address where the warrant was served, 1128 Oak St., has a
sign over the door: ``In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most
Merciful, the Community Store.''
</P>
<P>
   At 1126 Oak St. is the Al-Fajr Trading Co., which sells incense,
books, oils and clothing. A sign reads: ``Welcome to Islam, Worship
the Creator, not the Creations.''
</P>
<P>
   Chadd said it looked as if the gunman ``had a vendetta for
police officers or deputies.''
</P>
<P>
   The officers returned fire and may have wounded the suspect,
Chadd said.
</P>
<P>
   Police seeking the shooter thought they had him cornered in the
store at 1128 Oak. When officers entered, they found signs that the
man may have been wounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're following a blood trail,'' Chadd said. SWAT teams were
conducting a house-to-house search of a four-block area south of
downtown Atlanta. The neighborhood being searched was around the
Oak Street area near West End Place.
</P>
<P>
   Police brought in a helicopter and dogs. West End Place was
blocked off through the night. Al-Amin, 56, moved to the West End
area in 1976 after he was released from prison on a robbery
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   He converted to the Muslim faith while in prison and changed his
name to Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin.
</P>
<P>
   The grocery store he runs is about 100 feet from, and on the
other side of West End Place from Al-Amin's mosque, which is housed
in a large blue frame building.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been knowing him (Al-Amin) since '77,'' said Jerry
Stegall, a taxi dispatcher who lives next to the mosque. ``I don't
believe he would have been shooting a police officer. I know he was
in the Black Panthers, but that was 30 years ago and people
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Stegall said he had been in the grocery store often, but the
former activist turned Muslim never tried to convert him. ``It was
up to you. If you wanted to talk about Islam, he'd listen, but he
never tried to talk you into his religion,'' he said of Al-Amin,
who he described as a calm-natured person.
</P>
<P>
   William Abdur-Rahim, representing the Council of the Iman, a
group of about 20 mosques in the Atlanta area, was at Grady
Memorial Hospital early this morning.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke to Mayor Bill Campbell, who was also at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Abdur-Rahim said he has known Al-Amin for several years and that
he believes police were being too quick to try to convict him,
saying there is no proof Al-Amin is the person who shot the
officers.
</P>
<P>
   He described Al-Amin as ``a pillar of the Muslim community and a
pillar of the African-American community. He's valuable in the
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Cobb County police arrested Al-Amin on May 31, 1999, during a
traffic stop on Cobb Parkway near I-285. Al-Amin was driving a
stolen 1992 green Ford Explorer. He told Officer J.J. Mack that he
had bought the Explorer earlier in the month, according to the
police incident report.
</P>
<P>
   When Al-Amin pulled out his wallet, he had what appeared to be a
police badge, the report said. When Mack asked if he was a cop,
Al-Amin said yes, he was an officer in White Hall, Ala., the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   But when police checked it out they couldn't find proof Al-Amin
was an officer, the report said. He was also charged with no proof
of insurance and arrested.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Cobb County jail booking report, Al-Amin was
released on $10,000 bond within hours of his arrest. He was
indicted on all three charges on Sept. 3, according to court
records.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin failed to appear in Cobb County Superior Court on Jan.
24, and Judge Mary Staley issued a bench warrant for his arrest
four days later, according to the warrant.

&HT;     `ERIN BROCKOVICH' PROVIDES PATHOS BATHED IN HUMOR 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   This is probably stating the obvious, but you have to love Julia
Roberts. No, literally you have to. It's in the penal code
somewhere. (Section 115-D: No person shall engage in such conduct
or opinion that would constitute an insult to Julia Roberts, her
movies, person, boyfriends or hair.)
</P>
<P>
   Roberts is by now such an American icon that it's hard to
imagine the last decade of moviegoing without her. She seems so
permanent, so fixed in our joint consciousness, that each new film
she releases carries a curious air of inevitability. We know what
to expect of her because we own her: Like Shirley Temple before
her, Roberts' stardom is as much a product of our frontier optimism
as her own exuberant gifts. She's ours.
</P>
<P>
   Never has this been clearer than in ``Erin Brockovich,'' in
which Roberts brings her corn-fed ebullience to the brassiest, most
irresistible role she has had in years. Tramped-up in necklines
that head south, hemlines that head north and cleavage that heads
everywhere, Roberts' titular heroine is the sort of ballsy broad
who knows what she's got and uses it without apology. Her breasts
are weapons; her language is trash. Yet she's still, somehow, Julia
Roberts, the girl next door with the self-effacing laugh who can
play a hooker and still seem wholesome. ``Pretty Woman'' is never
far away.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts is perfect for this kind of contradiction, and she's
perfect for ``Erin Brockovich,'' an unexpectedly delightful
legal-eagle movie that embraces convention while twisting it
craftily on its ear. Keen viewers, and even a few not-so-keen
viewers, will spot the obvious parallels with last year's ``A Civil
Action'' _ Big Bad Corporation Fouls Water, Gets Sued _ but ``Erin
Brockovich'' is neither as gorgeous to look at nor as fatally blah.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it's an eco-crusade with spunk, the true story of a
broke, spirited single mom who joins forces with a lawyer (a
splendiferously discombobulated Albert Finney) to bring down
California utility giant Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric.
</P>
<P>
   The film was directed by Steven Soderbergh, the former indie
wunderkind whose work runs from the off-kilter (``Out of Sight,''
``The Limey'') to the ecstatically odd (``Schizopolis''). It was
scripted by Susannah Grant, who wrote the revisionist fable ``Ever
After,'' and her collaboration with Soderbergh boasts the same
winning self-awareness; she seems to specialize in films that tweak
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   A few tweaks are inherent to the story, as Erin (whose real-life
counterpart pops up in a cameo) is neither a legal authority nor
one of the plaintiffs poisoned by PG&AMP;E's toxic chromium outwash.
She's just a nobody with a filing job in a small private firm. But
what a nobody: By film's end she's found 634 people whose lives
were ruined by the utility company's malign neglect. Both Erin
Brockovich and ``Erin Brockovich'' confound expectations, imbuing a
long, sad tale with lightness and warmth. When was the last time
someone made a comedy about people dying from contaminated
groundwater?
</P>
<P>
   Yet ``Erin Brockovich'' isn't strictly a comedy. It is a very
funny film, but it's a funny film that pulls laughs from character
and human drama rather than boilerplate sitcom set-ups. One of the
more startling punchlines in the film occurs about halfway through,
when Erin, gathering evidence for the suit against PG&AMP;E, interviews
a housewife (Marg Helgenberger) who's just learned she has uterine
and breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   It's a brutally affecting scene, prefaced by a brief, dark clip
of the woman's husband thrashing in anger at the plant across the
way. But just as the scene is about to erode from pathos to bathos,
Soderbergh slaps it with humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think,'' asks the housewife, ``if you've got no uterus
and no breasts, you're still technically a woman?'' Half a beat
passes before Erin's reply. ``You're a happier woman,'' she says,
``because you don't have to worry about maxi-pads and underwire.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's something even more extraordinary: It gets a laugh. A
confused laugh, a shocked laugh, a guilty laugh, but nevertheless a
laugh. Although ``Erin Brockovich'' is by far the most linear movie
Soderbergh has ever made _ even ``Out of Sight'' had more tricks up
its sleeve _ it retains his spirit of contrary independence.
Despite a hefty running time (131 minutes), he whooshes things
along, elbowing past the standard narrative techniques that usually
clutter such films. It has, for instance, no courtroom climax.
</P>
<P>
   While some of this may irritate traditional-minded viewers,
``Erin Brockovich'' is beyond question a crowd-pleaser _ an
eccentric anti-blockbuster masquerading as mainstream fodder.
Although Roberts gets plenty of mileage from her push-up bra, her
crossfire with co-stars is as nuanced and sneaky as anything she's
done. (Aaron Eckhardt, best known as the white-collar scum from
``In the Company of Men,'' is a dish of soft butter as Erin's
sensitive-biker beau.) Just look at her scenes with Finney, his
great, soft loaf of a face flushed with amazement; he's never seen
a creature like this before, although we have. It's our Julia. And
oh, how we love her.

   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

   MONROVIA, Calif. _ Holiday are important to small children. They
provide elementary school teachers an opportunity to teach ``art''
by having their small charges pick the correct color crayon for
each holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Children used to make paper chains of red and green in
anticipation of Christmas, even if they came from Jewish, Muslim or
families who do not observe the holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Now we are multicultural. Everyone is included. We still take a
week or two off at Christmas but we call it the ``winter break'' or
``winter solstice.'' It doesn't really matter, the entire country
takes Dec. 25 off _ believers or not, religious or not.
</P>
<P>
   What are we to make of St. Patrick's Day? No one gets a day off
work, but elementary school children use green crayons to color
four-leaf clovers and cartoon versions of St. Patrick. Adults drink
green beer and New York has a big parade. Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   My Irish-German mother loves St. Patrick's Day. When I was a kid
she made ``blarney stones'' out of white squares of cake covered in
green frosting, rolled in crushed peanuts. My brothers and sisters
and I devoured them. They were a family tradition and delicious.
</P>
<P>
   I grew up in a small town in the Midwest in the late 1950s, safe
in the knowledge that everyone in the world was white, Christian
and just like me. Some may call my upbringing homogeneous. I call
it deprived. I didn't eat a taco until I was 24, the same year I
attended my first symphony concert.
</P>
<P>
   I moved to California in 1982. I heard Spanish and learned the
important words. I got a taste of real Mexican food, a la
California, and loved every bite. I was introduced to Chinese,
Korean, Vietnamese and Cuban food. I drew the line at sushi.
</P>
<P>
   Being German, Irish and French (my dad's side), in other words,
``white,'' I have often felt left out in this multicultural world.
As a child I ate Wonder Bread, Spam, Tater Tots and fish sticks. I
found a peanut butter and jelly sandwich in my lunch box every day
at school, along with three pennies so I could buy a carton of
white milk.
</P>
<P>
   Although I didn't really think about it much as a child, I
didn't have an ethnic identity of my own.
</P>
<P>
   After moving to California, I felt deprived and left out. I was
just plain white. My ancestors had come from Europe more than a few
generations ago; I was simply a WASP, a white Anglo-Saxon
Protestant. I had no food (other than my grandmother's blarney
stones), language or dress to claim. Or so I thought.
</P>
<P>
   I was so busy being envious of my co-workers, neighbors and
friends who took pride in their ethnic heritage, I didn't look hard
enough for my own. I owe my compulsive need for neatness to the
German side, my love of laughter and writing to the Irish side and
my occasional snootiness, and love of Chardonnay, to the French
side.
</P>
<P>
   One bright St. Patrick's Day morning a few years ago I went to
work sporting a huge, plastic, fluorescent green bow tie. It was
like a party hat, and the tiny elastic band held the clown-size bow
tie securely to my neck. I was a big hit. I claimed my heritage. I
belonged!
</P>
<P>
   Some of my co-workers wanted a green bow tie too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, no,'' I exclaimed, ``you're not Irish.''
</P>
<P>
   They felt left out. Oh, my.
</P>
<P>
   On another St. Patrick's Day, I no longer needed to wear a green
bow tie to work. I know who I am, where I belong and how I got
here. I arrived as almost all of us did, with hope, optimism and a
deep sense of who I am: an American.

<P>
   GUADALUPE VALLEY, Mexico _ As Victor Torres swished the amber
liquid between his teeth, an expression of joy spread over his
face.
</P>
<P>
   A French-trained winemaker, Torres knew he had a sweet nectar of
exquisite caliber in the making.
</P>
<P>
   Are we talking France here? Maybe Napa Valley?
</P>
<P>
   Neither. Torres is among a new breed of winemakers in the
Guadalupe Valley, a pocket of surprisingly fertile land on the
Pacific Ocean side of Mexico's Baja California. The valley is only
about 50 miles southeast of the border city of San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Blessed by a cooling coastal fog that takes the hot edge off the
region's near-desert terrain, the valley is starting to produce
award-winning wines that are gaining a toehold at upscale
restaurants and among wine lovers on both sides of the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be the Napa Valley of Mexico,'' said Torres, the
winemaker for Chateau Camou, one of about a half-dozen wineries
that have started to produce premiere wines in the valley over the
last decade.
</P>
<P>
   Just down the road from Chateau Camou, winemaker Hans Backhoff,
who grew up in this area, also praises the soil, sun and chilly
nights that create a nourishing micro-climate for grapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the influence of the sea. That's what makes this valley
so special,'' Backhoff said, as he poured a sample of Merlot aging
in a French oak barrel at his winery, Monte Xanic (pronounced,
``Mon-TAY Sha-NEEK'').
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans consume less than half a bottle of wine per person per
year, a figure that's a fraction of what consumers drink in
countries that have a love affair with the grape. Argentineans, for
example, consume around 50 liters per person annually.
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans still produce far more of the ever-popular tequila and
beer. But wine consumption is indeed increasing, buoyed by a taste
for fine wine among Mexican professionals and Baja's homegrown
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The Guadalupe Valley is about 10 miles east of the Baja beach
town of Ensenada, which is touting Mexico's new ``wine country'' as
a great place to visit while eating lobster enchiladas and swimming
and surfing. Hotels are stocking fliers on the Guadalupe Valley
now, and offering tours for tasting and to attend a number of
annual festivals. Cruise ships that dock in Ensenada are also
encouraging visitors. The valley's wines are featured now in fine
restaurants in Acapulco, Cancun, Mexico City and a growing number
of American cities.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the oldest winery in this hemisphere started in
Mexico, where in the 1520s Mexico's Spanish conquistadors ordered
1,000 vines planted for every 100 Indians forced to work for them.
</P>
<P>
   Then Spain, fearing competition from its colony, subsequently
banned vineyards from Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Wine grapes were eventually born again in Mexico, but for
centuries vintners have produced mostly grapes for brandy or for
wine that was mediocre.
</P>
<P>
   Now vintners in Baja California, where most of Mexico's wine
grapes are grown, are getting serious about quality rather than
quantity.
</P>
<P>
   That's the mission of the Guadalupe Valley vintners, including
the oldest of the bunch, Bodegas de Santo Tomas, which was
established in 1888.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 Santo Tomas winemakers teamed up with American friends
in Northern California, a region that was also once considered an
upstart in a world of wines dominated by Europeans. The joint
venture, which first produced 5,000 cases that were released in
1998, was the brainchild of Santo Tomas and Wente Bros., a
century-old winery in the Livermore Valley east of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Christened Duetto, the wine is a blend of 50 percent Mexican and
50 percent California grapes. It is bottled in Mexico, and thus
escapes tariffs on U.S. wine imports that are hovering at about 8
percent now. A high-quality red wine mix of Cabernet Sauvignon,
Cabernet Franc and Merlot, Duetto's first vintage sold out in a
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico has the quality of the grapes. They have everything to
produce a good wine. That's for sure,'' said Marc Bourreli, Wente's
director of Latin American exports.
</P>
<P>
   This year, for the first time, 1,000 cases of Duetto will be
released in the U.S. market for retail sale and stocking at
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Torres and Backhoff's wines are also heading north.
</P>
<P>
   Backhoff, a British-trained food scientist, said he made wine as
a hobby in Baja California before getting together a group of
investors in 1987 and opening up Monte Xanic. Housed in a classic
stone building, the winery has a tasting room featuring white and
red wines that are now on wine lists in restaurants in New York,
Colorado, Arizona, California and Florida. Backhoff's wines have
picked up awards at a number of California festivals in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   The Henry Wine Group is distributing Monte Xanic now to
retailers and the Napa Valley-based Chalone Wine Group is offering
bottles of the wine to its shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Backhoff said he and his partners thought of the name of their
winery after spring rains prompted beautiful desert flowers to
bloom throughout the valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want a French name,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So they chose Xanic, which in an Indian language means ``the
first flower that blooms after the rain,'' Backhoff said. ``It's
Mexican. But it doesn't sound like tequila or tacos.''
</P>
<P>
   The vineyard is 175 acres, he added, and some of the vines are
40 years old. Part of the vineyard was previously owned by a family
of Russian descent, which took up grape growing like other Russian
immigrants to Baja California at the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Xanic's wines range from US$15 to US$100. Only about 3 percent
of the product is exported, but Backhoff expects exports to climb
to 6 percent this year. Tariffs are low on Mexican wine imports to
the United States and if Mexican vintners export their wines, they
get a substantial tax break at home.
</P>
<P>
   Chateau Camou's wines are being carried by the United States'
Wine Warehouse and can be found in Chicago, Washington and this
year, the company hopes, Texas. Prices range from US$6 to more than
US$100 for wines that have won awards in French competitions in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The winery, which was founded in 1985, is constructing a new
mission-style building and its tasting room is also open for
tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Torres said he is particularly proud of his white wines _
Chardonnay and Chenin Blanc _ which many experts believe Mexican
soil simply cannot produce.
</P>
<P>
   One of Torres' white wine blends, Flor de Guadalupe, recently
beat California whites in a competition north of the border, Torres
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that was one of our lower-end wines,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Torres is equally proud of the French techniques he uses, such
as gently agitating the wine periodically with a stick while it
ferments in French oak barrels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why change something that's worked for more than 200 years?''
Torres said. ``We're trying to combine tradition with modern
techniques.''

   JERUSALEM _ Pope John Paul II comes to the Holy Land next week
as an elderly pilgrim determined to change the world.
</P>
<P>
   He begins his visit Monday in Jordan, then visits Israel and the
Palestinian territories until the following Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   He will see the Mount Nebo in Jordan, where Moses looked upon
the promised land. He will pray above the Bethlehem cave where
tradition says Christ was born. He will deliver mass above the Sea
of Galilee, in the hills where Christ gave the speeches that became
known as the Sermon on the Mount.
</P>
<P>
   The journey presents a monumental moment in the already
remarkable life of this pontiff.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II, at 79 years of age, is the most media savvy
and well-traveled of all the popes. He scores high in U.S. public
opinion polls despite stands on issues with which many Americans
disagree _ against abortion, the death penalty and contraception.
</P>
<P>
   Long ago an amateur actor, the pope now steps onto a stage that
has the most holy sites in Christianity as its backdrop _ in the
very places Christ himself walked. It is his first trip here as
pope.
</P>
<P>
   With the pope in the twilight years of his pontificate, this
91st trip abroad could be the hallmark of a legacy that is hinged
on the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The pope has declared the year 2000 a ``Jubilee'' and ``Holy
Year.'' He asks that Catholics begin the third millennium since
Christ's birth by reflecting on their past, and building a new
future.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, the first of the Catholic Lenten period of
penitence, the pope took the unprecedented step of asking
forgiveness from God for a sweeping list of sins committed by
followers of the church.
</P>
<P>
   This week's trip is part of that renewal or, as the pope calls
it, the ``purification of memory.'' Ultimately, he aims for nothing
less than sweeping away centuries of bitterness between Jews and
Catholics _ and within different branches of Christianity itself.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere are the divisions more clear than here. Israelis and
Palestinians are still logjammed in a tense peace process. Arab
Christians _ some 180,000 of them _ are an uncomfortable minority
between the Jewish state and Muslim-dominated areas under control
of the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Some Jews accuse the Church of ignoring the Holocaust. Some
Muslims bear grudges from the Church's medieval crusades. Greek
Orthodox Christians here view the Catholic Church with suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   Amid it all, the pope brings his message of reconciliation with
the hopeful enthusiasm of a pilgrim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a strong desire to go personally to pray in the most
important places which, from the Old to the New Testament, have
seen God's interventions,'' the pope wrote in June of last year.
``I say to everyone: Let us set out in the footsteps of Christ!''
</P>
<P>
   He came here in 1965, before he was pope, and commemorated the
``unforgettable experience'' in poetry.
</P>
<P>
   Some say it took the warming relations between Israel and its
Arab neighbors to make the new trip possible. Others protest that
the time is still not right, since many issues between Israelis and
Palestinians remain unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   But, the pope has talked about the Jubilee year since he
ascended to the papacy in 1978. Now appearing to suffer from
Parkinson's disease, it may be that no political circumstance could
have stopped him from making the trip _ which he insists is not
political.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be an exclusively religious pilgrimage in its nature
and purpose, and I would be saddened if anyone were to attach other
meanings to this plan of mine,'' he wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   But politics are super-imposed on any high-profile trip to the
region, and the pope's is no exception.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians worry his visits to Arab areas of east Jerusalem _
under Israeli security protection _ will be seen as a recognition
of Israeli occupation there. Israelis fear his trip to
Palestinian-controlled areas will be tantamount to a recognition of
Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is inevitable that it is going to be politicized. What will
please the Palestinians will upset the Israelis, and whatever
pleases the Israelis will upset the Palestinians,'' said Harry
Hagopian, executive director of the Jerusalem liaison office for
the Middle East Council of Churches.
</P>
<P>
   But Archbishop Pietro Sambi, the Vatican's representative to
Israel, suggested the pope's visit could ease the political
bitterness.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the pope speaks of a spiritual pilgrimage, he is not
talking about just coming to say prayers,'' Sambi said. ``He means
to make a new consensus, a sense of responsibility, a principle of
truth and justice.''
</P>
<P>
   The ground is more fertile for that than it was during the only
other papal visit to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, Pope Paul VI visited for a day. Relations were so
chilly between the Vatican and Israel that he insisted on a special
entry point into the country rather than recognize any of Israel's
official border points.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, Israeli officials still bristled at the Church's
silence during the Holocaust. Church doctrine seemed to blame Jews
for the death of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Church officials were sympathetic to Israel's Arab
neighbors. They worried that cozy relations with Israel would
endanger Christian communities in Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1960s, the church officially retracted the
accusations of Jewish involvement in Christ's death. Then, Pope
John Paul II went even further.
</P>
<P>
   He has sought forgiveness for Catholics' misdeeds during the
Holocaust and has condemned anti-Semitism dozens of times. While
church teachings used to call the Jews treacherous, this pope has
dubbed Judaism the ``elder brother'' among the Christian, Jewish
and Muslim faiths.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi David Rosen, head of the Israel office of the
Anti-Defamation League, said the pope has ``turned upside down the
whole traditional attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, with the way paved by the Oslo peace process, Israel
and the Vatican exchanged their first ambassadors.
</P>
<P>
   Of primary concern to the Vatican are the followers of the pope
in the region. There are about 70,000 Arab Christians in Israel and
the Palestinian areas who are Roman Catholics or Greek Catholics,
known also as Melkites.
</P>
<P>
   They comprise a little less than half the Christians in Israel
and the Palestinian areas _ including Greek, Syrian, Armenian
Orthodox and some Protestants. They have been overwhelmed by the
growth in the Jewish and Muslim populations.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty years ago, Christians made up about 9 percent of the
population, but now they are about 2 percent. Christians emigrate
at higher rates than non-Christians do.
</P>
<P>
   The pope is expected to encourage the local Christians to stay
in the place where Christianity began.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe he will have special blessings,'' said 77-year-old
Labibeh Abdel-Noor, leaving a Roman Catholic Mass in Jerusalem's
Church of the Holy Sepulchre on Sunday. The pope is scheduled to
hold a Mass in the church, believed by Catholics to be where Christ
was crucified and entombed, on March 26.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-five years ago, Abdel-Noor was among the crowds that
greeted Paul VI. Just maybe, she said, this pope's visit can bring
people closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people can start to get united, it is easier to have
peace. We pray for peace,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But, the pope's message could be less well-received by those of
the majority religions.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials welcome the visit and say it will be a
breakthrough in Christian-Jewish relations. They have laid out more
than $10 million in roadwork and construction for the visit.
</P>
<P>
   A poll this month showed most Israelis see the visit positively.
</P>
<P>
   But, a fringe of right-wing Israelis have threatened to disrupt
the visit if they can. Signs and graffiti in Jerusalem have labeled
the pope a ``pagan'' who should be shunned.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Chief Rabbi Israel Meir Lau said he hopes the pope will
use a visit to the Yad Vashem Holocaust museum to apologize for the
silence of Pope Pius XII during the Holocaust. He said the pope's
Lenten confession of sins, which did not mention the Holocaust,
showed ``serious historical myopia.''
</P>
<P>
   An apology for Pius XII is extremely unlikely. He is in the
running for sainthood and popes are considered infallible under
Catholic doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   But, the pope has asked for 15 minutes to speak at Yad Vashem
and is using the event to meet Jews from his hometown in Poland who
fled the Holocaust. Some were among the pope's childhood friends.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, officials of the Palestinian Authority _ which
controls the Palestinian areas _ have warmly welcomed the visit,
while some Muslims chose to bear their own grudges. One Muslim
leader called for the pope to apologize for the Crusades.
</P>
<P>
   For most of his trip, the pope will be surrounded by 18,000
police in the largest security operation in Israeli history. Entire
neighborhoods will be closed when the pope is nearby, prompting
concerns that the isolation will frustrate local Christians and
deprive the pope of the crowd contact from which he draws strength.
</P>
<P>
   Two of his ``Pope Mobiles'' are being flown in and a smaller one
has been constructed to navigate the narrow streets of Jerusalem's
Old City. He will spend his nights in the house of the Vatican
delegation here, an old mansion with Arab tile floors and a small
chapel. A helicopter pad was built nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's itinerary includes time alone at Holy sites for
meditation. He will also give a Mass before about 100,000 near the
Sea of Galilee, and another to an expected 7,000 in Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
   The pope is also visiting the Holocaust museum and a Palestinian
refugee camp _ two sites that are not destinations for religious
pilgrimage. They are his nod to the trip's tense political
backdrop, where he can show sympathy for suffering on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's trying to present a model for how you go about
reconciliation,'' said the Rev. Drew Christiansen, a Jesuit advisor
for international affairs to the United States Catholic Conference.
``It's a moment of grace and, God willing, everyone will be open to
the grace _ wherever they stand.''

   MOSCOW _ Nadia Gorovaya is a 19-year-old Russian architecture
student who counts The Verve and The Beatles among her favorite
musical groups. She loves art, and spends free time hanging out
with friends in Moscow's budding cafe culture. She and her mother
live in a tidy one-bedroom apartment on this city's northern
outskirts. On March 26, Nadia will be able to cast a vote for the
first time choosing the person who will lead Russia for the next
four years. She spoke recently with Cox Newspapers Moscow
correspondent Margaret Coker on her thoughts about politics and
teen-age life in her country.
</P>
<P>
   ------------------------------------------------------------------
</P>
<P>
   Question: Your generation is the first to come of age after the
Cold War. How are you and your friends different from your parents?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: We are very different. Me and my friends have a much
wider outlook and have access to much more information. We also
have more responsibility and more choice. Previously, (your life)
was more or less pre-determined. You graduated and knew what was in
store for you. You did what was required. Now, even though life is
rather hard, more depends on the person's own effort.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How is your view of America and the rest of the world
different?
</P>
<P>
   A: The borders are now open and many of my friends and I travel
a lot. It's one of the things I like most. I get a fresh look at
things and new impressions. (This opportunity) is much more
realistic for us than it was for our parents.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you think are the best, and the worst changes in your
country since the end of the Soviet Union?
</P>
<P>
   A: To me, the best thing is democracy, the ability to say what
you think freely even if the government doesn't like what you say.
Now, we have some freedom of choice. The worst thing is that all of
this is not yet properly protected. Our laws don't really work all
of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Would your older relatives answer this question the same way?
</P>
<P>
   A: In principle, they all agree with me. Although my father, for
example, who belongs to the democratic camp and does not want the
restoration of the old regime, believes there were some advantages
in the Soviet times, like free education and free health-care.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you think about the political situation in Russia?
</P>
<P>
   A: I do not like what is happening now. I think the authorities
are thinking for the most part about power, money, prestige and
very little about what they ought to be thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you think your leaders should be paying attention to?
</P>
<P>
   A: In the first place, to social programs, raising people's
living standards because the majority of the population are very
poor. The government must develop the economy, private business,
promote private property.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you discuss politics with your friends?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, with some. Not of all my friends are interested. I've
found they usually share the views of their parents. In these
elections, I think many of my friends are going to vote like their
parents
</P>
<P>
   Q: For whom will you vote?
</P>
<P>
   A: For Gregory Yavlinsky (the leader of the liberal political
party Yabloko).
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think he is the most democratic candidate. His party, I
think, is the most honest and the most decent. His program is aimed
at the development of all of Russia, especially promoting private
property. There are so many issues I like. For example, Yavlinsky
opposes the war in Chechnya and says it should be stopped.
Unfortunately, I know he will lose. There is no alternative to
Putin in these elections, but I do not want to vote for him.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you think the winner is obvious, then why bother voting at
all?
</P>
<P>
   A: If I do not go to the polls, my ballot may be used somehow to
falsify the results. It is my choice. I do not want to vote for
someone else only because everybody else votes for him. I do not
want this to happen. There will be few of us voting for Yabloko,
but maybe it will give rise to the hope of this happening in
future.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where did you first learn about democracy?
</P>
<P>
   A: We studied it a bit in history class in high school, but, of
course, it is not enough. We studied the American system some. I
read books for myself to find out what the principles are.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You have visited America. Did you like our way of life? Do
you think it is better?
</P>
<P>
   A: You have a higher standard of living compared to Russia. Of
course, that is better. Your college graduates know they will be
able to find a job. It is hard for U.S. families to pay for
education, but at least you have a banking and loan system that
makes it possible to repay all costs. Americans can travel, change
jobs, feel the police protects them. Your courts are really
unbiased in most cases.
</P>
<P>
   My friends really like America. They think everything is great
there. But I think there are negative things about your country,
too. People pay too much attention to superficial things, not to
culture or the soul. You can find anything in the stores, sometimes
even 100 kinds of soap. But what about theater or good books?
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you follow the news? Read newspapers?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, I do. Not very regularly, but I do.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you know about the American elections?
</P>
<P>
   A: That you have now two candidates _ Democrat Al Gore and
Republican George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you were an American for whom would you vote?
</P>
<P>
   A: I know less about American politics ... Not that I do not
care at all, but I know much less about your candidates than mine.
I don't know who I would vote for, honestly. I think Democrats, as
a party, are closer to my views.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you see your life in five years?
</P>
<P>
   A: I do not know. What makes life in Russia both fascinating and
a little frightening is that you do not know what's in store for
you tomorrow. You do not know what life is going to be like in one
or two years, let alone in five. I do hope it will get better. In
principle, I am an optimist. But judging by what is happening now,
I'm not sure. If Putin comes to power it will be a regime based on
a ``strong hand.'' I do not think he'll bring about more reforms.

   TULA, Russia _ At 9 a.m. one day last week Stanislav Petrovich
was well into his working day. He already had answered a two-hour
barrage of phone calls and organized a daily schedule for an
adrenaline-packed group of volunteers assembled at the Tula
regional Communist Party headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   With Russian presidential elections less than one week away,
many Moscow pundits have already called the vote, saying it's not a
question of whether Acting President Vladimir Putin will win, but
by how many votes.
</P>
<P>
   But don't tell this to Petrovich and the rest of the
half-million Communist Party faithful toiling to make their
candidate Gennady Zyuganov Russia's next president.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are calling from all over wanting to know how they can
help defeat Putin,'' said Petrovich, a clean-cut 46-year-old
economics teacher and the party chairman in the Tula region. ``They
don't believe this election is a done deal.''
</P>
<P>
   While Putin's lead is undeniably strong _ he leads Zyuganov, his
nearest competitor, by a 2-to-1 margin _ nearly half of the Russian
electorate will not be voting for the 47-year-old former KGB
officer on March 26, according to the latest poll figures.
</P>
<P>
   Some voters say they don't like Putin's secret service past.
Some think he's a dictator in disguise. But for Zyuganov and his
constituents, Putin represents the corrupt system of government
that flourished under former President Boris Yeltsin and led the
country into its current state of disrepair and depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin is supported by the oligarchs that robbed our country of
its wealth. He's tied to all that by virtue of the fact that
Yeltsin anointed him as his successor,'' Zyuganov said in a recent
interview.
</P>
<P>
   This feeling runs strong throughout Tula Oblast, a largely
agricultural region roughly the size of Ohio. Only 200 miles south
of Moscow, the opportunities of open markets and democracy have
passed by most of the region's population.
</P>
<P>
   Besides farming, defense factories like the one that builds
Kalashnikov rifles kept people employed in the Soviet days. But in
the last 10 years, this economic infrastructure has rusted to a
halt, leaving people disenfranchised and impoverished.
</P>
<P>
   In December's parliamentary elections, about 30 percent of the
region voted for the Communists, while less than 10 percent voted
for Putin's electoral bloc, Unity. Like-minded voters across the
country handed the Communists more seats in parliament than any
other single party.
</P>
<P>
   Zyuganov attributes this popularity to the fact that he and
other leaders have redefined the party's ideology away from
classical Marxism and towards a socialism practiced by many
European countries. He says he wants to increase social spending,
but at the same time increase tax collection and stem capital
flight to pay for the expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not looking to turn back the clock, or repeat mistakes
of the past,'' the solid, ruddy-faced former schoolteacher said in
a recent interview. ``We want to go forward, like Lenin said.''
</P>
<P>
   But while travelling past snow-whitened wheat fields and
tumble-down wooden houses with Communist Party campaign volunteers
to deliver election literature to the small towns in Tula Oblast
last week, visitors see it's nostalgia that seems to be driving
voters to turn toward Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Semonov, a 50-year-old unemployed miner from Kiryevsky,
said he's watched his town die a slow death. Since 1990, 10 of its
12 iron mines have closed, and the population has dwindled from
105,000 to less than 80,000, as young people leave in droves.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've heard of the Stalin gulags? Well, I'm living in a
Yeltsin gulag. I have no job, but there is nowhere for my family
and I to go. Even if I could find work in some other town, where
would we live? I can't sell my apartment and I have no money to
rent another. I'm trapped,'' Semonov said.
</P>
<P>
   His neighbor Yelena Antonova, 42, said she didn't trust Putin,
even when he promised to crack down on corruption, and increase
minimum wage and social security payments for the elderly _ three
promises Zyuganov has also made to voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zyuganov isn't in it for the money or the prestige. He's
running for the people. With Putin, I just don't know,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In Tula's provincial capital, where signs of economic resurgence
flourish along the tree-lined main street called Lenin Prospect,
citizens feel less inclined towards the Communists. They tend to
shy away from Putin also for economic reasons, but for different

   ``I can't say I lived poorly under the Communist system, but now
I've found a different way to live,'' said 46-year-old Valery
Ivanov, the assistant director of a private publishing company, a
business he and a group of friends started five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voting for Putin is madness. Only a fool would vote for a
candidate without an economic plan. I have no idea what he stands
for,'' Ivanov, an earnest man with ink-stained hands, added.
``(Gregory) Yavlinsky (the leader of the liberal Yabloko party) is
the only solution. He's the only intelligent person who can help us
now.''

&HT;     TRY A TOUCH OF WHIMSY TO LIGHT UP YOUR LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, March 19)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Whimsical lighting is made of any unexpected,
amusing shape, from animals in clothing to a carved wooden toy.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are loosening up with light fixtures, to introduce more
personality into a room,'' said interior designer Michel Patterson,
owner of Hudson River Fine Interiors in Loudonville.
</P>
<P>
   Internationally known interior designer Mario Buatta is fond of
injecting a touch of whimsy into many of his interiors.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to overdo it, because it can get tiresome,''
Buatta said. ``But it's fun to add a funny touch of whimsy in a
room by placing something that's a little fun on a telephone table
or desk, like a secretary desk. ... For one room I used a monkey
lamp with three monkeys representing see, hear and speak no evil.''
</P>
<P>
   Whimsical lighting is a decorative accessory that's like a piece
of art, said interior designer Denise Maurer of Troy. ``It's to be
used mainly as accent or mood lighting. You might place a fun lamp
on a piano, kitchen counter or even in the powder room. This type
of lamp is always good for adding a little interest to a dark
corner of the room. But you can also use a whimsical fixture in a
formal room.''
</P>
<P>
   Because whimsical lighting fixtures have a personality of their
own, make sure that it's appropriate to the room.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't find a lamp you like or that's in your price range,
use your imagination and create your own. You can transform
anything into a lamp, from a favorite teapot to an antique brass
coffee urn, soup tureen (in an animal shape), piece of machinery or
fun sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to transform something into a lamp, but can't or
don't want to bore a hole through it for wiring, simply mount it on
a base with the rod (encasing the wire) coming up behind it,
Patterson said.
</P>
<P>
   The designers also noted that decoupage, which is coming back
into style, offers another way to add a light touch to a lamp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep your eyes open for things that look whimsical,'' said
Carol Dexter, an interior designer with Hudson River Fine
Interiors. ``Get a glue gun to enhance the shade and create your
own whimsical lamp, chandelier, sconce or candlestick.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Pope John Paul II comes to the Holy Land next week
as an elderly pilgrim determined to change the world.
</P>
<P>
   He begins his visit Monday in Jordan, then visits Israel and the
Palestinian territories until the following Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   He will see the Mount Nebo in Jordan, where Moses looked upon
the promised land. He will pray above the Bethlehem cave where
tradition says Christ was born. He will deliver mass above the Sea
of Galilee, in the hills where Christ gave the speeches that became
known as the Sermon on the Mount.
</P>
<P>
   The journey presents a monumental moment in the already
remarkable life of this pontiff.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II, at 79 years of age, is the most media savvy
and well-traveled of all the popes. He scores high in U.S. public
opinion polls despite stands on issues with which many Americans
disagree _ against abortion, the death penalty and contraception.
</P>
<P>
   Long ago an amateur actor, the pope now steps onto a stage that
has the most holy sites in Christianity as its backdrop _ in the
very places Christ himself walked. It is his first trip here as
pope.
</P>
<P>
   With the pope in the twilight years of his pontificate, this
91st trip abroad could be the hallmark of a legacy that is hinged
on the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The pope has declared the year 2000 a ``Jubilee'' and ``Holy
Year.'' He asks that Catholics begin the third millennium since
Christ's birth by reflecting on their past, and building a new
future.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, the first of the Catholic Lenten period of
penitence, the pope took the unprecedented step of asking
forgiveness from God for a sweeping list of sins committed by
followers of the church.
</P>
<P>
   This week's trip is part of that renewal or, as the pope calls
it, the ``purification of memory.'' Ultimately, he aims for nothing
less than sweeping away centuries of bitterness between Jews and
Catholics _ and within different branches of Christianity itself.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere are the divisions more clear than here. Israelis and
Palestinians are still logjammed in a tense peace process. Arab
Christians _ some 180,000 of them _ are an uncomfortable minority
between the Jewish state and Muslim-dominated areas under control
of the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Some Jews accuse the Church of ignoring the Holocaust. Some
Muslims bear grudges from the Church's medieval crusades. Greek
Orthodox Christians here view the Catholic Church with suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   Amid it all, the pope brings his message of reconciliation with
the hopeful enthusiasm of a pilgrim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a strong desire to go personally to pray in the most
important places which, from the Old to the New Testament, have
seen God's interventions,'' the pope wrote in June of last year.
``I say to everyone: Let us set out in the footsteps of Christ!''
</P>
<P>
   He came here in 1965, before he was pope, and commemorated the
``unforgettable experience'' in poetry.
</P>
<P>
   Some say it took the warming relations between Israel and its
Arab neighbors to make the new trip possible. Others protest that
the time is still not right, since many issues between Israelis and
Palestinians remain unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   But, the pope has talked about the Jubilee year since he
ascended to the papacy in 1978. Now appearing to suffer from
Parkinson's disease, it may be that no political circumstance could
have stopped him from making the trip _ which he insists is not
political.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be an exclusively religious pilgrimage in its nature
and purpose, and I would be saddened if anyone were to attach other
meanings to this plan of mine,'' he wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   But politics are super-imposed on any high-profile trip to the
region, and the pope's is no exception.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians worry his visits to Arab areas of east Jerusalem _
under Israeli security protection _ will be seen as a recognition
of Israeli occupation there. Israelis fear his trip to
Palestinian-controlled areas will be tantamount to a recognition of
Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is inevitable that it is going to be politicized. What will
please the Palestinians will upset the Israelis, and whatever
pleases the Israelis will upset the Palestinians,'' said Harry
Hagopian, executive director of the Jerusalem liaison office for
the Middle East Council of Churches.
</P>
<P>
   But Archbishop Pietro Sambi, the Vatican's representative to
Israel, suggested the pope's visit could ease the political
bitterness.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the pope speaks of a spiritual pilgrimage, he is not
talking about just coming to say prayers,'' Sambi said. ``He means
to make a new consensus, a sense of responsibility, a principle of
truth and justice.''
</P>
<P>
   The ground is more fertile for that than it was during the only
other papal visit to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, Pope Paul VI visited for a day. Relations were so
chilly between the Vatican and Israel that he insisted on a special
entry point into the country rather than recognize any of Israel's
official border points.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, Israeli officials still bristled at the Church's
silence during the Holocaust. Church doctrine seemed to blame Jews
for the death of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Church officials were sympathetic to Israel's Arab
neighbors. They worried that cozy relations with Israel would
endanger Christian communities in Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1960s, the church officially retracted the
accusations of Jewish involvement in Christ's death. Then, Pope
John Paul II went even further.
</P>
<P>
   He has sought forgiveness for Catholics' misdeeds during the
Holocaust and has condemned anti-Semitism dozens of times. While
church teachings used to call the Jews treacherous, this pope has
dubbed Judaism the ``elder brother'' among the Christian, Jewish
and Muslim faiths.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi David Rosen, head of the Israel office of the
Anti-Defamation League, said the pope has ``turned upside down the
whole traditional attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, with the way paved by the Oslo peace process, Israel
and the Vatican exchanged their first ambassadors.
</P>
<P>
   Of primary concern to the Vatican are the followers of the pope
in the region. There are about 70,000 Arab Christians in Israel and
the Palestinian areas who are Roman Catholics or Greek Catholics,
known also as Melkites.
</P>
<P>
   They comprise a little less than half the Christians in Israel
and the Palestinian areas _ including Greek, Syrian, Armenian
Orthodox and some Protestants. They have been overwhelmed by the
growth in the Jewish and Muslim populations.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty years ago, Christians made up about 9 percent of the
population, but now they are about 2 percent. Christians emigrate
at higher rates than non-Christians do.
</P>
<P>
   The pope is expected to encourage the local Christians to stay
in the place where Christianity began.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe he will have special blessings,'' said 77-year-old
Labibeh Abdel-Noor, leaving a Roman Catholic Mass in Jerusalem's
Church of the Holy Sepulchre on Sunday. The pope is scheduled to
hold a Mass in the church, believed by Catholics to be where Christ
was crucified and entombed, on March 26.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-five years ago, Abdel-Noor was among the crowds that
greeted Paul VI. Just maybe, she said, this pope's visit can bring
people closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people can start to get united, it is easier to have
peace. We pray for peace,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But, the pope's message could be less well-received by those of
the majority religions.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials welcome the visit and say it will be a
breakthrough in Christian-Jewish relations. They have laid out more
than $10 million in roadwork and construction for the visit.
</P>
<P>
   A poll this month showed most Israelis see the visit positively.
</P>
<P>
   But, a fringe of right-wing Israelis have threatened to disrupt
the visit if they can. Signs and graffiti in Jerusalem have labeled
the pope a ``pagan'' who should be shunned.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Chief Rabbi Israel Meir Lau said he hopes the pope will
use a visit to the Yad Vashem Holocaust museum to apologize for the
silence of Pope Pius XII during the Holocaust. He said the pope's
Lenten confession of sins, which did not mention the Holocaust,
showed ``serious historical myopia.''
</P>
<P>
   An apology for Pius XII is extremely unlikely. He is in the
running for sainthood and popes are considered infallible under
Catholic doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   But, the pope has asked for 15 minutes to speak at Yad Vashem
and is using the event to meet Jews from his hometown in Poland who
fled the Holocaust. Some were among the pope's childhood friends.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, officials of the Palestinian Authority _ which
controls the Palestinian areas _ have warmly welcomed the visit,
while some Muslims chose to bear their own grudges. One Muslim
leader called for the pope to apologize for the Crusades.
</P>
<P>
   For most of his trip, the pope will be surrounded by 18,000
police in the largest security operation in Israeli history. Entire
neighborhoods will be closed when the pope is nearby, prompting
concerns that the isolation will frustrate local Christians and
deprive the pope of the crowd contact from which he draws strength.
</P>
<P>
   Two of his ``Pope Mobiles'' are being flown in and a smaller one
has been constructed to navigate the narrow streets of Jerusalem's
Old City. He will spend his nights in the house of the Vatican
delegation here, an old mansion with Arab tile floors and a small
chapel. A helicopter pad was built nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's itinerary includes time alone at Holy sites for
meditation. He will also give a Mass before about 100,000 near the
Sea of Galilee, and another to an expected 7,000 in Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
   The pope is also visiting the Holocaust museum and a Palestinian
refugee camp _ two sites that are not destinations for religious
pilgrimage. They are his nod to the trip's tense political
backdrop, where he can show sympathy for suffering on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's trying to present a model for how you go about
reconciliation,'' said the Rev. Drew Christiansen, a Jesuit advisor
for international affairs to the United States Catholic Conference.
``It's a moment of grace and, God willing, everyone will be open to
the grace _ wherever they stand.''

<P>
   Political consultants always do the same thing when the campaign
is over. If their horse wins, they take full credit. If they lose,
they blame it on the lousy candidate or on his other, inept
advisers.
</P>
<P>
   But even by the normal standards of the political-consulting
profession, which ranks ethically somewhere between personal-injury
law and loan-sharking, Mike Murphy's behavior is stunning.
</P>
<P>
   It took Murphy all of three days after his candidate, John
McCain, suspended his campaign to be on the front page of The
Washington Post dishing out a self-serving account of the race. The
story is the fruit of a deal Murphy struck with Howard Kurtz of the
Post.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for his waiting until McCain was out of the race to
publish his story, Kurtz got exclusive access to Murphy. Murphy got
an opportunity to blame colleagues for mistakes, to boast about
behavior that any normal person would be ashamed of, and to
introduce generally a posthumous element of rancor into what was at
the time an unusually pleasant campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the ways Murphy spins the story his own favor:
</P>
<P>
   SHIFTING BLAME. Murphy doesn't go so far as to suggest that he
objected to McCain's Virginia Beach speech, in which he attacked
the religious right, and which is now widely seen as having been a
big political miscalculation. But Murphy does let it be known that
the idea for the speech came from Rick Davis, McCain's campaign
manager and someone Murphy is known not to get along with. Murphy,
according to Murphy, ``softened'' the speech.
</P>
<P>
   CLAIMING CREDIT. Murphy makes himself out to be the genius
behind McCain's press-friendly campaign. In fact, McCain was the
genius behind McCain's press-friendly campaign. The candidate was
granting unprecedented access to reporters from the beginning of
his announcement tour, long before Murphy signed on.
</P>
<P>
   And indeed, Murphy inadvertently let Kurtz know that he didn't
particularly like this approach, or at least that he was prepared
to blame it on somebody else if it ended up being viewed as
unhelpful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Murphy cringed when McCain began holding forth for reporters
on the campaign bus, convinced that he would foul things up,''
Kurtz writes. ``It was a tactic born of necessity, for they
desperately needed free coverage.'' Eight paragraphs earlier,
Murphy was taking credit for the brilliant notion of ``exploiting''
the media.
</P>
<P>
   SETTLING SCORES. Murphy blames his rival Rick Davis for defying
the candidate's decision to not air a counterattack ad against
George W. Bush in New Hampshire. According to Murphy's version,
Davis went behind Murphy's back and convinced McCain to change his
mind and run the ad after the candidate first decided against
airing it.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy tells Kurtz that he didn't tell McCain the full story of
Davis' sneaky behavior for fear it would damage the campaign's team
spirit. ``However dumb the maneuver, it was not worth blowing up
the campaign,'' Kurtz relates.
</P>
<P>
   I have my doubts about this account, both because Murphy loves
negative advertising more than just about anyone alive and because
Davis is no match for Murphy in the sneakiness department. But in
any case, the only real significance of the anecdote is that Murphy
wants to make Davis look bad. Later in the article, Murphy raps
Davis again for slashing the amount of airtime devoted to negative
advertising without informing him. This is another personal
vendetta with no larger significance.
</P>
<P>
   DIMINISHING THE CANDIDATE. Murphy refers to his candidate as
``The Meat'' (as in the consultant's admonition ``Don't fall in
love with the meat''). But worse than this disrespect is the way
the consultant portrays his candidate as someone who is too eager
to please audiences and not firm enough in his principles _ until
Murphy rides in and stiffens his spine.
</P>
<P>
   He lets us know that McCain didn't want to stand firm in his
opposition to ethanol and wasn't inclined to be as tough as he
needed to be with Bush. Murphy also tries to claim credit for
decisions that were portrayed as coming from McCain's gut, like
McCain's challenge to Bush in South Carolina to take down all
negative ads.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the evidence in Kurtz's article suggests that Murphy's
real role was to persuade McCain to go negative in a way that
troubled the candidate. It was Murphy who wrote the script for the
ad that said Bush ``twists the truth like Clinton'' and Murphy who
persuaded McCain to air it. This may have been the single biggest
blunder in the entire campaign _ something Murphy never owns up to.
</P>
<P>
   More generally, Murphy exhibits a consultant-centric view of the
world, placing McCain in the passenger seat and himself at the
wheel of the car. ``They had made McCain the most popular
politician in America, one who could undoubtedly win the White
House in the fall, but they couldn't burst through the narrow
arteries of the Republican Party and deliver the nomination,''
Kurtz writes of the candidate's consultants, summarizing Murphy's
thinking. A more detached observer might say that McCain became the
most popular politician in America on the strength of his own
personal appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Kurtz, who as a media reporter sometimes takes other journalists
to task for being too uncritical of their sources, plays mostly
into Murphy's hands. ``Given little more to stop the Bush
juggernaut than a charismatic candidate, a comfortable bus and a
talent for working the media, Murphy kept driving the jerry-built
contraption until the wheels came off,'' Kurtz writes. How little
Murphy had to work with! How brilliant of him to hire McCain as his
presidential vehicle!
</P>
<P>
   BOASTING ABOUT MISDEEDS. Kurtz's story begins with an anecdote
about Election Day in Michigan. Ron Fournier, an Associated Press
reporter, calls Murphy to confirm the existence of McCain's sleazy
``Catholic Voter Alert'' phone calls in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, who, Kurtz informs us, had written the script for the
calls, faced a choice: He could lie or tell the truth. He chose to
lie by saying that he had to check out the facts. (Kurtz does bust
Murphy on this, calling it ``a moment of less than straight
talk.'')
</P>
<P>
   Murphy also lied to other reporters on the ``Straight Talk
Express'' in much the same way when he said he didn't know whether
the calls mentioned Bob Jones University. He also left Howard
Opinksy, the campaign spokesman, ``out of the loop'' on the calls,
which was another way of communicating a lie to the press and
public, as well as harming Opinsky's professional reputation.
Murphy seems quite pleased with himself for all of these slimeball
maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the small matter of Murphy's working for two
presidential candidates at the same time. Kurtz: ``Murphy had
quietly been advising both Alexander and McCain, but when Alexander
finished sixth in the straw poll, the senator asked Murphy to join
his staff.''
</P>
<P>
   So Murphy was not only ignoring a clear conflict of interest in
advising two candidates running against each other but also waiting
to see which one had the better chance before he made his choice.
</P>
<P>
   What a creep.

   GUADALUPE VALLEY, Mexico _ As Victor Torres swished the amber
liquid between his teeth, an expression of joy spread over his
face.
</P>
<P>
   A French-trained winemaker, Torres knew he had a sweet nectar of
exquisite caliber in the making.
</P>
<P>
   Are we talking France here? Maybe Napa Valley?
</P>
<P>
   Neither. Torres is among a new breed of winemakers in the
Guadalupe Valley, a pocket of surprisingly fertile land on the
Pacific Ocean side of Mexico's Baja California. The valley is only
about 50 miles southeast of the border city of San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Blessed by a cooling coastal fog that takes the hot edge off the
region's near-desert terrain, the valley is starting to produce
award-winning wines that are gaining a toehold at upscale
restaurants and among wine lovers on both sides of the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be the Napa Valley of Mexico,'' said Torres, the
winemaker for Chateau Camou, one of about a half-dozen wineries
that have started to produce premiere wines in the valley over the
last decade.
</P>
<P>
   Just down the road from Chateau Camou, winemaker Hans Backhoff,
who grew up in this area, also praises the soil, sun and chilly
nights that create a nourishing micro-climate for grapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the influence of the sea. That's what makes this valley
so special,'' Backhoff said, as he poured a sample of Merlot aging
in a French oak barrel at his winery, Monte Xanic (pronounced,
``Mon-TAY Sha-NEEK'').
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans consume less than half a bottle of wine per person per
year, a figure that's a fraction of what consumers drink in
countries that have a love affair with the grape. Argentineans, for
example, consume around 50 liters per person annually.
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans still produce far more of the ever-popular tequila and
beer. But wine consumption is indeed increasing, buoyed by a taste
for fine wine among Mexican professionals and Baja's homegrown
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The Guadalupe Valley is about 10 miles east of the Baja beach
town of Ensenada, which is touting Mexico's new ``wine country'' as
a great place to visit while eating lobster enchiladas and swimming
and surfing. Hotels are stocking fliers on the Guadalupe Valley
now, and offering tours for tasting and to attend a number of
annual festivals. Cruise ships that dock in Ensenada are also
encouraging visitors. The valley's wines are featured now in fine
restaurants in Acapulco, Cancun, Mexico City and a growing number
of American cities.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the oldest winery in this hemisphere started in
Mexico, where in the 1520s Mexico's Spanish conquistadors ordered
1,000 vines planted for every 100 Indians forced to work for them.
</P>
<P>
   Then Spain, fearing competition from its colony, subsequently
banned vineyards from Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Wine grapes were eventually born again in Mexico, but for
centuries vintners have produced mostly grapes for brandy or for
wine that was mediocre.
</P>
<P>
   Now vintners in Baja California, where most of Mexico's wine
grapes are grown, are getting serious about quality rather than
quantity.
</P>
<P>
   That's the mission of the Guadalupe Valley vintners, including
the oldest of the bunch, Bodegas de Santo Tomas, which was
established in 1888.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 Santo Tomas winemakers teamed up with American friends
in Northern California, a region that was also once considered an
upstart in a world of wines dominated by Europeans. The joint
venture, which first produced 5,000 cases that were released in
1998, was the brainchild of Santo Tomas and Wente Bros., a
century-old winery in the Livermore Valley east of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Christened Duetto, the wine is a blend of 50 percent Mexican and
50 percent California grapes. It is bottled in Mexico, and thus
escapes tariffs on U.S. wine imports that are hovering at about 8
percent now. A high-quality red wine mix of Cabernet Sauvignon,
Cabernet Franc and Merlot, Duetto's first vintage sold out in a
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico has the quality of the grapes. They have everything to
produce a good wine. That's for sure,'' said Marc Bourreli, Wente's
director of Latin American exports.
</P>
<P>
   This year, for the first time, 1,000 cases of Duetto will be
released in the U.S. market for retail sale and stocking at
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Torres and Backhoff's wines are also heading north.
</P>
<P>
   Backhoff, a British-trained food scientist, said he made wine as
a hobby in Baja California before getting together a group of
investors in 1987 and opening up Monte Xanic. Housed in a classic
stone building, the winery has a tasting room featuring white and
red wines that are now on wine lists in restaurants in New York,
Colorado, Arizona, California and Florida. Backhoff's wines have
picked up awards at a number of California festivals in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   The Henry Wine Group is distributing Monte Xanic now to
retailers and the Napa Valley-based Chalone Wine Group is offering
bottles of the wine to its shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Backhoff said he and his partners thought of the name of their
winery after spring rains prompted beautiful desert flowers to
bloom throughout the valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want a French name,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So they chose Xanic, which in an Indian language means ``the
first flower that blooms after the rain,'' Backhoff said. ``It's
Mexican. But it doesn't sound like tequila or tacos.''
</P>
<P>
   The vineyard is 175 acres, he added, and some of the vines are
40 years old. Part of the vineyard was previously owned by a family
of Russian descent, which took up grape growing like other Russian
immigrants to Baja California at the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Xanic's wines range from US$15 to US$100. Only about 3 percent
of the product is exported, but Backhoff expects exports to climb
to 6 percent this year. Tariffs are low on Mexican wine imports to
the United States and if Mexican vintners export their wines, they
get a substantial tax break at home.
</P>
<P>
   Chateau Camou's wines are being carried by the United States'
Wine Warehouse and can be found in Chicago, Washington and this
year, the company hopes, Texas. Prices range from US$6 to more than
US$100 for wines that have won awards in French competitions in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The winery, which was founded in 1985, is constructing a new
mission-style building and its tasting room is also open for
tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Torres said he is particularly proud of his white wines _
Chardonnay and Chenin Blanc _ which many experts believe Mexican
soil simply cannot produce.
</P>
<P>
   One of Torres' white wine blends, Flor de Guadalupe, recently
beat California whites in a competition north of the border, Torres
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that was one of our lower-end wines,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Torres is equally proud of the French techniques he uses, such
as gently agitating the wine periodically with a stick while it
ferments in French oak barrels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why change something that's worked for more than 200 years?''
Torres said. ``We're trying to combine tradition with modern
techniques.''

   MOSCOW _ Nadia Gorovaya is a 19-year-old Russian architecture
student who counts The Verve and The Beatles among her favorite
musical groups. She loves art, and spends free time hanging out
with friends in Moscow's budding cafe culture. She and her mother
live in a tidy one-bedroom apartment on this city's northern
outskirts. On March 26, Nadia will be able to cast a vote for the
first time choosing the person who will lead Russia for the next
four years. She spoke recently with Cox Newspapers Moscow
correspondent Margaret Coker on her thoughts about politics and
teen-age life in her country.
</P>
<P>
   ------------------------------------------------------------------
</P>
<P>
   Question: Your generation is the first to come of age after the
Cold War. How are you and your friends different from your parents?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: We are very different. Me and my friends have a much
wider outlook and have access to much more information. We also
have more responsibility and more choice. Previously, (your life)
was more or less pre-determined. You graduated and knew what was in
store for you. You did what was required. Now, even though life is
rather hard, more depends on the person's own effort.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How is your view of America and the rest of the world
different?
</P>
<P>
   A: The borders are now open and many of my friends and I travel
a lot. It's one of the things I like most. I get a fresh look at
things and new impressions. (This opportunity) is much more
realistic for us than it was for our parents.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you think are the best, and the worst changes in your
country since the end of the Soviet Union?
</P>
<P>
   A: To me, the best thing is democracy, the ability to say what
you think freely even if the government doesn't like what you say.
Now, we have some freedom of choice. The worst thing is that all of
this is not yet properly protected. Our laws don't really work all
of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Would your older relatives answer this question the same way?
</P>
<P>
   A: In principle, they all agree with me. Although my father, for
example, who belongs to the democratic camp and does not want the
restoration of the old regime, believes there were some advantages
in the Soviet times, like free education and free health-care.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you think about the political situation in Russia?
</P>
<P>
   A: I do not like what is happening now. I think the authorities
are thinking for the most part about power, money, prestige and
very little about what they ought to be thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you think your leaders should be paying attention to?
</P>
<P>
   A: In the first place, to social programs, raising people's
living standards because the majority of the population are very
poor. The government must develop the economy, private business,
promote private property.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you discuss politics with your friends?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, with some. Not of all my friends are interested. I've
found they usually share the views of their parents. In these
elections, I think many of my friends are going to vote like their
parents
</P>
<P>
   Q: For whom will you vote?
</P>
<P>
   A: For Gregory Yavlinsky (the leader of the liberal political
party Yabloko).
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think he is the most democratic candidate. His party, I
think, is the most honest and the most decent. His program is aimed
at the development of all of Russia, especially promoting private
property. There are so many issues I like. For example, Yavlinsky
opposes the war in Chechnya and says it should be stopped.
Unfortunately, I know he will lose. There is no alternative to
Putin in these elections, but I do not want to vote for him.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you think the winner is obvious, then why bother voting at
all?
</P>
<P>
   A: If I do not go to the polls, my ballot may be used somehow to
falsify the results. It is my choice. I do not want to vote for
someone else only because everybody else votes for him. I do not
want this to happen. There will be few of us voting for Yabloko,
but maybe it will give rise to the hope of this happening in
future.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where did you first learn about democracy?
</P>
<P>
   A: We studied it a bit in history class in high school, but, of
course, it is not enough. We studied the American system some. I
read books for myself to find out what the principles are.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You have visited America. Did you like our way of life? Do
you think it is better?
</P>
<P>
   A: You have a higher standard of living compared to Russia. Of
course, that is better. Your college graduates know they will be
able to find a job. It is hard for U.S. families to pay for
education, but at least you have a banking and loan system that
makes it possible to repay all costs. Americans can travel, change
jobs, feel the police protects them. Your courts are really
unbiased in most cases.
</P>
<P>
   My friends really like America. They think everything is great
there. But I think there are negative things about your country,
too. People pay too much attention to superficial things, not to
culture or the soul. You can find anything in the stores, sometimes
even 100 kinds of soap. But what about theater or good books?
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you follow the news? Read newspapers?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, I do. Not very regularly, but I do.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you know about the American elections?
</P>
<P>
   A: That you have now two candidates _ Democrat Al Gore and
Republican George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you were an American for whom would you vote?
</P>
<P>
   A: I know less about American politics ... Not that I do not
care at all, but I know much less about your candidates than mine.
I don't know who I would vote for, honestly. I think Democrats, as
a party, are closer to my views.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you see your life in five years?
</P>
<P>
   A: I do not know. What makes life in Russia both fascinating and
a little frightening is that you do not know what's in store for
you tomorrow. You do not know what life is going to be like in one
or two years, let alone in five. I do hope it will get better. In
principle, I am an optimist. But judging by what is happening now,
I'm not sure. If Putin comes to power it will be a regime based on
a ``strong hand.'' I do not think he'll bring about more reforms.

<P>
   TULA, Russia _ At 9 a.m. one day last week Stanislav Petrovich
was well into his working day. He already had answered a two-hour
barrage of phone calls and organized a daily schedule for an
adrenaline-packed group of volunteers assembled at the Tula
regional Communist Party headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   With Russian presidential elections less than one week away,
many Moscow pundits have already called the vote, saying it's not a
question of whether Acting President Vladimir Putin will win, but
by how many votes.
</P>
<P>
   But don't tell this to Petrovich and the rest of the
half-million Communist Party faithful toiling to make their
candidate Gennady Zyuganov Russia's next president.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are calling from all over wanting to know how they can
help defeat Putin,'' said Petrovich, a clean-cut 46-year-old
economics teacher and the party chairman in the Tula region. ``They
don't believe this election is a done deal.''
</P>
<P>
   While Putin's lead is undeniably strong _ he leads Zyuganov, his
nearest competitor, by a 2-to-1 margin _ nearly half of the Russian
electorate will not be voting for the 47-year-old former KGB
officer on March 26, according to the latest poll figures.
</P>
<P>
   Some voters say they don't like Putin's secret service past.
Some think he's a dictator in disguise. But for Zyuganov and his
constituents, Putin represents the corrupt system of government
that flourished under former President Boris Yeltsin and led the
country into its current state of disrepair and depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin is supported by the oligarchs that robbed our country of
its wealth. He's tied to all that by virtue of the fact that
Yeltsin anointed him as his successor,'' Zyuganov said in a recent
interview.
</P>
<P>
   This feeling runs strong throughout Tula Oblast, a largely
agricultural region roughly the size of Ohio. Only 200 miles south
of Moscow, the opportunities of open markets and democracy have
passed by most of the region's population.
</P>
<P>
   Besides farming, defense factories like the one that builds
Kalashnikov rifles kept people employed in the Soviet days. But in
the last 10 years, this economic infrastructure has rusted to a
halt, leaving people disenfranchised and impoverished.
</P>
<P>
   In December's parliamentary elections, about 30 percent of the
region voted for the Communists, while less than 10 percent voted
for Putin's electoral bloc, Unity. Like-minded voters across the
country handed the Communists more seats in parliament than any
other single party.
</P>
<P>
   Zyuganov attributes this popularity to the fact that he and
other leaders have redefined the party's ideology away from
classical Marxism and towards a socialism practiced by many
European countries. He says he wants to increase social spending,
but at the same time increase tax collection and stem capital
flight to pay for the expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not looking to turn back the clock, or repeat mistakes
of the past,'' the solid, ruddy-faced former schoolteacher said in
a recent interview. ``We want to go forward, like Lenin said.''
</P>
<P>
   But while travelling past snow-whitened wheat fields and
tumble-down wooden houses with Communist Party campaign volunteers
to deliver election literature to the small towns in Tula Oblast
last week, visitors see it's nostalgia that seems to be driving
voters to turn toward Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Semonov, a 50-year-old unemployed miner from Kiryevsky,
said he's watched his town die a slow death. Since 1990, 10 of its
12 iron mines have closed, and the population has dwindled from
105,000 to less than 80,000, as young people leave in droves.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've heard of the Stalin gulags? Well, I'm living in a
Yeltsin gulag. I have no job, but there is nowhere for my family
and I to go. Even if I could find work in some other town, where
would we live? I can't sell my apartment and I have no money to
rent another. I'm trapped,'' Semonov said.
</P>
<P>
   His neighbor Yelena Antonova, 42, said she didn't trust Putin,
even when he promised to crack down on corruption, and increase
minimum wage and social security payments for the elderly _ three
promises Zyuganov has also made to voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zyuganov isn't in it for the money or the prestige. He's
running for the people. With Putin, I just don't know,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In Tula's provincial capital, where signs of economic resurgence
flourish along the tree-lined main street called Lenin Prospect,
citizens feel less inclined towards the Communists. They tend to
shy away from Putin also for economic reasons, but for different
ones than the Zyuganov electorate, who hope the government will
guarantee employment once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say I lived poorly under the Communist system, but now
I've found a different way to live,'' said 46-year-old Valery
Ivanov, the assistant director of a private publishing company, a
business he and a group of friends started five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voting for Putin is madness. Only a fool would vote for a
candidate without an economic plan. I have no idea what he stands
for,'' Ivanov, an earnest man with ink-stained hands, added.
``(Gregory) Yavlinsky (the leader of the liberal Yabloko party) is
the only solution. He's the only intelligent person who can help us
now.''

&HT;     COLLEGE STUDENTS PAYING MORE FOR FUN IN THE SUN

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Students used to hold up signs reading, ``Hi Mom
&AMP; Dad. Send Money.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, they are sending post cards that say, ``Wish you
were here.''
</P>
<P>
   The booming economy means college students _ children who have
grown up using cellular phones, surfing the Internet and wearing
logo-laden designer duds _ are spending thousands for more
elaborate spring break trips than their parents could have
imagined.
</P>
<P>
   Florida beaches aren't drawing today's jet-set students.
Instead, they are hopping planes to places like Cancun, Jamaica,
the Bahamas and other Caribbean islands.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of parents have never been to a tropical island, ever,
and now their kids are going there every year for four years of
college spring break,'' said Eric Sunila, office manager of college
trip organizer Inter-Campus Programs, based near Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The disposable income the students have is amazing and kind of
bizarre,'' said Sunila, whose company plans between 10,000 and
12,000 student vacations each year. ``There are still kids that are
going to South Florida and Texas, but over the past six years,
there are definitely more coming to us with more money to spend and
they're going to the islands.''
</P>
<P>
   One State University of New York at Albany student just returned
from Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so, so much fun. But I spent a lot of cash. I mean a
lot,'' said the tanned freshman who pleaded that her name not be
used because she spent double what her parents think she did. ``I
just wanted to go somewhere more fun, more exotic than the Florida
beaches.''
</P>
<P>
   To pay for the upscale seven-day getaway, the first-year student
used money from a part-time job, funds sent weekly by her parents
and her credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   Average prices for the spring break trips can start as low as
$200 to $300, agents say. But these days, many students are going
for the higher-end getaways, with beachfront accommodations and
price tags around $1,250 per person _ and that's with four in a
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, if we have the money, we might as well take the trips and
spend it,'' said the SUNY-Albany student as she walked off,
hurrying to the tanning salon to keep up her vacation glow.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Milian, an agent at Central Travel in Albany, noted that
cruises are popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cancun is always a big seller, and the Bahamas. Previously it
would be Myrtle Beach or Fort Lauderdale because they would drive,
pack in the car for a road trip,'' she said.

   India's ``Queen of Spices'' is indeed considered royalty in the
world of flavor. Cardamom's versatility enhances the taste of
everything from soups to desserts. Its aromatic, spicy-sweet and
warm flavor goes well in both hot and cold foods.
</P>
<P>
   Cardamom is the third most expensive spice (behind saffron and
vanilla) in the world, but a dash goes a long way. The spice gives
Danish pastries, Swedish coffee cakes and Norwegian Christmas cakes
their distinctive flavor. Cardamom also spices up Swedish meatballs
and flavors that country's popular hot spiced wine served at
Christmas. It is also widely used in many American processed foods
such as hot dogs, sausages and salami, as well as in soda, liqueurs
and sweets.
</P>
<P>
   Jill Norman, the author of ``The Complete Book of Spices,''
writes: ``The (cardamom) seeds were prized in India long before the
birth of Christ. Gradually the spice reached Europe along the
caravan routes.'' Cardamom was used in perfumes in ancient Greece
and Rome. It was also used as a breath freshener and to calm
digestive problems.
</P>
<P>
   According to tradition in the Bedouin culture, before guests are
served cardamom coffee, the spice is displayed, Norman writes.
``The pods imply esteem and respect for the guests.''
</P>
<P>
   WHAT IS IT: Aromatic pods with a warm, spicy-sweet taste,
cardamom is a member of the ginger family.
</P>
<P>
   FORM: Pods, seeds, ground
</P>
<P>
   LOOK FOR: Hard, dried pods that are greenish in color.
</P>
<P>
   STORE: In an airtight container in a cool, dry place. Pods can
be stored for up to a year; ground cardamom for several months.
</P>
<P>
   USE IN: Fruit and pasta salads; soups; curried fish, meat,
sausage and poultry dishes; vegetables such as carrots, pumpkin,
squash and sweet potatoes; bulgur, polenta, rice and couscous
dishes; cookies, cakes and pastries; teas; mulled wine.

CHANEY IS ONE WISE OWL 
</HEADLINE>

 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (itals)The world according to John Chaney: Point guards.
</P>
<P>
   After a game against Fordham Jan. 12, the Temple coach was
explaining the qualities he looks for in a floor general.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know who was a good point guard? Jesus. Jesus was a good
point guard because he gave to the multitudes.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone joked that Jesus could not go to his left.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't have to,'' Chaney fired back, ``because he was
always right.''(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   There are a growing number of people pulling for Chaney. They
may never say so publicly, but they do exist _ in the same way
folks wanted John Elway and Julius Erving to get championship rings
before they retired.
</P>
<P>
   There is a sentimental favorite to reach the Final Four and it
is John Chaney. The colorful, outspoken 67-year-old sage has taken
teams to four regional finals, losing each time. The squad he takes
to this year's NCAA tournament is the best since his 1987-88 team
that went 32-2 and lost to Duke in the East Regional final. Some
say this year's team is better.
</P>
<P>
   Chaney, whose second-seeded Owls (26-5) meet Lafayette Friday in
the East Regional's first round, became a sentimental favorite last
season when his team made an unexpected run to the East final,
where, again, it lost to Duke.
</P>
<P>
   The coach's press conferences were heavily attended and Chaney
used them to expound on such topics as NCAA rules, basketball
philosophies, and racism.
</P>
<P>
   The mentor was often followed off the podium and into the Temple
locker room by reporters, some of whom walked away with a different
view of a man famous for entering a postgame press conference and
trying to attack then-University of Massachusetts coach John
Calipari.
</P>
<P>
   Many had heard Chaney tell the same stories and offer the same
viewpoints. But you don't tire of Chaney.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, what is often best about him is that he seems out of
place with the fanfare and high drama of big-time college sports.
</P>
<P>
   He runs a tepid half-court offense and a zone-trap defense that
frustrates even the best of teams. He holds practices at 5:30 a.m.
to keep from interfering with class schedules. He'll stop practices
for discussions on current events.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (itals)The world according to John Chaney: The NCAA and
tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   After Temple's win over UMass in the Atlantic 10 semifinals,
Chaney was asked about the importance of playing in postseason
tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly everybody thinks it's about money, but kids get
excited about this time of year. And look at this room. It's filled
with you guys. Aren't you excited? You've got jobs because we've
got jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, moderator Ray Cella opened the floor for
questions and a reporter posed one to Temple guard Pepe Sanchez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pepe,'' he said, ``can you talk about the pace of the game?
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me finish my statement just one more time,'' Chaney
interjected. ``The other day there was this guy picking up after
reporters, talking about what a terrible time of year this is. I
got a guy picking up my trash outside my door, all up and down the
street, I can hear him cussing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I flipped the window and I said, `Let me tell you something
(expletive). You better be glad there's trash because you got a
damn job.' How many of you guys would be in this room if it wasn't
for athletics?''(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   Chaney is as old school as the two-handed set shot, as stubborn
as your grandfather when he knows he's right. He is also eighth
among active Division 1 coaches (and 20th all-time) with 631
victories. This year's NCAA tournament is Temple's 10th straight
and 16th in 17 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Owls annually play one of the toughest schedules in college
basketball and are 6-6 against teams ranked in the top 5 in the
last five regular seasons, including a win over then-No. 1
Cincinnati Feb. 20. This season, 11 of Temple's opponents (39
percent of its regular-season schedule) have advanced to postseason
play, including seven top the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Temple's trip to the Elite Eight last season put it among eight
schools to have reached that round at least four times in the last
12 years. All the others _ Connecticut, North Carolina, Arkansas,
Michigan, Kansas, Duke, and Arizona _ have won the national
championship.
</P>
<P>
   The Owls are led by Sanchez (6 points per game, 7.8 assists per
game), the A-10 player of the year, and junior Mark Karcher (15.4
ppg, 4.5 rpg). They are coming off one of their most impressive
outings of the season, a 65-44 trouncing of St. Bonaventure in the
A-10 final, where the Owls grabbed the first 16 rebounds, sank
seven first-half 3-pointers in a row, and raced to a 32-4
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Even Chaney admitted to being impressed. ``I never had a team
shoot the ball that well,'' he said. ``It was frightening to see
it. That's why I kept my mouth shut. I was afraid that if I had
opened my mouth and complained we would have stopped shooting and
lost the game.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (itals)The world according to John Chaney: NCAA rules. The coach
was asked, on a conference call, to respond to the NCAA's
suspension of Temple sophomore center Kevin Lyde, who had to sit
out the March 4 game against George Washington while the governing
body investigated whether an AAU coach paid for a summer class in
1997 _ when he was a junior in high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never heard of such a rule in my life,'' Chaney said. ``I
guess next time they'll be looking at 7-month-old babies, seeing
what's in their diapers . . . How is this a law and how do you
enforce such laws? You can't even stop the state of South Carolina
from flying that (Confederate) flag. That's where (presidential
candidate George W.) Bush and those guys want to play.''(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   Chaney's ways aren't always popular. He is known for making his
team, when it loses the A-10 championship game, watch the winning
squad cut down the nets. That happened five times in the 1990s. But
when the Owls beat the Bonnies last Saturday, they did not cut the
nets.
</P>
<P>
   Yet most of his players buy into his philosophies, and you can
always see former Temple players in the stands at the Owls' games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if you have to be a worthy winner you have to be a
worthy loser,'' said Chaney. ``I always make my team sit there,
even with tears in their eyes. It's important to do that, to show
respect for the other team.''
</P>
<P>
   But even the coach, who won a Division 2 national championship
with Cheyney State in 1978, has had to watch, as UMass replaced
Temple as the A-10's dominant team and as URI beat the Owls on a
last-second 3-pointer last season in the conference tournament
final.
</P>
<P>
   Chaney said he appreciates this season's A-10 title because of
the second-place finishes in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you understand a lot more of what this thing is about
from losses,'' he said. ``It's almost like having a lot of friends
when you have a lot of money in your pocket. You'll learn who your
friends are when you're broke. When you're sick, you learn a lot
more about what kind of resolve you have and what kind of friends
you have.''
</P>
<P>
   Chaney said he has told his players that despite what happens in
the tournament, all they can lose is one more game this season. If
the Owls continue to play as they did against St. Bonaventure, that
lose won't come soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played like a Final Four team,'' said Bonnies coach Jim
Baron. ``And we played them three times this year. In the
tournament, you don't have a chance to prepare.''

CASTING IN A DIFFERENT LIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While laboring in New Zealand for most of the winter, I afforded
myself one immense pleasure (though also actually on the job) by
venturing to see first-hand if the trout fishing in that country's
pristine bush land could live up to its legend.
</P>
<P>
   It did. And how. Try wild native brown and rainbow trout up to
about 10 pounds, as finicky as bone fish and pursued with about the
same stalking method. ``Hunting fish'' is how our guide, Simon
Dickie, described it.
</P>
<P>
   The first story I wrote about this fishing trip to the bush and
farming country a few hours south of Auckland met with some
skepticism back home, even though it was accompanied by two photos
of an 8-pound brown, one showing the magnificent gold side covered
with bright black speckles.
</P>
<P>
   We New England anglers have a hard time relating to such fish.
They resemble something we recognize in a smaller and dingier form.
One of the American anglers staying at the Poronui Ranch with us,
Greg Kelley, comes from the Midwest and has flyfished from Idaho to
Montana to Scotland. He pronouced this ``the finest fly fishing in
the world'' as, with a cheer of Wild Turkey, he toasted the day
past and the one to come.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the next day Kelley helicoptered to a stream hidden in
the half-million-acre Maori land that backs up to the ranch, and
there encountered a 10-pound rainbow, the catch of that day.
</P>
<P>
   At one point we hiked back into the bush and stopped at a high
banking overlooking a 50-yard stretch of the Taharua River in which
we spotted about eight browns ranging from 6 to 10 pounds. These
were wild, native fish, as unimaginable as that is to those of us
living in places where stocked fish half that size are considered
prizes.
</P>
<P>
   Fishing in New Zealand was an exercise in self-discovery. In
this paradise _ where the fish are not pressured for 10-day
stretches and so must be approached with great subtlety and care _
my skills were woefully inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   Like most people who grow up saltwater casting, my habits are so
ingrained that the considerable touch required to present the fly
to fish such as this had to be learned, like some skill totally
unrelated to what I previously knew fishing to be.
</P>
<P>
   Dickie, who owns the Poronui Ranch, explained to us with a note
of impatience that an angler has no more than one or two chances to
cast over a fish, and that once one fish is spooked it will spook
the rest. Therefore, said Dickie, the fly must be almost perfectly
cast.
</P>
<P>
   Right.
</P>
<P>
   The line must roll silently onto the water, and deposit the No.
14 Caddis silently upstream of the trout, and as it drifts
downstream the angler must take slack out of the line
progressively. At the very hint of a nibble, the angler must strike
hard and never again permit the slightest slackening of the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``He who hesitates is lost,'' said Dickie, though all my
instincts were backward. Back home, we let bass and bluefish nose
around for a while, and a striper may tail-slap your lure a few
times before taking it.
</P>
<P>
   That is not the only counterintuitive move when a lifelong
heavy-reel spin-caster meets a fresh water flyrod. I managed a few
casts in the right direction, but all in all my one Orvis school
week did not bring back the subtleties of wild trout fishing on the
Poronui Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   So I came home determined to improve my flyfishing skills.
Nothing in a shelf of old trout fishing books was very helpful, but
a new book out this spring has actually helped me make noticeable
improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Maine flycasters Macauley Lord (writer) and Jim Rowinski
(photographer) have authored a 126-page book, ``L.L. Bean
Fly-Casting Handbook.'' It may be the best instructional book on
the subject I have ever seen, due in part to the generous devotion
of space to Rowinski's photos.
</P>
<P>
   They are big, colorful shots with clear detail showing the cause
and effect of many motions that Lord describes as the book's
thesis:
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote this book to take you closer to the perfect cast, the
cast that seems to make itself while you stand by and watch in awe.
Physicists speak of an elegant theory, one that is precise, neat,
simple. That is what I hope for your casting: that, though falling
short of perfection, it may be precise, neat, and simple, without
excess motion. The elegant cast is the simple cast, the one that
quiets the body and the mind, making room for reverence of fishes
and waters.''
</P>
<P>
   Desribing himself as ``a fly-fishing generalist,'' Lord takes us
through the presentation, starting with a pantomime casting with an
unrigged rod, before moving on to the first backyard lesson. He
ends up with tricky reach casts, roll casts, aerial mends, and
shooting line.
</P>
<P>
   Every point is illustrated in a series of photos that Rowinski
renders clear, bright, and nearly always highlighting rod and line
against a contrasting deep shadow.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so most of us know that almost no one flyfishes to catch
fish. It's a Zen thing, and after all his extremely clear technical
advice, Lord leaves us with this picture of a teaching colleague
practicing in a casting pool:
</P>
<P>
   ``For the sheer fun of it, Craig and I are flycasting. After
teaching casts for 14 years, Pat is on the casting pool, quietly
making four-part casts: pickup, back cast, forward cast,
presentation. Time and again they are beautiful, elegant casts, yet
perfection eludes him, as it does all of us. But on this soft
summer evening, he moves a little closer.''

ECONOMY KEY TO BUSH, GORE CAMPAIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For months, Vice President Al Gore has counted on
the sizzling economy to help assure his election as president. Even
George W. Bush, with his focus on ``prosperity with a purpose,''
has all but conceded that boom times have prevailed during the
Clinton-Gore administration. The hottest economic issue has been
how to spend the surplus.
</P>
<P>
   But now, as Gore and Bush have wrapped up their party's
nominations, a bout of economic jitters threatens to reshape the
fall campaign. Gas prices are climbing rapidly to more than $2 per
gallon in some areas, prompting Bush to consider calling for a
repeal of what he labels the ``Gore gas tax.'' The Dow Jones
industrial average, after tripling during the Clinton
administration, is down this year, though it bounced up 4 percent
Thursday. The Nasdaq index, where many newer technology issues are
listed, has trended down in recent days, with traders jumpy about
even hints of bad news. Some economic forecasters are warning that
a bear market, or even the heightened fear of one, could quickly
dampen the positive outlook held by most voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went into this six months ago believing the economy would
be a non-issue,'' said Republican pollster Neil Newhouse of Public
Opinion Strategies. ``Now we are awakening to the fact that it may
very well be on the front-burner in the election.'' If Gore loses
his grip on the economic issue over the next eight months, analysts
said, the underpinnings of his candidacy could be seriously
damaged. But that is a big ``if.'' Wall Street is awash with
economic forecasters who for months have been issuing dire
warnings, only to be proven wrong _ as those who missed the
yearlong run-up in the Nasdaq market would attest. But even taking
into account the current correction, some analysts view this as an
extraordinarily volatile market, built, in large measure, on
unrealistic expectations about unproven tech-driven enterprises.
Such dour sentiments have fed concerns that the stock market
``bubble'' will burst, perhaps in the stretch run of the
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is the anxiety more pronounced than at the gas pump and
among those _ especially in New England _ who rely on home heating
oil. Already, according to the American Automobile Association,
gasoline prices have gone up nearly 50 percent in the past year, to
an average of $1.58 this week, and the price has skyrocketed to as
high as $2.50 per gallon in some areas of California. The price has
gone up an average of 12 cents in just the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Gore so far has rejected calls for a repeal of the 4.3
cents-per-gallon gas tax increase, which was approved by Congress
in 1993 to help reduce the budget deficit. The funds were later
redirected for highway construction.
</P>
<P>
   This week, in a move that may be designed partly to help Gore
avoid a potentially damaging campaign fight, Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson said that repealing the gas tax was ``on the table.''
But Richardson warned that repealing the tax would also remove $600
million in monthly revenue that is used to build highways and
bridges and other transportation projects. After an initial flurry
of interest in repeal, however, some leading Republicans have
indicated they could not support repealing the tax because it would
interfere with road projects. Bush economic adviser Lawrence
Lindsey said in a telephone interview that while the Texas governor
is studying the issue, he has not decided whether to call for
repeal.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane ridiculed Republicans who are
focusing on the gas tax, noting the levy was an instrumental part
of the 1993 budget vote that helped bolster the economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans call the 4.3 cents per gallon the `Gore gas
tax,' '' Lehane said, but we call it the `Gore 22 million new jobs
vote.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Lehane, noting that no Republican supported the measure, added,
``It was that vote on the economic program that helped balance the
budget and put the country on road to economic prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the gas tax is only a small part of the overall gas
price, so Bush this week began hammering at Gore for failing to
exert enough pressure on the oil-producing nations to boost
supplies. Bush contrasted the way his father, former president
Bush, dealt with the oil cartel to the way President Clinton has
performed in the diplomatic arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are countries with which we should have an enormous
amount of capital,'' Bush said during a recent campaign appearance.
``These are countries where it wasn't that long ago that a
President Bush helped Kuwait, or a United States helped Mexico, and
I think the fundamental question is, `Why can't the administration
get anything done on the diplomatic side?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Bush took a shot at Clinton, and by association, Gore. ``The
administration must use its leverage to get something done,'' Bush
said. ``And if it can't get something done, it shows how weak we
are diplomatically around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Voters are evenly split about which candidate can best handle
the economy, the issue that often determines which candidate wins
in November. A new Gallup Poll found that 46 percent of voters said
Gore would do a better job, while 45 percent favored Bush.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the economic fundamentals favor Gore, analysts said, as
many voters bask in the boom times. But politics is based greatly
on perception, as Bush's father, learned in 1992. During that
campaign, Bush lost to Bill Clinton despite winning the Gulf War
and presiding over the end of the Cold War. The reason was largely
economic, as voters perceived that the nation was in recession and
came to think that Bush was not doing enough to end it. In fact, as
Bush argued during the late stages of the campaign, the recession
was over and a period of strong growth was just beginning _ and has
continued to this day.
</P>
<P>
   ``If George W.'s father learned any lesson in 1992, it was that
the spring economy is not the fall economy,'' said former US
Representative Steve Gunderson, executive director of Republican
Main Street Partnership, a coalition of GOP moderates and business
executives. ``I think Gore has to be equally concerned whether they
can sustain the economy for the next eight months with fuel oil
prices. . .the interest rates and the repositioning of parts of the
stock market.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Bush campaign has its way, every gas station will become
the equivalent of a negative campaign advertisement against Gore.
The high price hits not only the suburbanites who commute in their
sport utility vehicles, but also the poor who drive outdated
gas-guzzlers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big, big pocketbook issue,'' said former senator
Alan Simpson, the Wyoming Republican and frequent Gore critic who
is director of Harvard University's Institute of Politics at the
Kennedy School of Government. ``Think of the poor guy in the inner
city who says, `Who the hell made gas go to $2?' Tell them it was
Gore and Clinton, and it could be a very volatile thing in this
election. It really affects the guys who are Gore's natural
constituency.''
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts said blaming the administration, and Gore, is
largely off the mark, given the sources of the current increase and
the fact that gas prices are actually low by historical standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question gas prices have gone up a lot and
quickly,'' said Daniel Yergin, chairman of Cambridge Energy
Research Associates. ``But if you adjust for inflation, they are
still lower than they were for the first half of the 1980s.''
</P>
<P>
   Yergin said that the oil price spike has been caused by
increasing demand from the recovering economies as well as the
thriving US market. ``What has happened over the last few years is
the kind of cars we drive has changed so much. We have become a
nation of sport utility vehicles,'' said Yergin, who admits to
driving a Volvo that guzzles its share of gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   So the question is whether voters will blame Gore for the gas
prices and other economic factors, or mostly credit him with the
good times.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy is Gore's great advantage,'' said Donald Kinder, a
professor of political science at the University of Michigan who
has studied the impact of the economy on presidential campaigns.
``For economic conditions to make a difference, people have to
assign responsibility _ credit or blame _ to the incumbent,''
Kinder said.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the economy has been one of the top factors in most
recent elections. In 1976, Jimmy Carter was elected after inflation
hurt the reelection bid of President Gerald Ford. Then Carter was
defeated by Ronald Reagan after interest rates and inflation
soared. In 1984, Reagan was reelected after an economic recovery,
and George H.W. Bush was elected in 1988 as the economy remained
strong.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1992, Bush was defeated by Clinton, who ran on the
memorable mantra that could once again define the election: ``It's
the economy, stupid.''

BULLY FOR CNN/SI, SHAME ON KNIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just when it was almost safe for the media to interview the
volatile Bobby Knight, along comes a report charging that the
Indiana coach not only subjected his players to verbal and physical
abuse but also once threw the university president out of a
basketball practice.
</P>
<P>
   The arrogance amid March Madness is seldom addressed, but CNN/SI
captured the dark side of the price of winning in Tuesday's solid
piece on the man whom Boston broadcaster Gerry Callahan has dubbed
``Coach Satan.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a hatchet job, as some Knight supporters suggest, but
rather a revealing look into Knight's bizarre coaching style.
</P>
<P>
   Producer Robert Abbott worked on the piece for a year. His boss
at the cable service, Steve Robinson, wanted a report on why top
recruits were leaving one of the nation's most prestigious
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Luke Recker was one such player. He was basketball-crazed
Indiana's top high school player, then one of the best players on
Knight's team before transfering after his sophomore year. Recker's
departure came on the heels of the transfers of two other High
School All-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The CNN/SI report revolves around the charges of another player,
Neil Reed, who played at Indiana between 1995-1997. He accused
Knight of, among other things, once grabbing him by the throat.
``He had me by the throat for probably, say, about five seconds,''
Reed said. ``I grabbed his wrists and started walking back, and by
this time people, coaches . . . grabbed Coach Knight and pulled him
away. . . . People came in and separated us like we were in a
schoolyard fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Another former player, Richard Mandeville, told a story about
one of Knight's pep talks. ``In our locker room,'' he said, ``there
is a bathroom attached to it and Knight came out, pants down around
his ankles, and just wiped his (expletive) and said, `This is how
you guys are playing.' And he just stuck out his hand with toilet
paper and kind of showed everyone and then walked back into the
stall.''
</P>
<P>
   Reportedly, no one was immune to Knight's tantrums. Not even
university president Myles Brand. During one practice, Reed told
CNN/SI, Brand and a guest were sitting near courtside. ``Coach
Knight could hear him and just stopped practice and said,
`(Expletive), quit that talking. I don't come into your office and
talk while you are working. Get the hell out of here.' The
president kind of looked, grabbed his stuff, and walked out,'' Reed
said.
</P>
<P>
   Brand and Knight refused three CNN/SI's request for interviews.
When told the details of the story, Indiana officials still refused
to react to the charges. Abbott said he spelled out the charges
shortly before the piece aired and Brand's response was ``he didn't
think it was necessary (to respond) if Knight didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I call Knight the emperor of Indiana,'' Murray Sperber, a
Indiana University professor of English and American Studies, told
CNN/SI. ``And there is no one in this state, really, who will stand
up to him, and certainly there is no one in this university who
will. And so, in a sense, if you are the emperor, you are allowed
to do what you want.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the report aired, two Indiana players, A.J. Guyton and
Michael Lewis, have defended Knight and blamed Reed for not
accepting responsibility for his own problems. ``We voted him off
the team,'' Lewis told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   And CBS analyst Billy Packer went on WEEI in Boston Wednesday
morning to defend his criticism of the CNN/SI report after Callahan
had accused him of being a Knight apologist. He claimed that the
three main charges were all denied by the very people alleged to
have been involved. Packer said Brand denied being kicked out of
practice, both assistant coaches denied pulling Knight off Reed,
and the team's head trainer vowed to take a lie detector test to
prove that Knight didn't pull his pants down in front of the team.
Packer further said that the video of Knight swearing at players in
the locker room was from 1991 but CNN/SI presented it as new.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing new in the report,'' Packer said. ``And of
the three main charges, all have been refuted by credible people.
I'm not saying Reed is lying, but someone is. Knight will be judged
on his record. But CNN/SI set out to create some news by printing
charges from disgruntled players.''

   Booming reaction
</P>
<P>

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The NBA has reached a compromise on its policy of forcing
coaches to wear microphones _ a boom microphone placed near the
reluctant coaches' benches. The softening of the league edict comes
after weeks of daily criticisms from coaches, players, and
analysts.
</P>
<P>
   The latest salvo came from Yankees manager Joe Torre. ``It's
probably the worst thing a manager or coach has to do,'' he told
the Associated Press Wednesday. ``You can be misunderstood. And
it's nobody's business.''
</P>
<P>
   Toronto forward Antonio Davis had one of the best reactions to
the NBA's other new policy of placing a camera in the locker room.
``What if I decide to scratch my butt?'' Davis told Bloomberg News.
``It's like that eye is always watching you. It's bad enough the
league controls our conduct and emotion on the court. Now we can't
be ourselves in the locker room. I'd be shocked if this goes over
well.''

OKLAHOMA: SOONER THAN LATER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _ It's always very nice to encounter a clear-thinking
man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep reading that 20 teams have a chance to win this
thing,'' said Oklahoma coach Kelvin Sampson. ``That's just not
true. Maybe five or six teams, plus a sleeper. That's all. And has
anybody seen Michigan State? Are there 63 teams here that could
beat Michigan State? You'd have to have a virus in the Michigan
State locker room for most of these teams to beat Michigan State.''
</P>
<P>
   How else can I put this, except to say, ``My sentiments,
exactly.''
</P>
<P>
   I was starting to wonder if I really was inhabiting some
parallel universe myself. Where are all these great teams? As
Sampson implied, the list of real honest-to-God contenders numbers
about a half-dozen. The odds are overwhelming that the next
national champion will be one of the following: Duke, Temple, Iowa
State, St. John's, Arizona, Stanford, or, of course, Michigan
State. I wouldn't even discount a Kenyon Martin-less Cincinnati.
That makes eight, which is a lot fewer than the 15 or 20 some
people have been talking about.
</P>
<P>
   This really isn't different than any other year. The Final Four
will almost certainly consist of three logical high seeds and a
mystery guest. The trick, as always, is to identify the 2000
mystery guest.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma, perhaps?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. There is a lot to like about Kelvin Sampson's
third-seeded Sooners, starting with Kelvin Sampson himself. If you
are the type who stays up late on January nights to watch the
midnight game on ``Big Monday,'' then you know who Kelvin Sampson
is. If you're the type who kind of floats into March having paid
limited attention to the sport of college basketball, then you
don't know who he is. You don't know about the nice job he did at
notoriously difficult Washington State (you try inducing a kid to
spend four years in Pullman), or about the outstanding job he is
doing at Oklahoma. You don't know that in the business, 44-year-old
Kelvin Sampson is very well respected.
</P>
<P>
   You've got to like any team that can score inside and out, that
routinely thinks pass before shot, that plays an excellent helping
man-to-man defense, and whose best player is a smart, versatile,
dynamic 6-foot-8-inch player who just happens to be something of a
national phenomenon below the border.
</P>
<P>
   Will Eduardo Najera (accent on the first syllable) become a star
in the NBA? Who knows? That's not the issue today. For his sake,
and his family's sake, you hope so. How could you not root for a
great kid from Chihuahua, Mexico, a kid who is burdened with the
responsibility of being a role model for Mexican youth on top of
being asked to lead his team deep into the NCAA tournament? He
really is a great college player.
</P>
<P>
   At 6-8 and 240 pounds, he can handle the ball, shoot the ball,
rebound the ball, and pass the ball. He throws his body around on
defense, too. He is a throwback, and never mind if he's a 3 or a 4
or a 3 7/8. What was Larry? He's not Larry, but he's not easily
categorized, either. He may be the best all-around forward in
college basketball, and that should be good enough for anyone.
</P>
<P>
   When Sampson recruited Najera out of San Antonio's Cornerstone
Christian High School, where he spent his senior year, he was 6-7
and 215, and you'd have to say he was a small forward. ``Now he's
6-8 and 240,'' said Sampson, ``and he still handles the ball like a
small forward. He has sincere versatility. It's not like some of
these guys who can handle the ball a little so they automatically
want to stay outside. If you're a 4, and you can handle the ball,
that's an asset if you stay inside, isn't it? Eduardo is able to do
what he does because he has real basketball instincts. He has a
very high basketball IQ.''
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't the story in Oklahoma's 74-50 conquest of 14th-seeded
Winthrop at the University of Arizona's McKale Center Thursday. He
had modest 10-point, 5-rebound, 5-assist numbers because the game
wasn't going his way, and he saw no need to force anything, not
with his teammates connecting on 10 of 21 3-pointers. Oklahoma also
had rather nice balance, with five men scoring between 10 and 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, you want to win your first-round game,'' said
Sampson, ``but the thing I was most impressed with is the way we
won it. We defended the 3-point line, and we defended their
halfcourt sets. We didn't let them reverse the ball. On offense,
our best friend was the 3-point shot.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first NCAA test for freshman point guard Hollis
Price, a skinny kid who, according to Sampson ``is the kind of kid
that makes you want to coach in the first place.'' Price was raised
in a New Orleans project by his grandfather (``There were some real
problems with the parents'' _ Sampson), and in very short order he
has become a Sampson favorite. Playing in the rugged Big 12, which
sent six teams into the NCAA tournament, put some hair on the young
lad's chest.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good thing, too, because guard play is crucial in this
tournament. ``You go nowhere without a good point guard,'' said
Sampson. ``It was no accident last year that you saw Khalid
El-Amin, Scoonie Penn, William Avery, and Mateen Cleaves in the
Final Four.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelvin Sampson isn't predicting anything for his team other than
a rugged game Saturday against Purdue. He worries about rebounding
(Winthrop helped itself to 19 offensive rebounds) and about the
fact that his team doesn't ordinarily block any shots. But he knows
he came out of a tough league _ ``Four very good teams in Iowa
State, Oklahoma State, Texas, and us, plus two more right there in
Kansas and Missouri'' _ and that he has the kind of great player in
Najera who might win a big game all by himself.
</P>
<P>
   So, yes, Oklahoma could be that ``sleeper'' he was talking
about. But it is pretty clear that if Kelvin Sampson were backing
one horse in this race it would be the one coming out of East
Lansing wearing green and white.

CARDINAL STANDS FOR SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ It wasn't supposed to happen like this, of
course. At least, not at this level.
</P>
<P>
   After all, when a team loses four seniors after going 26-7 and
getting upset in the second round of the NCAA tournament, you don't
automatically think Final Four, much less national championship.
</P>
<P>
   Or do you?
</P>
<P>
   It's not like Stanford is a basketball factory that turns out
blue-chip players like widgets on an assembly line. After all, this
is a program that won the national championship by beating
Dartmouth in 1942 and went 47 years before even making another NCAA
tournament appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Yet one day into the 2000 NCAA tournament Stanford will take the
court at the Birmingham-Jefferson Civic Center as not only the No.
1 seed in the South Regional, but as one of the favorites to win
the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   This is no soft No. 1. Other than a pair of losses to Arizona,
only a buzzer-beating basket by UCLA marred Stanford's record,
which comes in at 26-3.
</P>
<P>
   All of this with only power forward Mark Madsen returning from
last year's starting unit.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the program was drained. One thing Mike Montgomery has
learned to do in his 14 seasons as Cardinal coach is restock.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery simply plugged in new talent such as precocious
freshman forward Casey Jacobsen, who contributed more than anyone
could have expected. He handed the starting point guard job to
Michael McDonald, who has done more than an adequate job of
replacing Arthur Lee. He has worked the West Coast version of the
Twin Towers, 6-foot-10-inch Jarron Collins and 6-11 Jason Collins,
into the rotation as solid contributors. He has channeled shooting
guard David Moseley's talents as a scorer.
</P>
<P>
   One more thing. Montgomery has toughened the Cardinal to the
point where their attitude shows through when they take the court.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this: Stanford led the nation in defense, allowing
opponents a shooting percentage of only .352. Marquette set the
NCAA record of .358 during the 1994 season. Only six times has a
Stanford opponent hit more than 40 percent of its shots.
</P>
<P>
   All of this and Montgomery has graduated 100 percent of his
players and hasn't encountered even a sniff of an off-court
incident involving his players.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's one of the great stories in college basketball
over the last 20 years,'' said longtime Pac-10 observer George
Raveling, who coached against Stanford at USC and Washington State.
``I never thought Mike would be able to sustain this the way he
has. He found the magic formula that allows the university to be
the best academically and athletically.''
</P>
<P>
   Sustain is the right word. This marks the sixth consecutive
20-win season.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal, which faces 16th-seeded South Carolina State in
Friday's fourth game, have done it without the flare of a
Cincinnati or even an Arizona or Connecticut, each of whom can turn
a basketball court into a laser show of fast-break points, slam
dunks, and end-to-end excitement. ``We're definitely not like the
`Showtime' era,'' said McDonald. ``But we have the same amount of
wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery says the Cardinal style is more suited to the long
run. ``We wouldn't have any one thing that people would say, `Wow,'
said Montgomery, ``but we grow on you.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, this team is a throwback, featuring good size up
front, tenacious defense, and smart, if unspectacular, basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our mantra from day one has been that if we rebound and play
defense, we're going to win games,'' said Madsen, who has had a
solid, and at times standout, season. ``Shooting is going to come
and go.''
</P>
<P>
   Most often it has come, although the impression that sticks in
the mind of many people in New England is the way UConn has
physically manhandled the Cardinal in the teams' last two meetings,
including a 70-59 pounding at Maples Pavilion last season.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery says all a coach can ask of a program is the
opportunity to string together four wins in March and make the
Final Four, then take your chances. ``If you can consistently get
your program into the tournament and consistently in the Top 20,
you've got a chance,'' he said. ``We're a strong team, one of about
16 teams that can get into the mix. Ultimately, for any team it
comes down to performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting now, the Cardinals will be judged critically on each
performance, with the success of the season determined not by what
they have done over the last four months, but by what they will do
during the next two weeks.

DOW, NASDAQ DECIDE IT'S TIME TO PARTY AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ted English wins this week's award for the luckiest man on the
planet.
</P>
<P>
   Eight days ago, English, a 17-year employee, was officially
named the successor to TJX Cos. chief executive Ben Cammarata.
Shares of the Framingham, Mass. retail company, pounded for no
particular reason over the last year, suddenly became caught up in
Wall Street's furious ``old economy'' rally.
</P>
<P>
   The forgotten were instantly invited to the party. Retailers,
banks, insurance companies, and other battered stocks finally began
to climb back. TJX shares soared 31 percent in just four days this
week and, sorry Ted, the move didn't have much to do with executive
promotions.
</P>
<P>
   The story of this week's stock market had been surprising but
straightforward and reassuring, in a way. Investors had finally
become wary of the rocket-propelled rally of Nasdaq's technology
stocks and moved money into established names that were for sale at
amazingly reasonable prices.
</P>
<P>
   It felt like everyone at the casino had begun to sober up a
little. Tech stocks took a hit, but they were already up a ton and
the day of reckoning everyone really feared, when a correction
would crush every single thing in the market, seemed a little less
likely.
</P>
<P>
   That's what makes Thursday harder to explain.
</P>
<P>
   The session started just as the rest of the week had gone: the
Dow Jones industrial average climbed smartly and the Nasdaq index
gave back a bit more. But then money started flooding everything.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day, the Dow's 499-point gain had set a record
and Nasdaq finished up nearly 3 percent. Bond prices were up.
Everything was up.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the backdrop, not dire but hardly conducive to a
furious rally. A report on wholesale prices was sharply higher,
though oil accounted for most of the problem. Now consumer
inflation numbers were due Friday and the Federal Reserve is
scheduled to raise interest rates next week.
</P>
<P>
   There are some important facts that could explain away a lot of
Thursday's activity.
</P>
<P>
   Dow stocks and other out-of-favor issues have been beaten so far
down that even Friday they remained far behind the prices of their
best days. FleetBoston Financial gained nearly 25 percent in the
first four days of this week, but still traded more than 20 percent
below its best prices of last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Among high-tech stocks, prices bounced back only after a decline
of about 9 percent in just a few days. A snap back, even a
temporary recovery, shouldn't come as any shock.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the highest fliers were still down substantially for the
week, even after Thursday's bounce. Locally, stocks including Open
Market Inc., Akamai Technologies Inc., and Art Technology Group
Inc. were all down more than 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The more compelling story lies in the continuing gap debate.
That's the difference between valuations of fast-growing technology
companies and the established businesses that hate to be saddled
with the ``old economy'' tag.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts pointed to the gap between the Dow and the Nasdaq as
the easiest way to see what was happening, and most agreed the new
economy stocks had gotten too far ahead. But exactly what that gap
should be, the premium investors should pay for faster growth, is a
continuing debate. Like everything else in this market, it is
shaped by dramatically greater velocity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our markets are starting to operate at warp speeds,'' said Ned
Riley, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors.
He calls the tech-stock credo GAAP, or ``growth at any price,'' and
welcomed the swing toward the Dow stocks this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to think we were going to continue that
rotation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some money managers saw Thursday's late Nasdaq rally as a
reevalution of the old-to-new adjustment of the week, when some
investors thought enough was enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the valuation gap between new and old began to close a
little, people said maybe we should be buying back the new again,''
said John Wilson, manager of the $3.5 billion State Street Research
Investment Trust.
</P>
<P>
   John Ballen, president of MFS Investment Services in Boston,
sees a broader and relatively healthy market that is undergoing
adjustments by ``rolling corrections.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think you'll have a broadening of the market and
earnings growth will be rewarded at the companies that come
through,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But by the end of Thursday's trading, it was hard to avoid the
feeling you had returned to the casino and this time there were
just more games to play. Good luck, Ted.

MORE LIP FROM SKIP: NO BIG DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A couple of Boston boys have gotten in a tangle out San
Francisco way.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the setup, parts of which were reported earlier this week
in the California edition of the Wall Street Journal: Last year,
developer Richard Friedman bagged a contract to build a $200
million luxury hotel on an extremely desirable plot right outside
his pal David Ross's new Museum of Modern Art in downtown S.F.
Remember David Ross? He ran the Institute for Contemporary Art here
and then moved his bourgeois-shocking act to New York's Whitney
Museum during the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his deal, Friedman agreed to dedicate a fraction of
his space _ 20,000 square feet _ to an African-American cultural
museum. Ross suggested that Friedman hire Thelma Golden of Harlem's
Studio Museum and Harvard's own Henry Louis (Skip) Gates, both of
whom had ties to the Whitney (Golden used to work there; Gates is
on the board), to help set up the proposed cultural center.
</P>
<P>
   Problem Number One: San Franciscans openly wondered why geniuses
had to be imported from New York and Boston to plan their museum.
``This is Skip Gates and friends,'' Claudia Polley, president of
the San Francisco-based National Association for African American
Heritage Preservation told me. ``Gates isn't a historian, he's not
a museum person, and he's not an exhibit designer. We may not be
the best experts in the world, but we do know something.'' In fact,
Gates's specialty is literature.
</P>
<P>
   Problem Number Two: As recently as Feb. 1, Gates was proposing
to call the museum ``Africana: The San Francisco African American
Cultural Institute.'' Not surprisingly, some San Franciscans viewed
this as a crass brand extension of a for-profit company that Gates
has been working hard to promote nationwide. He is the co-creator
of the print and digital/interactive versions of Microsoft's
Encarta Africana, an encyclopedia that has morphed into a Web site,
africana.com. Africana would like to be to African-Americans what
iVillage would like to be for women: a multi-service ``portal,'' or
gateway to the Internet for their respective constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman and the Skipper assure me that their intentions have
been misinterpreted. As for Problem Number One, Friedman says:
``It's not going to be our museum, it's going to be the community's
museum. It's premature for anybody to be worried about this.'' As
for Problem Number Two, Gates explains that S.F. mayor Willie Brown
said he wanted an interactive museum, which prompted Gates to demo
his Encarta Africana CD-ROM for the museum crowd. ``Africana was
just a working title,'' Gates says. ``It had nothing to do with
Microsoft. And that's the truth, Ruth.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Author's Corner
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Didja ever whack anybody for Whitey? Maybe you should be
thinking about a book deal.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure Eddie Mackenzie ever whacked anybody, but he does
claim to have broken a leg or two for the Whitey Bulger-controlled
Irish mob. South Boston's own Eddie Macke, as he calls himself, got
busted for drugs in 1992 and cut a deal with the law that got him
out of his 13-year sentence. The quo pro which he got the quid was
helping the feds on a successful sting operation against a Latin
American drug gang.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, agent Helen Rees signed a lucrative deal with
HarperCollins for Mackenzie's life story, called ``The Redemption
of Eddie Macke.'' I'm assured there's enough blood and guts to
interest the Rupert Murdoch-owned publishing house, and Mackenzie
will be getting some writing help from Marblehead's own Phyllis
Karas, who also helped out on a 1998 book called ``The Onassis
Women.''
</P>
<P>
   Depending on how fast Mackenzie and Karas can write, they may
catch the tail end of the Whitey Bulger wave. Three Globe writers
have books planned for this year: Gerry O'Neill and Dick Lehr will
be publishing ``Black Mass'' later this spring, and Ralph Ranalli
hopes to have ``Blood Brothers'' in the stalls before the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   The word on the street is that John Martorano may try to do a
book, Henry Hill-style. Martorano was a Whitey triggerman who has
turned state's evidence and is now in the witness protection
program. Hill was the similarly protected mobster who sold his
story to Simon &AMP; Schuster for the book ``Wiseguy'' and the
subsequent movie ``GoodFellas.'' Martorano's lawyer Francis DiMento
says doing a book ``is completely out of the question,'' mainly
because his client hasn't yet testified in court. What about after
his testimony? ``Years down the road,'' muses DiMento, ``I suppose
he could do what he wants.''

MENINO PUSHES MITCHELL FOR VP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The George Mitchell-for-vice &UR;  &LR; president bandwagon is out of the
barn and rolling in Al Gore's direction, and the mayor of Boston is
whipping up the horses.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Tom Menino is convinced Mitchell's congressional
experience and international savvy will confirm and expand upon the
stature gap he hopes will become evident by election day.
</P>
<P>
   And, even better for Boston on this sainted day, Mitchell is
half-Irish. ``He has the stature, the experience, the reputation
he's carved in international relations, where he was so effective
in the Northern Ireland situation,'' enthused Menino, who, as Dame
Boston's first Italian-American mayor, is of necessity somewhat of
an expert on Irish politicians and even half-Irish politicians.
</P>
<P>
   As former majority leader of the US Senate, Mitchell knows the
inside-the-Beltway deal as well as anyone. But the former senator's
personality is what seals the deal for Menino, and a number of
mayors whom Hizzoner is buttonholing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the ability to bring people together,'' said Menino
over the phone Thursday. ``And he has the status to give the
Democrats a little extra in this presidential contest.''
</P>
<P>
   Menino went to Tennessee Monday and Tuesday to sit with Gore and
review the party's prospects for the fall. Menino did not try the
hard-sell with Gore directly; you don't do it that way, as the vice
president was preparing to lay informal claim to the nomination
after the latest primaries and caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   But Menino left the Gore senior staff with no doubt as to his
preference. Gore gets to decide on his running mate two weeks after
Bush makes his choice known to the GOP convention delegates in
Philadelphia in early August.
</P>
<P>
   Menino said he tossed Mitchell's name out in front of a bunch of
other US mayors at a Washington luncheon speech Monday, and
Mitchell's name elicited approval from a number of them. Mitchell's
success in bringing the warring factions of Northern Ireland to the
peace table is the type of skill badly needed in the nation's
capital, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really see that when you mention the idea to other people.
Anybody you mention it to, you get a positive response. Why? He's
one of those individuals who are special in our society who have
come out of public life. People look up to him, they respect him.
Because they think that whatever he's doing is for the common
good.''
</P>
<P>
   And as a practical political consideration, added Menino,
Mitchell's age could make him more acceptable to the rest of the
Democratic leaders. Mitchell will turn 67 on Aug. 20, the week
after the convention. At that age, it's highly unlikely he'd run
for president himself in four or eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it doesn't clog up the political landscape,'' is the way
Menino phrased it. But most of all, he emphasized, ``It gives Gore
what he really needs right now _ he makes it a special ticket.'' To
some Democrats, Mitchell is about the closest thing the Dems have
to Colin Powell, the retired general who tops every Republican's
dream list of running mates.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, still active in two law firms, is remarried and has a
young son. He often jokes about his assertion that being
commissioner of baseball is the best job in America.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that presidential nominees pick their running mates
to deliver an important swing state or a desirable chunk of
democraphics is now old style politics, claims Menino. By that
yardstick, Mitchell would deliver only Maine, with four paltry
electoral votes, or New England's three dozen.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was 20 years ago,'' he said dismissively. ``People don't
vote anymore on Democratic or Republican labels. They look at the
individual: What does he stand for? That's what explains John
McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that McCain came out of nowhere to push
Bush hard in the early primaries before running out of gas, money,
and traction.
</P>
<P>
   The independent and crossover Democratic voters who flocked to
the McCain banner did so not because they were in ideological
lockstep with his various positions. Rather, argued the mayor, they
were attracted by McCain's personal qualities: patriotism, honor,
sacrifice, courage, independence. It's the man and not the laundry
list that sways moderate voters sloshing around in the middle of
the political spectrum, insisted the two-term mayor, the first to
be reelected without opposition in more than a century of fractious
Boston politics.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has become cool to the idea of picking McCain, the
Republican with the most evident ability to attract votes outside
the GOP base. If Bush had the wit and the self-confidence to choose
McCain, the pressure would be on Gore to match the senator's
appeal. Mitchell would be one choice.
</P>
<P>
   Another might be the junior senator from Massachusetts, John
Kerry, a decorated Vietnam veteran, a rugged campaigner, and a
television debater of top quality, as witness his 11 hour-long
televised jousts with the redoubtable Bill Weld in the '98 Senate
fight.
</P>
<P>
   But Menino is going for Mitchell and is trying to enlist some of
his fellow mayors in the cause.

 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At one extreme, there's the fun stuff, like the private language
our 12-year-olds use with friends in instant messages:
</P>
<P>
   ``sup?''
</P>
<P>
   ``nm. u?''
</P>
<P>
   ``hw.''
</P>

<P>
   ``pos, ctgr.''
</P>
<P>
   ``l8er.''

   At the other end of the spectrum, there's peril: Late last
month, a 29-year-old Massachusetts man was charged with breaking
into a house and attempting to rape a 14-year-old girl he had met
on line in a chat room and corresponded with via e-mail for about a
year. According to police, he posed as an 18-year-old and may also
have contacted 20 or more other girls. Police also say the girl had
willingly met him off line several times.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, the space between the two extremes is not the chasm we
might hope for.
</P>
<P>
   With all the positives we know children can get out of
cybercommunication, most of us think of our kids' e-mail and buddy
chats as innocuous or, at most, a hindrance to homework. But the
chilling Whitman arrest highlights not only how vulnerable our
children are but also how they put themselves at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Why are our kids so attracted to cybertalk to begin with?
</P>
<P>
   ``For the same reason I used to come home from school and get on
the phone with the friends I had just left,'' says children's
culture specialist Kathy Merlock Jackson, a professor at Virginia
Wesleyan College. At this age, she says, there's a deep, powerful
need to connect to peers, ``but in this day and age it's the
computer that comes naturally to kids instead of the phone.''
</P>
<P>
   That need begins to surface at about 10 and peaks from about 13
to 16. E-mail (one-to-one conversation) and instant ``buddy''
messages (instantaneous e-mail to a specified group of users) are
more popular than chats (public conversations, often with strangers
who share a common interest), but a staggering number of children,
about 12 million, engage in some kind of cybertalk, says
cybersafety specialist Parry Aftab.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Better than the telephone
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At a stage in life when independence and privacy are paramount,
cybertalk has much more to offer than the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents can't overhear you,'' says Jackson. ``They're less
likely to know how long you're on or who you're talking to. Even if
they pay attention, they don't know what you're saying because of
the `secret' language.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that anything of substance ever gets said anyway. ``The
point of it is the connection, not the content,'' says Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   The advantages for shy or socially awkward children are even
greater. ``On line, there's no one judging them,'' says Pittsburgh
psychologist Kimberly Young. ``That frees them to express
themselves in ways they can't in person. Kids who are misfits in
school suddenly feel they belong.'' Young is executive director of
the Center for On-Line Addiction (www.netaddiction.com) and the
author of ``Caught in the Net'' (Wiley and Sons).
</P>
<P>
   But cybertalk does have negatives:
</P>
<P>
   --It creates a culture of detachment. At a time in life when
teens should be honing interpersonal skills, they withdraw from
real life by spending time on the computer. If anything, says
Jackson, ``The child who's shy in person only becomes more so.''
</P>
<P>
   --It's easy to misread. Because there's no tonal quality to
e-talk, it's easy for a child to take offense where none was
intended. This translates to real-life hurt feelings, even broken
friendships. Younger children are especially prone.
</P>
<P>
   --It's easy to pretend. What begins as newfound freedom to
express yourself often turns into trying on a new persona: A timid
boy plays with being a threatening, macho type; a 14-year-old girl
who's overweight tries out being sexually provocative. ``It's easy
to get caught up with it,'' says Young.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chat room ``lurkers''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The danger is that provocative words and content draw attention.
Chats are notorious for attracting ``lurkers,'' people who listen
in rather than participate and contact a person privately
afterward, through e-mail. Their goal, says Aftab, can range from
sending kids pornographic material or initiating cybersex (sexual
talk about what you would do if you were there in person) to
meeting off line. A typical lure: ``I just got the new Sony
PlayStation! I bet my uncle can get it for you, too!'' Aftab is
executive director of Cyberangels, a national Internet safety
organization safety group (cyberangels.org). She also is the author
of a must-read book, ``The Parent's Guide to Protecting Your
Children in Cyberspace'' (McGraw Hill).
</P>
<P>
   --It's easy to feel safe. Teens tend to feel impervious to
danger. ``They take risks on line because they don't see them as
risks,'' says Aftab. In an online survey of 11,000 girls aged 13 to
16, 60 percent said they engage in cybersex even though they said
they wouldn't have real sex until they are married. Similarly, once
a 14-year-old chats and then exchanges e-mail for months with a
stranger, the person no longer is a stranger. ``He was a friend,''
the Whitman teen reportedly told police.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't occur to a teen that the person isn't who and what
he says he is,'' says Aftab.
</P>
<P>
   This is, of course, what's so frightening. According to Aftab,
12 to 13 percent of preteens who engage in cybertalk agree to meet
off line someone they have met on line. Children most likely to do
this: middle-class suburban kids. ``They're naive and trusting,''
she says. ``Urban kids are far more likely to know it's a stupid
idea.'' Since 1995, the FBI has arrested 515 people accused of
trying to arrange offline meetings with children, and last year it
opened 1,500 new cases, double the number from 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Good news for parents
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The good news in all of this is that we are not as powerless as
we may think in keeping our children safe. Perhaps most important,
says Aftab, is making sure your children understand that people
they don't want to get in touch with them are able to trace them if
they: fill out any online personal profiles; answer junk e-mail;
divulge personal information in an e-mail or chat room. Since this
may frighten some younger children, stress the junk advertising
piece of it: ``You know how we get so many annoying catalogs in the
mail? Well, there's junk e-mail, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Basic safety rules also are important: The computer belongs in a
public space in the house; no Internet surfing except for school
research and/or with a parent present; instant messaging only with
people you know directly off line, that is, not with friends of
friends; chatting only in agreed-to chats.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've established these rules, says Aftab, create a
contract for you and your child to sign; the younger he is when you
do this, the safer he will be when he's older. Here are basic items
to include:

THE PRESIDENT VS. THE NRA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The drive-by political shootings by the National Rifle
Association are less remarkable for their occurrence than for the
seven years of hapless responses from President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   For all of the terror inflicted on Capitol Hill, all Clinton has
done is flail his arms and rail impotently as the thugs speed away.
Unlike bullhorn-wielding women and marching men in inner cities who
turn stoops and sidewalks into bully pulpits to drive out violent
drug dealers, Clinton has only whimpered as the bullies steal his
pulpit.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the unrivaled distinction of the United States as the
murder capital of the developed world, the NRA has opposed all
attempts to stem the proliferation of guns. Whenever Congress seems
the least interested in the most minor of gun restrictions, the NRA
invokes images of Nazism. Its two decades of calling federal
firearms agents ``jackbooted thugs'' drove former President George
Bush to resign his NRA membership in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was no friend of gun control, but he friends of his in the
Secret Service and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms were
killed in Oklahoma City and Waco.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's resignation should have discredited the NRA for good. Yet
the gun lobby is still speeding away, with no one brave enough to
give chase.
</P>
<P>
   Even after several recent school shootings, office shootings,
and racist and anti-Semitic killing sprees, the Congress has yet to
pass laws for background checks at gun shows. The NRA has prodded
14 states to pass laws that attempt to block cities from suing gun
makers.
</P>
<P>
   The gun industry and the NRA have so far gotten three city
lawsuits thrown out of court _ in Cincinnati, Miami, and
Bridgeport, Conn. A grass-roots campaign by the gun lobby recently
forced Citibank to reverse its ban on business with gun
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that is nothing compared to the latest NRA terrorist
attack. In response to the killing of a 6-year-old girl by a
6-year-old boy in Michigan, Clinton renewed his call for background
checks. NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre, the man with
the AK mouth, fired back by saying Clinton has made the NRA a
scapegoat while lazily enforcing existing gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   Within the last week, LaPierre said ``President Clinton is
willing to accept a certain level of killing to further his
political agenda,'' and that the death of former Northwestern
University basketball coach Ricky Byrdsong ``is on the president's
hands . . . that blood is on his hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, but not in the way LaPierre thinks, Clinton does
bear responsibility. Clearly, in a nation where 32,000 people died
from firearms in 1997, and with ample data to show that gun
proliferation leads to more deaths, the NRA has far more blood on
its hands than the president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton can no longer hide behing the excuse that a
Republican-led Congress is responsible for blocking gun control.
After seven years in office, the president's failure to use his
bully pulpit to goad Congress into action on our 200 million-plus
guns has become a defeated acquiescence to them. Acquiescence to
guns means accepting a certain level of killing.
</P>
<P>
   For seven years, Clinton has been more the befuddled victim of
the NRA than the clear-eyed crusader against it. He has repeatedly
said these shootings make no sense, knowing full well that England
and other countries made instant sense out of gun violence by
banning handguns.
</P>
<P>
   Early in his presidency, Clinton demanded that black people
stand up to inner-city gun violence. In many corners they did,
including here in Boston. Now it is Clinton's turn to stand up to
guns for all of America.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA has given him a golden opening, going from calling
federal agents jackbooted thugs to all but saying the president is
a murderer. So far, Clinton has laughed it off. ``I have so much
scar tissue now, I can't even feel it,'' Clinton said this week.
``So it's totally immaterial to me what they say.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Clinton jokes about the scar tissue caused by wounds
by the NRA, he can claim no direct hits on the NRA in his seven
years in office.
</P>
<P>
   If he does not use the final months of his presidency to wage an
all-out assault on the NRA's power and our mindless proliferation
of guns, then all his words and hugs are meaningless. His words _
particularly if progun George W. Bush is elected president _ will
become totally immaterial.
</P>
<P>
   As of now, the NRA has committed another drive-by political
shooting. As it speeds away, one can see an object sticking out of
the trunk. It is President Clinton's bully pulpit.

&HT;     FOR `NICE GUY' GEORGE CARLIN, THE INSULTS KEEP ROLLING 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK McGUIRE  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   George Carlin is not an angry man; he just plays one on TV. In
fact, he's not even ticked off. No, you have to care to be ticked
off, and Carlin long ago detached himself from messy attachments
like, oh, an affiliation with the human race.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it really amounts to is a contempt and disillusionment
and a distaste for all the things this species has gone through,''
Carlin explained in a telephone interview from California. ``It is
more of an impatience. It is an accumulation of grievances on the
parts of these humans.''
</P>
<P>
   These humans. George Carlin has met the enemy _ well, at least
the perpetrators _ and they are us. Or, if you like, them. And he
wants no part of it, except to observe from afar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who's doing art is better served if they are
emotionally detached from the subject matter,'' he said. ``For me,
the best way is no emotional involvement. This way I can see it
more objectively.''
</P>
<P>
   But try as he might to irk the audience with a list of their
transgressions, he will not succeed _ since his fans naturally
exempt themselves from his contempt. ``You try to insult them and
it doesn't work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now in his fifth decade of performing, Carlin does a stage show
that he splits in half, the first part being bits from his last HBO
show, while the second half features new work from his next HBO
special, slated for spring 2001.
</P>
<P>
   That show will be his 12th for the cable network, to go along
with 130 appearances on ``The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson.'' He
was a network variety show staple in the late 1960s, although his
Fox sitcom in the mid-1990s never hit its stride. (Still, he's the
answer to a great trivia question, having served as the first host
of ``Saturday Night Live.'')
</P>
<P>
   But Carlin is the outsider who is now an institution. Closing in
on age 63, the artist _ the word fits without pretension _ did not
really find his voice until the 1980s, long after his bit on the
seven words you can't say on television (the inside joke is trying
to think of all seven) got him in trouble with the mainstream
suits.
</P>
<P>
   Then came cable. Carlin, even more than ``The Sopranos,'' is a
perfect match for HBO. No cable, and Carlin would have remained a
funnyman on the fringe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been a much more limited deal,'' Carlin said.
``I would have been stuck with albums. It still would have been a
healthy career.''
</P>
<P>
   But he wouldn't have been an icon. Cable television allowed
Carlin an outlet Lenny Bruce never had, and gives him the mantle as
arguably the most influential comic of the last third of the 20th
century.
</P>
<P>
   Carlin's 1997 book ``Brain Droppings'' was a best-seller; he
plans to release another tome, ``Napalm and Silly Putty,'' next
year. The latter title shows the juxtaposition in Carlin's act
between his rants on the ``big world'' _ war, politics, race, death
and the like _ and the ``little world'' _ food, pets, stuff, etc.
</P>
<P>
   The third component of his persona is his love-hate relationship
with language, heard in his riffs on the oxymorons (``jumbo
shrimp,'' ``original copy'') we take for granted. Words are
Carlin's tools, and he hates it when they're used as haphazardly as
a neighbor's borrowed ratchet set.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's religion. A former Catholic (``lapsed'' doesn't do
justice to his disdain for the religion), Carlin doesn't say he is
an atheist, or even an agnostic: He believes it's futile to try to
comprehend the concept of a god. Carlin, who played a cardinal in
the controversial comedy ``Dogma,'' thinks God would get the joke.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made the joke,'' Carlin said. ``It's all a big joke.''
</P>
<P>
   This cosmic prank _ and you know he has a better four-letter
name for it _ leaves Carlin sounding bemused but angry. One hundred
nights a year, he goes out to towns like Charleston, S.C., while
another 13 weeks are spent packing the casino halls, all the while
mocking the morons who surround all of ``us.''
</P>
<P>
   A two-time Grammy winner, Carlin last fall released a box set,
``George Carlin: The Little David Years (1971-77).'' It's a
seven-CD period piece from the time when Carlin was honing his
stage character, years before his sharpest writing and sharpest
tongue.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-two and still peaking, still acerbic, still provocative,
still unafraid. Lines? Boundaries? Yeah, like he cares.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look for where the line might be and deliberately cross
it,'' Carlin said. ``Then I bring the audience across the line with
me.''
</P>
<P>
   And we go, wherever this nice man takes us.

PUTTING NAMES TO A FISHING PORT'S LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ARNOLD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLOUCESTER, Mass. _ About all history recalls of Jeremiah Allen
is that he was 18 years old, a resident of Gloucester, on his way
home from a fishing trip off Sable Island when his schooner sank in
a storm on Oct. 14, 1716.
</P>
<P>
   There was no burial; his body was never recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Not much, but it's all Allen needs to earn the dubious
distinction of heading the list of 5,230 fishermen who hailed from
Gloucester, or sailed from Gloucester, never to return, except in
name.
</P>
<P>
   Now a dozen volunteer archivists have officially finished their
seven-month project documenting the deaths of every fisherman lost
at sea who either came from Gloucester or shipped aboard a
Gloucester-based vessel.
</P>
<P>
   The list is scheduled for publication in the Gloucester Daily
Times, which hopes residents will come forward to report any
corrections or omissions. Then the list will be sent to a foundry
and the names will be cast in bronze, eventually to become the soul
of a $110,000 addition to the Gloucester Fishermen's Memorial
statue.
</P>
<P>
   The famous statue of the fisherman at the wheel _ its base
inscribed, ``They that go down to the sea in ships'' _ was
dedicated 75 years ago. In August, a cenotaph, a memorial to people
buried elsewhere, will highlight a rededication ceremony for the
statue.
</P>
<P>
   And, perhaps in a private moment, people will be able to run a
finger over the raised bronze letters naming someone who, at least
in name, will have returned to Gloucester.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin ``Benny'' Interrante, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Interrante disappeared with five mates aboard the fishing boat
Captain Cosmo in 1978. He took the trip on a lark, talked to his
family by marine radio on his 22d birthday, then failed to return
to port two days later for his sister's wedding.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be good to see him,'' his mother, Mary, said the other
day, her fragile voice a reminder that the pain lingers. ``There
was nothing. Now there will be something.''
</P>
<P>
   Memorials are nothing new to Gloucester, a community of 27,000
on Cape Ann. In 1997 the city hosted the traveling version of the
Vietnam Wall Memorial. The names of 17 men from Cape Ann
communities are on that wall. But, just since that war ended,
Gloucester has lost more men at sea.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, Gloucester has been at war with the sea for more than
three centuries. The city's reputation, its profits, and, because
of recent fish shortages, its frustrations, have been defined both
by what the sea offers and what it claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``These fishermen are what made Gloucester famous,'' said Gaspar
``Gap'' Lafata, who is chairman of the committee overseeing the
memorial project. Like so many of his fellow residents, Lafata has
direct connections to death at sea, an uncle and first cousin lost
on a 1978 fishing trip.
</P>
<P>
   Half the money already has been raised for the privately funded
cenotaph, Lafata said.
</P>
<P>
   Ten granite slabs will be aligned along the periphery of the
existing oval in front of the statue, located between a sea wall
and Stacey Boulevard. Bronze plaques affixed to the stones will
list the names of those killed and the years they were lost. Only
men _ and to date, researchers have documented only men _ lost at
sea will be included.
</P>
<P>
   Last on the centotaph will be the four men lost aboard the
vessel Italian Gold in 1994. Next to last will be the six men lost
aboard the Andrea Gail in a 1991 tragedy that Hollywood has
dramatized in ``The Perfect Storm,'' slated to debut in June.
</P>
<P>
   Gloucester has compiled names of its sea deaths before; a
partial list of losses from 1874 to 1975 is displayed on a mural in
City Hall. But to get all of them, and to get them right, became
Lafata's goal when the former city councilor realized that this
summer would mark the statue's 75th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   ``No more excuses,'' he recalled saying to himself. ``You've got
the time; you've got the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Research began last September when Lafata introduced a few key
players.
</P>
<P>
   He knew that Alan and Mary Ray had been organizing vital records
in the basement of City Hall since 1988, and he knew that Roberta
Sheedy had been working for several years sifting through old
newspaper clippings. Sheedy had planned to flesh out her family
genealogy, but got so drawn into the harrowing fishing stories she
kept running into that she created a Web site, www.downtosea.com,
to sort and display them.
</P>
<P>
   From those stories came a rough tally of who died when, where,
and how. And the tally became the jumping-off point for the Rays
and a dozen other volunteers to check, double check, append, and
cut. Their tools were sources such as burial records, ship logs, US
Customs and Coast Guard archives, church annual reports, and
undertakers' documents.
</P>
<P>
   Sheedy, who works days as a computer technician for a Danvers
fish company, would update her Web site each night with new
findings from the archivists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We quickly developed a working premise: None of us is as smart
as all of us,'' Mary Ray explained as she nudged a reporter's pen
away from a 300-year-old document and replaced it with a pencil.
</P>
<P>
   One could mark each hour in the basement by the momentary
evacuation as archivists disappeared to plug quarters into their
parking meters.
</P>
<P>
   For them, the dusty records helped put faces on the statistics.
Fog and freak storms frequently separated men in dories from the
schooners that had brought them hundreds of miles offshore to fish.
The 1983 saga of Howard Blackburn is famous. the man intentionally
freezing his hands to his oars so he could row with the frozen,
dead body of his partner for five days and 60 miles to shore.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps less well known were the struggles of Sweeny McKenzike
and Charles Coleman, who in 1879 clung so hard to the upturned
bottom of their capsized dory that they left claw marks in the
wood.
</P>
<P>
   Six men died in 1913 when the ocean liner Sagamore sliced
through the schooner Olympia in dense fog. Eight lucky survivors
climbed to the rigging of their sinking vessel in time to jump
aboard the liner.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 21, 1897, the schooner Yosemite ran up on a rock off
Nova Scotia in a blizzard. Nine survivors spent the night clinging
to the rock as waves washed over them. The next day eight of them
afflicted by sundry broken limbs eventually swam more than a mile
to a deserted shore. When rescuers eventually got back to the rock
to collect the dead, one man was fozen so solidly into the cracks
he had to be chipped off.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's most amazing,'' said Sheedy, ``is that time and time
again you find instances where survivors turn right around and go
to sea again.''
</P>
<P>
   The worst year was 1879, when 268 men were lost aboard 15
schooners sunk by storms on Georges Bank. The runner-up was 1883:
17 schooners, 264 men.
</P>
<P>
   From 1860 to 1900, 3,597 men were lost, which is 68 percent of
all the men confirmed lost from Gloucester. This period of heaviest
loss was partly a result of the high number of people fishing at
the time, spurred by an influx of immigrants drawn to the sea and
the growth of railroads able to distribute the product.
</P>
<P>
   But it also had to do with the heightened risks that boat owners
forced the fishermen to accept.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greed,'' replied Joseph Garland, a Gloucester author who has
written several books on the local fishing trade. It was an era
when boat owners purchased a new class of schooner that forfeited
safety for speed and carrying capacity. The shallow, fat hulls were
fast, but water flooding through a carelessly handled vessel could
swamp the schooner, according to Garland.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually a cry for safer design, coupled with the introduction
of auxillary engines, reversed the death curve. Still, fishing
remains, per capita, the nation's most dangerous occupation,
according to federal statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as there's one fish left, someone will risk their life
trying to catch it,'' Garland said.
</P>
<P>
   As if bearing him out, designers of the new Gloucester memorial
have left two columns blank on the last plaque of the last slab of
granite. There will always be, Garland said, ``men that go down to
the sea in ships.''

`FINAL DESTINATION' NEVER ARRIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
FINAL DESTINATION 
Directed by: James Wong 
Screenplay by: Glen Morgan &AMP; James Wong, Jeffrey Reddick 
Satrring: Devon Sawa, Ali Larter, Kerr Smith, Tony Todd, Kristen
Cloke, Seann William Scott, Chad E. Donella, Amanda Detmer, Daniel
Roebuck, Roger Guenver Smith 
Running time: 93 minutes 
Rated: R (violence and terror, and for language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Final Destination'' begins as a better than-average-teen scare
movie. But then, like the exploding 747 that becomes its central
image, it self-destructs. The exercise in would-be teen terror is
launched when Devon Sawa's senior on his way to Paris with his high
school class has a premonition of the plane being blown apart by a
fireball. While the plane is still on the ground at JFK, he freaks,
and is ejected with a handful of other high schoolers and a
teacher. While they're sitting in the terminal, grousing, the
aircraft does explode moments after takeoff. The survivors don't
feel lucky. They feel haunted in this film that isn't likely to be
shown on airplanes carrying the vacationing young.
</P>
<P>
   At least the six surviving teens aren't chased by a
knife-wielding maniac in a mask. Instead, they start dying one by
one as lethal fluids mysteriously appear, as well as live
electrical wires and loose gas connections, making it look as if a
series of household accidents is knocking them off. The
ever-shrinking band of survivors doesn't have to look at the
spooked expression on Sawa's face to arrive at the conclusion that
death itself is coming after them, after having missed them the
first time. Sawa's teen, Alex, figures there's a pattern, and that
they can outwit death. Ali Larter, as the spunky girl who feels
close to him after their narrow escape, is optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they start dying one by one, in various but equally
gruesome ways, and the questions are who'll die next, and how, and
who, if anybody, will be left. ``Final Destination'' also plays to
teen persecution fantasies via a pair of FBI agents who keep
hounding Alex, convinced that he's somehow behind the deaths. But
while the decapitations, electrocutions, and explosions
enthusiastically continue, the film runs out of suspense. The
ongoing carnage is unable to avoid seeming contrived, then campy,
right down to an ending on the streets of Paris that utterly
demolishes any last frisson of terror that ``Final Destination''
might have salvaged. It starts by cheating death and ends by
cheating us.

SPRING CLEANING FOR YOUR COMPUTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Before 1994, I knew a lot about DOS and working
with programs on the microcomputer. Then I lost touch with
technology for a couple of years, and Windows buried DOS. Last
year, I bought a Pentium III with Windows 98, and even with the
instruction book, I feel less informed than I did 15 years ago. How
do I remove unwanted programs and clean up my hard drive? Should I
ignore them? My 6-gigabyte hard drive is already half-full.
</P>
<P>
   _ Waist-Deep
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DEEP: Ahhh, but I see it as half-empty. Imagine all the
unneeded files, program remnants, cached Web files and other
useless garbage you can store on those remaining three gigs!
</P>
<P>
   Think of Windows as a tourist leaving cigarette butts, candy
wrappers, beer cans and used Huggies all over the pristine
landscape of your hard drive. A typical Windows program
installation scatters support files in several directories, so you
can't simply lay waste to a single folder to get rid of all the
litter.
</P>
<P>
   Well-written Windows software registers how to uninstall either
in the Add/Remove Programs utility in the Control Panel or in the
folder it builds in the Programs menu. Using an uninstaller
generally gets rid of most traces of a program, but it can leave
things like shared support files or saved games or data behind.
</P>
<P>
   You can clear a little more space by dumping your temporary
Internet files, but not really enough to make a big difference. You
can also go on a search-and-destroy through every folder on the
drive using Windows Explorer, but don't kill anything you're not
absolutely sure about or you could wind up with a very expensive
paperweight.
</P>
<P>
   Win98 also has a utility that's supposed to automatically dump
useless files. Go to the Programs menu, then Accessories, then
System Utilities and pick Disk Cleanup. Or, you can take the Bombay
scorched-earth approach: My PC gets so bogged down by all the stuff
I download that every six months or so I nuke the drive. Usually I
just reformat and load the essentials _ Office 2000, Unreal
Tournament and my Claudia Schiffer wallpaper _ and I'm ready to
start cluttering things up again.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: You had a column some time back about how to
erase the contents of a hard drive to render them permanently
unreadable. Could you point me to this column?
</P>
<P>
   _ Top Secret
</P>
<P>
   DEAR TOP: Yes, it's over there under the couch. Hmmmm. I see the
mice have been at it. You should have taken better care of it,
because this is the most-asked question I receive. And that only
reinforces my opinion that either (a) everybody in the world is
afflicted with rampant, unfounded paranoia, or (b) we all have
nothing but porn, bootlegged software and incriminating e-mail on
our hard drives.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, nobody's going to dig much deeper than a reformat.
Create a bootable floppy disk with Format.com on it, boot with the
floppy, then type in Format C: /u at the prompt (assuming it's the
C: drive you're killing). Everything goes bye-bye.
</P>
<P>
   If you're still worried that United Nations troops will be able
to decipher your plans for a plutonium generator, get a utility
that overwrites your files with random data. I found several at
www.hotfiles.com by searching for ``wipe.'' Judging by the number
of hits, I guess I was right about the paranoia. Or the porn.
</P>
<P>
   (Dr. Emilio Bombay wouldn't be ashamed for anybody to inspect
the contents of his hard drive, as long as he gets 20 minutes'
advance notice. Reach him at drbombay(at)star-telegram.com

VETERAN COCKBURN CONTINUES TO EVOLVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Musicians rise and fall at a shocking rate today, so few will
ever scale the plateau that Bruce Cockburn just reached. He has
issued his 25th album _ one of the best in a career that has often
placed him outside the mainstream, though he ranks among the
keenest singer-songwriters of his time.
</P>
<P>
   He has been called Canada's Bob Dylan, and there's some truth to
that. Both men are prolific writers, both have a profound social
conscience, and both have a sense of humor that is sometimes
unappreciated but keeps their work from slipping over the line to
pretentiousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I marvel sometimes at how long I've been around,'' says the
Toronto-based Cockburn, whose first album came out in 1970. ``In
commercial terms, I've never set my sights that high. But I try to
keep the music always evolving _ maybe slowly in some people's
eyes, but I continue to learn more and apply it to what I'm
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Cockburn's new album, ``Breakfast in New Orleans, Dinner in
Timbuktu,'' is a gem. The album boasts his biggest radio single,
``Last Night of the World,'' since his political ``If I Had a
Rocket Launcher'' more than a decade ago. The new hit purrs along
with a verse about how ``the radio is playing Superchunk and the
Friends of Dean Martinez'' (yes, Cockburn is a major fan of both
groups) and builds to the climactic line, ``If this was the last
night of the world, what would I do that was different unless it
was champagne with you?''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of sipping champagne at the apocalypse actually came
from singer/songwriter Sam Phillips, who toured with Cockburn in
1992. They talked about the apocalypse one day and she mentioned,
``What do you need for the apocalypse except for champagne and two
glasses?'' As Cockburn says today, ``She forgot she said it, but
the image was too perfect. It stuck with me.''
</P>
<P>
   The new CD includes several backup vocals from friends Lucinda
Williams and Margo Timmins (of the Cowboy Junkies). It features
other standout songs such as the contemplative ``The Embers of
Eden,'' the minor-key ballad ``Isn't That What Friends are For?,''
the meditative instrumental ``Deep Lake'' (Cockburn continues to
impress with his canny folk-jazz guitar style), and a once-common
but now-rare Cockburn political rant in ``Let the Bad Air Out.''
Its central verse: ``Take a walk by Parliament, smells like
something died . . . Open up the window, let the bad air out.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the decrease of politics in his material _ replaced by a
greater focus on love songs _ Cockburn says, ``There are a lot of
issues that I could be writing about, but for them to be turned
into songs, there has to be an emotional flash. Maybe it's from
being years around it, but there's less flash action in the
political arena of late for me. But I try to avoid being
pigeonholed one way or another. That's another reason why I've
probably stayed around as long as I have.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Grant Lee on his own: A few years ago, the alt-rock band Grant
Lee Buffalo made some noise with the albums ``Fuzzy,'' ``Mighty Joe
Moon,'' ``Copperopolis,'' and ``Jubilee,'' plus opened tours for
REM, the Smashing Pumpkins, and Pearl Jam. But that was yesteryear.
``A lot of folks are just finding out today that Grant Lee Buffalo
has reached its final legs,'' says Grant Lee Phillips, the band's
singer and songwriter.
</P>
<P>
   He says the group became ``disillusioned'' with record company
troubles, having moved from Slash Records to Reprise to Warner
Bros., where ``we weren't being told we were dropped, but they
weren't picking up our option, either.''
</P>
<P>
   So Phillips opted to go it alone. He just released a CD of
acoustic songs, ``Ladies' Love Oracle'' (named for an antique
parlor game), which he's selling over the Internet at
www.grantleephillips.com. He'll mix old and new songs at his solo
gig at the Middle East on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Describing his entourage, he says, ``It's just basically my wife
and I and a guitar and too much luggage. . . . But this seems like
a natural step and it's much less complicated than I imagined.''
</P>
<P>
   The new album brings out his softer side, from sweet love song
``Heavenly'' to the more sobering ``Nothin' Is for Sure.'' Some
songs have problems and are wispy attempts to reinvent himself, but
there is promise in the above-named tunes and in the finger-picking
``Lonesome Serenade'' and ``Squint,'' where he sings, ``I'll keep
squinting for something.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, he'll keep squinting on his solo tour, trying to
reconnect with Grant Lee Buffalo fans. ``It's as if I were playing
in my living room,'' says Phillips, who plays guitar and piano each
night. ``At some point, all the Buffalo songs began with me sitting
at a piano or guitar, so this is a full-circle exercise to take it
back to its original inspiration. I'm enjoying the immediacy of
it.''

WELL-CRAFTED TENSION IN `DETERRENCE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
DETERRENCE 
Written and directed by: Rod Lurie 
Starring: Kevin Pollak, Timothy Hutton, Sheryl Lee Ralph 
Running time: 101 minutes 
Rated: R 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's a whopper of an unlikely scenario for the year 2008, in
which the nuclear thriller ``Deterrence'' is set: A certain
Buchanan _ Pat, it would seem _ has become president, but died in
office. Vice President Walter Emerson (Kevin Pollak) has taken over
and is in the midst of a primary campaign against this Trump fella
(the movie was made before The Donald floated his campaign 2000
trial balloon and then dropped it). Emerson is Jewish, our first
Jewish president.
</P>
<P>
   Stop there. Could this happen? Buchanan and a Jewish VP? All
right, keep suspending your belief. Emerson has been stranded by a
blizzard inside a diner in the rural Colorado town of Aztec. He's
with some of his advisers, the military guy who carries the
football (nuclear-code-equipped detonator), a TV camera guy, and a
bunch of locals, some nuts, some not.
</P>
<P>
   President Emerson is seeking shelter from the storm, but a storm
of international proportions awaits him. Saddam Hussein's son is
now running Iraq and bullying its people, and has pulled a
like-father-like-son act on Kuwait. His surprise attack has crushed
the US (or US-backed) troops in his way, and he is sitting pretty
and mean, waving his arms in the air and threatening Israel,
Greece, Turkey _ hey, pretty much the world as we know it.
</P>
<P>
   This warmongering takes place off camera. ``Deterrence,'' a
quickly paced number written and directed by former film critic and
investigative reporter Rod Lurie, is a nuclear thriller in the
guise of a one-act, one-room play. Call it ``The Hunt for Red
October'' Jr. Do you push the button or not push the button? Do you
succomb to the ethnic baiting? Do you want to be responsbile for a
world where only cockroaches and Cher survive? The tension is well
crafted _ the Iraqis' refusal to deal with a Jewish president is a
knotty imbroglio _ and we see Emerson grow in stature and command,
even as he makes decisions furiously questioned by chief of staff
Marshall Thompson (Timothy Hutton) and National Security Adviser
Gayle Redford (Sheryl Lee Ralph). The locals in the diner get to
have their time with the prez and his cohorts too. This ultimate
high-stakes chess _ bluff or strike? live or die? _ escalates until
Emerson must decide to drop the big one on Baghdad or not. If he
does, how does Hussein respond?
</P>
<P>
   ``Deterrence'' is a small-scale movie about a large-scale issue.
The notion that the fate of the earth is decided in this
out-of-the-way diner _ where the dynamics among these disparate and
desperate people fuel the tension _ brings a certain down-home
quality to these high-level bureaucratic decisions. ``Deterrence''
does feel claustrophobic, but it's intended to. It moves quickly;
there's not a lot of down time. There is a palpable
edge-of-the-seat tension and a number of complex ethnic issues that
linger after the movie ends.

CROSSOVERS TAKE A TURN IN HOT MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Is it a car, truck, SUV, or minivan? That was the question
when DaimlerChrysler first introduced the PT Cruiser at the Detroit
Auto Show in January, 1999. Now, we have the answer, well make that
answers.
</P>
<P>
   It's a truck, says DaimlerChrysler. If only all the vehicles now
in production or coming out soon were that easy to categorize. But
as the line between car, truck, sport utility and minivan has
blurred, and the era of crossovers has taken hold, that matter is
further confused by the recent EPA ruling that deems the PT Cruiser
a car. Meanwhile, the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration, which administers the corporate average fuel
economy program (CAFE), says that, for now at least, Chrysler can
call the Cruiser a truck.
</P>
<P>
   It is this ever-changing, vibrant segment of the automotive
industry that is fueling the continued growth in sales and products
being offered by the many manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the X5, BMW's entry into the sport-utility field,
isn't called a sport utility vehicle but, rather, a sports activity
vehicle. BMW wanted a vehicle that would ride and handle like one
of its cars, yet also offer the advantages of a sport utility
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Not too long ago, trucks were basically designed for their
payload and what they could do in a work environment. Pickups were
judged by their cargo bed and how many sheets of 4x8 plywood,
sheetrock, or other goods they could carry.
</P>
<P>
   Pickup trucks gained popularity in the late 1970s as
manufacturers made the trucks more car-like in ride, conveniences,
and features. Then, in the 1990s, along came the sport utility
vehicle _ designed to carry people, go anywhere, do just about
anything, and have a good-sized cargo area.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in this new century, there's a blending of sport utility
and truck to meet the wishes of a new generation of buyers.
</P>
<P>
   There's a good reason for these changes. The truck market is
fast overtaking the car market, with some analysts predicting that,
by 2002, trucks will outsell cars. Trucks already are entrenched at
the top of each year's list of best-selling vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturers see a new generation of buyers coming along.
Ford feels its No. 1 priority is to make all its vehicles
``aspirational to the next generation.'' One Ford executive said,
``You have to make sure the vehicle brands connect emotionally to
the next generation. You cannot just provide technology and
performance, you need to connect emotionally.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford, for example, sold 1.10 million cars and 2.31 million
trucks in 1999. Even with those figures, Ford envisions problems.
For example, its market share for trucks slipped from 29.9 percent
in 1998 to 28.2 percent in 1999. Ford blames some of that slippage
on the company being too slow to retool for new vehicles. It hopes
to regain its market share with the introduction of new models this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Ford is spending more than $1 million surveying buyers of sport
utility vehicles to find out who they are and what they want in an
SUV. They found many with the attitude that ``I can do anything I
want to do.'' So Ford is developing the ``Ford Outfitters. No
Boundaries'' theme for its vehicles and dealerships.
</P>
<P>
   New models coming soon from Ford are the Explorer Sport Trac,
Explorer Sport two-door, and F-150 SuperCrew sport utility pickup.
These vehicles with traditional cargo boxes and sport utility
cabins are aimed at the buyers who like the outdoors environment;
they are models that can go anywhere and carry all sorts of outdoor
gear. The Sport Trac, which is an Explorer with a short bed,
includes a fold-out bed extender, nautical bed cleats for tying
down equipment and mud-proof rubber floor coverings. Its cab has
full-sized room for five passengers. This makes the Sport Trac both
a pickup and an SUV.
</P>
<P>
   Chevrolet is taking the SUV-pickup idea one step farther with
its upcoming Avalanche. This vehicle will compete head-on with the
Ford Sport Trac, but will also offer a sliding door between the
cabin and the cargo bed, which will allow people to haul even
bigger loads with the back seats folded down.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan's new Xterra comes with features such as bike-carrying
racks both inside and outside the vehicle, compartments to stow
muddy boots and outdoor gear, and a boast that it can go anywhere.
Some dealers have even put a premium price on the Xterra, since it
is a hot seller in the current market.
</P>
<P>
   All the manufacturers are rushing to get their new models out.
General Motors originally planned to hold off on new models of its
Chevrolet S10 and GMC Sonoma lines but has decided to rush extended
cab versions for these vehicles into production this summer. Nissan
is hoping to boost sales by bringing out a more macho design of its
Frontier in July.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of these models are being designed to draw in younger
buyers. Toyota's StepSide sport truck is one. ``This StepSide model
was conceived to broaden the appeal of Tacoma by attracting a
significantly younger, more style-conscious buyer,'' said Don
Esmond, general manager of Toyota Motor Sales. To make this model
more attractive, Toyota dropped the base price by almost $1,200 to
$13,750.
</P>
<P>
   The Tacoma compact pickup is an important part of Toyota's
overall truck strategy. Its platform lends itself to new
derivatives. ``The Tacoma StepSide is one such derivative that will
help us attract a younger buyer base. Look for more in the near
future,'' said Esmond.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota, which last year came out with its first full-sized
pickup, the Tundra, now can't keep up with the sales demand. Toyota
is going to increase production at its Indiana plant so that it can
build 300,000 Tundras by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   With the Tundra, Toyota became the first foreign company to
actively compete with American full-sized pickup trucks. In the
2001 model year, it will enter the full-sized sport utility field
with the Sequoia.
</P>
<P>
   For 2000, General Motors completely redesigned its Chevrolet
Tahoe/Suburban and GMC Yukon/Yukon XL (GMC has replaced the
Suburban name with Yukon). Rather than make them larger, as Ford
did with its huge Excursion, GM just made these models better. All
are based on the Silverado pickup platform and have stiffer bodies
for better ride and handling. While the Yukon XL and Suburban may
not be a large as the Ford Excursion, for 2000 they offer more
passenger room than last year.
</P>
<P>
   Early reports on the Chrysler PT Cruiser give it good marks for
performance and people- and cargo-hauling. Road &AMP; Track reports
``While the PT Cruiser definitely stands out in the crowd on
styling, it runs with the pack in performance. The clincher is
interior flexibility.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons DaimlerChrysler puts the truck mark on the
Cruiser, and other manufacturers push small pickups is not for
profit, but for CAFE (Corporate Average Fuel Economy). With
automobiles, the average CAFE requirement is 27.5 miles per gallon
for all the company's makes. For trucks, it is 20.7 miles per
gallon, and since many trucks get poor mileage, selling lots of
small pickups allows makers to meet the CAFE requirements without
being fined while still being able to sell big profitable trucks
with big fuel appetites.
</P>
<P>
   Having the EPA say the PT Cruiser is a car means Chrysler will
have to make some changes for tailpipe emissions standards. Having
the National Highway Safety Administration allow Chrysler to call
it a truck helps the company meet the CAFE standards. One federal
definition of a truck is that it has seats that can be removed for
cargo.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler isn't the first to have this dual ruling. The
Lexus RX 300 is a car by EPA standards, and a truck by NHTSA.
</P>
<P>
   Dodge has upped the ante among the more practical pickup trucks
with the Dodge Dakota Quad Cab. Already the biggest in-class
compact pickup, the new Quad Cab adds four full-sized, front-hinged
doors. The rear doors even open almost 90 degrees for more
convenience. And while Dodge has shortened the bed to 5.25 feet
from the regular Dakota's 6.5 feet, it has added an optional Bed
Extender. This lengthens the bed when needed, and, when it's not in
use, it creates a smaller cargo area to contain loose items that
otherwise might move about the bed. A few years ago, a less than
6-foot bed would not have been considered acceptable or marketable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know how many segments there are in the light truck
category,'' says George Murphy, Ford division general marketing
manager, but we do ``think there are still a few opportunities to
define a segment with a new vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   And there seems to be no end to the ever-growing sport utility
field. This year there are 46 different SUV models on the market
alone, and, by 2005, industry analysts predict more than 70
different models of SUVs will be competing for your dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The next Mitsubishi Montero, due in dealer showrooms this month,
has a totally new design. It gives up its truck frame construction
for the unibody design common on car platforms. This will give the
vehicle a quieter ride. Among new features is a third row of seats
that folds flat into the floor. In earlier models, these seats
folded against the windows and took up cargo space.

   In the small sport utility field, General Motors, with its
Chevrolet Tracker, expects annual sales to reach 500,000 units this
year, up from 440,000 last year. Coming out this year, are the Ford
Escape, Mazda Tribute, Hyundai Santa Fe, and a redesigned Toyota
RAV4. Already in showrooms are the Suzuki Grand Vitara (sister to
the Tracker), Honda CR-V, Jeep Wrangler, Subaru Forester, and Kia
Sportage.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Brooks, Tracker brand manager, sees sales of the new
model, with an optional 155-horsepower V-6 engine and new trim
packages, increasing by 25 percent and predicts a potential market
for small SUVs of 1 million units in three to four years.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the confusion as to what constitutes a sport utility
are the new breed of models, exemplified by the BMW X5 and the
Lexus RX 300, neither of which looks like your typical SUV. In
these days of high gasoline prices, one compelling reason to look
at one of these is fuel economy. The Lexus RX 300 with 4WD has an
EPA rating of 19 mpg in the city, and 22 mpg on the highway. The
BMW X5 gets 13 mpg in the city and 17 on the highway.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors will soon be introducing its versions of this new
breed of SUVs with the Pontiac Aztec and Buick Rendezvous. GM,
which recently took full ownership of Saab, said it plans to
produce a Saab sport-ute based on the Rendezvous platform.

</P>

   For more than a year, pundits have grossly underestimated Al
Gore's prospects of winning the presidency. No matter what you
think of him or how small a role you think he has played, Gore has
the best material arguments any virtual incumbent could hope for:
eight years of relative peace and unprecedented prosperity, lower
crime rates, and other achievements. Republicans would kill to have
that record. And they have no real hope of beating Gore unless an
issue emerges that threatens the current prosperity and can be
linked to the vice president. Now they may have such an issue:
rising gas prices.

manifest destiny. Los Angeles was ready to overtake the East Coast.
Now, though, Los Angeles is being recolonized by the same uncouth
prairie-dwellers who populated it in the early part of the 20th
century. The Rust Belt has purchased Times-Mirror! Even in an age
when newspapers don't have the clout they once did, that stings.

A VIGOROUS, MODERNIST TAKE ON `MARY STUART' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ED SIEGEL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
MARY STUART 
Play in five acts by Friedrich Schiller. Translated by Michael
Feingold. 
Directed by Carey Perloff. Set, Ralph Funicello. Lights, Peter
Maradudin. Costumes, Deborah Dryden. Lighting, Peter Maradudin.
Music, David Lang. Sound, Garth Hemphill. Produced by the
Huntington Theatre Company with the American Conservatory Theater. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Peter Altman gave some thought to staging one of Tom Stoppard's
later plays, ``India Ink'' or ``The Invention of Love,'' in his
final season. The problem was that the logical person to direct was
Carey Perloff, who had staged their premieres at San Francisco's
American Conservatory Theater, where she is artistic director, and
Altman was already sold on another production he had seen her do,
``Mary Stuart,'' Friedrich Schiller's turn-of-the-19th-century play
about those killer queens, Elizabeth I of England and Mary, Queen
of Scots.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to see why Altman, producing director of the
Huntington Theatre Company, went with ``Mary Stuart.'' Perloff and
translator Michael Feingold have fashioned a knockout of a
production that, like the best of classical drama, feels rooted in
its origins while resonating with the political and personal issues
of the day. That is what makes it a classic, as one character says
in ``Art.'' If Perloff and Feingold have sacrificed Schiller's
heroic idealism for a more modernist spin, then at least the
production makes its case with such vigor that it's hard to object.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mary Stuart'' bristles with psychological tension in every
character, and the ACT production team makes the three hours seem
shorter than plays half its length. Ralph Funicello's movable
columns create diverse claustrophobic sets indoors and out while
Peter Maradudin's lighting, David Lang's music, and Garth
Hemphill's sound are both nuanced and dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   It's the clash of personalities, of course, where ``Mary
Stuart'' lives and dies (literally). But it isn't Mary who carries
the play, or at least this production. It's Caroline Lagerfelt's
Elizabeth who commands the stage as well as the kingdom. Lagerfelt
makes Elizabeth's doubts, confidences, vanities, and compromises
play off one another with a Shakespearean agility until her final
cruelties leave her in a realpolitik prison of her own. Lagerfelt's
performance compares with Judith Light's in ``Wit'' as the best by
an actress in Boston this season.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth's skills as a survivor are matched by Marco
Barricelli's Machiavellian Leicester. In love with Mary but
determined to stay in Elizabeth's good graces, he can change
stories faster than you can say, ``I did not have sexual relations
with that woman.'' Richard Ziman matches him as Burleigh, his
political rival, but Firdous Bamji's Mortimer is no more admirable
as Mary's, and Catholicism's, fanatical standard-bearer. It's left
to Richard Ooms's Shrewsbury to find a semblance of a moral center
amid the wreckage, although much of the strength of this production
and its fine cast is to explore an inner logic amid all the noble
knavery. Would we have acted any differently in their places, been
any less moved by flattery and any less motivated by fear?
</P>
<P>
   And what of Mary amid all this double dealing? She is less
admirable than Elizabeth through most of the play, a vain and
vengeful power seeker, despite a radiance that draws people to her.
Schiller meant for the part to be played melodramatically, but Rene
Augesen overdoes it with an off-putting tremulousness that is out
of character with the rest of the production. As a result, her
religious freedom at the end is less the spiritual breakthrough
Schiller intended as a moral guidepost for the audience than one
more act of desperation among many.
</P>
<P>
   Or have modern audiences become too cynical of power and its use
of religion to accept such transcendence, no matter how it's
played? However one interprets it, this ``Mary Stuart'' does work
on its own sublime merits of political inevitability.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the relationships that Altman has built, perhaps the two
most important are with August Wilson, whose ``King Hedley II''
ends Altman's tenure in May, and with Perloff. Let's hope new
artistic director Nicholas Martin maintains them. ``Mary Stuart''
whets the appetite for Stoppard's ``India Ink'' and ``Invention of
Love'' all the more.

`GHOST' SHOWS ONLY A FEW SIGNS OF LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
GHOST DOG 
Written and directed by: Jim Jarmusch 
Starring: Forest Whitaker, John Tormey, Cliff Gorman, Henry Silva,
Isaach De Bankole, Camille Winbush, Victor Argo, Tricia Vessey,
Gene Ruffini 
Running time: 114 minutes 
Rated: R (strong violence and language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It can at least be said that Jim Jarmusch's ``Ghost Dog''
represents a partial return to vitality from the nadir of ``Dead
Man.'' The latter was more than flat; it approached absolute zero,
the point at which molecular motion ceases. ``Ghost Dog'' is best
when it's playful, toying with the fact that the Mafia has in a
single generation been transmogrified from myth to joke. But it
leaves largely unexplored its biggest asset, namely Forest
Whitaker's implacable, inscrutable hit man, Ghost Dog, living an
ascetic life on the roof of an abandoned building, alone except for
a coop full of pigeons and a Shinto shrine. Disciplined, adept, he
slides through the night, an unstoppable killing machine of
arresting stillness.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Jarmusch would have us believe, a principled killing
machine. The film is punctuated by title cards from the
18th-century samurai manual known as the ``Hagakure.'' Ghost Dog
lives by its precepts, although the frequent punctuation of the
action by the ``Hagakure'' excerpts stops being merely irritating
and starts seeming pretentious. What saves ``Ghost Dog'' from
degenerating into a sentimental attempt to put a gloss of nobility
on essentially psychotic behavior is Whitaker's soft gravity and
all-around grace in the title role. He's a figure of mournful
dignity and doomed integrity, but ultimately an inverted white
version of the subjugated black men who have gained so much favor
with the Academy of Motion Picture Arts &AMP; Sciences in ``The Green
Mile'' and ``Hurricane.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ghost Dog'' shows us a potent black man, but one bent on
abnegation. That's because in the story, Ghost Dog has interpreted
the samurai code to mean that he owes his allegiance and his life
to a low-level mobster who years ago saved him from a bunch of
murderous white thugs. The joke is that Ghost Dog is more skilled
and more dignified than John Tormey's designated master, a
none-too-respected soldier in a mob family that's coming apart at
the seams. So toothless has the family become that it is being
bounced from its clubhouse for nonpayment of rent by a landlord
obviously unafraid of consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath Jarmusch's characteristic deadpan surfaces, ``Ghost
Dog'' is sentimental through and through, although not where the
pigeons are concerned. Ghost Dog uses them to communicate with his
clients, including the one he has sworn to serve. Their respective
dying cultures intersect when Ghost Dog is given an assignment to
kill a made man who has had the poor judgment to become sexually
involved with the don's daughter. The assignment is child's play to
Ghost Dog. However, the daughter not only sees him, but gives him
the copy of ``Rashomon'' she was reading between watching Betty
Boop cartoons on TV. As Henry Silva's almost but not quite
brain-dead godfather sees it, that means Ghost Dog must in turn be
killed.
</P>
<P>
   Silva's performance is slyly involving in a reptilean way. You
think he's out of it, unable even to comprehend the violent
cartoons he too stares at unblinkingly on TV. Then he'll flicker to
life and croak a malignant command. Jarmusch has fun playing the
film's violence against TV cartoon versions of violence. The
problem is that they eventually become interchangeable as Ghost Dog
singlehandedly takes on the dysfunctional Mafia family. ``Ghost
Dog'' isn't the first film to transpose Pierre Melville's memorable
Parisian hit man movie, ``Le Samourai'' (1967). But something gets
lost along the way as ``Ghost Dog'' works at establishing its
gangsta bona fides by pulsating to a score by The RZA of The
Wu-Tang Clan. To back up a generation, and paraphrase Thelonious
Monk, the hip-hop score, and the movie, have beauty, but no smack.
</P>
<P>
   Things grow more devitalized with the introduction of a
sentimental friendship Ghost Dog strikes up with Isaach de
Bankole's ice cream vendor and Camille Winbush's icon of purity, an
adolescent girl Ghost Dog meets in a park and to whom he passes the
copy of ``Rashomon.'' But there's no real sense of passing along a
code, or a tradition. Good thing, because Ghost Dog's
interpretation of the samurai code results in just one more black
man's death after a lifetime of service to an unworthy white lord.
He can accommodate Jarmusch's laconic irony. But not his cultural
perch. ``Ghost Dog'' thinks it's hip. But it's only a hipper
version of the black subjugation that today's hipsters deride in
mainstream movies. Ghost Dog is given the moves of an outlaw, but
not the soul of one. His veneer of dignity and spirituality is just
another gloss on self-perpetuating slavery.

   Roberts puts it all together in ``Erin Brockovich,'' reminding
us what star power can do when it's hitched to the right material.
Roberts is a big personality, ``Erin Brockovich'' is a big story,
and Hollywood bigness is a perfect delivery system for them.
Roberts has been looking for something more substantial since
becoming the queen of romantic comedy. ``Erin Brockovich'' gives
her the dramatic and emotional depth she's been trying to
regenerate ever since ``Steel Magnolias'' _ which it surpasses in
every way.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts could hardly go wrong in this fact-based story of a
single mom who empowered herself when nobody else wanted to, went
to bat for a townful of people clobbered by a large corporation,
and fought a spectacular David-and-Goliath legal battle against
Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric on behalf of the residents of a California
desert town it had poisoned with toxic waste, then lied to in a
cover-up attempt.
</P>
<P>
   If this is starting to sound like ``A Civil Action,'' but with a
much sexier protagonist, it is. From start to finish, Roberts's
warmth and energy pour off the screen in this film, which is boldly
contoured enough to accommodate her outsize persona. Tapping
brilliantly into her high-strung maverick side, Roberts really
makes this film stand up and march, or, rather, totter fearlessly
ahead on 8-inch heels. Never has she filled a role with so much
fire and conviction. Utilizing fashion advice from the best
possible source _ the real Erin Brockovich (who can be seen as a
waitress in a cameo) _ Roberts's Erin assertively plays the sex
card, dressing in miniskirts and low-cut jerseys that help her talk
her way past reluctant record-keepers in dusty municipal archives.
But the strength of Roberts's commitment and the unstoppability of
Erin's moral outrage count for a lot more here.
</P>
<P>
   Erin's earthiness is amplified by her salty talk, which
sometimes makes her reluctant-lawyer partner squirm. As played by
Albert Finney, he's a gruff softie who's experienced enough and
shrewd enough to let Erin run her mouth after he realizes that her
genuineness gets people to open up to her in ways they won't to
other lawyers. Erin pushes her way into a job as a law office clerk
after the lawyer, Finney's Ed Masry, loses a personal injury case
brought on her behalf. When looking over documents related to real
estate sales in a small Mojave Desert town, she wonders why a lot
of medical records are mixed in with them, and notices that a lot
of the people involved had become seriously ill. After driving
there and investigating, she suspects that the giant utility that
accounts for most of the economic activity there is behind it.
</P>
<P>
   As she doggedly and unswervingly keeps digging, and wins the
confidence of blue-collar townspeople who see her as one of them,
her suspicions deepen. But pointing a finger at a giant utility
with deep pockets and taking it to court are two different matters.
And Erin has battles on several fronts. She's got to prod the
lawyer, who had been entertaining visions of retiring to Palm
Springs to play golf, to stay on the job and go with her unorthodox
procedures. So good a foil is Finney, so expert at seeming barely
able to avoid total domination by Erin, that when he asks her how
she got copies of certain documents, and she flashes her cleavage
and says, ``They're called boobs, Ed,'' we wince with him. Finney
inscribes a number of little grace notes that further humanize the
film. But there's a lot of easy-to-overlook work from others, too.
</P>
<P>
   Erin finds another indispensable ally to solve the problem of
day care for her two young children _ Aaron Eckhart's next-door
neighbor, who's willing to switch from being a biker to being Mr.
Mom. Not that there aren't a few ruffled feathers to be smoothed
out on the home front. But you know, and don't really mind, that
the decks are being cleared for Erin's showdown with the bullying
utility on behalf of people who have been ingesting chromium
flowing out of the company's power plant and being told it's good
for them. As the most prominent of the poisoned, Marg
Helgenberger's delicate soul, who wears dresses with little
flowered prints, and Cherry Jones's angry neighbor are
heartbreaking in their modesty and decency. Their niceness had been
making them victims, as Erin realizes when she asks Helgenberger's
longtime resident why she didn't make some noise. ``I didn't want
to be a pain in the butt,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Director Steven Soderbergh, screenwriter Susannah Grant, and
cinematographer Ed Lachmann resourcefully and imaginatively put the
right kind of environment around Erin and the others. Shrewdly,
courtroom confronatations _ and the cliches that go with them _ are
minimized. Repeatedly, Soderbergh finds ways to yank the film away
from the deadening juggernaut of formula. When the legal verdict
comes, for instance, it is played out quietly and on an intimate
scale. With this script, Grant becomes Hollywood's foremost writer
of strong, smart women's roles, and Lachmann works the same wonders
with the atomizing light of Southern California that he did in
Soderbergh's ``The Limey.'' Roberts and ``Erin Brockovich'' have
Oscar contender written all over them. She made ``Notting Hill''
work by incorporating her star persona into the film's antics.
``Erin Brockovich'' taps into passions of hers that we haven't seen
before. She's dynamite.

`BEYOND THE MAT' GIVES WRESTLING A HUMAN FACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
BEYOND THE MAT 
Documentary directed by: Barry W. Blaustein 
Running time: 102 minutes 
Rated: R (language and violent content) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nobody can say that Barry Blaustein's wrestling documentary,
``Beyond the Mat,'' isn't a zeitgeist movie. Like Las Vegas,
wrestling has retooled its image, attached bells and whistles and
glitz to its grunts and thuds, and presto! After helping TV get
started in its early days, wrestling now is resuscitating networks
like UPN, to say nothing of serving as a talent pool for future
governors. It has become a multimillion-dollar merger of violence
and showbiz. In ``Beyond the Mat,'' wrestling gets in America's
face and Blaustein gets in wrestling's face. It's a fascinating
tango.
</P>
<P>
   Blaustein, who says upfront that he's a fan for reasons he can't
explain, spent two years, from 1996 to 1998, aiming his camera at
big-time and small-time wrestling. The former is personified by the
spectacle-oriented World Wrestling Federation. It's headed by
muscular Vince McMahon, representing the fourth generation of the
WWF's founding family. McMahon, a revved-up muscular type, is in
love with the hype he eats, sleeps, and breathes. On one occasion,
we see him climbing into the ring to compete. On another, we see
him auditioning former NFL player Darren Drozdov. When McMahon
learns that Drozdov can regurgitate at will, he assigns him the
stage name Puke.
</P>
<P>
   Blaustein contrasts the WWF with the downmarket Bay Area All-Pro
Wrestling Group, two of whose sweating wannabes actually audition
for the WWF and all of whom are masterminded by the club's owner,
Roland Alexander. To his credit, Alexander tells his wrestlers that
they probably won't make much money. But Blaustein, a screenwriter
who began on ``Saturday Night Live'' and has fashioned material for
Eddie Murphy, knows enough to humanize his subject. He tracks at
length three wrestlers with differing but equally valid claims on
our attention: Terry Funk, Mike Foley, and Jake Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Funk is the most amazing. Winner of the Extreme Championship
Wrestling belt in 1997 at the age of 53, Funk is a battered Texan
whose right knee and various other body parts are shot, and who
keeps on retiring, only to keep coming back. He embodies the aging
gunslinger ethic, looking tough and durable in the ring and seeming
a pussycat outside it. A dignified figure, he nevertheless cries at
his daughter's wedding. And when a fellow wrestler and less
successful longtime friend from Texas confronts him, he gets the
guy a gig refereeing one of his matches. The gladiator's scars he
carries with macho pride attest to the bedrock fact that while
wrestling matches may be fixed, the pain and injuries are real.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Foley, a bearded giant nicknamed ``Mankind,'' seems to make
his living by absorbing enormous amounts of punishment. Off camera,
he's a soft-spoken family man who demonstrates great affection for
his kids, if not always great judgment. The film's most
uncomfortable moment comes when Foley's kids are taken to a match
in Anaheim by their mom, Collette, and clearly are traumatized by
the sight of their dad being pounded into a bloody pulp. Later,
healed and at home in Florida, Foley is shown that ringside footage
and is appropriately guilt-stricken about having permitted his wife
and kids to attend.
</P>
<P>
   Jake Roberts, nicknamed ``The Snake'' for his gimmick of
unnerving rivals by bringing a large reptile into the ring with
him, personifies the athlete who is fine inside the ring and a mess
outside it. Hobbled by alcohol and drug addiction, and an
emotionally stingy father, Roberts is barely hanging on. Blaustein
accompanies him through a Midwestern barnstorming tour, where the
sadness and anguish in his face are captured during long drives
between bouts. The only time he feels fear during the tour, he
says, is when he's due to meet, for the first time in years, the
estranged grown daughter he hadn't seen since his marriage fell
apart. It's a difficult meeting for both, with plenty of naked
emotional pain to go with the routine physical pain inside the
ring. ``Beyond the Mat'' does what the wrestling game, with its
manufactured personas, doesn't. It stays with the wrestlers until
we start seeing them as people.

MATTHIESSEN'S `TIGERS' BURNS BRIGHTLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By VICKI CROKE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
TIGERS IN THE SNOW 
By Peter Matthiessen 
North Point Press, 174 pp., $27 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a surefire pairing: Peter Matthiessen, an author who leans
toward the poetic, writing about tigers, animals that are the
essence of poetry themselves. Further, ``Tigers in the Snow'' is a
handsome volume that includes maps, historic artwork, and photos.
</P>
<P>
   The story is built around Matthiessen's two visits with the
American and Russian scientists running the Siberian Tiger Project.
In a world in which there are more Siberian tigers in captivity
than out on the taiga, this band of maverick scientists has had to
cobble a big plan. First, a huge challenge: getting to know these
cats intimately _ how they hunt, what they eat, when they mate, how
far they travel _ without disturbing them. And then another
enormous goal: to preserve as much tiger habitat as possible to
sustain a viable wild population large enough to avoid problems
such as inbreeding and to withstand others such as occasional
poaching.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the numbing cold (temperatures that routinely reach 40
below), the lack of personnel and equipment, and the challenge of
trying to track these elusive animals without disturbing them, the
program is working. In the Sikhote-Alin Reserve, a national park
the size of Yosemite, 300 miles northeast of Vladivostok, Siberian
tigers are on the rebound. While there were only 50 tigers there in
1936, the latest census in 1996 showed a population of 450.
</P>
<P>
   To give all this work context, Matthiessen provides an overview
of the state of tigers around the world. At the turn of the
century, there were something like 100,000; today, that figure is
4,600 to 7,700. Matthiessen's lively primer includes all tiger
subspecies, from recently lost races to those that are on the
brink, to those we may be optimistic about _ Javan, Bali, Caspian,
South China, Siberian, Indian, and Indochinese.
</P>
<P>
   Tigers were nearly wiped out in China where, under Mao Tse-tung
in 1959, they were declared ``an enemy of man,'' and targeted for
eradication. In India, at the same time, Indira Gandhi sponsored an
active conservation program to save them. Still, they are under
great threat.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, what had been perceived as a victory for tiger
conservationists in the late '80s and early '90s turns out to have
been merely a hiatus on poaching due to large secret stockpiles of
tiger parts, which are used in traditional Asian folk medicines.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, with its desperate economy, there is continued
poaching and, worse, the loss of habitat due to logging rights sold
to other countries. Matthiessen reports that the country is
``selling off the future of Siberia at bargain rates.''
</P>
<P>
   While time is short, the questions about an animal that one
might have assumed was well known are surprisingly large.
</P>
<P>
   Are tigers really solitary? One expert isn't so sure it's their
nature. He believes that habitat degradation, with the loss of prey
animals, forces tigers to spread out. And prey densities vary in
different countries. A male Siberian tiger who eats 10 pounds of
meat a day requires 150 square miles for adequate hunting, while an
Indian tiger in Chitwan needs only eight square miles.
</P>
<P>
   Matthiessen also must cover a lot of ground on the status of
tigers around the world before he gets to what he does best: giving
you a ticket to the seat right next to him as he explores foreign
lands and nimbly negotiates complicated matters.
</P>
<P>
   The real joy of the book begins far in, as the author wings
toward his destination. ``The sun set at last over Manchuria, and
the deep blue of the wild horizon was fired by a dragon light of
crimson. To the east, where night had fallen over the Japan Sea,
Orion rode on a clear void of black sky.'' If you've read other
nature tales by Matthiessen such as ``The Snow Leopard'' or
``African Silences,'' you'll think, ``Now he's getting warmed up!''
</P>
<P>
   But Matthiessen here never quite ignites with that combustible
combination of evocative prose and deep understanding of all things
natural. He doesn't seem as engaged as in his best work. My guess
is that he just didn't get enough time on the ground to do so. But
most fans of his work will agree that even a low-key Matthiessen is
a fine read.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, we learn that actually sighting Siberian tigers is
a rare event for those who study them. Most carnivore researchers
must puzzle out a great deal of their subjects' lives through
footprints and feces. Matthiessen spins even these simple signs
into elegant stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the river ice, most of the snow had been taken by the wind,
and the pugmarks were crisp, as if incised in steel. In one place
the tigress had lain down and stretched, leaving behind a ghostly
outline of the True Spirit of the Mountains, even to the big head
and long tail, the leg crook, the big floppy paws. All that was
missing was the stripes.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthiessen seems to be missing his stripes a bit, too, with
``Tigers in the Snow.'' But nonetheless, where writing about
animals is concerned, he is still one powerful cat.

WHAT YOU WANT DETERMINES THE RIGHT SPORT UTILITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They're the hottest vehicles in the marketplace, and, while
sales of SUVs reportedly are a little soft right now, that's not
stopping manufacturers from introducing even more models. About the
only companies that haven't produced an SUV are Volkswagen and
Porsche _ and both are about to enter the market.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with sport utilities is deciding what an SUV means
to you. Is an SUV a monstrous Ford Excursion or a Suzuki Grand
Vitara or perhaps a Jeep Grand Cherokee? Even the manufacturers
don't help: the new BMW X5 is called a sport activity vehicle by
its maker.
</P>
<P>
   During the winter months, SUVs are particularly attractive.
Their four-wheel-drive capabilities, coupled with their greater
road clearances, enable them to handle whatever snowstorms Mother
Nature tosses our way better than regular cars.
</P>
<P>
   The new BMW X5 was the clear winner in a recent test of vehicles
by the New England Motor Press Association. For the first time in
its three-year history of evaluating winter vehicles, the NEMPA
members' selection was unanimous.
</P>
<P>
   NEMPA jurists especially liked the way the BMW blended real
world off-road capability with some of the best creature comforts,
yet retained the intrinsic fit, feel, and finish of the marque in a
totally new vehicle. Among comments by members were ``BMW X5 _ a
great mix of sedan and SUV''. . .``a 5-Series with a better seating
position and as much fun to drive as any of BMW's cars,''. . . and
``clearly a winter techno-achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   Pretty high praise, but at a price of $51,000-plus, this vehicle
isn't for everyone. Which is why there's such a wide selection of
SUV types out there. Shoppers will find models from the Kia
Sportage with a list price of $14,445 on up to a Range Rover at
around $60,000.
</P>
<P>
   New this year is the Ford Excursion, the biggest SUV yet; it can
easily carry nine passengers. It's so big that it won't fit in most
garages, yet sales are doing quite well. Giving it a run for the
money are the newly redesigned Chevrolet Suburban and GMC Yukon
(formerly the Suburban), until now the largest SUVs. The newly
redone GM models are stiffer, quieter, more comfortable and more
powerful than earlier versions.
</P>
<P>
   The Nissan Xterra is also new with a price range of $17,300 to
$25,500. This is a vehicle designed definitely for the young,
active lifestyle. If you're looking for hot rod performance in an
already great SUV, the Mercedes-Benz ML55 is the one to have. It
can do 150 miles per hour, handle corners, and still handle the
utility of an SUV.
</P>
<P>
   Also new this year is a revamped Infiniti QX4. The 2001 model,
which has just been introduced to the market, offers more power, is
stronger, quieter and luxurious.
</P>
<P>
   In checking out SUVs, it's best to remember that not all are
created equal. Some are designed for off-road use while others are
for highway driving. Some have full-time all-wheel drive while
others offer a choice of two- or four-wheel drive.
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking at cargo capacities, some can handle just
about everything you toss at them, others can't handle any more
cargo than a regular sedan.
</P>
<P>
   The safety issue is a major concern. SUVs can, and have, rolled
over. Those warning stickers inside SUVs are there for a good
reason. Because of their relatively high center of gravity, SUVs
don't hold the road like automobiles, which are lower and closer to
the surface. For this reason, taking a sharp turn to avoid
something or going fast around a corner can cause an SUV to roll
over.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest danger in owning an SUV is overconfidence _
the attitude that these vehicles can go anywhere, do anything.
Drivers need to drive these vehicles with care.
</P>
<P>
   Other sport utility winners in the New England Motor Press
Association's winter vehicle test were the Toyota Land Cruiser,
which tied with the Range Rover 4.6 HSE in the full-sized category;
the Lexus RX300 in the compact class and the Nissan Xterra in the
mini-SUV class.
</P>
<P>
   Not all winners were SUVs, which proves you can have a winter
vehicle with all-wheel-drive without going the SUV route. In the
all-wheel-drive class winners were the Audi A8 sedan; the Volvo V70
XC in the wagon class; and the Porsche C4 in coupe. The best people
mover was the Chrysler Town &AMP; Country Lxi all-wheel-drive minivan,
and the Subaru Outback received the value award.
</P>
<P>
   Winner of the pickup class was the Toyota Tundra. The Ford
Excursion received the extreme vehicle award.

LEASE OR BUY? A LOT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU'LL USE THE TRUCK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To buy or to lease: that is the question consumers must consider
before they're ready to acquire a new vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to trucks or sport utility vehicles, it may appear
that leasing is a better deal. But depending on how you will use
the vehicle, leasing could be a costly mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Leasing a vehicle does offer an attractive monthly payment with
no down payment usually required. These factors would seem to make
leasing a better option than buying, which normally requires both a
down payment and a higher monthly payment.
</P>
<P>
   With leasing, however, you never do own the vehicle. And therein
lies the problem. Two of the predetermined conditions of a leased
vehicle are that there is a set number of miles allowed (go over
that limit and you pay for each and every mile) and the vehicle
must be returned in good condition.
</P>
<P>
   With a truck or SUV, especially the new breed that mixes the two
types of vehicles, chances are you'll be enjoying it so much,
you'll go over the stated mileage limit. And that could be very
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Also, it's likely you will abuse the truck or SUV more than you
would if you owned a car. That situation could be expensive when it
comes to turning in the vehicle. Jack Gillis, a noted consumer
advocate and author of ``The Ultimate Car Book'', notes ``when it
comes time to turn in the car, it has to be in top shape _
otherwise, you'll have to pay for repairs or body work.''
</P>
<P>
   Comparing leasing vs.buying, Gillis warns consumers: ``Don't be
deceived _ in general, leasing costs more than buying outright or
financing. When you pay cash or finance a car, you own an asset;
leasing leaves you with all the headaches and responsibilities of
ownership with none of the benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   As an example, Gillis provides the overall cost of leasing and
financing a vehicle with a price tag of $22,000 over three and six
years. Gillis says holding the vehicle for three years, leasing has
an overall cost of $12,941.64 while financing costs $11,879.83. If
you hold the vehicle for six years, the cost of the lease jumps to
$25,883.28 while the price of ownership jumps only to $15,898.51
</P>
<P>
   Gillis says the example used for leasing has a residual value
(the value of the vehicle at the end of the lease) of about 54
percent after three years and 36 percent after six years. Few
vehicles have a 54 percent value after three years, so, should you
still wish to lease, it is wise to check a current Blue Book of
residual values to see what the future value of the vehicle in
question will be.
</P>
<P>
   If leasing still appeals, Gillis offers a few tips:
</P>
<P>
   --Find out the annual mileage limit. Don't accept a contract
with a lower limit than you need.
</P>
<P>
   --Avoid ``capitalized cost reductions'' where you are asked to
essentially put up a down payment to lower monthly costs.
</P>
<P>
   --Ask about early termination fees. Between 40 and 60 percent of
four-year leases terminate early.
</P>
<P>
   --Retain your option to buy the car at the end of the lease at a
predetermined price.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ultimate Car Book 2000'' is filled with good advice for
anyone considering buying any vehicle.

   WASHINGTON _ For a president driven by a quest for policy
remedies to the world's most intractable problems, the Indian
subcontinent always seemed inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, it's begun to look like an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   When President Clinton arrives Sunday in New Dehli, becoming the
first president to visit the region in 22 years, he faces a clear
and daunting challenge: to try to defuse mounting tensions between
India and Pakistan, before crisis escalates into catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   Two years after the uneasy neighbors declared themselves the
world's newest nuclear powers, tensions between India and Pakistan
are at a 30-year high.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides are engaged in almost daily skirmishes over the
disputed territory of Kashmir. Neither side is talking to the
other. And the risk of a miscalculation that could trigger a
nuclear exchange hangs like the sword of Damocles over the region.
</P>
<P>
   India and Pakistan have already fought three wars over Kashmir,
a territory that fell through the geopolitical cracks when the
British partitioned the subcontinent into Muslim Pakistan and Hindu
India half a century ago. Fighting just last summer left more than
1,000 dead.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Pakistan's deeply flawed but democratically elected
prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, has been overthrown by a military
dictator, chief Army Gen. Pervez Musharraf. He quickly set about
the normal business of setting up a junta: forcing chief justices
to swear their allegiance to him, placing Sharif under house arrest
and threatening unfriendly journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Sober analysts don't lightly raise the specter of atomic
Armageddon in a region that takes in one-fifth of the world's
population and abuts China, the Middle East and the southern edge
of the former Soviet Union. Experts say, though, they can't rule
out the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this very, very dicey period, where the stakes are high,
where tensions are rising, and in the face of a nuclear world, the
situation becomes extremely dangerous,'' former U.S. Ambassador to
India, Frank Wisner, said this week in an Asia Society briefing.
``Quiet diplomacy is extremely important.''
</P>
<P>
   Diplomacy is non-existent at the moment between Musharraf's
junta and the government of Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee. Even back channels have iced over, replaced, analysts
say, with a chilling sense of fatalism in New Dehli and Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S.-Soviet relationship, at its worst point in the Cold
War, had greater interaction than India and Pakistan do now,'' said
Richard Haas, director of foreign policy studies at the Brookings
Institution, a Washington think tank. ``That is simply, I think, an
unacceptable situation, given the stakes, given the history of
conflict, and given the fact that now you have a nuclear overlay on
top of the entire Indo-Pakistani relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   It is precisely because of those concerns, Clinton's foreign
policy aides say, that the president plans to visit Pakistan next
weekend, after a week-long swing through India and neighboring
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
   It's a sign of how high the regional stakes have become, in
fact, that Clinton plans to pay a visit to Musharraf, whose coup
last October flew in the face of Clinton's efforts to promote
democracy around the world and risks sending a troubling signal to
fragile democracies in places like Indonesia and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``In no way is this a decision to endorse the military coup or
government led by Gen. Musharraf, and no one should interpret it as
such,'' Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said in a speech here
last week(CQ). ``We are going to Pakistan because the United States
has interests there which are important and urgent.''
</P>
<P>
   Rarely has the White House applied either word to the Indian
subcontinent. No president has been there, after all, since Jimmy
Carter visited India in 1978. Richard Nixon was the last American
president to visit Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has offered to mediate the Kashmir dispute, a proposal
that Pakistan supports.
</P>
<P>
   India, though, has made clear that it wants no part in a
U.S.-brokered peace process. That, Vajpayee's government worries,
would risk placing Pakistan, a nation of 135 million people, 97
percent of whom are Muslim, on equal footing with India, a nation
of 1 billion, 82 percent of whom are Hindus.
</P>
<P>
   Expectations for Clinton are not high on this score. It's no
secret that he's got 10 months left in office _ seven until
November elections make him officially a lame duck. And the Kashmir
issue suffers from complexity as well as neglect by the world
community.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say, though, it would be a significant step forward if
Clinton can get the two neighbors to recognize that they can't
change geography, that they must resolve the Kashmir issue, first
by talking to each other about it.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of Clinton's week-long swing will be focused on
geopolitics.
</P>
<P>
   After spending Sunday night resting in Dehli, Clinton begins the
official portion of his trip Monday, spending the day in
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
   A country where per capita income is less than $1 a day,
Bangladesh is ground zero for the global war on poverty. It was
there that a young economics professor named Mohammmad Yunus forged
the concept of lending small amounts of money, in increments of $50
or $100 or so, to the poor. He later institutionalized the practice
with his revolutionary Grameen Bank, the symbol for the
micro-credit movement that's since become a mainstay of the world
development establishment
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's day in Dhaka, where he will become the first American
president ever to visit the 19-year-old state, is built around a
visit to a nearby village to spotlight the Grameen movement, as
well as health and education projects that work in concert with
micro-credits to help promote empowerment for women and progress
for their families.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add begins.)
</P>
<P>
   Returning to New Delhi late Monday, Clinton begins his state
visit to India the next day, meeting with Prime Minister Vajpayee,
and attending a state dinner in his honor hosted by President
Kocheril Raman Narayanan.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday Clinton addresses the Indian Parliament, then goes
to nearby Agra to tour the Taj Mahal, the most famous work of
Islamic architecture in the world.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of Clinton's trip will be the contrasts and
contradictions inherent in India, the world's most populous
democracy and home to one-sixth of all humankind , more than half
of whom are among the poorest anywhere on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will pay tribute, for example, to the father of Indian
independence, Mahatma Gandhi, and the profound impact that his
doctrine of non-violent protest had on the seminal political force
of Clinton's own career: the American civil rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will travel to the burgeoning high-tech center of
Hyderabad to stress the growing technology base helping to fuel an
economic expansion in India, which is projected to grow by 5.9
percent this year. And he'll spotlight the increasing commercial
and trade ties between the United States and India, which did $12.8
billion in two-way trade last year.
</P>
<P>
   He'll go to the vibrant commercial and cinema capital of Mumbai,
formerly called Bombay. He'll pay homage to the contributions
Indian people have made to the United States, where more than 1
million Americans of Indian descent now play vital roles in
technology, medicine, science, education, business and law.
</P>
<P>
   At each juncture, though, Clinton will find India staring back
with its inexhaustible insistence to be taken in on its own terms.
</P>
<P>
   There simply is no way to conceal or to clean up the myriad
manifestations of misery in a country whose national pastime is
daily survival in an economy that allots the Indian people with, on
average, the local equivalent of $1.25 a day; where 48 percent of
people over the age of 15 can't read; where one person in five,
day-in and day-out, can expect to be sick simply because they lack
access to safe drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton is overcome by the swill of India's poverty, he is
certain to convey the message that to dwell only on that would be
to sell short a civilization that has endured continuously for
4,600 years, surviving one invasion after the next, centuries of
tyranny, feudalism and colonialism and, having rejected them all,
has built its own freewheeling democracy, the imperfect miracle of
government by one billion people, overlaying a world of ideas atop
a distinctively Indian design.

general election campaign, voters are in a pessimistic mood over
stock market fluctuations, gas prices and killing of a six-year-old

   JAPAN-ECOMMERCE (Tokyo) _ Want to buy a concert ticket or book a
hotel room? Stroll into a Lawson, Japan's second-largest
convenience store chain, punch into its online store, Loppi, and
pay at the register on your way out. How about a book? Hop online
at the nearest 7-Eleven and find your title at e-Shopping! Books, a
site the chain owns with Softbank, Tohan and Yahoo, Japan's largest
book distributor. A day or two later, on your way home from work,
you can pick up and pay for your selection at the store. Accustomed
to adding new items to its merchandise mix every day, the Japanese
convenience store is fast grabbing hunks of cyberspace to expand
its limited shelf space. At the same time, recent deregulation is
allowing it to encroach on territory long out of reach, like
over-the-counter pharmaceuticals and banking. ``Without the
convenience store, e-commerce in Japan would have more trouble
taking off,'' says an official with the Ministry of Trade and
Industry. By Stephanie Strom.

&HT;     PASSENGERS HELP THWART COCKPIT ATTACK 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JUSTINO AGUILA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Passengers and crew members aboard an Alaskan
Airlines jet headed to San Francisco subdued a man who broke into
the cockpit and attacked a pilot, airport officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Joe Reilly of the San Francisco police said it was unclear
why the passenger, David L. Bradley, 40, of Blue Springs, Mo.,
acted so erratically. He speculated that Bradley might have been
under the influence of drugs or alcohol, or in need of psychiatric
medication.
</P>
<P>
   The incident occurred at 7:10 p.m. Thursday on Flight 259 when
the airplane was about 160 miles south of San Francisco, coming
from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley had been speaking nonsense and took off his socks and
his shirt, Reilly said. He repeatedly switched seats, disobeying
flight attendants and the captain, who told him to stay put.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley eventually sat in first class, where, Reilly said, he
made this threat: ``I'm going to kill all of you; keep away from
me,'' while simulating a gun with his hand.
</P>
<P>
   Passenger Robert Benjamin, 56, of West Linn, Ore., who helped
restrain the man until landing, said people on board were very
horrified.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of them didn't think they were going to make it,'' he
said. ``Families were crying.''
</P>
<P>
   The co-pilot, whose name was not released, already had been
alerted and armed himself with a tool in case of attack, Reilly
said.
</P>
<P>
   As flight attendants continued to coax the man back to his seat,
he became angry and threatened them. Soon after, he forced open the
cockpit door and lunged at the controls of the MD-83 jet, the
police said. The co-pilot tried to block the passenger from the
controls and the two men scuffled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The co-pilot was able to do a body block,'' Reilly said,
adding that Bradley weighs about 250 pounds and is 6 feet, 2 inches
tall.
</P>
<P>
   As the two men fought, the co-pilot suffered cuts to his right
hand as the passenger tried to get the tool _ described by the
police as a pick-like instrument _ away from him.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot called for help and was quickly aided by seven
passengers. They and the crew subdued Bradley and forced him to the
floor where he was bound with plastic restraints.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately all the guys moved quick and he ain't dead and
we're not dead,'' Benjamin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What really scared me was when he tried to open up an exit,''
said Chris Honochick, 37, of Salem, Ore., who also helped tackle
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot requested an emergency landing at the San Francisco
International Airport, where law enforcement officers met the
flight shortly before 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the jet landed, airport tower officials already had
received an ``alert 1'' message, meaning there was an emergency on
the plane, said Philip Meginness, an airport duty manager.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was taken into the custody of FBI agents. Threatening
the crew of an airplane is a federal offense.
</P>
<P>
   Meginness said Bradley was taken by ambulance to Mills-Peninsula
Hospital in Burlingame with bruises and cuts to his face. The
co-pilot also was taken to a hospital for treatment of cuts to his
hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't overemphasize the heroics that went on tonight,'' said
Reilly, referring to the passengers' and crew's actions. ``They
averted a tremendous disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin's wife, Donnie, said Bradley was speaking nonsense
during the flight.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Bradley said, ``It's not what's on the floor, it's
not the love you lost,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft went on from San Francisco to Portland, Ore.,
arriving at 12:50 a.m. Friday. The plane was carrying 43 passengers
and five crew members, according to Alaska Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley faces several federal charges including interfering with
a flight crew, assaulting crew members and failing to follow their
directions, Reilly said.

GRITTY WOMAN: ROBERTS SHOWS TRUE PLUCK AS `ERIN BROCKOVICH` 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Julia Roberts hits a career high-water mark with ``Erin
Brockovich.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for the dull title, the movie is near perfect:
entertaining, instructive, emotional, expertly directed and funny.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts is so right as Erin that it's hard to imagine anyone
else playing her. The role is beautifully written (by Susannah
Grant, who did the Cinderella update ``Ever After''), moving
naturally and seamlessly between drama, pathos and reality-based
humor, and Roberts is in complete control at every moment. She's a
delight to watch.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, directed by Steven Soderbergh, long a favorite of
actors and film buffs, is just as pleasing, and should be his first
blockbuster hit.
</P>
<P>
   Like the recent John Travolta drama ``A Civil Action,'' this is
a true story about a lawsuit against a huge company that is
knowingly damaging its neighbors' health by environmentally
dangerous practices. But the films could hardly be more different.
``A Civil Action,'' though good, wasn't fun. ``Erin Brockovich,''
while suspenseful and delivering its theme clearly and
dramatically, is a pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   It focuses not on the lawsuit (there is no trial scene) or
injured families or the lawyers, but on the unlikely woman who
became the heroine of the tale by uncovering the misdeeds and the
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Erin has three young kids, little education and few skills.
She's way behind on her bills and she cannot find a job. After a
car accident, she hires a lawyer to sue the doctor who hit her, but
her foul language and inappropriate clothes do not please the jury.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate, Erin browbeats the lawyer, Ed Masry (Albert Finney)
to give her a job as a file clerk. She is shunned by the women in
the office, who understandably don't cotton to her loud, aggressive
style, see-through tops and up-to-there skirts. When Masry suggests
she rethink her wardrobe, he gets back talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just so happens I think I look nice,'' she tells him
flatly. ``Maybe you should rethink those ties.''
</P>
<P>
   But Erin takes her work seriously and does it well. She uncovers
oddities in a minor real estate case involving a homeowner and a
major utility company. As she investigates, she discovers
horrifying proof that the company has been polluting a town's water
system, causing major health problems. She then convinces Masry to
begin a major class-action suit.
</P>
<P>
   While this is happening _ and the story is much more involved _
we are focusing on the high and low drama of Erin's private life,
from finding day care for her kids to considering a cautious
romance with the biker/carpenter next door, George (Aaron Eckhart).
</P>
<P>
   Erin makes a great character, albeit a pain in the neck at
times. Loud and foul-mouthed, she steamrolls over people _ though
sometimes she tries flirting first. Her treatment of lawyers, both
on her side and theirs, is one long lawyer joke.
</P>
<P>
   Her relationship with George adds more dimension to her
personality. At first, Erin judges George the same way the women in
her office judged her, by appearance. Eckhart, so good as the
button-down misogynist of ``In the Company of Men,'' gets to make
amends in this role.
</P>
<P>
   Though the movie is really about Erin, by the end we are quite
involved in the suit and concerned for the victims _ such as Donna
(Marg Helgenberger, of ``China Beach'') as a woman who pays a great
price for trusting the polluting company.
</P>
<P>
   The movie has sad, painful moments. Erin is a tremendously
empathetic person _ that's the reason the country folk of the movie
trust her when they don't trust lawyers. A scene where she tries to
cheer up a young girl with cancer is a heart-tugger.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, Erin Brockovich is a real person _ watch for her
playing a waitress early in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Director Soderbergh (``sex, lies and videotape,'' ``Out of
Sight,'' ``The Limey'') deserves huge credit for perfectly
balancing the humor and drama, the large events and the personal
moments. Soderbergh eschews his trademark stylistic flares to keep
this grounded in the character and reality of the story, but it's
just as much his movie.
</P>
<P>
   Soderbergh wonderfully captures the desperation Erin feels, the
austere terrible beauty of the desert where the pollution takes
place, the suspense of the danger (real or imagined) Erin may be
in. He handles the sad parts without letting the film turn maudlin.
And he gets strong performances from the entire cast. (The film has
many gemlike small parts.)
</P>
<P>
   Finney, who at first seems strange casting as a small-time
American lawyer, is just as wonderful and funny as Roberts. Much of
the film's humor is his response to Erin, and when he learns to
give as well as he gets, it's a treat.
</P>
<P>
   The movie does have a slight, only infrequent, tendency to turn
a bit cutesy in its humor, but really, not much. And while it's
been called a ``Rocky in miniskirts,'' it doesn't over-hype its
victories.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Erin Brockovich'' will be Roberts' personal triumph. After
a string of five box-office hits (even ``Conspiracy Theory'' and
``Stepmom'' did more than $100 million worldwide) Roberts has
completely re-established the momentum and popularity she lost in
the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Now she is stretching herself in a serious dramatic role, albeit
with a lot of humor and fun. She has, of course, done much drama
(``Mary Reilly,'' ``Michael Collins''), but this should be the
first since ``Steel Magnolias'' in which she makes a huge
impression on the public.
</P>
<P>
   It's great that ``Erin Brockovich'' has come along to brighten
up a pretty bleak spring at the theaters, but it will be too bad if
this movie and ``Wonder Boys'' are forgotten when Oscar time rolls
around next year. &QL;

&HT;     ENVIRONMENTALISTS SUE GOVERNMENT OVER DESERT PROTECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JANE KAY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Three environmental groups have sued the Bureau
of Land Management, charging that the federal agency is not fully
protecting endangered animals on 10.2 million acres in the
California desert.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has not implemented a conservation plan or considered
the plan's overall effects on at least 24 plant and animal species
in the high Mojave Desert and the low Sonoran Desert, the lawsuit
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Biological Diversity in Tucson, Ariz., the Sierra
Club and the Washington, D.C.-based Public Employees for
Environmental Responsibility filed the suit Thursday in the U.S.
District Court in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Doran Sanchez, spokesman for the Bureau of Land Management in
Riverside, said he could not comment on the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The agency is preparing four plans to protect the imperiled
species, including the desert tortoise, Peninsular Ranges bighorn
sheep, Inyo California towhee, Desert pupfish and rare plants,
Sanchez said.
</P>
<P>
   Two plans would be ready in early summer, and the other two
would be available later in the year, according to Bureau of Land
Management officials. Completion of the proposals would bring a
20-year-old conservation plan up to date, Sanchez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal of the four major plans is for the protection and
preservation of all the sensitive or threatened species,'' Sanchez

   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Hearst Corporation announced Friday that it
has agreed to sell The San Francisco Examiner to a company
affiliated with the publisher of the San Francisco Independent.
</P>
<P>
   Following a four-month transition period, The Examiner, which is
currently published under a Joint Operating Agreement with the San
Francisco Chronicle, will be published separately as an independent
newspaper. As part of the agreement, the new owner will assume
certain liabilities and The Hearst Corporation is making a
significant financial commitment to the continued publication of
The Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   The new owner will assemble its own staff, according to the
Hearst announcement, which said that current employees of both The
Examiner and the San Francisco Newspaper Agency will continue to be
employed by The Hearst Corporation, with the exception of those
employees who accept positions with the new owner.
</P>
<P>
   Last August 6, The Hearst Corporation and The Chronicle
Publishing Company announced that agreement had been reached for
The Hearst Corporation to acquire the Chronicle. At that time, to
offer The Examiner for sale, The Hearst Corporation engaged Veronis
Suhler &AMP; Associates, a New York City investment banker, which since
that date has been in contact with more than 90 prospective buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a vigorous and protracted sales effort and discussions
with regulatory authorities, The Hearst Corporation determined that
in order to complete its purchase of the Chronicle, it was
appropriate to facilitate the continued publication of The Examiner
rather than close the newspaper,'' according to the Hearst
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase of the Chronicle by Hearst will become effective at
the same time as the acquisition of the Examiner. The transaction
is expected to close by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle, with a daily circulation of 465,535 (ABC Sept.
1999), is the largest newspaper in northern California and the
second largest on the West Coast. It was founded in 1865 by Charles
and Michael deYoung and has been owned and operated over the
succeeding 134 years by their heirs.
</P>
<P>
   William Randolph Hearst founded what is today The Hearst
Corporation in 1887 when he assumed control of the Examiner. It
currently has a daily circulation of 108,968 (ABC Sept. 1999). A
joint Sunday Examiner &AMP; Chronicle will continue to be published
during the four-month transition period.

WASHINGTON, March 17 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   THERE ARE NO SENATE VOTES THIS WEEK.
</P>
<P>
   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: AVIATION
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday approved, 319-101, a three-year $40
billion authorization for the Federal Aviation Administration for
programs through 2003. The bill, which has been approved by a
conference of House and Senate lawmakers, provides nearly $10
billion for airport improvements and safety grants, and also allows
airports to raise local airport passenger taxes. Supporters said
the bill would make airports safer and help low-volume airports
become more economically viable. Opponents said the bill would
increase the amount of flights at busy airports. A ``yes'' vote
favors the authorization.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: PROPERTY
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday approved, 226-182, a measure that would
permit land developers to appeal local state and zoning decisions
in federal court. Private property owners would be able to appeal
cases if initial development applications are denied at the local
level. Supporters say it prevents private land owners from getting
caught in years of state-level litigation. Opponents say it
benefits big development companies who can circumvent local
authorities and take their case to federal coaurts. A ``yes'' vote
favors the measure.

<P>
   What appears to be a major victory for President Mohamed
Khatami's supporters in the new Iranian parliamentary elections
confirms that the Islamic regime that seized power in 1979 is
unlikely to survive in its current, strict theocratic form.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, after the shah was deposed, the coterie around the
newly powerful Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini purged its more
egalitarian members and crafted a theocracy instead of a democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights were virtually ignored in Iran for a decade, until
Khomeini's death in 1989. With typical revolutionary excess, the
regime's zealots were obsessed with winning converts to their
cause, both at home and in the region.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, today in Iran, the most innovative movement is the
Islamic reformation. Iranian thinkers have injected energy and
ideas into a disparate effort, from Egypt to India, to somehow
reconcile a 7th-century religion with modern life.
</P>
<P>
   By using Islam as a popular political idiom, by weaving Islamic
tenets into a modern, Western-style constitution, and by putting
clerics in charge of the state, Iran has actually become a live
test and a venue for debate on the proper relationship between
Islam and the modern world.
</P>
<P>
   Any aim to empower Iran's people was hijacked in the early days
of the Ayatollah's regime. Yet, ironically, the failure of the
world's only theocracy to empower its people has provided the
biggest boost for new, progressive ideas about the modern Islamic
state.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the most profound discourse within Islam today is taking
place in the newspapers, courtrooms and classrooms of Iran. Even
clerics who once held high office and intellectuals who were
proteges of the late Ayatollah Khomeini are now challenging the
religion's basic precepts as well as the specifics of theocratic
rule.
</P>
<P>
   Tehran was engrossed last autumn in the trial of Abdollah Nouri,
a cleric, former Khomeini aide and editor of the newspaper Khordad
who had served as vice president, interior minister and Tehran city
councilor.
</P>
<P>
   The Special Court for the Clergy, which operates as an
independent agency, charged Nouri with multiple counts of
``insulting'' Islam, the prophet Mohammad and Khomeini. Nouri's
specific offense was running articles in Khordad that questioned
everything from the Islamic concept of eye-for-eye justice to the
clergy's automatic right to hold power.
</P>
<P>
   At his trial Nouri, dressed in a white turban and clerical
robes, astonished Iranians by taking the stand and denying the
court's right to judge him: ``I totally reject the court, its
membership and its competence to conduct this trial, and any
verdict you reach will have no legitimacy.''
</P>
<P>
   After his conviction he refused to appeal, on the same grounds.
</P>
<P>
   In late November, Nouri was sentenced to five years in prison
and was also barred from political activity for five years, a
punishment tacitly designed to prevent Iranian President Khatami's
closest ally from running for speaker of the parliament.
</P>
<P>
   And Nouri's newspaper was banned, although his staff defiantly
pledged to launch another publication _ the people's new way of
getting around forced shutdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Six months earlier, Tehran had been absorbed in a similar trial
_ that of Mohsen Kadivar, a popular young cleric and seminary
professor whose sister was an adviser to Khatami and another Tehran
city councilor; his brother-in-law served as Khatami's minister of
culture and Islamic guidance.
</P>
<P>
   The Special Court for the Clergy charged Kadivar with
``disseminating lies and disturbing public opinion'' for writing
articles that advocated the separation of political and religious
institutions. Kadivar also dared to compare practices in the
Islamic republic with the former shah's repressive controls on
freedom of expression and questioned the powers and righteousness
of the theocracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``From both a legal and religious point of view, it's quite
permissible to criticize the Supreme Leader or the ruling
establishment,'' he argued.
</P>
<P>
   Like Nouri, Kadivar rejected the clergy's right to judge:
``Investigation into political and press offenses must be carried
out in the presence of a jury and by a qualified court of the
judiciary,'' he told the court. He was convicted and received an
18-month sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Kadivar's case gained him celebrity status. Posters of the young
cleric, who came from a noted religious family in the city of
Shiraz, were plastered all over Tehran. Students held a candlelight
vigil in the hills near Evin prison, where he was being held
without bail.
</P>
<P>
   Chanting ``freedom of thought, forever, forever,'' they released
doves as a symbol of liberty. More than 200 journalists also signed
a petition that condemned Kadivar's arrest as unconstitutional and
called it an ``offense'' against Iran's writers and intellectuals.
These responses to Kadivar's imprisonment reflected a newly
emboldened population.
</P>
<P>
   Both trials involved an issue even more fundamental than the
freedom of expression: the separation of religion from government.
In an Islamic society, who has the ultimate power _ the elected
officials or the clergy?
</P>
<P>
   Since Islam is a monotheistic religion that offers not only
spiritual values but also a set of rules by which to govern
society, sorting out the distribution of power is critical to any
genuine, lasting reform. So political change and religious reform
are often tightly intertwined in Muslim societies.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past five years, Iran's leading philosopher, Abdul
Karim Soroush, has fueled public debate by offering a framework _
on the basis of faith _ to blend Islam and democracy.
</P>
<P>
   He argues that to be a true believer, one must come to the faith
without coercion or pressure _ in other words, freely. That
principle is the origin of all other freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   Soroush has not abandoned the tenets of his faith; he believes
that ``sharia'' _ pure Islamic law _ can be a basis for modern
legislation. But he breaks from Iran's theocrats in his declaration
that Islamic law is not static, but instead is flexible and
adaptable because it has only begun to be understood by imperfect
human beings.
</P>
<P>
   Soroush was a long-time follower of Khomeini, who appointed him
to the Committee of the Cultural Revolution to set about being
certain that all Iranian university curricula were in conformity
with Islam.
</P>
<P>
   But a decade after the revolution, even Soroush, who initially
was so close to Khomeini, began to see the Ayatollah as an
instrument of transition, not as the goal. In books, magazine
columns and lectures at the three universities where he taught,
Soroush warned that Islam, like any other religion, should never be
relied upon to rule a state.
</P>
<P>
   To use religion as state law, he argued, opens the door to
totalitarianism.
</P>
<P>
   Often called the Martin Luther of Islam by students, Soroush is
also widely popular among today's young intellectuals, reformers
and the clergy. Many of his former students and followers launched
new, reform-oriented newspapers _ most notably Jameh, Tous, Neshat
and Asr-e Azadegan, or ``Era of the Emancipators'' _ all of which
were closed down, one after another, by the current Islamic-based
judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the goal of Soroush, Kadivar, Nouri and other Iranian
reformers is to be religious _ to be Muslim _ without being
fundamentalist, to be reverent but free, and to find a world-view
that is both Islamic and modern.
</P>
<P>
   All of this makes Iran quite unique in the Muslim world. And the
work of Iran's reformers is spreading rapidly throughout the
53-nation Islamic bloc. Indeed, this is the last group of countries
to hold out against the wave of democracy that in recent years has
swept the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Iran is still undergoing a transformation. After the elections,
more internal turmoil lies ahead, as the revolution's early
passions are replaced by hard-earned pragmatism, and as arrogance
gives way to realism among many believers in Iranian society.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, the government of God is being forced to cede to
secular statecraft _ and to empower Iranians. In the process, Iran
has begun contributing to the spread of public empowerment around
the world.

   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Hearst Corporation announced Friday that it
has agreed to sell The San Francisco Examiner to a company
affiliated with the publisher of the San Francisco Independent.
</P>
<P>
   Following a four-month transition period, The Examiner, which is
currently published under a Joint Operating Agreement with the San
Francisco Chronicle, will be published separately as an independent
newspaper. As part of the agreement, the new owner will assume
certain liabilities and The Hearst Corporation is making a
significant financial commitment to the continued publication of
The Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   The new owner will assemble its own staff, according to the
Hearst announcement, which said that current employees of both The
Examiner and the San Francisco Newspaper Agency will continue to be
employed by The Hearst Corporation, with the exception of those
employees who accept positions with the new owner.
</P>
<P>
   Last August 6, The Hearst Corporation and The Chronicle
Publishing Company announced that agreement had been reached for
The Hearst Corporation to acquire the Chronicle. At that time, to
offer The Examiner for sale, The Hearst Corporation engaged Veronis
Suhler &AMP; Associates, a New York City investment banker, which since
that date has been in contact with more than 90 prospective buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a vigorous and protracted sales effort and discussions
with regulatory authorities and Clint Reilly and his attorneys in
connection with the litigation regarding the transaction, The
Hearst Corporation determined that in order to complete its
purchase of the Chronicle, it was appropriate to facilitate the
continued publication of The Examiner rather than close the
newspaper,'' according to the Hearst announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly, a San Francisco real estate developer, also had made a
bid to buy The Examiner and had filed an antitrust suit to block
the Examiner-Chronicle merger.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase of the Chronicle by Hearst will become effective at
the same time as the acquisition of the Examiner. The transaction
is expected to close by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle, with a daily circulation of 465,535 (ABC Sept.
1999), is the largest newspaper in northern California and the
second largest on the West Coast. It was founded in 1865 by Charles
and Michael deYoung and has been owned and operated over the
succeeding 134 years by their heirs.
</P>
<P>
   William Randolph Hearst founded what is today The Hearst
Corporation in 1887 when he assumed control of the Examiner. It
currently has a daily circulation of 108,968 (ABC Sept. 1999). A
joint Sunday Examiner &AMP; Chronicle will continue to be published
during the four-month transition period.

   CIA-PROPAGANDA (Undated) _ ) _ Watch the 1955 animated version
of ``Animal Farm,'' and you'll notice the ending is different than
in the book. Another example of Hollywood butchering great
literature? Yes, but in this case the film's secret producer was
the Central Intelligence Agency. The CIA, it seems, was worried
that the public might be too influenced by Orwell's
pox-on-both-their-houses critique of Capitalism and Communism. So
after George Orwell's death in 1950, agents were dispatched to buy
the film rights to ``Animal Farm'' from his widow in order to make
its message more overtly anti-Communist. Rewriting the end of
Animal Farm is just one example of the often absurd lengths to
which the CIA went between 1947 and 1967 that are recounted in a
new book. By Laurence Zuckerman. (1400 words)

 &HT;    Roberts' `Erin Brockovich' flashes skin as she saves town
 &HT;    By Staci Sturrock
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You've never seen Julia Roberts quite like this, promises
costume designer Jeffrey Kurland.
</P>
<P>
   In Roberts' new film, Erin Brockovich, the actress sprints
through desert sand in 3-inch heels and shows off plenty of leg in
leather mini-skirts slit up to there.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, she's suddenly got major cleavage, the result of some
heavy-duty brassieres stitched right into her costumes.
``Understructure had to be made to feature whatever needs to be
featured,'' Kurland says delicately.
</P>
<P>
   The best part of it all, Kurland says, is that the wild woman
whom Roberts portrays is real.
</P>
<P>
   `A character dropped down from heaven'
</P>
<P>
   Erin Brockovich is a twice-divorced mother of three who, as a
file clerk in a small law firm, stumbles upon a coverup involving
contaminated water in a small desert town. She persuades her boss,
played by Albert Finney, to let her investigate. The payoff:
Without any formal legal training, Erin helps win a $333 million
lawsuit for the citizens of the town.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was like a character dropped down from heaven,'' Kurland
says. ``She did this amazing thing for these people, and she's so
much fun to look at.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Steven Soderbergh-directed drama, Roberts wears 52
costumes, most of which are characterized by plunging necklines,
loud prints and big, flashy earrings. Erin is ``an extraordinary
character who dresses rather extraordinarily,'' says Kurland, who
met the real Erin before he started sketching.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Roberts was more than willing to dress like, well,
a tramp, and spend countless hours tottering on stilettos, Kurland
says. ``If you've ever tried to run in high heels, you know that
those calf muscles are aching at the end of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   A Northwestern University grad, Kurland lives in Los Angeles
with his wife and two children; his parents have lived in Boca
Raton for the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   Many Kurland credits on Woody Allen films
</P>
<P>
   Before beginning his career in film in the late '70s, Kurland
designed for the Metropolitan Opera, American Ballet Theatre and
the New York City Opera. The bulk of his movie credits are Woody
Allen features. Kurland created the costumes for Mighty Aphrodite,
Hannah and Her Sisters, Crimes and Misdemeanors and many others,
and he previously dressed Roberts in My Best Friend's Wedding and
Everyone Says I Love You.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's very trusting of me,'' he says. ``I would never make her
uncomfortable, that's first and foremost.''
</P>
<P>
   And because Roberts is in such great shape, the Erin Brockovich
fittings were a study in efficiency. ``She looks good in so many
things, you spend the correct time looking for the character,''
Kurland says. ``You spend your time wisely.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, the real Erin still dresses pretty much the same,
Kurland says. ``Of course, there's a little more money behind it,
and the clothing is probably a little better quality.''

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 227.
WASHINGTON, March 17 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   THERE ARE NO SENATE VOTES THIS WEEK.
</P>
<P>
   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: AVIATION
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday approved, 319-101, a three-year $40
billion authorization for the Federal Aviation Administration for
programs through 2003. The bill, which has been approved by a
conference of House and Senate lawmakers, provides nearly $10
billion for airport improvements and safety grants, and also allows
airports to raise local airport passenger taxes. Supporters said
the bill would make airports safer and help low-volume airports
become more economically viable. Opponents said the bill would
increase the amount of flights at busy airports. A ``yes'' vote
favors the authorization.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: PROPERTY
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday approved, 226-182, a measure that would
permit land developers to appeal local state and zoning decisions
in federal court. Private property owners would be able to appeal
cases if initial development applications are denied at the local
level. Supporters say it prevents private land owners from getting
caught in years of state-level litigation. Opponents say it
benefits big development companies who can circumvent local
authorities and take their case to federal coaurts. A ``yes'' vote
favors the measure.

&HT;     ALLIES OF BUSH AND GORE READY `ISSUE ADS' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, March 19)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By STEWART M. POWELL

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If you missed the broadcast advertising campaigns
that George W. Bush and Al Gore waged in early primary states to
help secure their parties' presidential nominations, a
multi-million dollar replay is headed your way.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican and Democratic parties _ and allied organizations
theoretically acting independently of the candidates _ are on the
verge of mounting the most expensive advertising blitz in U.S.
history in hopes of shaping the political landscape for the fall
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Their plans are inspired by the Democrats' success in using the
post-primary, pre-convention phase of the 1996 campaign to inundate
the nation with thematic advertising that set the stage for
President Clinton to become the first elected Democrat to win a
second term in 60 years.
</P>
<P>
   By the time GOP nominee Bob Dole emerged broke and politically
weakened from GOP primaries to accept the Republican nomination,
Democrats had already augmented Clinton's $37 million in
permissible pre-convention campaign spending with an independently
financed, $45 million campaign that didn't count against Clinton's
spending limit because the ads never explicitly called for
Clinton's re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of Americans saw ads such as ``Values'' that extolled
Clinton's efforts to protect Medicare and cut taxes for ``working
families.'' The ads claimed that a ``Dole-Gingrich budget''
masterminded by the prospective GOP nominee and House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga., had ``tried to cut Medicare $270 billion'' and
``raise taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say they won't get caught by surprise this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to let the Democrats pull off what they did to
a fare-thee-well in 1996,'' warns Mike Collins, a GOP spokesman.
``We're prepared to respond to the Democratic onslaught.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee, armed with $15 million in the
bank and more on the way, hopes to raise $177 million in private
donations and federal matching funds to underwrite efforts to
reclaim the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, buoyed by their success in 1996, have $3.5 million in
the bank and millions more being raised to enable the party to
``keep all its options open'' for an aggressive advertising
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect an `air war' and we're ready,'' says Jenny Backus,
spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Issue advertising is especially appealing to presidential
candidates because the ads trumpet their political message and help
shape the political debate without the cost being counted against
their total permitted campaign spending.
</P>
<P>
   Ads qualify as ``issue advocacy'' as long as they do not overtly
endorse a candidate. The ads have extra appeal because they can be
financed with unlimited, unregulated ``soft money'' contributions
from corporations, unions and wealthy individuals. The spending
does not count against a candidate's spending limit because the ads
are ostensibly for public education by independent political
entities rather than to benefit individual candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Texas software billionaire Sam Wyly was able to weigh in on
Bush's behalf before the 13 GOP contests on March 7 with a $2.5
million privately financed advertising blitz funneled through an
organization he created, ``Republicans for Clean Air.'' Wyly's
television ads in New York, Vermont, Ohio and California belittled
the environmental protection record of Bush's hard-charging rival
for the GOP nomination, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   W. Russell Neuman, a professor of communications at the
University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School of Communications,
says allies of Bush and Gore are preparing to hit the nation's
television airwaves with just such ``issue ads.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The cannons are loaded,'' says Neuman, a communications
scholar who studies campaign advertising. ``Both sides are going to
launch _ and launch soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Allies of Republican and Democratic candidates and other
independent organizations already have spent or committed more than
$114 million for issue ads in the 1999-2000 presidential election
cycle. The spending far outpaces comparable spending at this point
in the last two presidential campaigns, according to a study
released Friday by the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the
University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore and Bush campaigns are now engaged in a stare-down over
which candidate will start the barrage.
</P>
<P>
   Gore challenged Bush last week to ``reject the use of soft money
to run issue ads'' as part of his bid to court McCain's
reform-minded supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats will ``not run any issue ads paid for by soft money
unless and until the Republican party uses money for advertising''
in an effort to avert ``the ad war arms race,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush rejected Gore's offer, challenging the vice president
instead to address Democrats' questionable fund-raising practices
in 1996 such as accepting $2.8 million in donations from foreigners
that was subsequently returned and Gore's participation in a 1996
fund raiser at a Buddhist temple in California where $55,000 of
$160,000 in donations was funneled through ``straw donors'' such as
Buddhist monks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clear the air on some serious charges'' stemming from such
``fundraising abuses,'' the Texas governor urged Gore. ``It is
important for Americans to know whether the current campaign
finance laws have been obeyed and enforced.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are preparing to copy their approach in 1996. One
possible Democratic target: Bush's failure to return $25,000 in
foreign money funneled to his gubernatorial campaign through the
Republican National Committee in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in fighting form,'' vows Backus, the Democrats'
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats expect the first salvo in the post-primary phase
of the campaign to be launched by the centrist Republican
Leadership Council. The quick-firing independent operation aired
advertising during the Republican primary campaign that challenged
magazine publisher Steve Forbes to drop negative attacks against
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The timetable is ``sooner rather than later,'' says spokesman
Matt Well.
</P>
<P>
   Grover Norquist, of Americans for Tax Reform, also vows an
activist advertising campaign that could help Bush. The
organization, which placed $4 million in ads in seven states last
summer, has joined Bush in calling for the federal government to
repeal ``the Gore gas tax'' _ the 4.3 cent-per-gallon fuel surtax
adopted in 1993 when Gore cast the deciding vote in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans note that whatever they do, the Democrats allies in
organized labor have already launched broadcast campaign ads in
selected congressional districts on behalf of labor-backed issues
being debated in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The ads by the 13-million member organization, part of its $46
million election campaign effort this year, are tied to looming
votes such as opposition to normalized trade status for China and
support for stronger legal rights for patients served by health
maintenance organizations, says AFL-CIO spokeswoman Deborah Dion.

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In an attempt to prevent an anticipated
undercount of immigrants and others in the U.S. Census, immigrant
rights groups in the San Francisco area are working closely with
census officials to encourage minorities and immigrants to
participate in the national survey.
</P>
<P>
   Fear of reprisals from the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, limited proficiency in English and a lack of understanding
of the census pose major obstacles in making sure the count of
immigrants and minorities is accurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone, every immigrant, whether documented or undocumented,
should participate in this census,'' said Mark Silverman, a lawyer
with the Immigrant Legal Resource Center in San Francisco. ``We
have ironclad guarantees from the INS that census information is
confidential.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal law prohibits the Census Bureau from sharing information
with any government agency or individual.
</P>
<P>
   Organizations participating in the outreach campaign with the
Census Bureau include the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, the
California Rural Legal Assistance, the Asian Law Caucus, Asians for
Affirmative Action, the California Institute for Rural Studies and
the Northern California Coalition for Immigrants Rights.
</P>
<P>
   Language may keep some immigrants from filling out the forms.
Translators and other census workers will be on hand at the
bureau's 40 Questionnaire Assistance Centers around San Francisco
to help people fill them out. The forms are due April 1.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, census takers will comb the area's homeless
shelters and less conventional homes, such as trailers, to make
sure those residents are counted. Starting April 27, census takers
will try to collect data from residents that did not respond to the
original form.
</P>
<P>
   Billions of federal dollars, whose distribution is based on
census figures, are at stake. In the 1990 census, officials
estimate they missed about 835,000 people in California, which cost
the state close to $2.2 billion in federal
</P>
<P>
   According to a Census Bureau study released Thursday, an
undercount similar to 1990 could cost California $5 billion in
federal funding.
</P>
<P>
   ``The census is about ... money and justice,'' said Johanna
Silva, who is coordinating the U.S. Census Bureau's outreach
efforts with organizations here. ``This is about transportation,
housing, school lunches, WIC (Women Infants and Children). These
are services we depend on as a city. Participating in the census
guarantees you'll get your fair share.''
</P>
<P>
   Those most likely to be undercounted are the poor or non-English
speaking or both, the very groups most in need of these services,
said Isabel Alegria, the regional census director for the Mexican
American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, or MALDEF.

   CIA-PROPAGANDA (Undated) _ ) _ Watch the 1955 animated version
of ``Animal Farm,'' and you'll notice the ending is different than
in the book. Another example of Hollywood butchering great
literature? Yes, but in this case the film's secret producer was
the Central Intelligence Agency. The CIA, it seems, was worried
that the public might be too influenced by Orwell's
pox-on-both-their-houses critique of Capitalism and Communism. So
after George Orwell's death in 1950, agents were dispatched to buy
the film rights to ``Animal Farm'' from his widow in order to make
its message more overtly anti-Communist. Rewriting the end of
Animal Farm is just one example of the often absurd lengths to
which the CIA went between 1947 and 1967 that are recounted in a
new book. By Laurence Zuckerman. (1400 words)

NRA SHOULD AVOID SHOOTING ITSELF IN THE FOOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With friends like Wayne LaPierre, the National Rifle Association
doesn't need enemies.
</P>
<P>
   LaPierre is the NRA executive vice president who suggested that
President Clinton sort of likes the idea of people getting shot to
death because the killings help Clinton promote his anti-gun
political agenda.
</P>
<P>
   There are politicians who could fairly be accused of such
coldhearted cynicism; Clinton isn't one of them. The president
often behaves like a manipulative, duplicitous, prevaricating creep
_ but he owns one of the great bleeding hearts of our time.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking about the nation's mourner in chief, a man who
tears up at the drop of a hat and who won two presidential
elections by convincing voters that he cares about their problems
and their ``needs.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is one thing that most Americans are willing to give
the president credit for, it's compassion.
</P>
<P>
   Disheartening though it may be to those of us who believe that
the right to bear arms is every bit as important as all the other
rights guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution, the public's perception
is that Clinton and the anti-gun crowd occupy the moral high ground
on this issue. The argument about guns is no longer an intellectual
disagreement over nuances of the Second Amendment; it's an
emotion-drenched showdown over life and death.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton talks about guns, he surrounds himself with gun
violence victims and their loved ones. He insists that gun control
can save lives _ especially the lives of innocent children _ and
professes bewilderment that any reasonable person could fail to see
the value of more and more gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   The other side finds itself defending a 208-year-old legal
precept that is vague enough to allow vast differences of opinion
about its meaning. When that defense is left to a spokesman as
combative and controversial as LaPierre, it's easy to see why some
folks jump to the conclusion that he is representing a dangerous
army of gun-happy fanatics.
</P>
<P>
   I should point out that I'm not a gun owner and have no
immediate plans to become one _ although I absolutely believe that
the decision to own or not own a gun should be mine, not the
federal government's. We could argue all day about the Second
Amendment's reference to a ``well regulated militia'' but there is
no ambiguity in the part that says that ``the right of the people
to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.''
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it all depends on your definition of ``infringed.''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to the question at hand. Do requirements such as
trigger locks and background checks and waiting periods
``infringe'' upon the right to bear arms? If so, are such
infringements reasonable when weighed against the recurring menace
of gun violence?
</P>
<P>
   What I find objectionable about most proposed gun laws is that
they miss the point. If we pass a law requiring trigger locks, we
pat ourselves on the back and say, ``OK, now we'll save some
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   And maybe we will. Maybe trigger locks will prevent some deadly
accidents, and maybe that will compensate for the times when a gun
owner can't defend himself against a criminal because his gun has a
trigger lock and the criminal's gun doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   But all the trigger locks in the world won't stop an armed
robber from gunning down a convenience store clerk, and all the
background checks and waiting periods that society can devise won't
stop the bad guys from buying guns on the street and using them
against law-abiding citizens. The real problem isn't guns _ it's
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   We can pass gun laws until the cows come home, and criminals
will find a way to beat them.
</P>
<P>
   But most Americans don't want to hear about all that. They want
to do something _ anything _ that might prevent one more child from
being gunned down in a classroom.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe it's time for the NRA and other gun-rights proponents
to compromise, to go along with some reasonable restrictions.
Otherwise, a frustrated public might eventually be persuaded to
support far more drastic remedies.

DO YOU LOVE THE SMELL OF COCA IN THE MORNING?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J.R. LABBE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It will be the leftist dream come true, this Plan Colombia to
dump $1.3 billion over the next two years in ``emergency requests''
for antidrug efforts in the South American country.
</P>
<P>
   When poor Colombian farmers and citizens die from the bullets
flying between American military personnel in-country to support
the Colombian army's antidrug battle with revolutionary forces, see
how long it takes for American soldiers to be painted as repressive
democratic dogs by guerrilla leaders wanting to capitalize on U.S.
involvement.
</P>
<P>
   The ``emergency'' in Colombia, brewing since the mid-'90s, is
actually the Clinton administration's late-term discovery that
ignoring South America for most of its tenure is coming home to
roost as an incredible failure.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has to do something _ and fast _ to avoid one of his
legacies being the abject failure of the war on drugs in South
America. And what better time to propose a billion-dollar aid
package than an election year, when members of Congress will be
hard-pressed to object for fear that their opponents will label
them as soft on the drug war?
</P>
<P>
   What's so terribly wrong with this plan? The fact that, of the
$1.3 billion proposed in emergency funding, $1 billion of it is
going to military and police assistance.
</P>
<P>
   It's not going to crop substitution programs; not to building
roads so that farmers can get those substituted crops to market;
and not to judicial reform, human rights protections or initiatives
to stop high-tech crimes like money laundering _ an all-important
aspect of the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   Nope, the United States is going to do a little aerial
fumigation to kill off those coca fields that can actually be seen
from the air, and a lot of training and equipping of a military
embroiled in a civil war. Never mind that federal law prohibits the
U.S. from doing just that.
</P>
<P>
   Section 1004 of the 1991 National Defense Authorization Act
allows foreign military training only for antidrug efforts. Defense
funds cannot legally be used to train foreign troops for
counterinsurgency purposes. Yet the line between the two is so
fuzzed that no one can tell the difference. Even U.S. drug czar
Barry McCaffrey suggested in July that differentiating between
anti-drug and anti-insurgency efforts is counterproductive,
indicating that the two are interdependent.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the plan, including Kenneth MacKay Jr., the
president's special envoy to the Americas, point to the successes
of the mid- to late '90s of reducing the coca crops in Peru and
Bolivia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plan builds on the very successful strategies that were
carried out with Peru and Bolivia that succeeded in reducing the
amount of cocaine produced in those two countries by 55 and 65
percent, respectively, over the last three years, thus reducing the
amount of cheap cocaine making its way into our country,'' MacKay
wrote in an opinion piece submitted to U.S. newspapers last week.
``Critics who say that the plan will not work must consider the
evidence in Peru and Bolivia.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, let's consider Peru and Bolivia. Coca production there
declined because of a series of crop substitution programs funded
by the international community and because of a Peruvian government
policy of shooting or forcing down planes suspected of shipping
coca to Colombia, where the processing and smuggling has always
taken place, even for Peruvian and Bolivian grown plants.
</P>
<P>
   And it didn't dry up coca production in South America. The drug
cartels just moved the entire operation into the southern plains of
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   This package is more of the same _ as the Center for
International Policy puts it _ all stick and no carrot. It will do
little to stop drug flow while forcing desperate small-scale
growers to move farther into the jungles while turning to armed
groups for help. And for the first time, U.S.-aided units will be
engaging in offensive operations against guerrillas who are holed
up in their oldest, most fiercely defended strongholds.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Vietnam, millennium-style.

&HT;     N.Y. ATTORNEY GENERAL SEEKS TO PUT PRESSURE ON GUN MAKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JAY JOCHNOWITZ  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Attorney General Eliot Spitzer is calling for a
national coalition of governments whose firearm purchasing power he
hopes will pressure the gun industry to adopt a ``code of conduct''
that would include making safer weapons.
</P>
<P>
   An industry spokesman called the effort ``naive'' and
``ill-conceived,'' and said manufacturers would not produce the
kind of weapons or adopt practices Spitzer seeks.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate matter, the Clinton administration announced
Friday that Smith &AMP; Wesson, the nation's largest gun maker, agreed
to provide safety locks on handguns within two months.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer's announcement, made Thursday, came in a week of
increasing support for tougher gun controls in New York. Gov.
George Pataki, a Republican, called Wednesday for such measures as
mandatory trigger locks, raising the age for handgun sales from 18
to 21, instant background checks on buyers at gun shows, banning
assault weapons and ``fingerprinting'' by manufacturers of the
unique markings each gun's barrel leaves on a bullet.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are preparing a similar proposal, and, while Senate
and Assembly Republicans prefer stiffer penalties for gun-related
crimes, they are looking at an assault weapons ban and trigger lock
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer proposes to use economics instead of politics as the
weapon of choice. Police departments and other government agencies
by about one-quarter of the handguns sold in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Stating that governments have so far tended to rely on laws or
lawsuits, Spitzer said, ``Today, we are offering a third way, and
that is for governments ... to use their immense financial leverage
to encourage gun companies to do what is right.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the key elements of the code are:
</P>
<P>
   _ Discontinuing models or features popular with criminals, such
as fingerprint resistant guns and pistols that can accept magazines
with more than 10 rounds.
</P>
<P>
   _ Including a second hidden serial number on handguns.
</P>
<P>
   _ Internal and external locking devices, safety disconnects that
make pistols impossible to fire, and designs that make guns
difficult to use by children under six.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ceasing sales to dealers who sell at gun shows or whose
weapons turn up in a disproportionate number of crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Delfry, president of the National Shooting Sports
Foundation, a Newtown, Conn.-based trade group, called it ``a very
naive code of conduct'' and described several measures as little
more than window dressing.
</P>
<P>
   Delfry, who has been involved in discussions between Spitzer's
office and manufacturers since last summer, said criminals would
easily find hidden serial numbers and can alter barrel markings
with a file. Nearly 95 percent of all guns now made have trigger
locks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Because some safety designs could make a gun useless in an
emergency, he noted, the code has exemptions for law enforcement.
That means, Delfry said, that officials would not do business with
a manufacturer unless it produces guns for the general population
that no police officer would use.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that any honest, responsible government official
is going to sign on to this document because it's too
hypocritical,'' said Delfry. And, he said, the ban on transactions
with certain dealers could lead to restraint-of-trade lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer, however, is sending letters this week to President
Clinton, the mayors of the 100 largest U.S. cities, all the
governors and attorneys general of all 50 states.

A BOUNTY OF PICKUPS TO BOGGLE THE MIND 
</HEADLINE>

 By BILL GRIFFITH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A pickup truck zips by you on the highway and you barely notice.
Oh, just another pickup truck, you think.
</P>
<P>
   On that level, a pickup truck is a pickup truck is a . . .
</P>
<P>
   But suppose that one day you decide that you need one . . . or
an SUV?
</P>
<P>
   Well here's some advice. It's free, and it might save you from
being overwhelmed when you go out looking at trucks. Do your
homework first.
</P>
<P>
   That's it.
</P>
<P>
   Homework? Yes. Because buying a truck or SUV can be a lot more
complicated than walking onto a lot and saying, ``I'll take that
one.'' Of course, that's exactly what you eventually want to do,
except that you want to know all about ``that one'' before you
point at it.
</P>
<P>
   The configurations available in trucks and SUVs can boggle the
mind. A good bit of self-evaluation of your wants, needs and
pocketbook can cut down a lot of time and frustration in trying to
make those decisions at a dealer's.
</P>
<P>
   For example: Let's say you want a Ford SUV. Do you want small
(the soon-to-be-available Escape), regular (Explorer), large
(Expedition), or extra large (Excursion)? Or would you prefer a
2-door Explorer Sport or the new Explorer Sport Trac (is it an SUV
with a small pickup bed? Or is it a pickup with an extra-large
four-door cab and small bed)?
</P>
<P>
   Are you confused yet?
</P>
<P>
   We haven't even begun to talk about two-wheel-drive vs.
four-wheel-drive or trim levels. Explorer, alone, comes in 13
configurations.
</P>
<P>
   If you walk into a dealership big enough to offer all the
variations on these themes, instead of a symphony, that sound in
your ears will be a cacophony of confusion.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, we'll offer a recent trip to Liberty Chevrolet in
Wakefield. Salesman Jim Marino provided a guided tour through the
Chevy line, along with some interesting tidbits.
</P>
<P>
   One: Trucks (including SUVs and minivans) make up 85 percent of
the dealership's sales.
</P>
<P>
   Two: Sales seem to be rising at approximately the same rate as
the price of gas.
</P>
<P>
   Three: I saw sticker prices from $12,815 (a base S-10 with the
radio deleted) to $50,000 (one of the custom conversion vans the
dealership is renowned for selling).
</P>
<P>
   The points here are that trucks are continuing to outsell cars
and bigger continues to be the better seller.
</P>
<P>
   Marino was overseeing the maneuvering of a 2000 Suburban
($44,000) onto the showroom floor. ``That sticker doesn't even
include all the extras you see on it,'' he says, gesturing to the
ski bag attached to the roof rack, the custom bicycle rack attached
to the trailer hitch and a protective bra on the front.
</P>
<P>
   ``That stuff is all there so you can see what's available as
dealer-installed options,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For all the time it took to place the Suburban in line on the
showroom floor, don't expect it to stay there long.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the last Suburban we have out of 12,'' said Marino of
the new millenium edition of the heavyweight champ of the Chevy
lineup. ``We sold five before any arrived, then we had more three
sold before the next shipment of five arrived and two more went out
the day they did come in.. And these weren't stripped: They were
$42-43,000 units.'' Still, that price was without the optional
moonroof now offered on the Suburbans for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Chevrolet redesigned its full-sized pickup for the
first time in more than a decade, a big step because the model was
a solid No. 2 seller in the market (behind Ford's perennial No. 1
F-150).
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the old C/K designations, the Chevy pickups now are
called Silverado (formerly the top trim line on the older body
styles).
</P>
<P>
   Want one? Which one? Here's where you realize that all pickups
aren't created equally and no two on the lot are the same.
</P>
<P>
   Let's run down a checklist of decisions to be made in picking a
pickup. Each choice is much more significant than ``paper or
plastic?''
</P>
<P>
   1. Regular cab or extended cab (all extended cabs soon will have
four doors).
</P>
<P>
   2. Box (that's the bed). Three choices here: Fleetside long box
(97.6 inches _ long enough for that 8-foot sheet of plywood or
wallboard); Fleetside short box (78.7 inches long) or Sportside box
(also 78.7 inches long, but narrowed considerably for the flared
rear fenders. Of course, you can buy the chassis-only version and
send it out for a custom box.
</P>
<P>
   3. Trim level. There's standard, an LS upgrade, and on top-end
models, an LT (as in leather) option.
</P>
<P>
   4. 1500 series (1/2 ton) or 2500 series (3/4 ton).
</P>
<P>
   5. Two-wheel drive or 4WD.
</P>
<P>
   6. Transmission. 5-speed manual, 4-speed automatic, heavy duty
versions of each are optional on the 3/4-ton trucks.
</P>
<P>
   7. Engine. Vortec 4300 V-6, 4800 V-8, 5300 V-8, 6000 V-8. If the
numbers are confusing, move the decimal point three places to the
left and you have the size in liters: 4.3, 4.8, 5.3 and 6.0.
</P>
<P>
   8. 2WD or 4x4.
</P>
<P>
   9. Dress-up accessories. Sliding rear window, running boards,
splash guards, tonneau cover, bed liner, off-road package.
</P>
<P>
   10. Suspension. Standard, heavy-duty, off-road, ride-control.
</P>
<P>
   11. Packages. Trailering, off-road, snow-plow prep.
</P>
<P>
   12. And more: You do have to talk such minor details as colors,
extra doors, perhaps a sliding rear window or traction contol in
addition to four-wheel drive.
</P>
<P>
   So the next time you see a pickup truck, you might be looking at
a one-of-its-kind vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Now, about that homework . . .

MINIVANS MAINTAIN THEIR POPULARITY, VERSATILITY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a television ad for an SUV which shows a man working out
in a gym being embarrassed by a public address announcement that
could identify him as the owner of a minivan.
</P>
<P>
   Is owning a minivan a stigma now? Apparently the manufacturer
buying this advertisement thinks so.
</P>
<P>
   However, owning a minivan is really nothing to be ashamed of.
The new minivans not only are great people-carriers, but also
cargo-movers, too. Consumer Reports compared the Honda Odyssey,
Volkswagen Passat wagon and Jeep Grand Cherokee for handling the
goods needed for a camping trip. The Odyssey minivan swallowed up
all the goods, the Jeep left a lot behind.
</P>
<P>
   The New England Motor Press Association rated the Chrysler Town
&AMP; Country minivan, which has all-wheel-drive, as its favorite for
winter driving.
</P>
<P>
   Minivans also offer a car-like drive, better handling, and _
very important in these days of high gasoline prices _ better fuel
economy than SUVs or trucks. And there's nothing embarrassing about
saving money at the pump. Minivans also offer more safety features
than some trucks or SUVs. The Ford Windstar, Toyota Sienna, and
Honda Odyssey are all highly rated in crash tests.
</P>
<P>
   Among other reasons for choosing a minivan is interior
flexibility to accommodate various seating arrangements and cargo,
as well as ease of entry. Almost all minivans now have dual sliding
doors, some of which are electrically controlled. The upcoming 2001
DaimlerChrysler products will include not only electrically
controlled dual sliding doors, but also an electric rear door as
well.
</P>
<P>
   While the minivans can offer lots of cargo space with seats
removed, check how easily this can be effected before selecting a
model. Some seats are easier to remove than others.
</P>
<P>
   A popular feature introduced this year on General Motor's
minivans are entertainment centers to keep passengers in the back
seats entertained on long trips. These are becoming more popular on
other makes as well, and units can be easily added to existing
minivans.
</P>
<P>
   For 2000, there are some 17 minivan models to choose from.
Fortunately for shoppers, many of these models are twins. The
Chrysler Town &AMP; Country, Voyager, and Dodge Caravan are similar; as
are the Pontiac Montana, Oldsmobile Silhouette and Chevrolet
Venture; so, too, are the Nissan Quest and Mercury Villager. The
Dodge Caravan is the top-selling model, and Consumer Reports rates
the Honda Odyssey tops.
</P>
<P>
   And, as Consumer Reports notes in its Sport Utility Special
($5.95 on newsstands), ``While not as popular as they once were,
minivans are far from dead.''

FEATURES TO CONSIDER WHEN TRUCK SHOPPING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why should you buy a truck-like vehicle? Conveniences,
flexibility, and safety are three good reasons. Trucks, according
to manufacturers, fall into three categories: pickups, sport
utilities, and minivans.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the things you should be considering when
shopping:
</P>
<P>
   Premium or regular: With gasoline prices nearing $1.80 a gallon
for premium fuels, check out the octane needs of the vehicle you
are looking at. Many SUVs require premium fuel. There are plenty
good SUV models which take just plain old regular octane gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Size: Your personal preferences will determine what size vehicle
you need. Are the truck's features only going to be used
occasionally? What will you be hauling: Lots of kids, cargo, or
some other combination? A pickup with a larger cab and an open
cargo bed could be used for family activities as well as hauling
yard trash or camping gear. A minivan might also serve your
purposes just as well. Consumer Reports found it could pack more
goods in the back of a minivan than a Jeep Grand Cherokee. The
Subaru Forester is a great choice for people who aren't looking for
a huge mass of vehicle, but one that offers all the plusses of an
SUV without being a gas-guzzler.
</P>
<P>
   Interior space: Newer pickup truck models which have rear
seating are now the rage. But not all these vehicles are created
equally when it comes to space. Even some supercab styles may offer
cramped seating for rear-seat passengers. Sport utilities come in
every size imaginable. If you really want space, consider the new
Chevrolet Suburban Tahoe or GMC Yukon. These are real people
carriers, and with rear seats removed, you can place sheets of
plywood on the floor inside. If you really need lots of room, look
to the Ford Excursion, with room for nine passengers plus cargo.
But size can be deceiving. Automobile magazine notes the Excursion
is only slightly bigger inside than the Suburban, and, because of
its size, cannot carry as much payload.
</P>
<P>
   Doors: The four-door pickup is here. But watch those doors. Some
are full-sized _ just like on cars _ and even open like car doors;
others are smaller and may only have door latches on the inside.
Consumers should also note how wide the doors open. The Dodge Quad
has rear doors that open to 90 degrees, making it easier to put
cargo as well as passengers in the back. The upcoming Chevrolet
Avalanche is designed to include a fifth door that opens onto the
bed, allowing extra-long items to be placed on an otherwise short
bed.
</P>
<P>
   Many minivans now have two side sliding doors which are
electrically controlled. The Chrysler Town &AMP; Country will soon
sport not only two electrically controlled side doors but also an
electrically controlled rear door.
</P>
<P>
   On SUVs, the Chevrolet Suburban and GMC Yukon are the only
models with a choice of rear doors. Buyers can choose between a
lift gate or a side-hinged rear cargo door.
</P>
<P>
   What drive? Two-wheel, four-wheel, all-wheel, part-time or
full-time: These are the choices. Just about every pickup truck and
SUV is available with a standard two-wheel-drive, similar to cars.
</P>
<P>
   Permanent four-wheel-drive vehicles have no two-wheel drive
option; these systems are effective in snow and mud and have a
differential that shifts power to wheels needing it. A low-range
drive is usually also found on these vehicles for off-road
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   All-wheel-drive handles all road conditions automatically. Power
is shifted between wheels as needed. No low-range drive is offered
on these models.
</P>
<P>
   Part-time four-wheel-drive operate on the road in
two-wheel-drive. If conditions call for four-wheel-drive, the
driver must select that mode with a lever or switch. Vehicles with
part-time 4WD do allow for ``shift on the fly'' to engage the
system. However, on these vehicles, the four-wheel-drive mode is
not suitable for use on dry pavement.
</P>
<P>
   Warranties: Check out what is covered on your vehicle and for
how long. Isuzu has expanded its powertrain warranty to 10 years,
120,000 miles on its Amigo, Rodeo, Trooper and VehiCross to cover
engine, transmission, steering assembly, suspension and axles.
Adjustment and maintenance items are not covered. The warranty is
only transferable to members of the original owner's family,
otherwise it reverts to a three-year, 50,000-mile warranty.
</P>
<P>
   Suspension: Isuzu's Rodeo and Amigo now have smart suspensions,
a new semiactive suspension system previously used only on luxury
cars and the Lexus LX470. The system increases comfort and reduces
oscillations in body roll. It is standard on models with Ironman
package and the top trim level of the Rodeo. It is not available on
the Trooper.
</P>
<P>
   On SUVs based on a car platform, the ride is much smoother than
on a vehicle with a truck platform. ABS: Antilock brakes prevent
lockups and provide straighter, quicker braking.
</P>
<P>
   Construction: Trucks originally were built on a solid frame,
cars on a unibody frame. The new Mitsubishi Montero has switched
from a frame construction to a unibody one for a more car-like
ride. In 1996, 31 of the 32 SUVs on the road had a truck platform;
by 2006, it is predicted that there will be 70 SUV nameplates, with
37 having truck-based platforms and 33 having car bases.
</P>
<P>
   Cargo bed: Once there were but two choices for pickups _ short
(6 feet) or long bed (8 feet). Then manufacturers built compact
pickups with narrow beds. Now come the blended pickup/SUV with even
shorter beds. &QL; 
 &QL; 
(Notes: Minivans are almost all front-wheel-drive. Chrysler Town &AMP;
Country and the Dodge Caravan have all-wheel-drive options. Only
the Chevrolet Astro and GMC Safari are rear drive. All-wheel-drive
options are available on these models . . . Mercedes Benz has a
solid four-wheel independent suspension on its sports utilities,
giving these models a more carlike ride than othe SUVs.)

   It was confusing enough when Christina Aguilera and Britney
Spears were both nominated for the Best New Artist Grammy this year
(Aguilera won), but now this blond-teen singer thing is getting out
of control. Spears has a new single, ``Oops ... I Did It Again''
scheduled to hit the airwaves this month, and fellow blonde Jessica
Simpson has a duet due out (''Where You Are'') that we expect to be
huge. Aguilera's ``What a Girl Wants'' is solidly in the Billboard
Top 20; then there's LeAnn Rimes, who's practically old-school by
now even though she can't drink legally, and Mandy Moore, the baby
of the bunch. With all these under-20 blond singers out there, we
thought we'd provide a reader service and sort them all out. So we
did.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   BRITNEY SPEARS
</P>
<P>
   Age: 18
</P>
<P>
   Major-label debut: ``... Baby One More Time,'' 1998
</P>
<P>
   Signature song: ``... Baby One More Time''
</P>
<P>
   Distinguishing characteristic: To quote Teri Hatcher on a
``Seinfeld'' episode, ``They're real _ and they're spectacular.''
At least that's close to what Britney says, when discussing her
breasts, which are rumored to have been surgically augmented.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like: Amateur night at a karaoke bar.
</P>
<P>
   Before she was a star: Appeared on ``The New Mickey Mouse Club''
at age 11, along with such future stars as ``Felicity's'' Keri
Russell and 'N Sync's Justin Timberlake; ``Star Search'' champion
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Best move: Being the first of the pop blondes out of the gate
makes the others look like imitators.
</P>
<P>
   Biggest mistake: Planning to record cover of the Rolling Stones'
(''I Can't Get No) Satisfaction'' is going to cause arguments
between her fans and their parents _ and in some cases,
grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   Quote: ``I have really strong morals, and just because I look
sexy on the cover of Rolling Stone doesn't mean that I'm a naughty
girl.'' (From People Almanac.)
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   CHRISTINA AGUILERA
</P>
<P>
   Age: 19
</P>
<P>
   Major-label debut: ``Christina Aguilera,'' 1999
</P>
<P>
   Signature song: ``Genie in a Bottle''
</P>
<P>
   Distinguishing characteristic: Near-platinum hair coloring makes
her blonder than the other blondes.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like: Typical assembly-line pop. Beneath the gloss,
though, is a fairly impressive voice.
</P>
<P>
   Before she was a star: Appeared on ``Star Search'' at age 8;
performed for two years on ``The New Mickey Mouse Club.''
</P>
<P>
   Best move: Appearing genuinely surprised and humbled when she
won the Best New Artist Grammy. Did NOT lip-sync on the recent
American Music Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Biggest mistake: Not performing at the Grammys, letting Britney
Spears grab the spotlight instead.
</P>
<P>
   Quote: ``Being (young) does put more pressure on you if you want
to be taken seriously as an artist. ... You have to be way sharper
than anybody else because people expect you to be this bubble-gum
airhead.'' (From Fort Worth Star-Telegram files.)
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   MANDY MOORE
</P>
<P>
   Age: 15; turns 16 April 10.
</P>
<P>
   Major-label debut: ``So Real,'' 1999
</P>
<P>
   Signature song: ``Candy''
</P>
<P>
   Distinguishing characteristic: Younger than the other blondes.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like: She thinks Britney Spears is a roots artist.
</P>
<P>
   Before she was a star: Was known as ``National Anthem Girl'' in
Orlando, Fla.,
</P>
<P>
   because she sang ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' before so many
major sporting events.
</P>
<P>
   Best move: Learning to play guitar and planning to write her own
songs.
</P>
<P>
   Biggest mistake: None yet, although admiration of Mariah Carey
could lead to critical disdain.
</P>
<P>
   Quote: ``I don't feel I've missed out on anything about growing
up because I feel so fortunate. There are so many kids that would
love to be doing what I'm doing!'' (From unofficial Web site,
AmandaMoore.com.)
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   JESSICA SIMPSON
</P>
<P>
   Age: 19
</P>
<P>
   Major-label debut: ``Sweet Kisses,'' 1999
</P>
<P>
   Signature song: ``I Wanna Love You Forever''
</P>
<P>
   Distinguishing characteristics: A Dallas native, Simpson is 5
foot 3 and is dating Nick Lachey from boy group 98 Degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like: Celine Dion on the single; Mariah Carey on the rest
of the album
</P>
<P>
   Before she was a star: Developed singing skills in church;
auditioned for ``The New Mickey Mouse Club'' at 12; worked for
three years on a small-label gospel album, only to have the company
fold.
</P>
<P>
   Best move: Touring with 98 Degrees, which helped her hook up
with Lachey personally and professionally. Their duet ``Where You
Are,'' on the soundtrack to the upcoming movie ``Here on Earth''
(starring Fort Worth's Chris Klein), is poised to be a huge hit.
</P>
<P>
   Biggest mistake: None yet, but blending in with the teen crowd
rather than capitalizing on a distinctive voice is a bad trend.
</P>
<P>
   Quote: ``I feel like I can bring a freshness, no matter what age
the person listening to my music is. And I think that freshness and
that innocence is something that is missing from a lot of young
female singers. I'm certainly not denying that I'm young, but I'm
not fluff.'' (From official Web site.)
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   LEANN RIMES
</P>
<P>
   Age: 17
</P>
<P>
   Major-label debut: ``Blue,'' 1996
</P>
<P>
   Signature song: ``How Do I Live''
</P>
<P>
   Distinguishing characteristics: New hairstyle gives her a more
mature, cosmopolitan look than teen peers. Plus, she sings country;
they sing pop.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like: Patsy Cline in high school
</P>
<P>
   Before she was a star: A longtime Garland, Texas, resident,
Rimes performed at Johnnie High's Country Music Revue in Arlington;
appeared on ``Star Search'' at age 8
</P>
<P>
   Best move: Singing ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' at a Texas
Rangers game, which led songwriter/disc jockey Bill Mack to send
her the song ``Blue,'' her first hit.
</P>
<P>
   Biggest mistake: Remaking Prince's ``Purple Rain.'' Some great
songs should remain untouched.
</P>
<P>
   Quote: ``People are going to criticize anything anyone does, no
matter what, so I don't let it get to me anymore. I used to think,
`Oh my God, I'm so bad.' Now I'm like, `Whatever.' '' (From
``InStyle'' magazine.)

A FEW PROTEST, BUT MOST ISRAELIS POSITIVE ABOUT POPE'S VISIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Not everyone is happy that Pope John Paul II is
traveling to Israel next week on a historic peace mission.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 other journalists attending a Religion and Media 2000
Conference in Jerusalem before the pope's visit ran into a few
sign-carrying demonstrators Thursday outside the office of Israel
Meir Lau, chief rabbi of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Shifting into herd-journalism mode, the reporters among us began
questioning the bearded men who were carrying hand-drawn signs,
including one decorated with a picture of a cross with an X drawn
through it. Other signs were decorated with the Star of David and
said ``Cross Out'' and ``Pagan Worship Out.''
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators are clearly in the minority. Yellow and white
papal banners are all over Jerusalem streets. A Gallup poll done
for Israel's Interreligious Coordinating Council indicates that
nearly 60 percent of adult Israelis see the pope's visit as
positive. Only 12 percent view it as negative.
</P>
<P>
   But those few are vocal.
</P>
<P>
   The sign-carriers said they were a part of the Committee to Stop
the Visit of the Pope.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a group of people from all kinds of organizations, and
we have already come here several times to demonstrate,'' said
Teran Pollock, one of the protesters. ``We hope to have thousands
next week demonstrating, if the police will let us.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the demonstrators was Baruch Merzeo, who said two of his
sisters died in the explosion of a bomb planted in Jerusalem. He
blames the terrorist act on Yasser Arafat, the Palestine Liberation
Organization leader who is seeking a peaceful agreement with Israel
over a Palestinian homeland.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators said they are particularly unhappy that the
pope, when he makes a pilgrimage to Bethlehem, will meet with
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also can't understand why the chief rabbi, who was a part
of the Holocaust, will be greeting the pope,'' said Pollock, who
said he is a member of Kach, a right-wing group.
</P>
<P>
   While emphasizing the demonstrators' freedom to protest, Lau
said during a news conference that he expects his talk with the
pope to be a historic moment of reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   The bearded rabbi, wearing a large-brimmed black hat, said that
Israel is a democracy and that many who are concerned about the
pope's visit remember the history of persecution of Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``We appreciate that this was the first pope to ask forgiveness
from the Almighty for the past sins of the church,'' Lau said,
referring to last Sunday's prayerful papal apology for Catholic
Church transgressions against Jews and others during the past 2,000
years. ``You must be a great man to ask for forgiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   Lau, who survived the Holocaust and, like Pope John Paul, is a
native of Poland, was among those expressing regret that the pope
did not specifically mention the Holocaust in his apology.
</P>
<P>
   But Lau has high hopes that John Paul will specifically
apologize for the Roman Catholic Church not being more outspoken
against the Holocaust when the pope visits Yad Vashem, the
Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The two have personal ties. John Paul knew Lau's grandfather,
who was a rabbi in Poland. The pope secretly studied for the
priesthood while working under Nazi occupation in Krakow.
</P>
<P>
   Lau visited the pope at John Paul's summer residence in
Castelgandolfo near Rome as a preliminary to next week's visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shared many memories of our experiences of the Holocaust,''
said Lau, whose father, also a distinguished rabbi, died at the
Treblinka death camp in Poland.
</P>
<P>
   No pope has ever visited Israel's chief rabbi on his home turf
in Jerusalem. The rabbi said it will be a far-reaching symbol that
the pope recognizes Israel as a state and respects the Jewish
people.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Let's Eat! But can the cabaret
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ This past week I was rejoicing with Sister
Sharion.
</P>
<P>
   The week before I had mourning for her _ and for me, too,
believing what I'd heard to be true.
</P>
<P>
   What I'd heard was that Sister Sharion had closed down her
little soul food cafe, Let's Eat.
</P>
<P>
   No more of her turnip greens and hot water cornbread . . . peas
and rice . . . mashed potatoes and gravy . . . her meat loaf, fried
chicken, pot roast, catfish . . .
</P>
<P>
   It was bad news for everybody who loves down-home, country
cooking.
</P>
<P>
   But here's the good news:
</P>
<P>
   The rumor was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Sharion had been under the weather for a couple of a
days. As a result, she closed down until she was feeling better.
</P>
<P>
   Now she's just fine, all smiles as always. The lunch was
luscious, as usual, on the day I stopped by.
</P>
<P>
   I had a serving of catfish, yams, peas and rice -- what some
call Hoppin' John -- and a couple of pieces of her hot water
cornbread, which some call the best in town.
</P>
<P>
   Good food, good crowd. You'll see most everybody you know at
Let's Eat Cafe, from the country club crowd to people from the
projects.
</P>
<P>
   If I were running for office, that's where I'd do my
campaigning. Politics and pot licker, not a bad combination.
</P>
<P>
   But as good as the Let's Eat Cafe is, I've always thought I
could improve on it.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it's fine as far as it goes. But why not go whole hog in a
place where no telling how many hogs have been sacrificed simply
for seasoning?
</P>
<P>
   Awhile back I put this idea to Sister Sharion:
</P>
<P>
   First we'd get a license to sell influential beverages of the
wit-enhancing variety.
</P>
<P>
   Next we'd open up the back part of the building for candlelight
dinners, a special place where ladies and gents could be together
for a special evening.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, we'd have a band playing toe-tapping tunes for
dancing. Best way I know of to work up an appetite.
</P>
<P>
   Put it all together and what do you have? A soul food gold mine,
the likes of which we we could franchise all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   All I was asking was for Sister Sharion to give it a try.
</P>
<P>
   What she gave me instead was a hard look.
</P>
<P>
   Put it all together, she said, and she knew what we'd have:
</P>
<P>
   A cabaret!
</P>
<P>
   Sister Sharion, being the good church-going lady that she is,
wanted no part of a cabaret.
</P>
<P>
   But, as I tried to explain, we wouldn't have to call it cabaret.
</P>
<P>
   The name would be the same. Well, almost. We'd simply add on to
the existing sign.
</P>
<P>
   Make it: Let's Eat, Drink and Be Merry.
</P>
<P>
   She gave me another hard look. After that, I gave up.
</P>
<P>
   So it is when the proprietor of the establishment is the soul of
piety.
</P>
<P>
   Looks like I'll have be satisfied with the Let's Eat Cafe the
way it is.
</P>
<P>
   Turnip greens and cornbread . . . peas and rice . . . mashed
potatoes and gravy . . . meat loaf, fried chicken, pot roast,
catfish . . .
</P>
<P>
   Oh well. I guess I can live with that.

HARLEY, FORD OFFER A SPECIAL EDITION

   If the line between cars-trucks-and SUVs is blurred, here's one
special edition that will be unmistakable: Ford's Harley-Davidson
F-150 pickup. Up to 7,500 of the $32,995 trucks will be built,
beginning on April 10 at Ford's Ontrario Truck Plant. It will be a
4x2 SuperCab (black, naturally) with Harley-Davidson orange
pinstriping, a chrome grill and a flareside box topped by a hard
shell tonneau.
</P>
<P>
   Under the hood will be a 5.4-liter Triton V-8 producing
260-horsepower and turning massive 20-inch tires. The suspension is
lowered one inch with special shocks and (naturally) sport-tuned 3
1/2-inch slash cut exhaust tips.
</P>
<P>
   Inside will be more of the H-D touch, including a dashboard
ornament, black leather-trimmed seats, and a ``spun metal''
instrument cluster. Additional options are slim: a six-disc CD
changer ($400), sliding rear window ($125) and engine block heater
($90) are it.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's George Magro says, ``This is the first of more exciting
products to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, special editions aren't anything new. Ford continues
its Eddie Bauer edition with the Expedition and Explorer, and Chevy
has a neat Warner Brothers Edition of its extended-length Venture
minivans,

   Word out of the Geneva Auto Show is that Dodge will stop using
Cummings diesel engines in its big Ram pickups in favor of a
Mercedes-Benz diesels. The change should begin with the next
generation Ram pickup, scheduled out in 2002 as a 2003 model . . .
GM reported record retail truck sales in February _ 227,298 units,
up 20 percent and the third straight month of double-digit growth
in truck sales . . . DaimlerChrysler reported February minivan
sales up 26 percent from a year ago. Dodge trucks were up 9 percent
. . . The folks at Nissan were happy with truck sales up 61.7
percent versus February, 1999 . . . Nissan Pathfinder buyers will
be equally happy to hear that the 2001 SUV (it went on sale March
15) will have a bunch of updates, most notably a beefier V-6 that
should solve complaints about it being underpowered. The new
3.5-liter V-6 is based on the technology used in the acclaimed
Maxima V-6. How big a change is it? The 3.3-liter V-6 in the 2000
model put out 170 horsepower, the new version is 240 when coupled
to an automatic transmission and 250 with the 5-speed manual.

THE ALMOST TOO-PERFECT TRUCK 
</HEADLINE>

   The military is great for creating acronyms that make their way
into our everyday lives.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, ASAP (as soon as possible) and NLT (not later
than) were part of my first orders for reporting to basic training.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, military vehicles such as the venerable Jeep and
Humvee, tried and proven by military use, have become popular
crossover civilian successes.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Ford unveiled a military adaptation of its heavy duty
F-350 Super Duty Crew Cab pickup complete with the appropriate
acronym COMBATT (Commercially Based Tactical Truck). Just
wondering: Does a Ford poohbah think of the acronym and adapt a
vehicle to fit it or does a team develop a vehicle and then have
brain(?)storming sessions for the name?
</P>
<P>
   It's obvious that this vehicle will give a whole new meaning to
``Built Ford Tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Gurminder Bedi, vice president, Ford North American Truck, said,
``Ford has a long, proud history of supplying vehicles to the US
military and other branches of government. In addition, this
program allows us to explore technologies that we may be able to
adapt to our regular production trucks.''
</P>
<P>
   Really now? Couldn't this become the ultimate Urban as opposed
to the Suburban?
</P>
<P>
   I can see plenty of civilian applications that would make this a
sensational daily driver.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, it will have a powerful onboard computer with an
advanced global positioning satellite navigation system, night
vision system, collision warning system and upgraded electrical
system, proving 12-volt, 24-volt and 110-volt power.
</P>
<P>
   Wow. I can use the computer to write stories while sitting in
traffic on the Central Artery. After all, I see other folks
applying makeup, reading books &AMP; papers or talking on the phone as
they inch along.
</P>
<P>
   The advanced GPS means never having to say I got lost on the way
to an assignment. (Well, it means I'd at least know where I am,
though not necessarily where I'm going).
</P>
<P>
   Night vision. It will certainly help spot and avoid those deer
and coyotes that are starting to dot our urban landscapes.
</P>
<P>
   The collision warning system should be a great addition.
Imagine! It will go off a split second before I get rammed by a Big
Dig 18-wheeler whose driver has been highway hypnotized while
trying to set the records for most loads of fill delivered in an
eight-hour shift.
</P>
<P>
   And imagine the stereo system you could install with that
110-volt electrical system!
</P>
<P>
   The truck also can be outfitted with a covered pickup box and
seats for carrying troops (in this case reporters). I can imagine
the paper renting out this truck to convey its army of reporters
and photographers for such big events as the Ryder Cup, political
conventions and the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   I'm starting to think I want to open a dealership for this
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   It also will have upgraded suspension, electronically controlled
high performance shock absorbers, supplemental air springs, a
central tire inflation system and 37-inch tires with a run-flat
capability.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know about you, but I'm signing up for a long-term road
test through Big Dig country. It sounds like a match for Boston's
spring potholes.
</P>
<P>
   You can't doubt it's perfect. Ford even says ``The vehicle's
ride height, tire pressure and firmness automatically adjust to the
challenging dirving conditions a military vehicle encounters.''
</P>
<P>
   The demonstration truck is said to have met or exceeded the
ratings of existing Army vehicles while carrying greater payloads.
It's designed to be able to ford 30-inch deep water and operate in
temperatures from 50 below zero to 120 degrees Fahrenheit.
</P>
<P>
   I have some questions for Ford before I trade in my 1961 Falcon
on this baby.
</P>
<P>
   1. How much a month to lease one?
</P>
<P>
   2. Will it run on regular gas?
</P>
<P>
   3. Does the camouflage paint job mean no one can see me coming?
</P>
<P>
   4. Can I get it with heated seats?
</P>

A SENSE OF SECURITY, YET A CONCERN FOR SAFETY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Safety: It's something you can't ignore when thinking about a
truck or sport utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Safety is one reason many buyers turn to an SUV. Most feel safe
driving one, especially the larger ones, with all that bulk around
them. Many SUVs are also built on a truck frame for added strength,
rather than the unibody construction used in cars. SUVs and most
trucks are also higher off the road, providing better visibility
(unless you're in a car riding behind one _ a major complaint of
non-SUV owners). Another way SUVs and trucks provide safety is on
models equipped with all-wheel-drive, providing a secure footing on
slippery surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   But the way these vehicles handle has become a major safety
concern. All SUVs come with warnings of possible rollovers. While
any vehicle can tip in a sudden manuever, such as trying to avoid
another vehicle, sport utilities are particularly prone to this
because of their design _ being higher off the road.
</P>
<P>
   The rollover issue came to a head when Consumers Union, after
placing vehicles through a double-lane change emergency avoidance
test, labeled the 1995 and '96 Isuzu Trooper and the 1998 Suzuki
Samura as unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Owners of an SUV should be aware that the vehicles tend to be
top heavy _ some more than others _ and care should be taken while
making sharp turns or in emergency situations. Also, drivers should
be careful when using antilock brakes in such a situation.
Anti-lock brakes require a vehicle to be going in a straight
direction during an emergency-braking situation. A sudden twist of
the wheel during braking could cause the vehicle to become
unstable.
</P>
<P>
   Owners of any truck should look for safety features such as
front and side air bags, ABS, and child safety features; trucks
often lag behind automobiles in safety equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Not all SUVs are created equal. Some are designed to go
anywhere, do just about anything; others are designed just for the
road. Some have full-time four-wheel-drive designed to send power
to which wheels need it; others, with part-time four-wheel-drive
are designed only for use on snow or off road, not for high-mileage
highway driving.
</P>
<P>
   However, many manufacturers are adding additional safety
features.
</P>
<P>
   Land Rover recently introduced an Active Cornering Enhancement
on its Discover series that reduces body lean to make the vehicle
more responsive under cornering situations. It is a $2,000 option.
(Land Rover also produces an interesting book comparing all SUVs,
including drivetrains, off-road capabilities, and pricing. Copies
are available at dealerships.)
</P>
<P>
   A concern to non-SUV owners is the fear of being hit by a
sport-utility and having the vehicle ride up over the smaller car.
Mercedes-Benz has placed bumpers on its M series SUVs at the same
level as cars to avoid those situations. The Lincoln Navigator has
a secondary bumper system underneath to also prevent similiar
accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Ford will introduce air bags to protect occupants' heads in the
event of a rollover in Explorers and other models next year. The
air bags provide a curtain that will inflate over front and side
windows and stay inflated for up to 6 seconds to cushion driver's
and passenger heads long enough to outlast a multiple rollover.
Most air bags deflate immediately after opening; only Mercedes-Benz
has side air bags that stay open a few seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The Ford system uses sensors, which measure how far the vehicle
is tipping. If a rollover is imminent, inflators are triggered,
filling a long air bag on each side of the vehicle with cool gas.
Ford says the new bags are not connected with any federal
investigation, but found that 80 percent of its owners said they
wanted such a feature.
</P>
<P>
   Rollovers are the most common fatal truck accident. The National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration is now working on a scoring
system to tell consumers how likely different SUVs are to roll
over.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ultimate Car Book 2000'' by Jack Gillis (A HarperResource
Book, $19.95) offers many safety tips and has a rollover rating
guide.

EXPECTING POLITICAL FIREWORKS, TAIWAN PREPARES FOR ELECTIONS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan _ Taiwan's voters prepared to vote for president
on Saturday for only the second time ever in a contest that has
drawn menacing threats from mainland China and is likely to produce
the weakest, most divided government since Chiang Kai-shek's
Nationalists fled to the island in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   At fervent rallies that brought hundreds of thousands of
flag-waving people into the capital's streets tonight, the three
main candidates made their final appeals in a race that appeared
too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   The contenders are Vice President Lien Chan, of the ruling
Nationalist Party; James Soong, a former Nationalist official
running as an independent; and Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic
Progressives, the country's main opposition party.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polling has not been allowed in the final 10 days,
adding to the suspense of an election that has been fought with all
the exuberance of a young democracy facing profound choices.
</P>
<P>
   Hanging over the campaign were heavy handed warnings from
Beijing, which considers Taiwan a wayward region and said it will
go to war if the island indefinitely delays talks on reunification.
</P>
<P>
   The outgoing Nationalist president, Lee Teng-hui, has outraged
Chinese officials with his insistence on Taiwan's equal status with
the mainland, a position that is widely shared here. But in recent
days, Beijing has pointedly attacked Chen, the opposition party
challenger, warning that his victory would be dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Alone among the candidates, Chen long championed a Taiwanese
declaration of independence, but he now says it is unnecessary
because Taiwan is effectively sovereign. While he has tried to
press an anti-corruption theme, he has had to spend much of his
campaign trying to assure voters that he will not act recklessly
and will seek peace.
</P>
<P>
   Given China's deep suspicions, his election would open a period
of serious tension, anxiously watched in Washington because the
United States has pledged to help defend Taiwan and would be drawn
into a cross-straits war.
</P>
<P>
   The Nationalist candidate, Lien, is in serious danger of losing
in a three-way, winner-take-all race that has disastrously divided
the party's traditional majority. With a wide sense that Chen was
gaining ground, Lien started trying to scare voters with warnings
that electing Chen would court a military attack.
</P>
<P>
   Holding high Lien's hand at Friday night's rally, Lee continued
this line of attack, shouting that Chen ``is inexperienced and
everything he says will give jitters to everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   But Chen's generally ardent supporters, including many younger
citizens who yearn for a fresh and cleaner government as well as an
independent Taiwanese identity, have not been deterred.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taiwan, stand up!'' was a loud chant at the Chen rally Friday
night, the largest and most frenzied of the three, which spilled
far into the streets from a packed football stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Considered by many to be a weak candidate, Lien, who has an
American doctorate in political science and has held several top
government posts, has offered little more in his campaign than
appeals to experience and stability.
</P>
<P>
   After being pushed aside by his former mentor, Lee, Soong, once
a Nationalist stalwart, has made an independent run, attacking the
corruption of the party he long served and billing himself as a
more competent leader than Lien.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Soong, who also has an American doctorate in
politics, is more willing to discuss the mainland's core principle
of ``one China.'' He says he would be the best able to negotiate
with the mainland, but the independence-leaning supporters of Chen
fear he would sell out Taiwan's interests.
</P>
<P>
   All three candidates say they will seek to broaden economic ties
with the mainland. But whether any of them can meet Beijing's
demands for unity talks is unclear, since the vast majority of
Taiwan voters prefer their current status of undeclared
independence.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For the Nationalists, who have firmly ruled Taiwan through 51
years of dictatorship and then a democracy they ushered in, the
election is a wrenching turning point that could transform the
island's politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is focusing so much on the cross-straits problem,''
said Steven M. Goldstein, an expert on Taiwan politics at Smith
College. ``But no matter who gets elected, there's going to be a
constitutional crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if its own candidate, Vice President Lien Chan, gains a
plurality on Saturday, the formerly impregnable Nationalist Party
will be weakened and will face new challenges to its vast business
holdings and freewheeling political deals.
</P>
<P>
   Both Chen and Soong have gained from their campaigning against
``black gold'' in politics, the term here for the business
manipulations, alliances with mobsters and vote-buying that have
plagued Taiwanese politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get rid of the corruption and organized crime and
vote-buying,'' said Lu Chiu-chien, 42, a social worker from Keelung
city who was furiously waving a Chen flag here Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Soong's credibility was hurt by evidence, released by the
Nationalists, that he diverted party money to personal accounts in
the past. But supporters like Mary Lu, a 45-year-old housewife who
was out cheering for Soong, say he has been persecuted by a
vindictive Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Chen or Soong, if elected, would have to contend with a
Nationalist majority in the legislature, which is not up for
reelection now.
</P>
<P>
   Also, though he is stepping down as president, Lee has said he
wants to serve out his remaining one and a half years as chairman
of the Nationalist Party, a position that has arguably been more
powerful than the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly, the same person will no longer be both president and
chairman of the party,'' said John Hsieh, Taiwan-born director of
the center for Asian Studies at the University of South Carolina.
``A serious confrontation is likely.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The campaign has brought out festering animosities within the
Nationalist Party, and between those who basically favor Taiwan's
independence and the majority who want to leave well enough alone.
</P>
<P>
   Many supporters of Chen and Soong are united in disgust at what
they call the continued corruption of the Nationalists under Lee.
</P>
<P>
   But attitudes toward Taiwan's independence remain the
fundamental cleavage in the electorate, said Hsieh, an expert on
public opinion here.
</P>
<P>
   Cheng Yin-fu, a 41-year-old furniture seller who was wildly
waving a Chen Shui-bian flag at the stadium Friday night, expressed
the attitude that China _ and some worried Taiwanese _ dread to
hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spiritually and morally I support independence,'' he said.
``But as for the actual action, we can wait for a while.''

SOFTWARE WORKERS FORM VIRTUAL UNION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Clever ideas are sometimes born out of frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Courtney was a contractor at Microsoft and got upset two
years ago when the software industry successfully lobbied the
Washington Department of Labor and Industries to allow high-tech
companies to pay straight time instead of time-and-a-half overtime
to workers who earn more than $27.63 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Like other Microsoft contractors, the former Seattle test
engineer was used to working 60- and 80-hour weeks and depended on
the overtime for a big chunk of his pay.
</P>
<P>
   So Courtney started the Washington Alliance of Technology
Workers (washtech.org) to address the issues of contractors who
work at Microsoft. Last year, the group affiliated with the
Communication Workers of America.
</P>
<P>
   Washtech.org is a union _ sort of. It isn't a direct employee
representative because the 6,000 contractors work for many
different companies, so they can't bargain collectively. Federal
labor law requires that workers represented by a union have a
``commonality of interests'' _ such as the same employer, same pay
and same benefits.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
ORGANIZING AROUND ISSUES &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Washtech.org acts like a union in that it organizes around
issues of interest to contractors. For example, the organization
learned that Microsoft did evaluations of its contract workers and
told them how to access online the information that was kept in a
secure company database.
</P>
<P>
   When Microsoft discovered the contractors were reviewing their
evaluations, it resecured the database.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft maintains the evaluations were only ``routine customer
feedback,'' information intended for the firms that actually
employed the contractors. Further, the company says, the
evaluations are common throughout the temporary employment
industry.
</P>
<P>
   But Courtney argued they were personnel files and contends the
state's labor department agreed in January that the contractors
have a right to examine the records.
</P>
<P>
   It's a new model of how to organize a union outside of
collective bargaining, Courtney said. And he claims its tactics are
working: Before Washtech.org was formed, Microsoft had no minimum
benefits for its temporary workers. Now, he said, Microsoft has
rules on minimum time off, health care and training.
</P>
<P>
   Independent truck drivers in Houston are facing some of the same
union organizing hurdles: They can't organize into a traditional
union because they don't work for the same company, said Orell
Fitzsimmons, state director of the Service Employees International
Union in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   But they can hold big rallies, like the one they had last month
in Houston, and they can picket in front of two trucking terminals
to generate support for pay raises and fuel surcharges.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like you need to be ordained by the federal
government,'' Fitzsimmons said.
</P>
<P>
   It's a matter of thinking outside the box and relying on tools
other than the National Labor Relations Act, said Fitzsimmons. But
more people are organizing the growing number of contract workers
by, among other things, sponsoring mass work stoppages.
</P>
<P>
   The new emphasis is a throwback to the confrontational spirit of
the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
HOW DO YOU COLLECT DUES? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unions can represent members in lots of ways, such as ensuring
they get the minimum wage and representing them in workers'
compensation cases.
</P>
<P>
   But there are hurdles to this new model of organization. For
example: dues, the lifeblood of a union.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, unions have collected dues through a payroll
deduction, but that doesn't work when there are multiple employers.
Some of the unions now collect dues through bank drafts, said
Fitzsimmons.
</P>
<P>
   Courtney said he thinks of Washtech.org a bit like the Sierra
Club. Members pay dues voluntarily. And he knows members want
valuable services in exchange, so the group is considering a
training program.
</P>
<P>
   Until it can build a financial base of support, the
Communication Workers of America is footing the bill.
</P>
<P>
   This is a hard thing for unions to do because temporary workers
tend to be transitory and traditionally don't have much allegiance
to their work sites or unions, said Kerry Notestine, an employment
lawyer who represents management with Littler Mendelson in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   It's more of a risk for employers when the temps are long term
and when the whole industry relies on them, Notestine said. And
that pretty much describes the software industry.
</P>

NAPSTER CHANGING MUSIC DISTRIBUTION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ In the seven years that I've been writing this column,
I've seen a lot of hype from companies and promoters of different
products breathlessly proclaiming that their offerings are
revolutionary and will change the way people work, play or
interact.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this seldom is the case. Only a handful of technology
products have been that transforming. E-mail was one; the World
Wide Web was another; so is instant messaging.
</P>
<P>
   And now, I believe, there's a new one _ Napster.
</P>
<P>
   I've written about Napster before _ in a Jan. 28 column about
software and a new service from MP3.com. (See
www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/tech/439487.) Since then, however,
I've been using the software more, talking with other users and
hearing from readers responding to that first column.
</P>
<P>
   It's made me realize that this software is more than just an
easy way to find music in MP3-file format online. It is, in its
most primitive state, the future of music distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Napster lets those with MP3 music files share them easily with
others. The software allows a user to designate a shared folder on
a hard drive, then connects the user with one of several Napster
servers.
</P>
<P>
   The software makes a list of files to be shared and uploads the
list to a central database. Users connected to the server can
search the database and see who has what songs. Transfers occur
directly between users _ in fact, you can disconnect the software
from Napster's server and still receive a file from an individual.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
MUSIC INDUSTRY CONCERNED &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I have not been this excited about a piece of software since the
first time I saw Mosaic, the original World Wide Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   Napster is a portent of things to come. It's not unthinkable
that, 20 years from now, Napster and its progeny could be as
powerful as today's traditional music labels.
</P>
<P>
   The powers-that-be want to, as Eric Clapton once sang, ``kill it
before it grows.'' That's not uncommon for revolutions _ the status
quo seeks to nip dramatic change in the bud. And the threats
against Napster's success are real.
</P>
<P>
   First, there's the legal challenge mounted by the recording
industry, which alleges that Napster's sole intent is to foster
piracy. The San Mateo, Calif.-based company responds that Napster
stores no music on its own servers, and that it can't be
responsible for what its users do with the software.
</P>
<P>
   However, since the lawsuit was filed, the company has posted
warnings on its Web site and in the software itself saying that it
will cancel the account of anyone illegally trading copyright
material. Its unknown whether this actually will be done.
</P>
<P>
   Next is the bandwidth problem. Napster is most popular with
college students, who are big fans of popular music. Many colleges
offer high-speed Internet access in dorm rooms. Napster works best
on a fast connection, because MP3 files _ while smaller than other
audio formats _ are still hefty, about a megabyte per minute of
music.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
BANS MAY BACKFIRE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   University network administrators have been complaining that so
many people are using Napster on their networks that available
bandwidth is being squeezed. As a result, the software has been
banned on some campus networks.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, what's the best way to ensure the popularity of
something among kids? Tell them they can't use it! The bans have
spawned petition drives, and even Web sites, demanding an end to
what the students see as censorship. And Napster becomes even more
popular at campuses that haven't gotten around to banning it.
</P>
<P>
   It also turns out that the recording industry has been
encouraging some of these bans, even though the universities insist
they've taken action because of bandwidth concerns, not because
students might be illegally sharing copyrighted material.
</P>
<P>
   The ham-handed response by the recording industry is typical of
an established entity that doesn't ``get'' the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Some have tried introducing their own proprietary method of
digitally distributing music. For example, Sony, which both owns a
record label and makes consumer electronics, has begun selling a
digital music player.
</P>
<P>
   However, it does not use the MP3 file format, but one of its own
that limits how often you can play a song. In fact, it's so
restrictive that Walter Mossberg, the computer columnist at the
Wall Street Journal, said it ``treats every user like a potential
criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other music formats that can limit how long a
downloaded song can be played or whether it can be moved to another
computer. These either have been developed by the recording
industry or offered in hopes the industry will pick up on them. Not
surprisingly, they have not been as widely adopted as MP3. An open
standard almost always will prevail over systems with restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   What the MP3 trend and Napster have done is expose a flaw in the
way music is delivered. Most Napster users aren't grabbing whole
albums _ they are just getting individual songs.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, if you want just one song from an artist's CD, you
have to buy the whole CD. Digital distribution and trading of music
has allowed people to get just the song they want.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect most Napster users would be willing to pay, say, 50
cents or $1 for a song they really wanted. However, right now they
don't have that option. I don't think they would be willing to pay
if there were any restrictions on being able to transfer the song
to another computer, or other devices.
</P>
<P>
   After all, when you buy a CD, a tape or even an LP, you can play
that music on any player designed for the respective formats. You
can even copy it from one format to another. Why should digital
music be handled any differently?
</P>
<P>
   The smart recording industry move would be to offer individual
songs for small amounts over the Internet, and do so using an open
format such as MP3. Yes, there will be some illicit trading and
copying, but there is now. That goes with the territory.
</P>
<P>
   To see what I'm talking about, I urge you to try Napster if you
have not done so. It's available at www.napster.com. You'll never
think of music the same way again.

A LEGAL VOICE FOR THE ANIMALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By VICKI CROKE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEEDHAM, Mass. _ Meet Steven Wise.
</P>
<P>
   He listens to Mozart. He loves the early Greek and Latin
scholars (Homer, Cicero, Euripides), history (Stephen E. Ambrose's
take on Lewis and Clark), and anything devoted to his favorites _
Abraham Lincoln, the Apostle Paul, and Isaiah Berlin, the British
philosopher and author of ``Four Essays on Liberty.''
</P>
<P>
   He is unself-conscious enough to dance the hokeypokey with his
2-year-old twins, Christopher and Siena, in the presence of a
stranger. He's a vegan both repulsed and still tempted by meat. And
he's not the least bit maudlin about animals. His friend,
primatologist Jane Goodall, calls him a ``sissy'' because he's
queasy around snakes.
</P>
<P>
   He's also the country's most prominent _ and talked about _
animal rights attorney. He may get nauseated touching snakes, but,
he says, ``in a proper case I would go in and fight for them.''
Over the battered desk in his basement office hangs a cartoon that
gently mocks the animal rights movement: A dog raises its paw on
the witness stand before a sign that reads ``Rover v. Wade.'' In a
politically charged environment, his sense of humor and lack of
sentimentality come as a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, justice and how I feel personally about a non-human
animal don't have to connect,'' he says. ``My passion for getting
justice for non-human animals comes more from the justice than from
the non-human animals.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet in courtrooms, on call-in radio talk shows, and in debates,
foes often expect him to be emotional, hysterical even.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly. An experienced litigator, Wise, 49, says he is
accustomed to the other side's attempts to refute every single
thing he says. His feelings don't get hurt.
</P>
<P>
   That's good, because right now, Wise is at the center of a
heated debate over animal rights. An article about his work in this
month's ABA Journal comments: ``Dismissive readers should note that
Wise has touched upon a high-profile national controversy.''
</P>
<P>
   After 20 years of doing battle in court for animals, he is
teaching the first course at Harvard Law School on animal rights
law. His book, ``Rattling the Cage: Toward Legal Rights for
Animals'' (Perseus Books, $25), is already in its second printing a
month after its release.
</P>
<P>
   Wise's goal with ``Rattling the Cage'' is, he says, to ``break
down the wall'' that separates humans and animals under the law. He
wants to give other primates the status of personhood, which would
end lab experiments on chimpanzees and perhaps free them from zoos.
</P>
<P>
   Wise is fond of his cat and dog, but his feelings for chimps go
much deeper than fondness. He compares them to his toddlers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I feel about chimpanzees is the way I feel about
humans,'' he says. ``To me they can hardly be distinguished from
humans _ they are like rough, strong, headstrong, id-run-wild
humans. They're like Christopher but 100 times stronger than he is.
They are other nations who deserve our immense respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Respect is sometimes in short supply in heated animal rights
discussions. On AM radio Wise has been called a nut, a
``Communist'' (that was in Des Moines), and worse.
</P>
<P>
   Some law professors have taken issue with him in a more civil
manner. Richard Epstein, of the University of Chicago, made his
disagreement clear in the National Review last fall: ``While I do
care about the welfare of animals, I consider the welfare of humans
a higher concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Wise takes them all on with relish. To fundamentalist
Christians, he cites scripture. ``That really drives them crazy,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   And in debates with members of the biomedical research world, he
is brutally logical. Looking at his daughter watching an Elmo
video, he says, ``What if Siena's life could be saved by killing a
bonobo (often misleading called Pigmy chimpanzees)? I'd say yes.
But if Siena's life could be saved by killing you, that would be OK
with me as well. So what does that prove? It proves that loving
fathers are willing to do anything to save the lives of their
children. But I'm being outrageously biased and unjust, and that
might be the way fathers act, but that's not the way judicial
systems are supposed to act or fair societies are supposed to
act.''
</P>
<P>
   That sort of talk is getting him noticed.
</P>
<P>
   In the March 13 issue of Time, writer Lance Morrow notes, ``Wise
is serious about the work and, the more you think about it,
reasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rattling the Cage'' is, indeed, a methodical, and sometimes
funny and moving, legal brief. It outlines the ancient basis for
our current legal system and delves deeply into issues of rights,
freedom, and slavery.
</P>
<P>
   It is the comparison between our treatment of the great apes and
the slaves in the past that resonates most with Wise.
</P>
<P>
   And, not surprisingly, it is to Abraham Lincoln that this
compassionate but zealous animal rights attorney turns for wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at the executions for desertion that Lincoln
commuted,'' Wise says. ``He was very, very sympathetic to the
weaknesses of human beings. He understood how we all get frightened
and we all get angry and we all get all sorts of things. We're not
saints. Lincoln really understood that. And he always tempered
justice with mercy.''

PRINTING ACROSS NETWORK TAKES A LOT OF POINTING AND CLICKING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Now that we have two computers in the house, I have set up a
home network. Mostly we play games on the network, but the other
day I wanted to print something from the computer that does not
have the printer connected to it. I couldn't figure out how to do
this across the network. Can you help?
</P>
<P>
   A: Being able to print across a network is one of the handiest
aspects of linking your home computers. Unfortunately, making it
work is not intuitive.
</P>
<P>
   First, you must enable file and print sharing, which you may
already have done if you are moving files between the computers.
Right-click on the Network Neighborhood icon on your desktop and
choose Properties (or use the Network module in the Control Panel)
and then click the File and Print Sharing button. Check the boxes
for both file and print sharing, and click OK.
</P>
<P>
   Next, you'll need to designate a method or protocol the
computers will use to communicate. Still in the Network properties
box, click Add and then Protocol. Click on the Microsoft entry in
the lefthand pane. You'll see a list of different protocols in the
right pane.
</P>
<P>
   Here I'd recommend you use NetBeui for security reasons. If
either of these computers is connected to the Internet and you are
using TCP/IP or IPX for file and print sharing, it is possible for
a hacker to gain access to your computer. Click on NetBeui, and
click OK.
</P>
<P>
   Now, scroll through the list of devices in the Network
properties window until you see your network card combined with
TCP/IP. Double-click on this entry, click on the Bindings tab and
uncheck the File and Print Sharing and Client for Microsoft
Networks boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Click OK, then OK again to close the Network window, and your
computer will reboot.
</P>
<P>
   When your system is running again, go to the Printers folder and
find your regular printer. Right-click on it and choose Sharing
from the menu that appears. Click the check box to enable sharing,
then click OK.
</P>
<P>
   In the Printers folder, you should now see a hand cradling the
icon for your printer, which is Microsoft's warm-and-fuzzy way of
indicating that others can now access the device.
</P>
<P>
   On the other computer, open Network Neighborhood and find the
printer's host computer. Open it, and you should see the printer
there. Right-click on it and choose Install. In most cases, this
will bring over the drivers from the other computer, and run a
quick install dialog that will let you name it as the default
printer. In some cases, you may be asked for a print-driver disk.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a notebook computer and a desktop computer. Both have
the same software installed on them. I use both to check my e-mail,
but I notice that some e-mail messages that I see on the desktop
never make it onto the portable, and vice versa. Why?
</P>
<P>
   A: You have your e-mail software set to delete e-mail from your
Internet provider's mail server on both systems. When you get your
mail, it's deleted from the server. Then, when you use the other
computer to get your mail, it's already gone.
</P>
<P>
   With almost all e-mail programs, you can tell the program to
leave mail on the server. But Internet providers have a limit on
how much mail you can keep on a mail server. If both your computers
are set to not remove mail, you'll exceed your quota and won't be
able to receive more.

HILL COUNTRY HAVEN: NEW B&AMP;Bs, ARTY SHOPS CAN'T TAKE COUNTRY OUT OF(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PATRICIA RODRIGUEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBERLEY, Texas _ Five years ago, Siri Hutcheson bought 66
acres of the old Moody Ranch, in the heart of the Hill Country, so
she could build a small weekend house there. A deserted,
9,000-square-foot hunting lodge with an abandoned swimming pool and
tennis court was part of the deal, but it was largely an
afterthought; the formerly grand lodge was so run-down, cows were
sleeping in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just bought it because I fell in love with it,'' Hutcheson
says of the land, bisected by the intriguingly named Lone Man
Creek. ``I just feel like I'm in paradise out here.''
</P>
<P>
   But slowly, like so many newcomers to Wimberley, she and partner
Camille Cook came to consider the possibility of sharing their
piece of paradise with others.
</P>
<P>
   The lodge was perched on a rise all by itself, overlooking a
rolling, rocky terrain of cedar and oak trees, cactus and
wildflowers. Doing much of the design and the work themselves, the
women turned the front third of the building into three suites,
with stylish stained-cement and tile floors, upscale ranch
furniture and exposed rock walls. They refinished the pool and
restored the grand rock porch, with its built-in stone picnic
tables. In September, their Wimberley Lodge at Lone Man Creek
opened for guests.
</P>
<P>
   It's the kind of story that has been repeated again and again in
recent years _ and one of the examples of how Wimberley is making a
run at Fredericksburg for the unofficial title of B&AMP;B Capital of
the Hill Country.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, nearby Fredericksburg, with more than 300 small
lodges, still probably holds that title. But with more than 100
bed-and-breakfast inns and cabins _ the majority of them having
opened in just the past five years _ plus a revitalized shopping
area and a longstanding reputation as an artists' colony, Wimberley
has become one of the Hill Country's tourism boom towns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been here 10 1/2 years, and Wimberley has changed
radically. The shops, the business atmosphere, the quality of
merchandise _ the whole tenor of it has been raised,'' says Neil
Mallard, who since 1989 has sold pies and cheesecakes out of a
converted gas station called the Wimberley Pie Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wimberley still has its own way of doing things, but it has
recognized the way the rest of the world does things now.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Wimberley, about 45 miles southwest of Austin on Ranch Road 12,
is nestled in a pretty part of the Hill Country, between Cypress
Creek and the Blanco River. In some respects, it's an unlikely spot
for a tourist town. An unincorporated village with a population of,
at best guess, about 9,000, it doesn't even have a square _ its
downtown business district is an unwieldy strip that lacks a focal
point or a unified theme.
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, is part of its charm; Wimberley hasn't yet
built itself into a too-precious, or too-expensive, theme-park kind
of tourist town. It can still be a bit charmingly rough around the
edges. While many of the new cottages and cabins have luxe
furnishings and amenities, others are more rustic. And only a few
offer a real breakfast beyond rolls, coffee and juice.
</P>
<P>
   The town dates back to the mid-1800s but took its name from a
mill owner named Pleasant Wimberley who arrived in 1874. It was a
typical small Texas ranch community; by 1947, when civic volunteer
M.F. Johnson moved here after marrying Bill Johnson, only about 500
people lived here, she remembers. And it was so remote that even as
late as the 1980s and early '90s, the town became a refuge for a
handful of ``chemically sensitive'' people who moved there to
escape cities and city buildings oozing man-made chemicals that
they said made them ill.
</P>
<P>
   But it also had a few unique selling points. Drawn by its cool
riverbanks, Houston and San Antonio families had vacationed here as
far back as the turn of the century. The Blue Hole, a swimming spot
with a strong following today, was first opened as a commercial
swimming hole and campground in 1928.
</P>
<P>
   And Wimberley has a long history of being hospitable to artists.
In the 1930s, painter and sculptor Buck Wynn, renowned for his
murals, was one of several artists to move here. A restored portion
of a mural he originally painted for the Lone Star Brewery in San
Antonio now decorates the local visitors' center.
</P>
<P>
   More artists began coming to the town in the '50s, lured partly
by Aulgerina Lange, a real-estate agent and local booster who
promoted local artists, opened a gallery and dreamed of building an
artists' colony here. The formal colony never really happened, but
artists and craftspeople continued to move in. Today, shoppers can
find local artwork, pottery, jewelry and textiles in many of the
125-plus shops and boutiques.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the shops are destinations in their own right, such as
The Wimberley Glass Works, where artisans conduct free
glass-blowing demonstrations.

WASHINGTON'S `HURRICANE' FORCE SUGGESTS AN UPSET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Up till now, calling the Academy Awards races has had a lot to
do with educated guessing _ a mixture of gauging standard academy
reactions to movies, audience response and personal tastes. But
predicting the Best Actor race includes a factor that the other
races didn't: The Screen Actors Guild Awards.
</P>
<P>
   The awards were announced Sunday, and Kevin Spacey took the top
movie prize for ``American Beauty.'' Since the SAG Awards are
considered an Oscar barometer _ the five previous SAG Best Actor
winners have all taken home Best Actor Oscars _ Spacey's win seems
like a lock. And if you don't think it's a good bet, remember that
Roberto Benigni won the SAG award last year before his ``surprise''
Oscar win for ``Life Is Beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   The only thing standing in Spacey's way is politics, and the
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences faces pressure that the
Screen Actors Guild doesn't: The academy has been accused, during
the past few years, of overlooking African-American actors (in
fact, Delroy Lindo, who was not nominated for his edgy, heartfelt
performance in ``The Cider House Rules,'' has complained that he
was overlooked this year, blaming his miss on poor promotion by
Miramax, ``Cider House's'' studio).
</P>
<P>
   This year, the academy has an amazing performance to consider:
Denzel Washington's turn as beleaguered, wrongly imprisoned boxer
Rubin ``Hurricane'' Carter in ``The Hurricane.'' It's almost odd
that Spacey and Washington are nominated in the same category;
aside from playing besieged males, their performances have so
little in common that comparing them seems specious. Except that
they're both playing men trying to regain their dignity under
trying circumstances: Washington's Carter in a literal prison;
Spacey's Lester Burnham in a metaphorical one, his suburban malaise
from which he's trying to break free.
</P>
<P>
   My pick between the two would be Washington, for a couple of
reasons: One, he is the main _ perhaps the only _ reason to see
``The Hurricane.'' Much has been made of the dignity of his
performance, but few people have noted the vigor and anger of his
portrayal of Carter's early days, his ability to keep a
solitary-confinement scene from lapsing into hallucinatory
silliness, and his softening at movie's end. And two, although
Spacey's performance is wicked fun to watch, he strikes some false
notes, especially in a bedroom argument after onscreen wife Annette
Bening catches him in an onanistic act. Blame that on director Sam
Mendes, who allows a little too much shrillness to creep into
``American Beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   Politics may work against Washington, though. Although
fact-based movies are often accused of twisting the truth, it's
hard to remember one that underwent an onslaught of deconstruction
as quickly as ``The Hurricane.'' The movie hardly portrays Carter
as a saint, but it does add gloss to his image, and critics _ not
necessarily film critics _ complained that it left out information
about Carter's troubled youth and about his unconventional
lifestyle since his 1986 release from prison.
</P>
<P>
   Similar complaints seem likely to scuttle Russell Crowe,
nominated for his performance as a tobacco-company whistle-blower
in ``The Insider.'' The movie depicts ``60 Minutes'' squelching a
Mike Wallace report in which Crowe's character, Jeffrey Wigand,
flatly states that tobacco companies intentionally make their
products addictive. Wallace and ``60 Minutes'' accused the movie of
truth-bending, but Crowe's biggest obstacle to an Oscar win is that
not many people saw his film.
</P>
<P>
   More people saw Crowe in ``The Insider,'' though, than saw
fellow nominees Richard Farnsworth and Sean Penn, in ``The Straight
Story'' and ``Sweet and Lowdown,'' respectively. These are small
movies, and if they'd made more noise at the box office, Farnsworth
and Penn would have more buzz behind their nominations. Farnsworth
is especially affecting in ``The Straight Story,'' David Lynch's
fact-based movie about an old man who journeys from Iowa to
Wisconsin on a riding mower to reconcile with his estranged
brother. And Penn switches back and forth from jerk to genius in
``Sweet and Lowdown'' as a 1930s jazz guitarist who is great
onstage, but a mess offstage. For most people, no doubt including
some academy members, their work remains to be seen _ and in the
case of ``The Straight Story,'' offers many rewards for thoughtful
viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Going to go against the grain here and say that
Denzel Washington is going to take the Oscar from Spacey, breaking
the SAG string.
</P>
<P>
   Personal pick: Washington.

WIMBERLEY, Texas: glass-blowing demonstration. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Still more local artists sell their wares at the monthly Market
Day, a kind of upscale flea market and bazaar, with up to 450
vendors in outdoor booths at a 16-acre park. A tradition for 35
years, it is held the first Saturday of the month, from April
through December, starting at dawn and ending when the last
merchant packs up and goes home.
</P>
<P>
   All of the businesses feed off each other, locals say; better
shopping has brought more tourists, who brought an increased demand
for lodging.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago, you could drive up and down (main artery) Ranch
Road 12 and see maybe two cars,'' says Terrie Bursiel, owner of All
Wimberley Lodging, a bed-and-breakfast booking agency. ``It's not
like that anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   When Mallard began his pie business in '89, he sold most of his
pies wholesale, to restaurants. Now, because there's so much foot
traffic, he sells more than 80 percent of his pies to retail
customers. He added his first tables for eat-in customers just last
year and is trying to figure out how to squeeze more in at the
small shop.
</P>
<P>
   Food, indeed, is the weak link. The town has about a dozen
restaurants, ranging from coffeeshops to pizzerias to unpretentious
spots serving anything from chicken-fried steaks to burgers to
German food to Mexican. But they tend to be fairly simple and
haven't caught up with the sophistication of the town's lodging and
shops.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Not that it matters all that much. One of the best things to do
in Wimberley, honestly, is not much at all.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, there's hiking. Many of the lodges are on private acreage
large enough to explore. Or visit the landmark known as Mount
Baldy, a limestone hill with an elevation reaching about 1,200
feet; it has a path and sculpted steps to the vista.
</P>
<P>
   When the weather's warm, there's swimming, especially at the
Blue Hole, so picturesque it was used for scenes in ``Honeysuckle
Rose,'' the 1980 movie starring Willie Nelson. An old-fashioned
Texas swimming hole, it has banks lined with ancient cypress trees,
from which you can swing on ropes into the water; there's even a
shallow end, lined with smooth pebbles.
</P>
<P>
   (If you don't have the energy for that, there's always sitting;
as you cross the bridge over Cypress Creek, which winds through
town, you might see someone drag a lawn chair right into the
shallow water to catch some rays.)
</P>
<P>
   And there's driving. One of the state's most scenic drives, the
Devil's Backbone, begins just south of Wimberley on Ranch Road 32;
it's a twisting, hilly stretch of about 25 miles heading to Blanco.
</P>
<P>
   But many visitors come just to do nothing. Bursiel says her No.
1 request from visitors is for romantic, secluded cabins,
preferably set off by themselves and overlooking the hills.
</P>
<P>
   Such as the lodge renovated by Hutcheson and Cook. The lodge has
some vestiges of its former days as a property of the wealthy Moody
family; an old airstrip, helpfully marked with ``yield to
aircraft'' signs, is within walking distance of the suites. And the
tennis court and pool have been restored to their former glory.
</P>
<P>
   The women paid good attention to detail, furnishing the rooms
with leather sofas, king-size beds with feather duvets, and antique
claw-foot tubs. There's a telescope for stargazing and binoculars
for bird-watching. The movies stacked near the VCR include a copy
of ``Giant.'' There are Aveda products in the bathroom, plush
towels and linens, and fresh coffee beans and a grinder in the
kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   But those are city touches you'd expect from an upscale lodge;
the best part of the property, like many of those in Wimberley, is
in the great outdoors. In the morning, listen for songbirds or hike
in the surrounding hills, watching for white-tailed deer; in the
evenings, gaze at the stars from the open-air hot tub.
</P>
<P>
   Stay here a couple of days, and you understand why the Wimberley
Chamber of Commerce officially bills the town as ``a little bit of
heaven.''

U.S. MAKES OVERTURE TO IRAN, LIFTING BAN ON SOME IMPORTS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID STOUT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a cautious but warmly worded overture to Iran,
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on Friday announced the
lifting of a ban against some Iranian imports and said the United
States wants to settle the remaining legal disputes between the
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spring is the season of hope and renewal, of planting the
seeds for new crops,'' the secretary said. ``And my hope is that in
both Iran and the United States, we can plant the seeds now for a
new and better relationship in years to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright made no specific promises regarding the settlement of
legal claims left over from the American seizure of Iranian assets
two decades ago, in response to the 1979 takeover of the U.S.
Embassy in Tehran and the holding of American hostages for more
than a year. Rather, she talked about ``eventually concluding a
global settlement of outstanding legal claims.''
</P>
<P>
   Settling those claims, she said, would ``put this issue behind
us once and for all.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright made official what had been rumored for several days:
that the United States would allow Americans once more to import
carpets, caviar, nuts and some dried fruits from Iran. She said,
too, that the United States would explore ways to promote more
contacts between scholars, artists and athletes of the two nations.
</P>
<P>
   But the secretary did not address the continuing American
prohibitions on imports of Iranian oil, or Washington's continuing
opposition to major loans to Iran by the International Monetary
Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's speech, delivered to the Conference on
American-Iranian Relations, was a delicate blend: of mea culpas for
past American support of a repressive government in the name of
Cold War strategy; of reminders that Washington, too, has
grievances; and of the belief that there is much good in common
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   The people of both countries, she said, ``are idealistic; proud;
family-oriented; spiritually aware; and fiercely opposed to foreign
domination.'' The full text of Albright's speech is available on
the State Department's web site, www.state.gov.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no illusions that the United States and Iran will be
able to overcome decades of estrangement overnight,'' she said.
``We can't build a mature relationship on carpets and grain
alone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But the direction of our relations is more important than the
pace,'' the secretary said. ``The United States is willing to
proceed patiently, on a step-by-step basis. Or to move very rapidly
if Iran indicates a desire and commitment to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   That last remark was an unmistakable signal to Iranian
moderates, who made big inroads in recent parliamentary elections
and whose success Washington is eager to nurture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the trend towards democracy, control over the
military, judiciary, courts and police remains in unelected hands,
and the elements of its foreign policy about which we are most
concerned have not improved,'' she said of the current situation in
Iran. ``But the momentum in the direction of internal reform,
freedom and openness is growing stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   The symbolic steps announced on Friday, Albright said, are meant
to show the people of Iran _ ``craftsmen, farmers and fishermen'' _
that the United States bears them no ill will.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary sounded a note of cold pragmatism in calling for
better relations between the countries, in view of what she
described as ``Iraq's lawless regime'' and the ``instability and
illicit narcotics being exported from Afghanistan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Iran lives in a dangerous neighborhood,'' Albright said. ``We
welcome efforts to make it less dangerous.''

   EMPTY-TRUCKS (Brownsville, Texas) _ A government study says
nearly half the cargo trucks crossing from Mexico into the United
States are empty, contributing to chronic traffic problems and the
slow movement of commerce across the border. But federal officials,
ever wary of the drug trade and illegal immigration, say they must
inspect commercial vehicles _ empty or not. By ALISON GREGOR.

   THOMPSON-COLUMN (Washington) _ Bill Bradley and John McCain
offered voters a brief blast of fresh air. Unfortunately, their
campaigns are already being forgotten as we focus on the exploits
and insults of Al Gore and George W. Bush. By the November
election, the Bradley-McCain interlude may be as much an event of
the past as Barry Goldwater's quest for the presidency in 1964 or
Gene McCarthy's campaign in 1968. By ROBERT E. THOMPSON. (Filed

<P>
   WHAT TO DO
</P>
<P>
   FRIDAY:
</P>
<P>
   After checking into your bed-and-breakfast inn, it's time to
think about dinner. Wimberley's restaurant selection is slender,
but options include the Creekview Grill, (512) 842-3663), serving
salads, burgers, steaks and pasta on a covered patio that overlooks
pretty Cypress Creek. At the Cypress Creek Cafe, (512) 847-2515),
across the street, there's a menu of steaks and sandwiches and a
full bar; a bonus is live music on the weekends.
</P>
<P>
   If you're up for more driving, you're within 30 minutes of
Gruene and its famous dance hall, where the Flatlanders, Pat Green,
Hot Club of Cowtown, Junior Brown and Kelly Willis have all played
recently. Information from (830) 606-1281 or www.gruenehall.com
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   SATURDAY:
</P>
<P>
   If breakfast isn't included with your lodging, head to Jitters
coffee shop, (512) 847-6101), for a latte and pastries. Afterward,
you can easily kill a couple of hours wandering through the shops
on the ``square,'' an elongated strip of stores and restaurants in
what passes for downtown Wimberley.
</P>
<P>
   Try Lady of the Lake for jewelry, cards, music, candles and
metaphysical gifts; you can also get a crystal reading there.
Designs in Wax has hand-poured scented candles, made locally;
Rancho Deluxe has crosses, furniture and interior-design fixtures
in a mixture of cowboy, Mexican and Latin American motifs.
</P>
<P>
   We recommend skipping lunch and going straight for the pie at
the Wimberley Pie Co., (512) 847-9462, where nearly 20 varieties,
including pecan, chocolate fudge, Key lime and coconut custard go
for $8.50 to $11 for a whole pie. Eat it there, in a converted gas
station just south of the square, or take it with you to find a
sunny spot for a pie picnic, perhaps on the banks of the Cypress
Creek.
</P>
<P>
   After that, you'll need to work off the calories; one option is
to hike to the summit of Old Baldy, off Ranch Road 2325. If that's
too much effort, make a reservation for a massage, a manicure or a
body treatment in one of the day spas that are rapidly springing
up. These include Touched by Angels, (877) 847-7568,
www.apstx.com/touched), with nail treatments, aromatherapy
treatments and massage; and Serenity, (512) 847-8985, with
Japanese-style body treatments and hot tubs.
</P>
<P>
   For dinner, make reservations at The Blair House, (512)
847-1111, www.blairhouseinn.com,) a country inn that offers a
five-course dinner on Saturday nights only. Chef Jonnie Stansbury,
who also teaches cooking class and is working on a PBS cooking
show, whips up gourmet fare from seasonal ingredients; meals might
include fresh-baked focaccia with kalamata olives, roasted corn
soup with chipotle cream, beef tenderloin and roasted new
vegetables, with a fresh strawberry torte for dessert. Dinner is
$50 per person and includes wine.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY:
</P>
<P>
   After breakfast, enjoy more of the Hill Country scenery by
taking a drive. The best known is Devil's Backbone, which stretches
along Ranch Road 32 for 25 miles just south of town, but there are
good views on nearly every road out of town.
</P>
<P>
   If it's warm enough, stop by the Blue Hole swimming area for a
dip, (512) 847-9127. A temporary membership gets you in for $5 per
person per day; it's open sunup to sundown, and brave souls were
already testing the waters in March.

&HT;     AGENTS WORRY ABOUT MEXICAN BORDER INCURSION

<P>
   EL PASO, Texas _ U.S. Border Patrol agents say that the
incursion into the United States by two vehicles loaded with
Mexican soldiers was more serious than reported, and that shots
fired could be linked to a reported bounty on agents by a major
drug-trafficking cartel.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was no accident,'' one agent, who asked that his name not
be used, said of the Tuesday night incident near Santa Teresa,
N.M., northwest of El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   The Border Patrol said Wednesday that the Mexican army vehicles
entered the United States about 10:30 p.m. Tuesday after straying
across the poorly marked boundary. Two shots were fired from one of
the Mexican vehicles, but no one was wounded.
</P>
<P>
   One vehicle retreated into Mexico, but the nine soldiers riding
in the second were detained temporarily by the Border Patrol before
being returned to their country Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   An agency spokesman continued to downplay the incident, saying
it ``was apparently accidental, and we don't know why they fired
the shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials said the soldiers were on an anti-drug patrol
and that the whole episode was under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   However, some rank-and-file Border Patrol agents said things
were not as simple as the official statements made them sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came more than a mile into U.S. territory and were
driving around for a while,'' one agent said of the Mexican
soldiers in Humvees.
</P>
<P>
   ``They figured they could sneak up on an agent and collect the
$200,000,'' said the agent, who asked not to be identified. He was
referring to an internal Border Patrol memo last month stating that
the Juarez, Mexico, drug cartel had placed a $200,000 bounty on the
head of every U.S. law enforcement officer on the border.
</P>
<P>
   George Swank, a spokesman for the patrol's office in Marfa,
Texas, said at the time that he could not discuss the memo
``because it is a sensitive issue. It's a credible threat, and it
extends all along the border.''
</P>
<P>
   Agents in El Paso said that memo and the incident in Santa
Teresa have many agents nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's heating up out here, and it's all about that bounty,''
one agent said. ``More (agents) are signing out automatic weapons
than ever before.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the agents' concern for their safety, Border Patrol
spokesman Doug Mosier said: ``There is always concern for agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no evidence that this was not an accident, and there's
no evidence to connect the bounty with this (Tuesday's) incident,''
Mosier said from his El Paso office.
</P>
<P>
   Border Patrol officials said the memo and the trespassing by the
Mexican military are under investigation by the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Emilio Anchondo Paredes, a spokesman for the state
government in Chihuahua, Mexico, said an internal affairs unit of
the Mexican military was looking into the Tuesday incident ``to see
if it was an illegal, intentional act.''
</P>
<P>
   Marco Antonio Fraire, a spokesman for the Mexican Consulate in
El Paso, called the incident a ``regrettable mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   As to why shots had been fired, Fraire said: ``We don't have any
details on that. We are still getting information on it.''

   NEW YORK _ It's not often that 150 20-somethings get together to
watch a dirty movie _ at least, not one that involves a cast of
60-somethings.
</P>
<P>
   But that was what was happening on Thursday night at the
premiere of ``The Lifestyle,'' a new documentary about swingers in
the suburbs that opened at the Pioneer Theater in Manhattan's East
Village. The film, which has been well received, follows the
exploits of what Stephen Holden, a critic for The New York Times,
called ``gray-haired, potbellied, cellulite-jiggling, over-60
orgiasts.''
</P>
<P>
   That demographic was not in evidence on Thursday. The premiere
and the post-screening celebration at Two Boots restaurant on
Avenue A drew a large crowd from another odd subculture: the
independent film scene. Young men in heavy black spectacles, and
the young women who love them, were everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   While some of the audience seemed a little shaken by the film _
there was a noticeable rush on the red wine _ most of the downtown
film buffs seemed singularly nonchalant about all the naked sex
among people old enough to be their parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say the subject matter is shocking,'' said Todd
Solondz, the director of ``Happiness,'' the suburban satire about
incest. Wearing heavy dark spectacles, he said in a voice that
sounded like Woody Allen on tranquilizers, ``The subject matter is
the subject matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Solondz was flanked by David Schisgall, the 32-year-old director
of ``The Lifestyle,'' and Schisgall's girlfriend, Evgenia Peretz.
She insisted Schisgall was not a swinger. ``Absolutely not,'' she
said. ``He's just a director.'' She added, however, that she had
warned her parents about the film before introducing them to him to
avoid that ```So what's your movie about?' moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Schisgall, also wearing heavy black glasses, confirmed that he
was not a swinger, though he admitted that he and his crew got
naked several times on the set. ``Every time they were naked, we
were naked,'' he said. ``When you go to a black-tie event, you want
to dress the part.''
</P>
<P>
   David Samuels, another writer in heavy spectacles, cornered
Schisgall to rave about a scene that involved a 70-year-old man,
another man's wife and a hammocklike contraption called a sex
sling. ``That is an image that has never ever been on screen
before,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some strove to discuss the film in more high-minded terms. Rufus
Griscom, a founder of nerve.com, the erotica Web site, said he
detected a sense in the audience of ``young people coming to terms
with their own sexual prejudices.'' Yeah, and that sex sling thing.
</P>
<P>
   Schisgall spent most of the evening shaking hands, but found
time to discuss the film with someone he called his toughest
critic: Jane Papish, his mother. Was she concerned when her son
told her what his film was about? ``I was more concerned that he'd
taken a job without health insurance,'' Papish said. ``David's
always done his own thing.''
</P>
<P>
   While most felt Schisgall had created an intriguing portrait,
few saw a similar lifestyle in their immediate future. Heather
O'Donnell, a friend of Schisgall's, asked jokingly, ``How long you
think before everyone at this party starts to swing?'' Hilary
Liftin, a writer, replied, ``Not for a long, long time.''

   IRAN-U.S. (Washington) _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
on Friday lifted a narrow slice of America's broad economic
sanctions against Iran and declared a commitment to take far more
extensive steps toward ending two decades of hostility ``if Iran
indicates a desire and commitment to do so.'' In a speech here
Friday that Clinton administration officials described as their
most explicit overture to the moderates who won Iranian
parliamentary elections last month, Albright described a road map
for economic normalization of relations. Without naming them, she
held out the prospect for ending bans on American investment in
Iran's oil industry and the blockage of major loans to Tehran by
the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. But she made no
mention of a resumption of full diplomatic relations. By David E.

Officials of the Fulton County Sheriff's Office said they did not

two deputies. The shooter escaped after being wounded by one of the
deputies, and sheriff's officials said they were looking for
Al-Amin. By David Firestone.

   RAIL-MERGER (Undated) _ Regulators in Washington Friday blocked
a plan to create an enormous cross-border transcontinental railroad
_ combining Burlington Northern Santa Fe and the Canadian National
_ by slapping a moratorium on all rail mergers until rules are
rewritten over the next 15 months. In deciding to impose the
unusual moratorium, the three members of the Surface Transportation
Board contradicted Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater, who
opposed a delay, and supported the position of competing railroads

vaguely Cycladic features and a tendency to make motion picture
professionals gush, weep and suddenly remember their parents. Just
two weeks after the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences
was forced to resend 4,200 of this year's Oscar ballots because the
first batch had been mislaid by the U.S. Postal Service, the
academy had to announce Friday morning that somebody has stolen the

   CIA-PROPAGANDA (Undated) _ ) _ Watch the 1955 animated version
of ``Animal Farm,'' and you'll notice the ending is different than
in the book. Another example of Hollywood butchering great
literature? Yes, but in this case the film's secret producer was
the Central Intelligence Agency. The CIA, it seems, was worried
that the public might be too influenced by Orwell's
pox-on-both-their-houses critique of capitalism and communism. So
after George Orwell's death in 1950, agents were dispatched to buy
the film rights to ``Animal Farm'' from his widow in order to make
its message more overtly anti-communist. Rewriting the end of
Animal Farm is just one example of the often absurd lengths to
which the CIA went between 1947 and 1967 that are recounted in a
new book. By Laurence Zuckerman. (1400 words)

   ONLINE-LIFE-COACHES (New York) _ Enrollment is up at Coach U.,

practicing, said Sandy Vila, president of Coach U., which began

   LEATHER-PROTEST (New York) _ It may seem surprising that the

of designers returned to fur and overall fur sales rose 10 percent
this winter. One might think the group would go after more modest
game. Instead, activists are girding for what they call ``The Big
One.'' They are convinced they can coax and sloganize leather into
a state of political incorrectness. But that seems unlikely.

   FOOTBALL'S GOAL AT STILLMAN: BUILD CHARACTER. After a 50-year
hiatus, football has finally returned to historically black
Stillman College. Why? In addition to boosting alumni interest in
the 124-year-old campus, President Earnest McNealy wants to
increase the number of males on campus. However, as a Division III
program, Stillman cannot offer athletic scholarships or establish
endowments. Players must find financial aid, loans and other
assistance to attend Stillman. In other words, they must have a
burning desire to attend the school and play football. In this
article, Bill Maxwell explains how, instead of exploiting black
athleticism, Stillman is dedicated to grooming young people for
bright futures. (slugged:

   CHANGE SPINS FASTER THAN TIME. Today, the average car has more
computing power in its glove compartment than did the Lunar landing
craft. Just more than a decade ago, only the wealthy could afford a
cellular phone at a cost of $1,500. Now these phones are
practically free. Everything around us is changing _ and changing
fast, writes Nat Irvin II in this feature from Emerge magazine. And
from the looks of things, the changes of the future will only come
faster. Irvin ponders the wonders of the technological innovations
that have occurred within the last 30 years and peers into the
future. For example, by the year 2020 your grandchildren will be
born with their DNA encoded and will likely be implanted with some
kind of genetic DNA chip and can expect to live to 2120. (slugged:

   AND NEXT TO THE TEN COMMANDMENTS, A LAKOTA SUN DANCE POLE. Last
week, South Dakota's Gov. Bill Janklow, a Republican, signed Bill
HB1261 permitting South Dakota public schools to display the Ten
Commandments, along with other objects and documents of cultural,
legal or historical significance. In this commentary, columnist Tim
Giago writes: ``The centerpiece of the Lakota spirituality is the
sweat lodge or inipi. If my understanding of HB1261 is correct,
then the public schools of South Dakota would have to allow the
Indian students who practice their traditional Lakota spirituality
to construct sweat lodges in the schools. The most sacred of
ceremonies is the Sun Dance. Should the Lakota and Dakota students
be allowed to build a Sun Dance pole in the school hallways?''
Giago traces the destructive consequences of mixing church and
state. (slugged: BC-NEW-AMERICA-LAKOTA-JOURNAL-NYTSF)

   THE OTHER TEXAS REPUBLICAN ON THE RISE: HISPANIC TONY GARZA.
There's another Texas star in the Republican party: Texas Railroad
Commissioner Tony Garza. Some say he is the real future of the GOP.
Not your average Republican, Garza, whose four grandparents were
Mexican, hails from Brownsville, Texas _ a poor, predominantly
Hispanic city along the democratically entrenched Texas-Mexico
border. A down-home guy, Garza speaks English and Spanish, and
despite his law-school education and party affiliation, he's a
south Texan to his core. This profile from Hispanic magazine looks
at the policies and politics that have set Garza on the road to
national prominence during his 11 years in public office. Garza's
good buddy? You guessed it. Gov. George W. Bush. (slugged:

 By TIM GIAGO (NANWICA KCIJI)  
 &HT;    We knew Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson long before they were
born. Back then they were called missionaries.
 &HT;    When you consider that several generations of Indian children
were forced _ at a very early age _ to go to church six days a week
and twice on Sunday, the posting of the Ten Commandments on a
school bulletin board seems a bit trivial. But that was then and
this is now.
 &HT;    Last week, South Dakota's Gov. Bill Janklow, a Republican,
signed Bill HB1261 permitting South Dakota public schools to
display the Ten Commandments, along with other objects and
documents of cultural, legal or historical significance that have
influenced and helped form the nation's government and legal
systems. But the Ten Commandments may not be posted more
prominently than other objects and documents.
 &HT;    Believe it or not, the legislative supporters of this nonsense
actually think it will stand up to constitutional scrutiny. (The
U.S. Supreme Court outlawed the posting of the commandments in
public schools two decades ago.) What does the Constitution say?
 &HT;    The First Amendment says Congress shall make no law respecting
an establishment of religion, which has been interpreted to require
a separation of church and state.
 &HT;    The separation of church and state held no meaning to Congress
when it came to the indigenous people of this land. In the 19th and
20th centuries, the Indian reservations were sliced up like pieces
of pie. Different sections were awarded to various religious sects
to build churches and schools. The object was to Christianize the
Indian.
 &HT;    Kill the Indian and save the child was the edict coming from the
U.S. Congress. In many instances, not only did the church kill the
Indian adult's spirituality, it also killed the culture, language
and traditions of the child.
 &HT;    The centerpiece of the Lakota spirituality is the sweat lodge or
inipi. If my understanding of HB1261 is correct, then the public
schools of South Dakota would have to allow the Indian students who
practice their traditional Lakota spirituality to construct sweat
lodges in the schools.
 &HT;    The most sacred of ceremonies is the Sun Dance. Should the
Lakota and Dakota students be allowed to build a Sun Dance pole in
the school hallways?
 &HT;    Isn't it a wonder that the U.S. Congress only allowed Christians
and Mormons to build schools and churches on the Indian
reservations? Why weren't the Muslims or Buddhists given the same
option? Probably because, as Gov. George W. Bush is so fond of
saying, ``This is a Christian nation.''
 &HT;    Is it? Who gave the Christians the right to call this a
Christian nation?
 &HT;    But the real question is why were different religious
organizations allowed to build churches and schools on the
reservations at all? Separation of church and state? Get real!
 &HT;    Generations of Indian children have grown up in the clutches of
the ``Religious Right.'' The religious zealots who moved onto the
reservations arrived with a vengeance. They used the wrath of the
Lord as their weapon of choice.
 &HT;    If there was a blizzard with snow drifts 6 feet high and wind
chill factors at 50 degrees below zero, the Indian students at the
mission boarding schools still marched in military ranks from their
dormitories to attend the daily church services.
 &HT;    We had our Jerry Falwells and Pat Robertons long before there
was a Jerry Falwell or Pat Roberton. These missionaries _ in their
fervent zeal to save our souls _ took thousands of Indian children
from their parents and ``adopted out'' the children to white
families.
 &HT;    The Mormon Church was famous for this practise. They practically
stripped certain reservations of their children and turned these
young captives into little slaves.
 &HT;    Did the parents of these children care? You bet they did, but
they had no say about what happened to their flesh and blood. They
could only sit at home and cry.
 &HT;    I suggest the Christians practice their religion at home or in
their churches. Keep it out of the schools. I do not care what
religion you belong to or if you belong to one at all. Just don't
force your beliefs on those who do not want it.
 &HT;    The smallest minority in this nation, the minority that used to
be the majority, has experienced first hand the damage that forced
religion can have upon a people. We didn't become the smallest
minority by accident. The religious zealots had a lot to do with
it.
 &HT;    In a classic example of gobbledygook, Gov. Janklow explained his
support for Bill HB1261. ``If you don't believe in God, it's not
any problem to suggest whether or not you have any other gods
before you. To the extent you do, you get to pick who it is because
it doesn't tell you who god is.''
 &HT;    Say what?
 &HT;    Sounds like something I heard in catechism class many years ago.
Yes, religious instructions were a regular part of our school
curriculum, but of course, our lessons were often spoken in Latin.
I never knew the governor was bilingual.

 By KIMBERLY GARCIA  
 &HT;    Republicans across the nation see Texas Railroad Commissioner
Tony Garza as the future of their party. It's an odd declaration
given that Garza is not your typical Republican.
 &HT;    Garza comes from Brownsville, Texas _ a poor, predominantly
Hispanic city along the democratically entrenched Texas-Mexico
border. Despite his law-school education and party affiliation,
Garza is a south Texan to his core. He's a down-home guy who's
comfortable on both sides of the border, speaking both English and
Spanish.
 &HT;    During 11 years in public office, Garza has championed causes
not usually associated with the GOP. As chief executive of the
county where he grew up, or as Cameron County judge, Garza helped
poor people gain access to critical health care, and to water and
wastewater services in substandard developments called colonias. As
secretary of state, he used computers to improve public access to
government documents.
 &HT;    Still, Garza holds true to Republican ideals of limited
government, free enterprise, strong families and a strong military.
 &HT;    ``I'm not any less conservative than other Republicans,'' Garza
says. ``But I do realize there are issues we have to address. In
terms of tone of discussion and building coalitions, maybe I'm not
a typical Republican. You need to include other groups to get
things accomplished. That hasn't always been a Republican
hallmark.''
 &HT;    Garza's unique combination of conservatism, compassion and
conciliatory spirit has served his political career well. He's
blazing a path across Texas that could take him to Washington D.C.,
especially if his good pal, Texas Governor George W. Bush, becomes
president of the United States.
 &HT;    Neither Garza nor Bush would speculate about Garza following
Bush to the White House if Bush is elected president, but Garza has
been joining Bush's presidential campaign trail whenever possible.
 &HT;    ``It's premature to talk about those decisions,'' Bush spokesman
Scott McClellan says. ``Garza is a trusted friend and advisor of
Gov. Bush ... He's a rising star in the Republican Party and he's
helping us broaden the base of the party.''
 &HT;    About Bush, Garza says, ``We're very close friends and his whole
family has been very supportive of me. There's nothing I wouldn't
do for G. W. Bush, but my focus right now has to be on being the
best railroad commissioner I can be. If I do that, the future will
take care of itself.''
 &HT;    Garza began his political career with a bang. When elected
Cameron County judge in 1988, he defeated a well-known Democrat who
had been county judge for 12 years. At age 28, Garza became the
youngest person and the first Hispanic Republican in the state to
win a countywide office along the vast Texas-Mexico border. Garza
served in that capacity until 1994, when he made an unsuccessful
bid for state attorney general.
 &HT;    In 1995, he became Bush's first appointee as secretary of state
and one of Bush's select few senior advisors, particularly on
border and Mexico-related issues. Today, Garza is the
highest-ranking minority in Texas as commissioner of one of the
state's most powerful regulatory agencies.
 &HT;    The three-member commission oversees regulation on the $60
billion oil and gas industry. And that's not even mentioning
Garza's accolades. In 1999, Garza became the first recipient of the
Republican National Hispanic Assembly's Rising Star Award.
 &HT;    ``Tony represents a new generation of political leaders,'' says
Luigi Crespo, executive director of the assembly that serves as the
Hispanic outreach arm of the Republican Party. ``He's a role model
for young Hispanics like myself. We're very proud of his
achievements in Texas.''
 &HT;    So how does a guy who didn't aspire to a political career end up
on the brink of national politics?
 &HT;    Garza's parents sowed the seeds of his conservatism. All four of
his grandparents were from Mexico. His father was a hardworking
small businessman who thought he could make it in this country if
the government left him alone. Antonio Garza operated a Texaco
station in the heart of downtown Brownsville from 7 a.m. until 10
p.m. for nearly 26 years. He also was a World War II veteran who
favored less taxes, less government and a strong military.
 &HT;    Garza's mother, Lita, died from cancer when he was 13. She
taught Garza the value of family and religion. After Garza
completed law school at Southern Methodist University in 1983, he
returned to the valley to practice law. He dabbled in supporting
Republican political candidates, but his father's apolitical views
sustained Garza's skepticism of government.
 &HT;    Instead of political activism, Garza tried to improve his
hometown through community service, coaching youth sports and
serving on the local health center's board of directors. By 1988,
he was warming up to the idea of holding public office when the
Republican Party approached him to run against a controversial
Democrat for county judge.
 &HT;    Garza began knocking on doors, and his friendship with Bush soon
followed. Bush called Garza during the race to offer help
campaigning and raising money. Bush also showed up for Garza's
swearing-in ceremony after he won the election.
 &HT;    So far, Garza has yet to disappoint his prominent friend.
Besides helping the indigent and ending a stalemate over two
international bridges as Cameron County judge, Garza also helped
the county improve its bond rating to the highest rating.
 &HT;    His proudest accomplishment so far is forging partnerships with
two state agencies to plug abandoned oil wells that threaten
important watersheds. In one case, the commission is working with
the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission to plug wells
threatening the Spence Reservoir that supplies nearly 305,000
people with water in west Texas. In the other case, the commission
is working with the state's General Land Office to plug
noncompliant oil and gas wells on state-leased land along the
coast.
 &HT;    ``We could not get to all those wells on our own and the
agencies could not collect all the data on their own, so working
together we can protect these water supplies,'' says Gene Acuna,
Garza's chief spokesman at the railroad commission. ``Some people
were surprised the railroad commission would start partnerships
like this. The commission doesn't usually look out for the
long-term impact on the environment. Tony looks at the long-term
impacts on people of this state. He looks at these partnerships in
ways people haven't before, and he makes them work. That's what's
unique about Tony Garza.''

 By NAT IRVIN II  
 &HT;    ``When do you think things are going to slow down?'' a friend
recently asked me as we discussed the realities of rapid social
change taking place around us.
 &HT;    ``How about by 2020?'' I responded with a certain inexact
wryness. I understood exactly how my friend felt. Everything around
us is changing _ and changing fast. And from the looks of things,
the changes of the future will only come faster.
 &HT;    Jaron Lanier, who coined the term ``virtual reality,'' says,
``There's a perception that things are going to change at such a
rapid rate that at some point (in the future) something very
dramatic will change about the fundamental situation of people in
the universe.''
 &HT;    Futurist Stephen Bertman says we are feeling the effects of
``hyperculture,'' where the social environment becomes so fluid
that the acceleration of one activity tends to induce acceleration
in other activities.
 &HT;    Much of what we are experiencing is a result of technological
innovation that has occurred in just the past 30 years. Speed
begets speed.
 &HT;    When the O jays recorded ``For the Love of Money'' in the early
1970s, the first microchip had barely been created. Today, the
average car has more computing power in the glove compartment than
did the Lunar landing craft, which landed on the moon in 1968, the
year Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated.
 &HT;    In 1977, the president of Digital Computing told the World
Future Society that ``there was no need for anyone to own a
personal computer in their home.'' In 2000, we already are in the
post-PC world and into the world of www _ the World Wide Web,
protocol for which did not even exist until 1993, after Bill
Clinton became president.
 &HT;    Just more than a decade ago, only the wealthy could afford a
cellular phone at a cost of $1,500. Now these phones are
practically free and the number of wireless customers in the United
States has jumped to 79 million from 16 million a decade ago, says
the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association.
 &HT;    Cell-phone manufacturer Nokia estimates there will be 1 billion
wireless phone users around the world by 2002. In Tanzania and
Ghana, school kids keep in touch using a wireless local loop with a
combination of pagers and wireless pay phones. And while many of us
still cling to the African adage, ``It takes a village to raise a
child,'' we now find ourselves on the Web creating a
``cybervillage'' in chat rooms instead of sitting on the front
porch.
 &HT;    After hearing the latest hit record by the Supremes, teen-agers
used to run to the nearest H.L. Green's drug store to purchase a
single 45 record. Perhaps as early as 2002, teen-agers will create
their own personalized, ubiquitous music streams of digital radio
featuring Sam Cooke, Otis Redding, Marvin Gaye, Lauryn Hill or
anyone from any source on the globe.
 &HT;    When the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was passed, who could have
ever imagined that blacks would one day vote without leaving home?
E-voting (electronic voting) is already being tested in three
states, and, by as early as the next election cycle in 2002, some
states may offer voters the convenience of casting their e-ballots,
not only from their home, but from their job, church or any place
in the world.
 &HT;    You could be able to use your phone, television or even your
digital Web TV browser.
 &HT;    Remember when politicians used to spend money to get out the
vote, or people worried that blacks might stay home on election
day? Wonder what Dr. King would say if he were alive today?
 &HT;    But look at what other changes lie ahead. By the end of 2000, we
may see the completion of the Human Genome Project, the
international effort to locate, decode and sequence the estimated
100,000 genes that comprise the human genome.
 &HT;    By March 2005, IBM expects to complete development of its
computer ``Blue Gene'' that will be 1 million times faster than the
average desktop computer and 500 times speedier than the fastest
computer today. It will perform 1 million billion mathematical
operations per second. This will be the first computer capable of
solving one of the most baffling mysteries of the human body: how
proteins are formed.
 &HT;    By 2007, computer programs will not only be written, but will
actually be grown fusing biology and technology to create computer
programs trained to do certain diagnostic tasks, including
correcting itself.
 &HT;    By 2020, your grandchildren will be born with their DNA encoded
and will likely be implanted with some kind of genetic DNA chip and
can expect to live to 2120.
 &HT;    When will things slow down? Not anytime soon.

 By BILL MAXWELL  
 &HT;    TUSCALOOSA, Ala. _ To Theophilus Danzy, the 69-year-old head
coach at private, historically black Stillman College, football is
no mere game. While acknowledging that such a view of the sport has
become cliche, he has proof that the gridiron, with the right adult
leaders on the sidelines, is the ideal venue for building
character.
 &HT;    Why did football return to Stillman in 1999 after a 50-year
hiatus? After all, the school, which is affiliated with the
Presbyterian Church U.S.A., has an average student population of
about 1,000, and it is continually strapped for money.
 &HT;    ``When President Earnest McNealy announced that the school was
bringing back football, I asked why,'' said Danzy, who had been
retired since 1990. ``I said, `God dog, that's a big chore.' Then,
I realized that our president has a mission.''
 &HT;    In addition to boosting alumni interest in the 124-year-old
campus, McNealy wanted to increase the number of males on campus.
During recent years, the college population has been about 65
percent to 70 percent female, and McNealy believed that football
would help balance the scale.
 &HT;    He was right.
 &HT;    ``It is safe to say we probably have 200 male students who would
not be here otherwise,'' McNealy told the Tuscaloosa News.
 &HT;    Incredibly, 300 students tried out for the squad, with more than
100 biting the dust early on and others failing the cut. McNealy
and the coaches expect football to have a domino effect. They
believe that even males who do not want to play football will want
to be on an all-black campus that has the sport.
 &HT;    The next task was to find the right coach. ``I selected a coach
that I thought would bring the same types of values to the table
that are at this institution already,'' McNealy told the News.
 &HT;    Most of those values are manifested throughout the tiny campus,
and the head coach must be in sync. ``If (athletes) don't do their
work, they will go home,'' McNealy said. ``If they don't behave,
they go home. We fully expect our students to go to class. We fully
expect them to graduate.'' Violence is not tolerated, and even
profanity is cause for expulsion. For example, one player who was
overheard cursing was kicked out of school.
 &HT;    ``So far,'' McNealy told the News, ``our football players are
among the most controlled students on campus.''
 &HT;    Most of the credit goes to Danzy, the straight-talking
fatherlike figure who acknowledges that he is ``very firm.''
Beneath that firmness, however, are a vision and a willingness to
save troubled young black males. When McNealy asked Danzy to be
Stillman's first contemporary football coach, he saw a chance to
renew efforts he had started in 1958, when he took his first
coaching job.
 &HT;    ``I had been reading that one in every three black males
couldn't vote because they were in jail or in some other kind of
situation where voting was taken away from them,'' Danzy said. ``I
told myself that the best way for me to help is to step in here at
Stillman. I had been successful every place I worked.''
 &HT;    He can rattle off the names of many current and former NFL
African-American players whom he turned around and put on the right
path, especially at Alcorn State University in Mississippi. But he
takes most pride in the ordinary ones who are making a difference.
 &HT;    ``Everywhere I go, I see them in places where I have recruited
hundreds of kids,'' Danzy said. ``I see successful professionals
who, when I first got them, their teachers said they would never
make it. And now, many are assistant principals, business
executives, attorneys, teachers, some even pastors. I feel that I
have succeeded when they go back into the community they came from
and produce.''
 &HT;    The coach knows student success is a two-way street. On an
office bulletin board, for example, he has written the words
``grade sign-off sheet.'' The note reminds him to regularly monitor
_ complete with signatures _ the players' course grades.
 &HT;    ``I have to make sure they're doing their part, that they are
studying,'' he said, taking a telephone call from a prospective
linebacker in Mississippi. ``They must do their part academically.
They just can't sit around and wait. But my job is to set up
mechanisms and tools to make sure the kids function well.''
 &HT;    As a Division III program, Stillman cannot offer athletic
scholarships or establish endowments. Players must find financial
aid, loans and other assistance to attend Stillman. In other words,
they have to have a burning desire to attend the school and play
football.
 &HT;    ``Not having scholarships makes coaching doubly hard,'' Danzy
said. ``You sell the young men the concept that you want to get
them an education. It is very hard to retain many of these young
men. They have faced many negative forces and still face them, and
it is tougher than ever. Regardless of football, you want to make
sure they get an education. Even if a kid stays here two or three
years, he is elevated. He is a better person.''
 &HT;    Danzy said too many high schools and colleges exploit black
athleticism and discard it _ and the player. He believes the
historically black campus is best for those with troubled pasts.
 &HT;    Unlike traditional campuses with thousands of students, which
also may have special programs for minority athletes, the typical
black campus is a network of caring.
 &HT;    ``Black schools have more net to catch the troubled kid,'' Danzy
said. ``I have no problem in saying that this thing is separate,
segregation. You take care of yours. When you cease to take care of
yours, then things go awry.''
 &HT;    Florida natives Michael Cunningham, 21, Jermaine Blakely, 21,
and Antwan Blatch, 19, each the first in his immediate family to
attend college, appreciate their coach's philosophy and credit it,
along with their parents, for their success. Each is determined to
earn a degree and become a professional after football. Each knows
that he is at Stillman because of football.
 &HT;    How does Danzy consistently inspire most of his players, many
from the inner city, to work hard and stay on the straight and
narrow?
 &HT;    ``I try to see farther than they're looking,'' he said. ``I try
to cultivate them in a way that will bring them into society and
show them the value of doing a good job. I want to build character
among young black men.''

 By TIM GIAGO (NANWICA KCIJI)  
 &HT;    We knew Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson long before they were
born. Back then they were called missionaries.
 &HT;    When you consider that several generations of Indian children
were forced _ at a very early age _ to go to church six days a week
and twice on Sunday, the posting of the Ten Commandments on a
school bulletin board seems a bit trivial. But that was then and
this is now.
 &HT;    Last week, South Dakota's Gov. Bill Janklow, a Republican,
signed Bill HB1261 permitting South Dakota public schools to
display the Ten Commandments, along with other objects and
documents of cultural, legal or historical significance that have
influenced and helped form the nation's government and legal
systems. But the Ten Commandments may not be posted more
prominently than other objects and documents.
 &HT;    Believe it or not, the legislative supporters of this nonsense
actually think it will stand up to constitutional scrutiny. (The
U.S. Supreme Court outlawed the posting of the commandments in
public schools two decades ago.) What does the Constitution say?
 &HT;    The First Amendment says Congress shall make no law respecting
an establishment of religion, which has been interpreted to require
a separation of church and state.
 &HT;    The separation of church and state held no meaning to Congress
when it came to the indigenous people of this land. In the 19th and
20th centuries, the Indian reservations were sliced up like pieces
of pie. Different sections were awarded to various religious sects
to build churches and schools. The object was to Christianize the
Indian.
 &HT;    Kill the Indian and save the child was the edict coming from the
U.S. Congress. In many instances, not only did the church kill the
Indian adult's spirituality, it also killed the culture, language
and traditions of the child.
 &HT;    The centerpiece of the Lakota spirituality is the sweat lodge or
inipi. If my understanding of HB1261 is correct, then the public
schools of South Dakota would have to allow the Indian students who
practice their traditional Lakota spirituality to construct sweat
lodges in the schools.
 &HT;    The most sacred of ceremonies is the Sun Dance. Should the
Lakota and Dakota students be allowed to build a Sun Dance pole in
the school hallways?
 &HT;    Isn't it a wonder that the U.S. Congress only allowed Christians
and Mormons to build schools and churches on the Indian
reservations? Why weren't the Muslims or Buddhists given the same
option? Probably because, as Gov. George W. Bush is so fond of
saying, ``This is a Christian nation.''
 &HT;    Is it? Who gave the Christians the right to call this a
Christian nation?
 &HT;    But the real question is why were different religious
organizations allowed to build churches and schools on the
reservations at all? Separation of church and state? Get real!
 &HT;    Generations of Indian children have grown up in the clutches of
the ``Religious Right.'' The religious zealots who moved onto the
reservations arrived with a vengeance. They used the wrath of the
Lord as their weapon of choice.
 &HT;    If there was a blizzard with snow drifts 6 feet high and wind
chill factors at 50 degrees below zero, the Indian students at the
mission boarding schools still marched in military ranks from their
dormitories to attend the daily church services.
 &HT;    We had our Jerry Falwells and Pat Robertons long before there
was a Jerry Falwell or Pat Roberton. These missionaries _ in their
fervent zeal to save our souls _ took thousands of Indian children
from their parents and ``adopted out'' the children to white
families.
 &HT;    The Mormon Church was famous for this practise. They practically
stripped certain reservations of their children and turned these
young captives into little slaves.
 &HT;    Did the parents of these children care? You bet they did, but
they had no say about what happened to their flesh and blood. They
could only sit at home and cry.
 &HT;    I suggest the Christians practice their religion at home or in
their churches. Keep it out of the schools. I do not care what
religion you belong to or if you belong to one at all. Just don't
force your beliefs on those who do not want it.
 &HT;    The smallest minority in this nation, the minority that used to
be the majority, has experienced first hand the damage that forced
religion can have upon a people. We didn't become the smallest
minority by accident. The religious zealots had a lot to do with
it.
 &HT;    In a classic example of gobbledygook, Gov. Janklow explained his
support for Bill HB1261. ``If you don't believe in God, it's not
any problem to suggest whether or not you have any other gods
before you. To the extent you do, you get to pick who it is because
it doesn't tell you who god is.''
 &HT;    Say what?
 &HT;    Sounds like something I heard in catechism class many years ago.
Yes, religious instructions were a regular part of our school
curriculum, but of course, our lessons were often spoken in Latin.
I never knew the governor was bilingual.

THE OTHER TEXAS REPUBLICAN ON THE RISE: HISPANIC TONY GARZA

 By KIMBERLY GARCIA  
 &HT;    Republicans across the nation see Texas Railroad Commissioner
Tony Garza as the future of their party. It's an odd declaration
given that Garza is not your typical Republican.
 &HT;    Garza comes from Brownsville, Texas _ a poor, predominantly
Hispanic city along the democratically entrenched Texas-Mexico
border. Despite his law-school education and party affiliation,
Garza is a south Texan to his core. He's a down-home guy who's
comfortable on both sides of the border, speaking both English and
Spanish.
 &HT;    During 11 years in public office, Garza has championed causes
not usually associated with the GOP. As chief executive of the
county where he grew up, or as Cameron County judge, Garza helped
poor people gain access to critical health care, and to water and
wastewater services in substandard developments called colonias. As
secretary of state, he used computers to improve public access to
government documents.
 &HT;    Still, Garza holds true to Republican ideals of limited
government, free enterprise, strong families and a strong military.
 &HT;    ``I'm not any less conservative than other Republicans,'' Garza
says. ``But I do realize there are issues we have to address. In
terms of tone of discussion and building coalitions, maybe I'm not
a typical Republican. You need to include other groups to get
things accomplished. That hasn't always been a Republican
hallmark.''
 &HT;    Garza's unique combination of conservatism, compassion and
conciliatory spirit has served his political career well. He's
blazing a path across Texas that could take him to Washington D.C.,
especially if his good pal, Texas Governor George W. Bush, becomes
president of the United States.
 &HT;    Neither Garza nor Bush would speculate about Garza following
Bush to the White House if Bush is elected president, but Garza has
been joining Bush's presidential campaign trail whenever possible.
 &HT;    ``It's premature to talk about those decisions,'' Bush spokesman
Scott McClellan says. ``Garza is a trusted friend and advisor of
Gov. Bush ... He's a rising star in the Republican Party and he's
helping us broaden the base of the party.''
 &HT;    About Bush, Garza says, ``We're very close friends and his whole
family has been very supportive of me. There's nothing I wouldn't
do for G. W. Bush, but my focus right now has to be on being the
best railroad commissioner I can be. If I do that, the future will
take care of itself.''
 &HT;    Garza began his political career with a bang. When elected
Cameron County judge in 1988, he defeated a well-known Democrat who
had been county judge for 12 years. At age 28, Garza became the
youngest person and the first Hispanic Republican in the state to
win a countywide office along the vast Texas-Mexico border. Garza
served in that capacity until 1994, when he made an unsuccessful
bid for state attorney general.
 &HT;    In 1995, he became Bush's first appointee as secretary of state
and one of Bush's select few senior advisors, particularly on
border and Mexico-related issues. Today, Garza is the
highest-ranking minority in Texas as commissioner of one of the
state's most powerful regulatory agencies.
 &HT;    The three-member commission oversees regulation on the $60
billion oil and gas industry. And that's not even mentioning
Garza's accolades. In 1999, Garza became the first recipient of the
Republican National Hispanic Assembly's Rising Star Award.
 &HT;    ``Tony represents a new generation of political leaders,'' says
Luigi Crespo, executive director of the assembly that serves as the
Hispanic outreach arm of the Republican Party. ``He's a role model
for young Hispanics like myself. We're very proud of his
achievements in Texas.''
 &HT;    So how does a guy who didn't aspire to a political career end up
on the brink of national politics?
 &HT;    Garza's parents sowed the seeds of his conservatism. All four of
his grandparents were from Mexico. His father was a hardworking
small businessman who thought he could make it in this country if
the government left him alone. Antonio Garza operated a Texaco
station in the heart of downtown Brownsville from 7 a.m. until 10
p.m. for nearly 26 years. He also was a World War II veteran who
favored less taxes, less government and a strong military.
 &HT;    Garza's mother, Lita, died from cancer when he was 13. She
taught Garza the value of family and religion. After Garza
completed law school at Southern Methodist University in 1983, he
returned to the valley to practice law. He dabbled in supporting
Republican political candidates, but his father's apolitical views
sustained Garza's skepticism of government.
 &HT;    Instead of political activism, Garza tried to improve his
hometown through community service, coaching youth sports and
serving on the local health center's board of directors. By 1988,
he was warming up to the idea of holding public office when the
Republican Party approached him to run against a controversial
Democrat for county judge.
 &HT;    Garza began knocking on doors, and his friendship with Bush soon
followed. Bush called Garza during the race to offer help
campaigning and raising money. Bush also showed up for Garza's
swearing-in ceremony after he won the election.
 &HT;    So far, Garza has yet to disappoint his prominent friend.
Besides helping the indigent and ending a stalemate over two
international bridges as Cameron County judge, Garza also helped
the county improve its bond rating to the highest rating.
 &HT;    His proudest accomplishment so far is forging partnerships with
two state agencies to plug abandoned oil wells that threaten
important watersheds. In one case, the commission is working with
the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission to plug wells
threatening the Spence Reservoir that supplies nearly 305,000
people with water in west Texas. In the other case, the commission
is working with the state's General Land Office to plug
noncompliant oil and gas wells on state-leased land along the
coast.
 &HT;    ``We could not get to all those wells on our own and the
agencies could not collect all the data on their own, so working
together we can protect these water supplies,'' says Gene Acuna,
Garza's chief spokesman at the railroad commission. ``Some people
were surprised the railroad commission would start partnerships
like this. The commission doesn't usually look out for the
long-term impact on the environment. Tony looks at the long-term
impacts on people of this state. He looks at these partnerships in
ways people haven't before, and he makes them work. That's what's
unique about Tony Garza.''

 By NAT IRVIN II  
 &HT;    ``When do you think things are going to slow down?'' a friend
recently asked me as we discussed the realities of rapid social
change taking place around us.
 &HT;    ``How about by 2020?'' I responded with a certain inexact
wryness. I understood exactly how my friend felt. Everything around
us is changing _ and changing fast. And from the looks of things,
the changes of the future will only come faster.
 &HT;    Jaron Lanier, who coined the term ``virtual reality,'' says,
``There's a perception that things are going to change at such a
rapid rate that at some point (in the future) something very
dramatic will change about the fundamental situation of people in
the universe.''
 &HT;    Futurist Stephen Bertman says we are feeling the effects of
``hyperculture,'' where the social environment becomes so fluid
that the acceleration of one activity tends to induce acceleration
in other activities.
 &HT;    Much of what we are experiencing is a result of technological
innovation that has occurred in just the past 30 years. Speed
begets speed.
 &HT;    When the O jays recorded ``For the Love of Money'' in the early
1970s, the first microchip had barely been created. Today, the
average car has more computing power in the glove compartment than
did the Lunar landing craft, which landed on the moon in 1968, the
year Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated.
 &HT;    In 1977, the president of Digital Computing told the World
Future Society that ``there was no need for anyone to own a
personal computer in their home.'' In 2000, we already are in the
post-PC world and into the world of www _ the World Wide Web,
protocol for which did not even exist until 1993, after Bill
Clinton became president.
 &HT;    Just more than a decade ago, only the wealthy could afford a
cellular phone at a cost of $1,500. Now these phones are
practically free and the number of wireless customers in the United
States has jumped to 79 million from 16 million a decade ago, says
the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association.
 &HT;    Cell-phone manufacturer Nokia estimates there will be 1 billion
wireless phone users around the world by 2002. In Tanzania and
Ghana, school kids keep in touch using a wireless local loop with a
combination of pagers and wireless pay phones. And while many of us
still cling to the African adage, ``It takes a village to raise a
child,'' we now find ourselves on the Web creating a
``cybervillage'' in chat rooms instead of sitting on the front
porch.
 &HT;    After hearing the latest hit record by the Supremes, teen-agers
used to run to the nearest H.L. Green's drug store to purchase a
single 45 record. Perhaps as early as 2002, teen-agers will create
their own personalized, ubiquitous music streams of digital radio
featuring Sam Cooke, Otis Redding, Marvin Gaye, Lauryn Hill or
anyone from any source on the globe.
 &HT;    When the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was passed, who could have
ever imagined that blacks would one day vote without leaving home?
E-voting (electronic voting) is already being tested in three
states, and, by as early as the next election cycle in 2002, some
states may offer voters the convenience of casting their e-ballots,
not only from their home, but from their job, church or any place
in the world.
 &HT;    You could be able to use your phone, television or even your
digital Web TV browser.
 &HT;    Remember when politicians used to spend money to get out the
vote, or people worried that blacks might stay home on election
day? Wonder what Dr. King would say if he were alive today?
 &HT;    But look at what other changes lie ahead. By the end of 2000, we
may see the completion of the Human Genome Project, the
international effort to locate, decode and sequence the estimated
100,000 genes that comprise the human genome.
 &HT;    By March 2005, IBM expects to complete development of its
computer ``Blue Gene'' that will be 1 million times faster than the
average desktop computer and 500 times speedier than the fastest
computer today. It will perform 1 million billion mathematical
operations per second. This will be the first computer capable of
solving one of the most baffling mysteries of the human body: how
proteins are formed.
 &HT;    By 2007, computer programs will not only be written, but will
actually be grown fusing biology and technology to create computer
programs trained to do certain diagnostic tasks, including
correcting itself.
 &HT;    By 2020, your grandchildren will be born with their DNA encoded
and will likely be implanted with some kind of genetic DNA chip and
can expect to live to 2120.
 &HT;    When will things slow down? Not anytime soon.

 By BILL MAXWELL  
 &HT;    TUSCALOOSA, Ala. _ To Theophilus Danzy, the 69-year-old head
coach at private, historically black Stillman College, football is
no mere game. While acknowledging that such a view of the sport has
become cliche, he has proof that the gridiron, with the right adult
leaders on the sidelines, is the ideal venue for building
character.
 &HT;    Why did football return to Stillman in 1999 after a 50-year
hiatus? After all, the school, which is affiliated with the
Presbyterian Church U.S.A., has an average student population of
about 1,000, and it is continually strapped for money.
 &HT;    ``When President Earnest McNealy announced that the school was
bringing back football, I asked why,'' said Danzy, who had been
retired since 1990. ``I said, `God dog, that's a big chore.' Then,
I realized that our president has a mission.''
 &HT;    In addition to boosting alumni interest in the 124-year-old
campus, McNealy wanted to increase the number of males on campus.
During recent years, the college population has been about 65
percent to 70 percent female, and McNealy believed that football
would help balance the scale.
 &HT;    He was right.
 &HT;    ``It is safe to say we probably have 200 male students who would
not be here otherwise,'' McNealy told the Tuscaloosa News.
 &HT;    Incredibly, 300 students tried out for the squad, with more than
100 biting the dust early on and others failing the cut. McNealy
and the coaches expect football to have a domino effect. They
believe that even males who do not want to play football will want
to be on an all-black campus that has the sport.
 &HT;    The next task was to find the right coach. ``I selected a coach
that I thought would bring the same types of values to the table
that are at this institution already,'' McNealy told the News.
 &HT;    Most of those values are manifested throughout the tiny campus,
and the head coach must be in sync. ``If (athletes) don't do their
work, they will go home,'' McNealy said. ``If they don't behave,
they go home. We fully expect our students to go to class. We fully
expect them to graduate.'' Violence is not tolerated, and even
profanity is cause for expulsion. For example, one player who was
overheard cursing was kicked out of school.
 &HT;    ``So far,'' McNealy told the News, ``our football players are
among the most controlled students on campus.''
 &HT;    Most of the credit goes to Danzy, the straight-talking
fatherlike figure who acknowledges that he is ``very firm.''
Beneath that firmness, however, are a vision and a willingness to
save troubled young black males. When McNealy asked Danzy to be
Stillman's first contemporary football coach, he saw a chance to
renew efforts he had started in 1958, when he took his first
coaching job.
 &HT;    ``I had been reading that one in every three black males
couldn't vote because they were in jail or in some other kind of
situation where voting was taken away from them,'' Danzy said. ``I
told myself that the best way for me to help is to step in here at
Stillman. I had been successful every place I worked.''
 &HT;    He can rattle off the names of many current and former NFL
African-American players whom he turned around and put on the right
path, especially at Alcorn State University in Mississippi. But he
takes most pride in the ordinary ones who are making a difference.
 &HT;    ``Everywhere I go, I see them in places where I have recruited
hundreds of kids,'' Danzy said. ``I see successful professionals
who, when I first got them, their teachers said they would never
make it. And now, many are assistant principals, business
executives, attorneys, teachers, some even pastors. I feel that I
have succeeded when they go back into the community they came from
and produce.''
 &HT;    The coach knows student success is a two-way street. On an
office bulletin board, for example, he has written the words
``grade sign-off sheet.'' The note reminds him to regularly monitor
_ complete with signatures _ the players' course grades.
 &HT;    ``I have to make sure they're doing their part, that they are
studying,'' he said, taking a telephone call from a prospective
linebacker in Mississippi. ``They must do their part academically.
They just can't sit around and wait. But my job is to set up
mechanisms and tools to make sure the kids function well.''
 &HT;    As a Division III program, Stillman cannot offer athletic
scholarships or establish endowments. Players must find financial
aid, loans and other assistance to attend Stillman. In other words,
they have to have a burning desire to attend the school and play
football.
 &HT;    ``Not having scholarships makes coaching doubly hard,'' Danzy
said. ``You sell the young men the concept that you want to get
them an education. It is very hard to retain many of these young
men. They have faced many negative forces and still face them, and
it is tougher than ever. Regardless of football, you want to make
sure they get an education. Even if a kid stays here two or three
years, he is elevated. He is a better person.''
 &HT;    Danzy said too many high schools and colleges exploit black
athleticism and discard it _ and the player. He believes the
historically black campus is best for those with troubled pasts.
 &HT;    Unlike traditional campuses with thousands of students, which
also may have special programs for minority athletes, the typical
black campus is a network of caring.
 &HT;    ``Black schools have more net to catch the troubled kid,'' Danzy
said. ``I have no problem in saying that this thing is separate,
segregation. You take care of yours. When you cease to take care of
yours, then things go awry.''
 &HT;    Florida natives Michael Cunningham, 21, Jermaine Blakely, 21,
and Antwan Blatch, 19, each the first in his immediate family to
attend college, appreciate their coach's philosophy and credit it,
along with their parents, for their success. Each is determined to
earn a degree and become a professional after football. Each knows
that he is at Stillman because of football.
 &HT;    How does Danzy consistently inspire most of his players, many
from the inner city, to work hard and stay on the straight and
narrow?
 &HT;    ``I try to see farther than they're looking,'' he said. ``I try
to cultivate them in a way that will bring them into society and
show them the value of doing a good job. I want to build character
among young black men.''

OSCAR STATUETTES DISAPPEAR ON THE ROAD TO HOLLYWOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ill., Ohio)  (js) 
 By RICK LYMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Police are being asked to keep an eye out for dozens
of missing bald, shiny men standing about 13 inches high and
weighing 8 pounds each, with strangely erect posture, vaguely
Cycladic features and a tendency to make motion picture
professionals gush, weep and suddenly remember their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Crystal had better have a pretty good alibi.
</P>
<P>
   Just two weeks after the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and
Sciences was forced to resend 4,200 Oscar ballots because the first
batch had been mislaid by the Postal Service, the academy had to
announce Friday morning that somebody had stolen the entire
shipment of 55 gold-plated statuettes that were to be used in this
year's ceremonies on March 26 at the Shrine Auditorium in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are, as you might expect, keeping a sharp eye out for
them,'' said Bruce Davis, the academy's executive director, at a
news conference Friday morning at the organization's Beverly Hills
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   There is no need to worry, Davis said. The academy has 20 Oscar
statuettes on hand and a new shipment of 35 is being prepared for
delivery next Monday by R.S. Owens, the Chicago-based manufacturing
firm that makes the awards. Academy officials were trying to laugh
off the theft, a little ruefully. Davis called it ``an interesting
but relatively minor glitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Here, as near as academy officials can determine, is the
sequence of events. Nine unmarked boxes containing 55 statues,
which were not inscribed with the names of the Oscar winners, left
the Owens facility on March 3 in the custody of Roadway Express, a
70-year-old transport company that has carried the statues in the
past. Most of the boxes held six statues. On March 8, they arrived
at the Roadway facility in Bell, Calif., an industrial suburb a few
miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles, where they were placed on
a loading dock.
</P>
<P>
   On March 10, Scott Siegel, Owens' president, said he received a
call from Roadway that the cartons could not be found. He alerted
academy officials, who on that day were having the annual gala
luncheon for the year's Oscar nominees at the Beverly Hilton Hotel.
For two days, Davis said, Roadway checked to determine whether the
boxes had been somehow rerouted, but it came to the conclusion that
they had been stolen, probably from the loading dock area, by a
person or persons unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect they were quite surprised to discover what they
had,'' Davis said. ``I think it's going to be fairly hard to fence
an Oscar.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Since the deadline for voting on the Oscars is not until March
23 _ and no one but the academy's accountants will know the names
of the winners until Oscar night _ all of the stolen statues are
unengraved. The total cost of the shipment was around $18,000,
Davis said, and the academy expected Roadway to pay for any losses
and costs incurred from the theft
</P>
<P>
   ``Roadway Express apparently has a somewhat casual attitude
toward security in their facility,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   John Hyre, a spokesman at Roadway's corporate headquarters in
Akron, Ohio, said the company would have no comment, and referred
all calls to the academy.
</P>
<P>
   At the Roadway facility in Bell, a seemingly secure compound
surrounded by a fence topped with razor-wire and a guard who can
monitor anyone approaching, a reporter was not allowed to enter or
question employees. The few workers who strayed outside declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said that Roadway was offering a $50,000 reward for
information leading to the arrest and conviction of the thieves.
</P>
<P>
   Police from Los Angeles and Bell have formed a joint team to
investigate the theft, and the FBI has become involved, since the
shipment involved interstate commerce, and has sent one of its art
experts to advise in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're going to solve this, but at the moment we do not
have them in hand,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   The new shipment of Oscar statues will be shipped from Chicago
by United Airlines Cargo and will be accompanied by security guards
every step of the way, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the exact number of eventual Oscar winners is not known
until the envelopes are opened on Oscar night, there are always
plenty of the statuettes on hand. Davis said he was confident that
would also be the case this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a three-way tie in the visual effects category,
we'll be in trouble,'' he said. ``In fact, I think everyone should
watch the entire Oscar show to see if we have enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, in most previous years the academy had simply
shipped the Oscars as it did this year, but two years ago it
decided to try to wring some publicity out of the event, staging a
photo opportunity showing armed guards escorting the Oscars from
the Owens facility in Chicago and across the country to Los
Angeles. But the academy had been criticized for that, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People said it was an old-fashioned publicity stunt and we
could just ship them overland,'' Davis said. ``But apparently, you
can't.''

A WARNING FROM THE BRAVE NEW WIRED WORLD  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is no originality in imagining science's horrors. Since
the Romantic era, it has been difficult to imagine anything else:
Science creates machinery of destruction. It spawns mutants. It
spews radiation. Its objective pose is a cover for callous
indifference. Scientists murder (as Wordsworth once said of Newton)
to dissect.
</P>
<P>
   Such are the premises of many science fiction novels and most
science fiction films. They help motivate the new discipline of
``science studies.'' They erupt into public life, in debates about
disarmament and the environment. And since the Manhattan Project,
some misgivings are justified: science has now put human survival
in human hands.
</P>
<P>
   So why should a a sober warning about technology's dangers be
treated as a revelation after being featured in the April issue of
Wired magazine? In the last week, Bill Joy, the author of the
article, ``Why the Future Doesn't Need Us,'' has been interviewed
on television, written about in newspapers and argued about on the
Internet. Yet there is not a single point that has not already been
made elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Joy, who is a co-founder and chief scientist of Sun Microsystems
and one of the most respected idea men in the computer field,
anticipates this dd objection, admitting that ``all this has been
written about before'': ``This is nothing new.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not even new that he turns his attention from old
technology nuclear threats to new technology dangers of genetic
engineering, or turns from imaginings of ecological disaster to the
threat of ambitious, hyper-intelligent robots. Who is in the dark
about the ethical problems involved in cloning, the genome project
and genetic testing? What science fiction writer has neglected the
theme of rebellious robots?
</P>
<P>
   But what is new is that Joy's essay appears in Wired, a magazine
that is more used to celebrating the brave new wired world. In a
piece written about Joy in August 1998 by Kevin Kelley _ one of
Wired's founders _ and Spencer Reiss _ a Wired editor, the
Internet, for example, is glowingly imagined as a ``vast planetary
system'' of interacting machines, ``expanding by its own internal
logic.'' It is a ``global nervous system.''
</P>
<P>
   As it evolves it will alter human life as we know it. Wired has
published speculations that this global nervous system may actually
lead to a new life form, currently beyond imagining. This
enthusiastic expectation is not the exception. Internet visionaries
of the 1990s often indulged in ecstatic imaginings of human
transformation.
</P>
<P>
   Joy's comments are also related to the exuberant arguments in
Ray Kurzweil's recent book, ``The Age of Spiritual Machines.''
Kurzweil, a prolific and brilliant inventor, argues that not only
are computer speeds increasing and computer sizes decreasing at
exponential rates, but that this kind of explosive change will
continue without foreseeable limits. By the year 2030, Kurzweil
suggests, computers will be about a million times more powerful
than they are today; they will start to resemble life forms. Humans
will also contain machines: miniaturization will allow nanobots _
microscopic robots _ to be injected into the bloodstream and heal
their host organisms. Humans will merge with their machines; we
will all be cyborgs. This, Kurzweil argues, is good news.
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising that in a world of surging entrepreneurial
energy, the prospects of technological change are being celebrated.
Even Joy is ordinarily somewhat of a utopian visionary in his work
for Sun. Fortune magazine called Joy ``The Edison of the
Internet'': he designed crucial system software, three of Sun's
microprocessors, and developed the Java programming language. More
recently he has been working on a computer-based system known as
Jini, which will allow household appliances to ``talk'' to one
another: use a Palm Pilot to start a car, have a computer send a
warning e-mail when the refrigerator gets too warm or ask a
camcorder to transmit pictures through a cell phone. Sun promised
Jini appliances last year, but they still aren't even close. I
don't see a compelling need for Jini, but no matter: it is utopian
because it makes the impossible seem possible.
</P>
<P>
   So it is no surprise that out of such an inventive and innocent
world, Joy's dissent would seem thunderous. What, then, is to be
done? Joy's proposals _ that we ``take personal responsibility'' or
hold Aspen Institute-type conferences _ will not make much of a
difference. Knowledge will increase; so will applications; so will
temptations. Any evil that grows out of technology will not arise
through nefarious plotting, but unpredictably and incidentally: by
letting Jini-like innovations out the bottle, by increasing human
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   One of the problems, in fact, might not be in technology itself,
but in the ways in which technological culture has already undercut
the special status of the human. In studying computer simulations
of life, some theorists have argued that sophisticated simulations
are themselves primitive life forms. Among other thinkers it is
also becoming more common to think of humans as ``hosts'' for
``memes'': memes are ideas _ like ``justice'' or ``evil,'' the
opening of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, or the taste for tatoos _
that replicate and spread from body to body like genes; their
particular meanings are unimportant. These sorts of speculations
treat human nature as a sophisticated form of information
processing. Why should tampering with such codes matter? Genetic
engineering is just another form of re-programming.
</P>
<P>
   This view of human life grows directly out of the culture Wired
celebrates. It does not encourage experimental restraint. Instead,
it encourages speculation about how we can control our memes and
genes, and encourages optimism that the possibilities are
unlimited. So Joy's argument needs amplification: there are not
only risks latent in technology, there are risks latent in certain
celebrations of technology. The dangers lie not in our technology
but in ourselves.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many people remember reading George Orwell's ``Animal Farm'' in
high school or college, with its chilling finale in which the farm
animals looked back and forth at the tyrannical pigs and the human
farmers but found it ``impossible to say which was which.''
</P>
<P>
   That ending was altered in the 1955 animated version, which
removed the humans, leaving only the nasty pigs. Another example of
Hollywood butchering great literature? Yes, but in this case the
film's secret producer was the Central Intelligence Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA, it seems, was worried that the public might be too
influenced by Orwell's pox-on-both-their-houses critique of the
capitalist humans and communist pigs. So after his death in 1950,
agents were dispatched (by none other than E. Howard Hunt, later of
Watergate fame) to buy the film rights to ``Animal Farm'' from his
widow to make its message more overtly anti-communist.
</P>
<P>
   Rewriting the end of ``Animal Farm'' is just one example of the
often absurd lengths to which the CIA went, as recounted in a new
book, ``The Cultural Cold War: The CIA and the World of Arts and
Letters'' (The New Press) by Frances Stonor Saunders, a British
journalist. Published in Britain last summer, the book will appear
here next month.
</P>
<P>
   Much of what Saunders writes about, including the CIA's covert
sponsorship of the Paris-based Congress for Cultural Freedom and
the British opinion magazine Encounter, was exposed in the late
1960s, generating a wave of indignation. But by combing through
archives and unpublished manuscripts and interviewing several of
the principal actors, Saunders has uncovered many new details and
gives the most comprehensive account yet of the period between 1947
and 1967.
</P>
<P>
   This picture of the CIA's secret war of ideas has cameo
appearances by scores of intellectual celebrities like the critic
Lionel Trilling, the poets Ted Hughes and Derek Walcott and the
novelists James Michener and Mary McCarthy, all of whom directly or
indirectly benefited from the CIA's largesse. There are also
bundles of cash that were funneled through CIA fronts and several
hilarious schemes that sound more like a ``Spy vs. Spy'' cartoon
than a historical account.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling first class all the way, the CIA and its counterparts
in other Western European nations sponsored art exhibitions,
intellectual conferences, concerts and magazines to press their
larger anti-Soviet agenda. Saunders provides ample evidence, for
example, that the editors at Encounter and other agency-sponsored
magazines were directed not to publish articles directly critical
of Washington's foreign policy. She also shows how the CIA
bankrolled some of the earliest exhibits of Abstract Expressionist
painting outside of the United States to counter the Socialist
Realism being advanced by Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   In one memorable episode, the British Foreign Office subsidized
the distribution of 50,000 copies of ``Darkness at Noon,'' Arthur
Koestler's anti-communist classic. But at the same time, the French
Communist Party ordered its operatives to buy up every copy of the
book. Koestler received a windfall in royalties courtesy of his
communist adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, ``Animal Farm'' was not the CIA's only dabbling
in Hollywood. Saunders reports that one operative who was a
producer and talent agent slipped affluent-looking
African-Americans into several films as extras to try to counter
Soviet criticism of the American race problem.
</P>
<P>
   The agency also changed the ending of the movie version of
``1984,'' disregarding Orwell's specific instructions that the
story not be altered. In the book, the protagonist, Winston Smith,
is entirely defeated by the nightmarish totalitarian regime. At the
end, Orwell writes, Winston realized that ``He loved Big Brother.''
In the movie, Winston and his lover, Julia, are gunned down after
Winston defiantly shouts: ``Down with Big Brother!''
</P>
<P>
   Such changes came from the agency's obsession with snuffing out
a notion then popular among many European intellectuals: that East
and West were morally equivalent. But instead of illustrating the
differences between the two competing systems by taking the high
road, the agency justified its covert activities by referring to
the unethical tactics of the Soviets.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the other side can use ideas that are camouflaged as being
local rather than Soviet supported or stimulated, then we ought to
be able to use ideas camouflaged as local ideas,'' said Tom Braden,
who ran the CIA's covert cultural division in the early 1950s. (In
one of the book's many surprising codas, Braden goes on in the
1980s to become the leftist foil to Patrick Buchanan on the CNN
program ``Crossfire.'')
</P>
<P>
   The cultural Cold War began in postwar Europe, with the fraying
of the wartime alliance between Washington and Moscow. Officials in
the West believed they had to counter Soviet propaganda and
undermine the wide sympathy for Communism in France and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   An odd alliance was struck between the CIA leaders, most of them
wealthy Ivy League veterans of the wartime Office of Strategic
Services and a corps of largely Jewish ex-Communists who had broken
with Moscow to become virulently anti-communist. Acting as
intermediaries between the agency and the intellectual community
were three colorful agents who included Vladimir Nabokov's much
less talented musician cousin, Nicholas.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA recognized from the beginning that it could not openly
sponsor artists and intellectuals in Europe because there was so
much anti-American feeling there. Instead, it decided to woo
intellectuals out of the Soviet orbit by secretly promoting a
non-communist left of democratic socialists disillusioned with
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Saunders describes how the CIA cleverly skimmed hundreds of
millions of dollars from the Marshall Plan to finance its
activities, funneling the money through fake philanthropies it
created or real ones like the Ford Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't spend it all,'' Gilbert Greenway, a former CIA
agent, recalled. ``There were no limits, and nobody had to account
for it. It was amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   When some of the CIA's activities were exposed in the late
1960s, many artists and intellectuals claimed ignorance. But
Saunders makes a strong case that several people, including the
philosopher Isaiah Berlin and the poet Stephen Spender, who was
co-editor of Encounter, knew about the CIA's role.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has made it very difficult now to deny that some of these
things happened,'' said Norman Birnbaum, a professor at the
Georgetown University Law School who was a university professor in
Europe in the 1950s and early 1960s. ``And she has placed a lot of
people living and dead in embarrassing situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Still unresolved is what impact the campaign had and whether it
was worth it. Some of the participants, like Arthur M. Schlesinger
Jr., who was in the OSS and knew about some of the CIA's cultural
activities, argue that the agency's role was benign, even
necessary. Compared with the coups the CIA sponsored in Guatemala,
Iran and elsewhere, he said, its support of the arts was some of
its best work. ``It enabled people to publish what they already
believed,'' he added. ``It didn't change anyone's course of action
or thought.''
</P>
<P>
   But Diana Josselson, whose husband, Michael, ran the Congress
for Cultural Freedom, told Saunders that there were real human
costs among those around the world who innocently cooperated with
the agency's front organizations only to be tarred with a CIA
affiliation when the truth came out.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The author and other critics argue that by using government
money covertly to promote such American ideals as democracy and
freedom of expression, the agency ultimately stepped on its own
message.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously it was an error, and a rather serious error, to
allow intellectuals to be subsidized by the government,'' said Alan
Brinkley, a history professor at Columbia University. ``And when it
was revealed, it did undermine their credibility seriously.''

   NEW YORK _ Time INC., the publisher of In Style magazine, has
just created its antidote: a new publication called Real Simple. I
subscribed immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine comes on the heels of a book, ``Home Comforts: The
Art and Science of Keeping House'' by Cheryl Mendelson (Scribner,
1999), which explains in patient detail how to make hospital
corners, fold laundry, remove stains, freeze food, tune a piano and
build a hearth fire. The 884-page manual is No. 11 on Amazon.com's
best-seller list. Let me repeat: a book on housekeeping basics is
ranked No. 11 on a best-seller list. I bought it, too.
</P>
<P>
   It's a fascinating aspirational trajectory, from House Beautiful
to House Clean.
</P>
<P>
   This month, Glamour magazine suggests ``50 Tricks for
Outstanding Orgasms.'' Please, who has the time? Besides, I have to
do my taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Which may explain why enrollment is up at Coach U., an online
educational company that trains people to be ``life coaches,''
members of a growing profession that instructs clients in so-called
life skills. More than 5,000 life coaches are now practicing, said
Sandy Vila, president of Coach U., which began with a few students
in 1992 and now boasts a yearly enrollment of about 1,300.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches in training study topics like relating, listening and
empowering, the better to offer clients advice on the fine points
of managing their lives: take a nap, take a bath, write a letter,
pay your taxes. Old-school motivational gurus like Tony Robbins
exhort clients to ``Awaken the giant within!'' Life coaches just
want you to take it one day at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a coach does is help people deal with the world at
large,'' said Cheryl Richardson, a bubbly life coach who publishes
a weekly Internet newsletter called Life Makeover for the Year 2000
and is the author of ``Take Time for Your Life: A Personal Coach's
7-Step Program for Creating the Life You Want'' (Broadway Books,
1999).
</P>
<P>
   ``They're like practical strategists that help people learn new
life skills,'' she said. ``It's obvious stuff, really, like saying
to a client, as I've done, `It's OK to tell your friends not to
send you any more junk e-mail.' The larger picture is that in an
adrenaline-based culture like ours, people's adrenal systems are so
fried they almost can't physically slow down. They come to life
coaching to learn how to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Martha Beck, another life coach, who is the author of ``Breaking
Point: Why Women Fall Apart and How They Can Re-Create Their
Lives,'' said: ``Life is just too damn hard right now. There are no
rules, and in some ways it's tragic, and in some ways it's magical.
Let's see what you can make out of it. I think this is the reason
you're hearing a lot about life coaches right now. The workplace is
specifically set up to take all the energy of a single person. You
combine that with the needs of young children or elderly parents,
and it's a tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Coaching is a profession of the new media. Coaches train at the
virtual Coach U. and advertise their services on the Web. Most
sessions are phoners _ clients pay $200 to $900 a month for four
half-hour sessions _ with bonus e-mails between calls. There are
coaches with degrees in business, law, sociology, psychology and
social work. And there are coaches with no degrees at all. It is an
unregulated, can-do profession.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you feel stressed out?'' one coach asks. ``Achieve
balance,'' another coaxes. ``Discover your natural talents and core
values and have more time, energy and fun!'' Buzzwords like
self-care and authentic come up again and again.
</P>
<P>
   Who doesn't need a life coach? I had a sample session not long
ago, more than an hour's worth of phone time with Richardson, who
no longer takes private clients. A lot of life coaches are full up.
Beck told me she ``runs from clients.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson was funny and prescriptive: The ZIP drive you bought
last summer? Unwrap it and plug it in, she told me. You say your
brain is fried? No more Page Six after dinner. No magazines in the
bathtub. Read a novel. Call your friends. Call four friends. Call
me!
</P>
<P>
   Choking on work? Take a walk. Get a tape recorder. Use it. Don't
be negative, even in jest. Change your language. Don't say
``loser.'' Say anything else. Say ``jelly bean!''
</P>
<P>
   Jelly bean?
</P>
<P>
   ``Jelly bean. Need a resource? Call me, I've got the best data
bank in the country. Need to connect? I've got a teleconferencing
bridge I hardly use. You try it, it's yours.''
</P>
<P>
   It was marvelous. Perhaps I could just move in with Richardson.
I bet she sends her laundry out.

HAPPY WHAT? YOU WISH! 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 19) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MONIQUE P. YAZIGI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The invitation last month promised a big birthday
bash in a private room at City Hall, a TriBeCa restaurant. The
fashion designer summoned nearly three dozen friends from New York,
East Hampton and Palm Beach to witness as she blew out the candles
on a tarte Tatin, marking what she announced was her 29th birthday.
This was to be the last year of her go-go 20s, and she wanted the
world to know.
</P>
<P>
   There was just one problem. The birthday girl's arithmetic was
off.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could she be turning 29 when we were in the same class in
kindergarten and I'm turning 31,'' said one of her friends, who
asked not to be named to save the birthday girl embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Three-Oh is a milestone that many approach with a
mixture of ambivalence and dread. It marks the twilight of youth, a
bringing down of the curtain on life's first act, and many chose to
observe it very quietly or ignore it altogether.
</P>
<P>
   But not so another kind of birthday baby increasingly common in
New York. She kicks up as much fuss as possible, inviting friends
and acquaintances to a blow-out. It's all a charade, because the
real milestone being passed is 32 or 33 or 34, but this celebrator
hopes to shave a few years off her age in as public a display as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of women I know on the Upper East Side wouldn't dream of
celebrating their 30th birthday until they are at least 34,'' said
Kristina Stewart, the society editor of Vanity Fair.
</P>
<P>
   Fibbing about one's age is nothing new, of course. Women have
long done it, giving rise to the taboo against asking a ``lady''
her age, and the coy expression ``a woman of a certain age,'' which
refers to anyone from 50-ish to 70-ish.
</P>
<P>
   But lying about age seems to have become more aggressive, more
elaborate and _ most surprising _ the province of ever younger
women, including many in their 20s who would seem to be so dewey
with youth that lying should be unnecessary. Yet they do, at ever
more tender ages. And men are beginning to join them.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Peregrin and Kristie Tippner, both 22-year-old seniors
at Syracuse University, have already started telling people that
they are still 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``For so long, we wanted to be older,'' said Peregrin, an
economics major. ``You can't wait to drive at 16. Then you can't
wait to leave home at 18. You can drink at 21. But then after 21,
it's all about buying beauty cream.''
</P>
<P>
   Her friend, Tippner, an advertising major, said, ``I'm already
looking at the lines under my eyes in pictures and it bothers me.''
</P>
<P>
   Meredith Hanley, another Syracuse student, who is majoring in
public relations, is still 21. ``I'm going to say I'm 21 until I'm
30,'' she said. ``What's the advantage of being older? Your health
declines, your husband leaves you for another woman and you can't
find a job.''
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere Naomi Wolf, the author of ``The Beauty Myth'' (Morrow,
1991), is softly weeping. She and countless other feminists have
spent decades trying to convince women, men and society at large
that a woman's worth transcends appearances. But to hear many young
women tell it, those efforts have changed little.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-something women who fudge their birthdays say they get
the message that they must be younger, ever younger, to succeed at
love, at work and in the marketplace as a catered-to consumer. And
many cultural critics back them up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Girl _ capital T, capital G _ is it,'' said Susan Faludi,
author of ``Backlash: The Undeclared War Against Women (Crown,
1991). ``It is what is most valued and what is rewarded with fame
and fortune, because we live in a visual, entertainment, ornamental
culture. What is valued is image and appearance and youth, and it's
what makes the consumer culture run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at Ally McBeal compared to the women on `Cagney and
Lacey.''' ``They were not conventionally cookie-cutter attractive;
they were basically middle-aged and looked it. But now you're
supposed to be middle-aged and look like you're 15. Ally McBeal
doesn't look like any grown-up lawyer. She looks like a teen-ager
dressed in career-mommy clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood, our most potent image factory, worships youth
on-screen and off. It is an industry that pairs over-50 male stars
like Harrison Ford with under-30 love interests like Anne Heche,
and it's a town where not long ago a 32-year-old television writer,
Riley Weston, famously pretended to be 19 to get work on
``Felicity,'' the WB show dealing with teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   Actresses have always been expected to ``play younger'' than
they really are, so their fictions about age hardly raise an
eyebrow. But what is new is how many people in nonpublic walks of
life feel pressured to play younger, too.
</P>
<P>
   Deserving some of the blame may be the playground called the
Internet. The business pages are full of dot-com wunderkinds who
have made a million by age 30. Investment bankers bring home
six-figure compensation packages in their mid-20s. So workers in
other industries feel pressure to demonstrate that they, too, have
achieved impressive success very early in life.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're 27 and doing well, then it's OK to say you're 27,''
explained Stephanie DiIorio, who is in fact 27 and a restaurant
consultant in New York. ``But if you're not. ... Well, let's say I
could see getting to 30 and being 30 for five years.''
</P>
<P>
   Ploys to shave off years and deceive friends, lovers and
colleagues have become more elaborate, like the 30th-birthday-party
charade. Another ploy, useful to those in the public eye, is to
give a fictional age to a newspaper or magazine; the fake statistic
is inevitably picked up and repeated so often it becomes part of
the record and a fact checker's truth.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Taylor Stein, a party-loving young woman about town who until
recently ran the restaurant Brown's on East 61st Street, told The
New York Times she was 29 for a profile last April. Stein now
admits that she fibbed _ and that she does so regularly when it
comes to age. (Stein still will not reveal her age. ``Age is a
number; mine's unlisted,'' she said.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I think as your age goes up, your market value goes down,
unlike real estate,'' Stein said. She admitted the foolishness of
the effort: ``It's all about insecurity. Do you think two years
makes a difference?''
</P>
<P>
   James Tully, 31, an artist in Manhattan, described a woman he
dated for a number of years who had a remarkable ability to reverse
time. ``The first year we started dating she was 27, and her age
progressed naturally for three years,'' he said. ``Then all of
sudden, when she hit 30, she went down to 28. I kept getting
confused because she kept getting younger and younger.''
</P>
<P>
   Whenever he tried to pin her down, she would get upset. ``She
was so insistent, and unless you wanted to invite an irrational
harangue, you would leave the subject alone,'' he said. ``In my own
mind, I'm keeping track, and she must be about 35 now, though she
pretends to hover around 30.''
</P>
<P>
   Reached for a comment while driving down a highway in
California, the woman insisted she had to pull over before
addressing Tully's version of events. She promised to call back on
her cell phone, but never did.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, one group of Manhattanites who were classmates at the
Nightingale-Bamford School, the all-girls private school on East
92nd Street, made a pact to collectively revise the year of their
graduation. Instead of admitting they graduated in 1986, which pegs
them as 31 today, these half-dozen women all cite 1991 as the date
they received their diplomas, making them 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives us more time,'' said one of the women in the group,
who is single, doesn't work and volunteers on junior charity
committees. ``When you're not married and don't have a career, New
York can be harsh on women. Men can be harsh on women.''
</P>
<P>
   Many women make no apologies for lying about their age. If
society _ men, the workplace, popular culture _ is going to
conspire against them, they reason, then they will make up whatever
age suits them.
</P>
<P>
   Eve Packer, a tutor who works from her Manhattan home, said she
lies always, changing her age each day depending on her mood. ``I
feel like it's a weapon used against women; it's like a club,'' she
said. ``If you're 29, then they look at you like, Why aren't you
19? Or if you're 39, then they say, `Why aren't you 25?' People
size you up by your age.''
</P>
<P>
   When Marie Claire magazine recently polled 100 men and 100 women
about everyday lies they tell, Michele Lavery, the deputy editor,
was shocked by the results. ``The degree to which people lie
unconsciously is really surprising,'' she said. The survey found
that people lie about almost everything: whether they are working
late, if they thought the sex was great, and yes, how old they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women only lie about being younger than they are, while men
lie up and down depending on who they are trying to impress,''
Lavery said.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Vasquez, 32, a home attendant from Paramus, N.J., has no
qualms about pretending to be 25 to attract younger women. ``I tell
them I'm 25 so I don't scare them off,'' he said. ``Young girls
don't like older men, because they think older men are possessive
and like to control young girls. I like them to think I'm on their
level.''
</P>
<P>
   He eventually reveals the truth. ``I tell them after I've been
with them,'' he said. ``After I've bought them things. You have to
buy them things, then you have them.''
</P>
<P>
   Given that lying about one's age is so pervasive, and accepted
in some quarters almost as a matter of course, can there be
anything wrong with it?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, said Sissela Bok, author of the 1978 book ``Lying: Moral
Choice in Public and Private Life'' (Vintage Books). Lying about
one's age puts one on a slippery slope toward more serious
falsehoods, she said. ``Once a person engages in a series of lies,
then they have to keep telling more and more lies to support the
first one,'' said Bok, who is an interim director of the Harvard
Center for Population and Development Studies. ``Now that they've
started, it becomes very hard to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Although small lies may not not seem to hurt anyone, Bok said,
the liar is frequently the one who suffers. ``People trust
themselves less if they know others cannot trust them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Bok said, it erodes one's credibility on larger
matters; once someone learns you've lied about your age, they will
be disinclined to trust you on larger matters. All this lying leads
to ``a kind of pollution to society,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And how old is Bok?
</P>
<P>
   She hesitated a long moment.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, she answered: ``65.''

IS YOUR PC POSSESSED?   
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   My favorite kind of newspaper headline is the one that asks a
question to which anybody in his or her right mind already knows
the answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can New York save itself?'' (Of course not.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Do special interests control our government?'' (Of course they
do.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Are our kids exposed to too much TV violence?'' (Only when the
set is turned on.)
</P>
<P>
   Which is why I was so smitten by a headline I recently saw in
Weekly World News, the New York Times of tabloid journalism: ``Is
Your Computer Possessed by a Demon?''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps there are one or two people out there who do not think
their computer is possessed by a demon. Maybe they don't like the
word ``demon.'' Maybe they'd prefer ``poltergeist'' or ``fiend'' or
the rather generic ``evil spirit.'' It is possible, of course, that
different kinds of demons inhabit different computers.
</P>
<P>
   The demon in my computer, for instance, is rather predictable
and unimaginative. (I have no idea where he picks that up from.)
His favorite line, regardless of the circumstances, is ``You have
performed an illegal operation and the computer will be shut
down.'' There is no discussion, no debate and no amount of
pleading, whining or crying will make my computer's demon change
its mind.
</P>
<P>
   This is not unusual. According to the Reverend Jim Peasboro,
author of the upcoming book, ``The Devil in the Machine,'' one in
10 computers in America contains some sort of evil spirit or demon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any PC built after 1985 has the storage capacity to house an
evil spirit,'' Peasboro told the newspaper. The Savannah, Ga.,
clergyman said he became aware of the problem from counseling
churchgoers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned that many members of my congregation became in touch
with a dark force whenever they used their computers,'' he said.
``Decent, happily married family men were drawn irresistibly to
pornographic Web sites and forced to witness unspeakable
abominations.'' (You decent, happily married family men may want to
try this excuse on your wife who up until now probably assumed that
your witness of unspeakable abominations was strictly voluntary.)
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if you're going to get to the cold, dark,
silicon-encrusted heart of computer demons, you've got to meet the
beast in person, and that's what Peasboro did. He logged on to a
parishioner's computer himself and immediately an
``artificial-intelligence'' program fired up without him even
clicking on it. (This happens to me all the time, by the way.)
</P>
<P>
   After typing out a few brief insults, just to get warmed up, the
computer then ``went haywire'' and printed out what looked like
gobbledygook. ``I later had an expert in dead languages examine the
text,'' the minister said. ``It turned out to be a stream of
obscenities written in a 2,800-year-old Mesopotamian dialect!''
</P>
<P>
   (This certainly is a plausible explanation for the strange stuff
that appears on my computer screen, but I wonder if it would be
worth it to keep an expert in dead languages on 24-hour call.)
</P>
<P>
   So what's the solution? Peasboro advises that if you suspect
your computer is possessed (and, of course, you know it is), you
consult a clergyman or, if the computer is still under warranty,
take it in for servicing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technicians can replace the hard drive and reinstall the
software, getting rid of the wicked spirit permanently.''
</P>
<P>
   Permanently or until such time as your new computer starts
spewing ancient Mesopotamian obscenities, whichever comes first.
</P>

ARTISTS WHO SCORNED AND THEN TURNED TO PHOTOGRAPHY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Texas, France)  By SARAH BOXER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When photography first arrived in the middle of the 19th century
with all its vaunted truthfulness, painters and sculptors did not
like it one bit. They were threatened. They were miffed. They were
scornful. Finally they took the matter into their own hands. They
turned photography inside out.
</P>
<P>
   Honore Daumier said, ``Photography imitates everything and
expresses nothing.'' Paul Gauguin said, ``Machines have come, art
has fled, and I am far from thinking photography can help us.''
Vincent van Gogh referred to ``the photographic and empty
perfection of certain people.''
</P>
<P>
   Photography, they suggested, was too objective and too
superficial. If people wanted that kind of perfect, mechanical
thing, then let them have it.
</P>
<P>
   But scorn of the camera did not stop some artists _ including
Pierre Bonnard, Edouard Vuillard, Constantin Brancusi, Medardo
Rosso, Edgar Degas, Edvard Munch and even Gauguin _ from dabbling
in photography. Some did it openly, others surreptitiously. (The
heirs of Gustave Moreau hid his photographs to preserve his
reputation.)
</P>
<P>
   What were these artists doing with the rival medium? Were they
trying to sneak a peek at a reality that was more accurate than the
one they saw with the naked eye?
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, yes. ``The Artist and the Camera: Degas to
Picasso,'' an exhibition at the Dallas Museum of Art, surveys a
dozen artists who used photography to further their art. Degas
copied dancers and horses from photographs _ his own and those of
Eadweard Muybridge. Bonnard's intimate paintings, cropped in odd
ways, look as if they had borrowed something from his family
snapshots. Artists, it seemed, though outwardly suspicious of
photography, didn't mind taking cues about reality from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a doubt the commonplace view of photography ever since
its inception ... is that it records a moment of reality as it
actually appeared,'' writes Martin Jay, a professor of history at
the University of California at Berkeley, in his book ``Downcast
Eyes: The Denigration of Vision in 20th-Century French Thought.''
But that, he suggests, is not the whole story.
</P>
<P>
   If photographs seemed to offer a better and more prolonged
glimpse of reality, they also planted a doubt about the human
ability to grasp reality and even the definition of reality. By the
end of the 19th century, photography began to generate ``a
subcurrent of skepticism,'' Jay writes.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first major blows was dealt by Muybridge, an English
photographer. His famous photographs of galloping horses, published
in 1878, revealed something that the human eye was blind to. As
Aaron Scharf describes it in ``Art and Photography'': ``They
contradicted almost all of the previous representations made by
artists. The most startling thing was that, unlike the traditional
flying gallop in which all four legs were shown off the turf,
spread out like those of a frozen rabbit, they were at one moment
proved to be jack-knifed beneath the body of the animal.''
</P>
<P>
   In his painting and sculpture Degas happily followed Muybridge's
lead. Others disparaged the new truth. Auguste Rodin insisted the
old way of depicting a gallop, typified by Theodore Gericault, was
better. ``For now I believe it is Gericault who is right, and not
the camera, for his horses appear to run and, though false, they
are nevertheless true.''
</P>
<P>
   To add to the confusion, people began to learn that photographs
could be manipulated. ``By the mid-1840s,'' writes Jay,
``photographers discovered that they could retouch their
photographs or even combine them to make a composite.''
</P>
<P>
   Francis Galton, for example, was known for ``combining a number
of underexposed photographic negatives of social types (such as
criminals) into a `sandwich' that could then be used to print a
single composite positive of that type,'' writes Robert A.
Sobieszek in the catalog ``Photography and the Human Soul.'' In
this way Galton created portraits of Jews, consumptives, healthy
people and criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Amid this confusion, ocularcentrism, or sight-centeredness,
began to erode. And fantasy, spiritualism, symbolism and surrealism
rushed in to fill the vacuum. This is when the story of art and
photography took an unexpected turn.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the artists who were most entranced by photography were
Symbolists like Fernand Khnopff, Munch, Gauguin and Moreau. They
were not at all interested in realism but rather in the ``inner
landscape,'' the invisible truth. Dorothy Kosinski, the curator of
``The Artist and the Camera,'' says that for these Symbolists,
``the photograph suggested a new scopic realm, inflected with
issues of time, memory, nostalgia, motion and space.'' Reality was
``something internal, private'' for them. And they thought the
camera could help them capture it.
</P>
<P>
   Degas is not normally thought of as a Symbolist, but his
engagement with photography suggests otherwise. He would seat his
photographic subjects in ``almost total darkness, as though
searching with his lens for something hidden within those faces
that could not readily be perceived by the human eye in the light
of day,'' Elizabeth Childs, a professor of art history at
Washington University, writes in the catalog for the ``The Artist
and the Camera.'' He was not searching for reality. He was looking
for souls to emerge, for something the ordinary eye could not see.
</P>
<P>
   One of Degas' most famous photographs is a double portrait of
Renoir, the Impressionist painter, and Stephane Mallarme, the
Symbolist poet. In the photograph Mallarme leans against a wall,
Renoir leans against a mirror that reflects his image and Degas is
obliterated by the glare of the flash in the mirror. Childs
suggests that by using mirrors and flashes, Degas seemed to say
that ``what we view here are not just individuals'' but ``the
consciousness of viewing itself.'' It is the eye turned inward.
</P>
<P>
   Munch, despite his ambivalence toward photography, took
photographs of himself, focusing on his eyes, by holding the camera
at arm's length, hoping to capture his own ``raw feelings.'' The
eye might have been questioned as the organ of vision, but it was
still, apparently, a trusted organ of feeling.
</P>
<P>
   Gauguin was famously antipathetic to the camera's version of the
truth, once testily asking: ``What truth? The true color of the
sky, of a tree, of all of material nature?'' But his doubts about
the truthfulness of photographs seemed to free him to use them as
documents of a fantasy world in Tahiti and Samoa that he knew no
longer existed. Gauguin collected faked, colonialist photographs of
natives carrying bananas, building huts and drinking at waterfalls.
He used what he knew were false documents of native life as models
for his nostalgic evocations of savage life.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the artists who turned to photography did it not so much
for their realism as for the access they provided to the invisible.
This trend continued into the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Marcel Duchamp, who obviously owed something to Muybridge for
his fragmented ``Nude Descending a Staircase,'' became interested
in X-rays around 1910. As Linda Dalrymple Henderson writes in
``Duchamp in Context,'' (Princeton, 1999) he was drawn in not only
because those naughty X-rays could ``penetrate clothing and flesh''
but also because they promised something more: ``Here was a new
kind of light that allowed a painter to go beyond the preoccupation
of earlier artists with surface appearances'' _ or the retinal in
Duchamp's derogatory term. It was one step in ``the quest for
invisible reality.''
</P>
<P>
   The beat went on. Surrealists used photographs to evoke
uncanniness, Dadaists cut and pasted photographs for the sake of
nonsense. Andy Warhol lined up row upon row of silk-screen photos,
mining them for their mind-numbing, commercial effect.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that artists have always resented photography for
capturing visible reality and always loved it for capturing
invisible reality. Go figure.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The storm that produced as much as eight inches of snow in
Portland, Maine, and brisk winds between 20 and 35 miles an hour at
Boston Friday will slide farther off the Northeast Coast Saturday,
setting the stage for ample sunshine and diminishing winds. In its
wake, a halcyon high pressure system will build over the Northeast
Seaboard, paving the way for clear skies and calm winds Saturday
night. As a result, temperatures will fall into the teens and
single digits across much of the Northeast by dawn Sunday, with
some readings in the 20s in traditionally warmer large urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, showers and thunderstorms will likely develop over
east Texas later Saturday or Saturday evening in response to a jet
stream disturbance arriving from the southern Rockies. Saturday
night, showers and thunderstorms will forge east toward the
Mississippi Valley. Ahead of this disturbance, earlier in the day,
broken areas of rain will form across the western Gulf States as
moist air from the Gulf of Mexico flows inland.
</P>
<P>
   Areas of rain and mountain snow will develop early Saturday
across western Washington and western Oregon as a cold front
arrives from the west. Rain will then graduate into more sporadic
showers as a jet stream disturbance trailing the cold front
arrives. A rumble of thunder is possible in northwest Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The northern Plains will turn milder this weekend as Pacific air
warms on its eastward descent from the Rockies. Temperatures Sunday
afternoon could reach 60 degrees as far north as South Dakota. &QL;

<P>
   Focus: Nipped in the Bud
</P>
<P>
   Last week, record-setting warmth enveloped areas of the Middle
West and Northeast that typically are just emerging from months of
wintry chill at this time of year. But, there can be a price to pay
for premature warmth. Blossoms on many trees swelled last week,
coaxed from their winter hibernation by several days with afternoon
temperatures in the 70s and low 80s. Now, a surge of wintry chill
has spread over the same area, which can cause damage to some kinds
of flora. Later in the spring when blossoms are more advanced,
frosty nights can be especially devastating to fruit trees. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday approved, 319-101, a three-year $40
billion authorization for the Federal Aviation Administration for
programs through 2003. The bill, which has been approved by a
conference of House and Senate lawmakers, provides nearly $10
billion for airport improvements and safety grants, and allows
airports to increase flight traffic and raise passenger taxes.
Supporters said the bill would make airports safer and help
low-volume airports become more economically viable. Opponents said
the bill would increase the amount of flights at busy airports. A
``yes'' vote favors the authorization.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: PROPERTY
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday approved, 226-182, a measure that would
permit land developers to appeal state and local zoning decisions
in federal court. Private property owners would be able to appeal
cases if initial development applications are denied at the local
level. Supporters say it prevents private land owners from getting
caught in years of state-level litigation. Opponents say it
benefits big development companies who can circumvent local
authorities and take their case to federal coaurts. A ``yes'' vote
favors the measure.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta's police chief said Friday that one of two
sheriff's deputies who were wounded in a shootout while trying to
serve a warrant has identified his assailant as a Muslim cleric who
was known in the 1960s as H. Rap Brown, a leader of the Black
Panther party. And the chief, Beverly Harvard, said authorities had
initiated a nationwide search for him.
</P>
<P>
   The two deputies from the Fulton County Sheriff's Office were
shot and seriously wounded near downtown Atlanta late Thursday
night while serving a warrant at the home of Brown, now known as
Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin. Authorities said the shooter escaped after
being wounded by one of the deputies, and sheriff's officials said
they were looking for Amin.
</P>
<P>
   They released a description of the man that seemed to match that
of the former militant: 6 feet, 4 inches and thin, with graying
hair.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Aldranon English was conscious but in serious condition
Friday at Grady Memorial Hospital and the second deputy, Ricky
Kinchen, was in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Friday, Harvard said English had
``positively identified'' Amin ``as the person who fired upon the
two deputies.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulton County Sheriff Jackie Barrett said the deputies went to a
community store owned by Amin to try to serve a warrant against him
issued by suburban Cobb County for failing to appear in court in
January on charges of theft by receiving stolen property,
impersonating an officer and having no proof of insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff said the officers did not know that Amin was the
former Black Panthers militant. He was imprisoned for five years in
the 1970s in New York, convicted of attempted armed robbery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think both officers kind of walked into this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett said that after no one answered their knocks at the
door, the deputies noticed a black Mercedes nearby and approached
the car. She said they told the driver they could not see his hands
and ordered him to step out of the car. She said when the driver
stepped from the car he declared ``here are my hands'' and then
opened fire with an assault rifle, striking both officers, who were
wearing bullet-proof vests. The driver continued to fire at the
officers after they fell to the ground, Barrett said.
</P>
<P>
   The officers were able to return fire as their assailant fled
and English told investigators that he believed the man was hit.
</P>
<P>
   English identified his assailant as Amin after he picked him
from a collection of photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta police conducted an intense manhunt in a four-block area
of southwest Atlanta surrounding Amin's mosque and home. As
helicopters hovered overhead, SWAT teams and police dogs searched
every home in the area, at one point following a trail of blood
that led to a neighbor's house, which turned out to be empty.
</P>
<P>
   Amin has lived in Atlanta for about 25 years, leading the
Community Mosque and running a small grocery store. In the 1960s
and '70s, when he was known as H. Rap Brown, he led the Student
Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, and was justice minister of the
Black Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, a neighborhood resident accused Amin of having shot
him, but later recanted the accusation after saying that police had
pressured him into making the identification. Amin's lawyer said at
the time that the police were looking for any excuse to charge Amin
with a major crime.

<P>
   The approaching Easter season is a time of resurrection, faith
and belief. Now, out of the catacombs of history comes new
information that will startle skeptics and make the heart of
believers rejoice.
</P>
<P>
   Long buried in ancient texts are surprising accounts that will
revolutionize old assumptions that Thomas was the only apostle who
went to India, that the Jews of Jesus' time spoke Aramaic and not
Hebrew, that the four gospels were originally written in Greek and
that Mark's gospel was the first of them.
</P>
<P>
   This newly uncovered information further confirms that Matthew,
an eyewitness to the miracles and events of Jesus' ministry, was
indeed the author of the first gospel and verifies both the
Jewishness and early date of the first gospel.
</P>
<P>
   Now we have a clear mention that the Gospel of Matthew was
written in Hebrew _ not Greek or Aramaic, as widely thought _ and
was carried out of Israel by one of the original apostles to the
Far East.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the earliest church fathers and historians, Eusebius and
Origen, wrote that a second, long-overlooked apostle, Bartholomew,
also went to India and took a gospel text with him, according to
Princeton scholar and author Samuel Moffett.
</P>
<P>
   In his ground-breaking book, ``A History of Christianity in
Asia,'' Moffett reveals that Pantaenus, a church historian and
missionary who traveled to India in 180 A.D., discovered the copy
of the Gospel of Matthew in Hebrew that Bartholomew had taken with
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is reported,'' wrote Eusebius, a fourth-century bishop and
church historian, ``that among persons there who knew Christ,
(Pantaenus) found the Gospel according to St. Matthew (which had
arrived ahead of Pantaenus by more than a century). For
Bartholomew, one of the apostles, had preached to them and left
them (in India) the writing of Matthew in the Hebrew language which
they had preserved.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a shock hidden in that rather matter-of-fact
statement,'' Moffett says. ``The surprise, of course, is the
mention of Bartholomew as the pioneer to the East.''
</P>
<P>
   Many scholars are unaware of an apostle other than Thomas ever
going to India, and some even doubt that Thomas himself went.
</P>
<P>
   Moffett ponders, ``What was Bartholomew ... doing in India with
a Hebrew Gospel of Matthew?''
</P>
<P>
   Why India?
</P>
<P>
   ``Jewish colonies are known to have existed in India from very
early times,'' Moffett writes, ``If there were, as tradition
asserts, Hebrew or Aramaic copies of the Gospel in circulation as
early as that, it is not unreasonable to imagine a Jewish
missionary using one in his evangelistic work, for it was the
apostolic missionary tradition to preach first to the Jewish
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, two historical records _ the New Testament's Book
of Acts and the writings of the Church Fathers _ confirm some of
Moffett's assertions.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Gospels were so thoroughly Jewish, there was no
concept among Jewish believers of preaching to gentiles. According
to Acts, Jewish believers in Israel were horrified to learn that
Peter had entered a gentile home and preached to gentiles. Jews did
not preach to gentiles until the Jewish believers fled from
persecution to the Greek city of Antioch in Asia Minor.
</P>
<P>
   While the Book of Acts lists the 11 apostles _ Judas having
hanged himself _ it doesn't say how they were paired. But what is
known is that Jesus instructed his disciples to work and travel by
twos.
</P>
<P>
   So it would be natural for Thomas to travel with a companion to
India and for Bartholomew to have taken along a freshly copied text
of Matthew's gospel, especially if it were the first and only
gospel written at the time. Jews customarily took their sacred
texts with them, as we see from the New Testament accounts of
Paul's travels, and it was this Gospel of Matthew that Pantaenus
found a century and a half later in India.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Jews of the early centuries, Pantaenus became a
follower of Jesus. But it is not only Pantaenus' academic
background as philosopher, his founding of the great theological
school in Alexandria and his two renowned disciples, Clement and
Origen, that make him so important here.
</P>
<P>
   As Moffett writes, ``The fact that Pantaenus was ... Jewish ...
explains his particular attention to the Hebrew copy of the Gospel
of Matthew.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that he returned to Alexandria with the same gospel
adds enormous validity to its discovery.
</P>
<P>
   These discoveries about Bartholomew going to India, the
existence of the Gospel of Matthew in Hebrew that was probably
written before 50 AD and the same text being returned to the West
add ``another piece of evidence of once again very early dating of
the New Testament,'' said Douglas Cecil, associate professor of
pastoral ministries at Dallas Theological Seminary.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do we now know where some of the apostles traveled but
also that Hebrew was far from a dead language at the time of
Christ, as many scholars espouse, and it evidently was used by Jews
all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   In search of what language was used during the time of Christ,
we find some interesting clues. Scholar George Howard, in his book,
``The Gospel of Matthew According to a Primitive Hebrew Text,''
quotes an early second-century writing by Papias (ca. 60-130 CE),
bishop of Hierapolis in Asia Minor, as stating that ``Matthew
collected the oracles in the Hebrew language.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard goes on to say, ``It has become commonplace (for the past
century and a half) to suppose that by 'Hebrew,' Papias meant
'Aramaic.' The subsequent discovery of many ... Hebrew documents
from Palestine from the general time period of Jesus now show
Hebrew to have been alive and well in the first century.''
</P>
<P>
   He also writes of a ``remarkable Hebrew text of the Gospel of
Matthew'' that appears in a 14th-century rabbinical text by
Shem-Tob, which Howard says is written ``in a kind of Hebrew one
would expect for a document composed in the first century.'' That
is, before 100 AD. He suggests that this Hebrew text, going back to
the time of Christ, may have ``served as a model for the Greek.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a common scholarly assumption that the original language
of the gospels was Greek. Yet the Church Fathers tell us otherwise.
Irenaeus, in the second century AD., tells us that Matthew was not
the only gospel writer who wrote to the Hebrews ``in their own
dialect.''
</P>
<P>
   Historians Epiphanius and Eusebius, both from the fourth century
AD, tell us that ``Matthew issued his Gospel in Hebrew'' and that
he wrote his Gospel ``in his native language.''
</P>
<P>
   A Dallas Theological Seminary professor of New Testament,
Darrell Bock, said that according to the tradition of the early
church, the language Jesus originally spoke ``was a Semitic
language.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that anti-Semitism was involved in some New
Testament research and that ``some German scholars in the 1930s and
even earlier were anti-Semitic.''
</P>
<P>
   William Farmer, a New Testament professor at University of
Dallas and author of the just-published book, ``Anti-Judaism and
the Gospels,'' sees a concerted effort by modern scholars to
divorce Jesus from his Jewish roots and language.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an unconscious attempt to remove Judaism from
Christianity by making Mark the first gospel instead of Matthew,
which is more Jewish. By making Mark the first gospel, it
discredits Matthew as only a Jewish makeover of Mark and thus
offers an excuse to disregard Matthew.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, some Biblical critics denied the use of Hebrew
and promoted the theory that the gospel writers used Aramaic and
Greek in an effort to dilute the Jewishness of the gospels.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But there is other evidence that, if anything, Aramaic and Greek
took a back seat to Hebrew among Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Orthodox rabbi and Talmudic scholar Dov Brisman of Philadelphia
said the Talmud implies that the two great sages of Judaism in 100
BC, Hillel and Shammai, ``spoke Hebrew to one another.'' He also
said the Aramaic version of the Bible was discontinued because Jews
only read the Holy Scriptures in the original Hebrew so that
nothing would be lost in translation.
</P>
<P>
   Two other scholars also assert that Aramaic was not the only
Semitic language used by Jews in Israel before and at the time of
Christ.
</P>
<P>
   In a paper presented to the Leeds University Oriental Society in
1966 called, ``Qumran to Edessa,'' J.C.L. Gibson wrote, ``No doubt
that Jews of the homeland continued to speak Hebrew in the everyday
life still into the Christian epoch _ otherwise how can we explain
the emergence of the late form of Hebrew known as Mishnaic
Hebrew?''
</P>
<P>
   Milton Fisher, professor of Old Testament at Philadelphia
Theological Seminary and the seminary's former president, provided
the coup de grace to the whole matter, saying, ``Did not Paul speak
to Jews at Jerusalem in Hebrew?''
</P>
<P>
   How could scholars miss this well-known passage of scripture in
the Book of Acts dealing with Paul's arrest by the Romans and his
defense before Jewry?
</P>
<P>
   ``And when he (the chief captain) had given him license, Paul
stood on the stairs ... And when there was a great silence, he
spoke to them in the Hebrew tongue ... And when they heard that he
spoke in the Hebrew tongue to them, they kept the more silence...''
(Acts 21: 39 through Acts 22: 2)
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It is not only in the language of the Gospels and of Jewry that
biblical critics take issue with the facts of history, but in the
historical truth and validity of the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   With a subtle anti-Semitic agenda behind liberal scholarly
theories about the Old and New Testaments, biblical critics have
developed, according to Ben Levi's book, ``Revelation,'' a ``dogma
that nothing original came from the Jews'' and that ``the existence
of miracle, prophecy, and revelation (without which no
understanding of the Bible is possible) were denied in a dogmatic
fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   These anti-supernaturalists theorized that Matthew and Luke
``borrowed'' the language, style and, most importantly of all, the
viewpoint of Mark's condensed version of Jesus' life, and they
expanded upon Mark's account.
</P>
<P>
   This so-called Synoptic (i.e. similar viewpoint) theory was
developed and exploited by liberal scholars who did not accept the
possibility that four different men who knew Jesus and were his
disciples could be divinely inspired to write similar accounts from
what they witnessed from their own personal perspectives.
</P>
<P>
   Another aspect of the anti-supernaturalist theory is that the
gospels were written long after the fact. There are still many
diehards among biblical critics who accept their own dating of the
gospels and say they were not written by eyewitnesses. It is
precisely here, in the clash between unbelief and belief, that
liberals and believers cross swords.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the testimony of the early church reminds us that the
gospels have as much historical as ethical value and that apostles
such as Bartholomew and Thomas, eyewitnesses to the ministry of
Jesus, did not give their lives for a mere myth.

LIFE MAGAZINE WILL CEASE REGULAR PUBLICATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DANIEL J. WAKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Life magazine, which died in 1972 as a weekly
publication only to be resuscitated six years later and showcased
generations of prominent photographers as America's premier picture
magazine, will cease regular publication after its May issue, its
parent company, Time Inc., said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Life will still come out periodically in special issues, some of
which will commemorate ``milestone events,'' Time said in a
statement. Life will continue to publish books and will launch a
web-based business.
</P>
<P>
   Life, which was once a pillar of Henry Luce's publishing empire,
becomes a traditional media casualty in an industry with an
increasing Internet presence. In a statement, Don Logan, chairman
of Time Inc., and Norman Pearlstine, the company's editor-in-chief,
called Life a valuable and honored franchise whose name deserves to
be preserved.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, despite the exceptional efforts of a number of
talented publishers and editors, the publishing formula for a
monthly general interest magazine was just not sustainable,'' they
said.
</P>
<P>
   Logan and Pearlstine said the ``new strategy would be the best
way to maintain the Life brand.''
</P>
<P>
   Luce conceived Life in 1936 and published the first issue on
Nov. 23. The start-up team included Alfred Eisenstaedt, who became
one of the century's most influential photo-journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Life ceased publication as a weekly in 1972, but continued to
appear as special issues before returning as a monthly in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   The original magazine distinguished itself in refining the craft
of modern photojournalism.

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Where the voters are
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a march of thousands _ and a key event in New York for Rudy
Giuliani and Hillary Clinton. The Irish Gay and Lesbian
Organization was banned from marching in the St. Patrick's Day
parade, but the two New York Senate candidates were in the
spotlight. Giuliani, the city's mayor, was near the front as usual.
Before Friday, Clinton had never walked up Fifth Avenue on St.
Patrick's Day.
</P>
<P>
   SCORING POINTS WITH THE ECONOMY
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore has convinced much of the public that he can keep the
strong economy going, and that has helped him gain ground on George
W. Bush, suggests a new survey by Republican and Democratic
pollsters. A Voter.com-Battleground poll released Friday showed
Bush ahead 48 percent to 44 percent. But Gore, who decided last
summer to focus more heavily on his economic role in the Clinton
administration, is getting more credit for his abilities on that
issue. And that has played a role in cutting the double-digit
margin Bush held last year, the poll indicated. The poll has a 3
percentage point margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT ABOUT THOSE LOCAL SCHOOL BOARDS?
</P>
<P>
   Taking direct aim at Al Gore, George W. Bush is kicking off the
general election ad wars with sharp criticism of the Clinton
administration's education record in a TV spot in a few
battleground states. Bush is charging that reading scores have
stagnated and American students have continued to rank near the
bottom in math tests. ``Gore and Clinton had eight years, but
they've failed,'' the 60-second ad says. It also touts Bush's
record in Texas on education and his goals for the presidency. The
ads will run through Tuesday in southern Illinois stations that
reach into Kentucky, Iowa and Missouri. Illinois' primary is
Tuesday, but the ad is clearly intended as early groundwork for the
fall.
</P>
<P>
   SHOULDERING THE GUN ISSUE
</P>
<P>
   After George W. Bush aligned himself with conservative groups
during the primary campaign, he is trying to shift back toward the
political center for the general election. Al Gore says Bush does
the bidding of the gun lobby; Bush strongly denies it. Bush's
effort at fence-mending came as he fended off fresh criticism from
Gore and waded into the nasty dispute between the National Rifle
Association and President Clinton. He said the NRA had ``gone too
far'' by accusing Clinton of having ``blood on his hands'' for
failing to enforce gun laws before a deadly shooting last year in
Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   MENDING FENCES WITH THE VANQUISHED
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush put the positive spin on his relationship with
John McCain after seeming dismissive of his defeated rival in a
published interview. Bush demonstrated respect by saying that he
and McCain could make a dynamic duo in Washington, with the senator
and would-be president working together on issues such as
overhauling campaign financing and shoring up Social Security.
Earlier, Bush said things like this to the New York Times: ``Well,
then, how come he didn't win?'' and ``No, he didn't change my
views.'' McCain supporters said such ``macho talk'' had harmed
hopes for an early endorsement of Bush that could be vital to a win
in November.
</P>
<P>
   AT LEAST ONE BATTLE LEFT IN THE WAR
</P>
<P>
   John McCain also may decide to withhold an endorsement of George
W. Bush if Bush tries to replace McCain delegates with his own
supporters at the national convention in Philadelphia. Although it
may seem like little more than a parliamentary issue, having loyal
delegates at the convention is a matter of necessity and pride for
McCain. By having supporters fill the 239 delegate slots he won, he
could use his convention soldiers for one last stand: to influence
platform issues such as campaign finance reform or to suspend
convention rules.
</P>
<P>
   SELLING TAX CUTS, COMPASSION
</P>
<P>
   Feeling comfortable after winning the GOP nomination, George W.
Bush acknowledged that he needs to do a better job selling his
tax-cut plan to the American people, as well as to the Republicans
who narrowly control the House. In an interview with the Chicago
Tribune, Bush also conceded he must reach out to John McCain's
supporters to defeat Al Gore in the fall. And while he insisted
that he had not abandoned his message of compassionate conservatism
to appeal to the party's social and religious right during the
primary campaign, he indicated he plans to move back toward the
center.
</P>
<P>
   CRANKING UP THE MONEY MACHINE
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush's Illinois swing marked his return to the
fund-raising circuit for the first time since mid-December. His
$1,000-a-person event in Wheaton on Thursday was expected to raise
$100,000. The Bush team plans to raise up to $10 million in the
next two months because his record-shattering $73 million campaign
fund has been largely depleted by the contest with John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   WATCH SOME HOOPS THIS WEEKEND?
</P>
<P>
   Both contenders, George W. Bush and Al Gore, were taking a long
weekend off the campaign trail, with Gore staying at home in
Washington and Bush spending the time at his ranch outside Waco,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   EIGHT MONTHS LEFT TO SPEND A LOT MORE
</P>
<P>
   More than $114 million has been spent or committed to
advertising by outside groups seeking to influence elections this
cycle _ a record, according to a report released Friday. One in
four ads deal with health care, principally efforts to defeat the
patients' bill of rights and to influence the debate over including
prescription drugs in Medicare, according to the study by the
Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania.
There are more attack ads than in previous years, with about 40
percent of them attacking a candidate or specific legislation. In
the 1995-96 election cycle, the center estimated that $135 million
to $150 million was spent on issue ads by 27 organizations.
</P>
<P>
   WHO'S THIS KENNEDY CHALLENGER?
</P>
<P>
   Jack E. Robinson III, 39, the Republican challenger who just
jumped in against 38-year Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.), is a
Boston-born African-American businessman whose father once headed
the city's NAACP chapter. He's seeking to become the third
popularly elected African-American U.S. senator. He has never held
political office. State Republican leaders, though, see him as the
party's last best hope to go against Kennedy, in part because the
state has a strong civil rights record, but also because they
believe his fiscally conservative, socially moderate approach to
politics, including support for abortion rights, will appeal to a
broad spectrum of Massachusetts voters. The last African-American
senator, Edward Brooke, also was from Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   IRS AS POLITICAL WEAPON
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush said an unsuccessful attempt by Al Gore's vice
presidential office to get IRS information for a labor union raises
``serious ethical questions.'' Bush called on Gore to further
explain the 1997 contacts, which were deemed improper by
investigators for Congress' bipartisan Joint Taxation Committee.
Gore's office called the 1997 contacts by two aides ``a simple
status check.'' But the committee report said the information the
aides sought appears to have been protected by tax confidentiality
laws. The report's main focus was to answer allegations from
nonprofit conservative groups that they were audited because of
their anti-Clinton views.
</P>
<P>
   RELIGION AS A POLITICAL WEAPON
</P>
<P>
   Republican national Chairman Jim Nicholson re-injected religion
into partisan politics this week by calling on Al Gore to repudiate
two abortion-rights organizations _ the National Abortion and
Reproductive Rights Action League, known as NARAL, and Women
Leaders Online _ that have called for a review of the Vatican's
status at the United Nations. ``As a Catholic, I am appalled that
Al Gore has courted the support of two groups trying to throw the
Vatican out of the United Nations,'' Nicholson said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   YOU ALWAYS HURT THE ONES YOU LOVE
</P>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan acknowledged that his White House bid may hurt the
Republican Party he has loved, but said he must run to promote the
causes he believes in. A two-time GOP presidential candidate now
seeking the Reform Party nomination, Buchanan said his candidacy
may syphon votes away from Republican George W. Bush, possibly
hurting the party's chances of reclaiming the presidency. But he
said his causes would be ignored if he didn't run.
</P>
<P>
   AFTER RUNOFF, THERE'S A TOUGHER FIGHT
</P>
<P>
   A runoff next month will determine which Democrat will take on
Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas) in the general election this
fall. Retired Air Force lawyer Gene Kelly was the top vote-getter
in the Democratic U.S. Senate primary Tuesday, but didn't receive
the majority needed for outright victory.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly got 35.8 percent in the five-way race, according to
unofficial final results from the secretary of state's office.
Charles Gandy, a former one-term state legislator, got 22.7
percent, one-tenth of a point above the third-place finisher.
</P>
<P>
   ORGANIZING FOR OFFICE-HOLDING
</P>
<P>
   AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney was in New York to promote an
ambitious effort by big labor to have at least 2,000 union members
run for office nationwide this year _ from campaigns for school
boards to campaigns for Congress. Too many of the nation's elected
officials, he said, come from big wealth, with at least one of
every four members of Congress being a millionaire. But, he
declared, big labor's ``2,000 in 2000'' program would help rectify
that by ensuring that the voices of the less well-off were
represented in the halls of power.

ext. 227. WASHINGTON, March 17 -- The following chart shows how
senators and representatives voted on key bills and amendments
within the last week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the
measure; an ``N'' means the member voted against the measure; a
``?'' means the member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member
voted ``present.''

   THERE ARE NO SENATE VOTES THIS WEEK.

<P>
   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: AVIATION
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday approved, 319-101, a three-year $40
billion authorization for the Federal Aviation Administration for
programs through 2003. The bill, which has been approved by a
conference of House and Senate lawmakers, provides nearly $10
billion for airport improvements and safety grants, and allows
airports to increase flight traffic and raise passenger taxes.
Supporters said the bill would make airports safer and help
low-volume airports become more economically viable. Opponents said
the bill would increase the amount of flights at busy airports. A
``yes'' vote favors the authorization.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: PROPERTY
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday approved, 226-182, a measure that would
permit land developers to appeal state and local zoning decisions
in federal court. Private property owners would be able to appeal
cases if initial development applications are denied at the local
level. Supporters say it prevents private land owners from getting
caught in years of state-level litigation. Opponents say it
benefits big development companies who can circumvent local
authorities and take their case to federal coaurts. A ``yes'' vote
favors the measure.

BUSH AD ATTACKS GORE ON EDUCATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ George W. Bush's first television commercial of
his general election presidential campaign against Vice President
Al Gore promises a ``crusade'' to improve education while giving
Gore a failing grade when it comes to helping the nation's schools.
</P>
<P>
   The ad is airing through Tuesday only in Illinois but is
reaching viewers in three surrounding states. Populated with
smiling children, the ad has decidedly negative comments about
Gore, although a Bush spokesman insisted the dominant message was a
positive one about Bush's plans to offer ``a fresh start for
education.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign blasted the minute-long advertisement as a
distortion of Gore's record.
</P>
<P>
   An ad by the Gore camp hits right back.
</P>
<P>
   ``George W. Bush _ from South Carolina to New York he used dirty
politics to trash John McCain's record. Now he's running attack ads
against Al Gore,'' the ad says.
</P>
<P>
   ``No amount of negative advertising can hide the fact that
Bush's only real agenda item is a risky tax scheme that would leave
nothing to invest in schools and could force deep cuts in
education,'' Gore spokesman Doug Hattaway said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has challenged Bush to forgo television advertising, but
Bush refused the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The ad, which is timed to stir interest in next week's
inconsequential Illinois GOP presidential primary as well as to
influence November voters, poses this question: ``Is the status quo
in America's schools good enough?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Under Al Gore and Bill Clinton, national reading scores
stagnated. America's high school students placed almost dead last
in international math tests. The achievement gap between poor and
non-poor students remains wide. Gore and Clinton had eight years,
but they failed.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning to the positive pitch, the ad states Bush will ``fight
for reforms hailed as the most fundamental in a generation,''
including more accountability for teachers and students, and
increased federal funding for public schools without jeopardizing
local control.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said ``this is the first ad of the
fall campaign and we think it is never too early to talk about the
importance of education. It's a positive education spot, while Al
Gore is masquerading as somebody who's done well on education,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer said the negative statements about Gore were based on
U.S. Department of Education data from 1996 and 1998, including
nationwide math and reading scores.

 &HT;     By JUSTINO AGUILA and SETH ROSENFELD  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A man described as a well-respected in his
Missouri hometown was in federal custody Friday for allegedly
threatening the crew of an Alaska Airlines flight and breaking into
the cockpit of a San Francisco-bound jet.
</P>
<P>
   Peter L. Bradley Jr., 40, of Blue Springs, Mo., was released
from Mills Peninsula Hospital after treatment for injuries and
taken into custody by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   During the bizarre incident Thursday evening aboard Alaska
Airlines Flight 259, the highly agitated passenger alternately
muttered about ``love lost'' and threatened to kill everyone aboard
the plane, according to the police and passengers.
</P>
<P>
   But no motive was apparent, said Sgt. Joe Reilly of the San
Francisco police, who speculated that Bradley might have been on
drugs or alcohol, or in need of psychiatric medication.
</P>
<P>
   A woman who answered the phone at Bradley's home Friday morning
said she was stunned by the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just not in his character. He's a wonderful person,''
said Janice McGrath, who described herself as a close friend of the
Bradley family for more than 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   She said Bradley was a professional who was well respected in
his community, though she declined to give further details.
</P>
<P>
   The incident began about 7:10 p.m. Thursday, as the jet,
returning from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, was some 160 miles south of
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley had been acting in a strange manner early in the flight,
repeatedly changing his seat, talking nonsense to other passengers,
sweating profusely and taking off his socks and shirt, Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   The crew, including the pilot, asked him to remain seated
several times, but he disobeyed them, Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley eventually took a seat in the first-class section, he
said. There he simulated a gun with his hand and allegedly
threatened, ```I'm going to kill all of you; keep away from me,'''
Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   The passengers were horrified.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of them didn't think they were going to make it,'' said
passenger Robert Benjamin, 56, of West Linn, Ore. ``Families were
crying.''
</P>
<P>
   As flight attendants continued to coax Bradley back to his seat,
he became angry and threatened them. Soon after, he forced open the
cockpit door and lunged at the plane's controls, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   The co-pilot, whom the authorities did not identify, already had
been alerted and armed himself with a tool in case of attack,
Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   As flight attendants continued to coax the man back to his seat,
he became angry and threatened them. Soon after, he forced open the
cockpit door and lunged at the controls of the jet, the police
said. The co-pilot tried to block the passenger from the controls
and the two men scuffled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The co-pilot was able to do a body block,'' Reilly said,
adding that Bradley weighs about 250 pounds and is 6-feet-2-inches
tall.
</P>
<P>
   As the two men fought, the co-pilot suffered cuts to his right
hand as the passenger tried to get the tool _ described by the
police as a pick-like instrument _ away from him.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot called for help and was quickly aided by seven
passengers. They and the crew subdued Bradley and forced him to the
floor where he was bound with plastic restraints.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately all the guys moved quick and he ain't dead and
we're not dead,'' Benjamin said.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot requested an emergency landing at the San Francisco
International Airport, where law enforcement officers met the
flight shortly before 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the jet landed, airport tower officials already had
received an ``alert 1'' message, meaning there was an emergency on
the plane, said Philip Meginness, an airport duty manager.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was taken into the custody of FBI agents. Threatening
the crew of an airplane is a federal offense.
</P>
<P>
   Meginness said Bradley was taken by ambulance to Mills-Peninsula
Hospital in Burlingame with bruises and cuts to his face. The
co-pilot also was taken to a hospital for treatment of cuts to his
hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't overemphasize the heroics that went on tonight,'' said
Reilly, referring to the passengers' and crew's actions. ``They
averted a tremendous disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft went on from San Francisco to Portland, Ore.,
arriving at 12:50 a.m. Friday. The plane was carrying 43 passengers
and five crew members, according to Alaska Airlines.

IS YOUR PC POSSESSED? 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   My favorite kind of newspaper headline is the one that asks a
question to which anybody in his or her right mind already knows
the answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can New York save itself?'' (Of course not.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Do special interests control our government?'' (Of course they
do.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Are our kids exposed to too much TV violence?'' (Only when the
set is turned on.)
</P>
<P>
   Which is why I was so smitten by a headline I recently saw in
Weekly World News, the New York Times of tabloid journalism: ``Is
Your Computer Possessed by a Demon?''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps there are one or two people out there who do not think
their computer is possessed by a demon. Maybe they don't like the
word ``demon.'' Maybe they'd prefer ``poltergeist'' or ``fiend'' or
the rather generic ``evil spirit.'' It is possible, of course, that
different kinds of demons inhabit different computers.
</P>
<P>
   The demon in my computer, for instance, is rather predictable
and unimaginative. (I have no idea where he picks that up from.)
His favorite line, regardless of the circumstances, is ``You have
performed an illegal operation and the computer will be shut
down.'' There is no discussion, no debate and no amount of
pleading, whining or crying will make my computer's demon change
its mind.
</P>
<P>
   This is not unusual. According to the Reverend Jim Peasboro,
author of the upcoming book, ``The Devil in the Machine,'' one in
10 computers in America contains some sort of evil spirit or demon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any PC built after 1985 has the storage capacity to house an
evil spirit,'' Peasboro told the newspaper. The Savannah, Ga.,
clergyman said he became aware of the problem from counseling
churchgoers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned that many members of my congregation became in touch
with a dark force whenever they used their computers,'' he said.
``Decent, happily married family men were drawn irresistibly to
pornographic Web sites and forced to witness unspeakable
abominations.'' (You decent, happily married family men may want to
try this excuse on your wife who up until now probably assumed that
your witness of unspeakable abominations was strictly voluntary.)
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if you're going to get to the cold, dark,
silicon-encrusted heart of computer demons, you've got to meet the
beast in person, and that's what Peasboro did. He logged on to a
parishioner's computer himself and immediately an
``artificial-intelligence'' program fired up without him even
clicking on it. (This happens to me all the time, by the way.)
</P>
<P>
   After typing out a few brief insults, just to get warmed up, the
computer then ``went haywire'' and printed out what looked like
gobbledygook. ``I later had an expert in dead languages examine the
text,'' the minister said. ``It turned out to be a stream of
obscenities written in a 2,800-year-old Mesopotamian dialect!''
</P>
<P>
   (This certainly is a plausible explanation for the strange stuff
that appears on my computer screen, but I wonder if it would be
worth it to keep an expert in dead languages on 24-hour call.)
</P>
<P>
   So what's the solution? Peasboro advises that if you suspect
your computer is possessed (and, of course, you know it is), you
consult a clergyman or, if the computer is still under warranty,
take it in for servicing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technicians can replace the hard drive and reinstall the
software, getting rid of the wicked spirit permanently.''
</P>
<P>
   Permanently or until such time as your new computer starts
spewing ancient Mesopotamian obscenities, whichever comes first.
</P>

&HT;     POLL SHOWS RISING PESSIMISM, A PLUS FOR BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAN FREEDMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the curtain rises on the presidential campaign
between Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush, a new
bipartisan poll shows that voters are in an increasingly
pessimistic mood about the state of the nation _ a trend that could
help Bush if it keeps up.
</P>
<P>
   Rising gas prices, stock market gyrations and the shooting death
of a six-year-old girl by a boy of the same age last month in
Michigan led 43 percent of respondents in the Voter.Com
Battleground 2000 Poll to say the United States is on the wrong
track. Forty-four percent said the nation is on the right track.
</P>
<P>
   That split compares to the same poll in January when 49 percent
saw the country heading in the right direction while 40 said it was
going wrong. Throughout the economic boom of the 1990s, polls
generally have tracked an upbeat mood which in turn fueled
President Clinton's re-election in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In the short run, ``a little nervousness is a good thing for Al
Gore,'' said Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster who is part of the
team that has done the Battleground Poll for nine years. ``When
voters are a little jittery, they are less likely to jump ship and
more likely to look for experience to continue prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   But a continued downturn in the national mood, ``then obviously
that would be bad for the Democrats,'' Lake said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the poll of 1,000 voters found Bush, the likely
Republican presidential nominee, leading Gore, the presumptive
Democratic nominee, 47 percent to 44 percent, with 9 percent
undecided. The survey was conducted Sunday and Monday.
</P>
<P>
   With Democrats vying to regain a foothold of power on Capitol
Hill, the poll showed that the congressional race was an even
41-percent-to-41-percent split between Republicans and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   With a 3.1 percentage point margin of error, the poll's
presidential result also is a virtual tie.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush advantage, however, is in line with other recent polls.
The latest USA Today/CNN/Gallup Poll earlier this week, for
instance, found Bush leading Gore 49 percent to 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
   With the primary battle now over, the opening act of the
head-to-head 2000 campaign poses more immediate problems for Gore
than Bush, the poll shows.
</P>
<P>
   With key constituencies that have been Democratic in recent
elections, Bush is either ahead of Gore or dead even. Among these
constituencies are:
</P>
<P>
   _ Mothers with children at home. The so-called soccer moms,
mostly white suburbanites who voted heavily for Clinton in 1996,
are favoring Bush over Gore by 55 percent to 37 percent. But
overall among women _ including African-Americans, women over 65
and working women _ Gore has a four point lead over Bush.
</P>
<P>
   _ Catholics, a traditional Democratic constituency. Despite some
negative fallout for Bush after his Feb. 2 appearance at Bob Jones
University, a conservative Christian school in South Carolina whose
leaders have made anti-Catholic statements, Bush and Gore split
these voters at 47 percent each.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hispanics, another strong Democratic group. Hispanics favor
Bush by a margin of 51 percent to 45 percent. But Gore's showing
has improved since the January poll, when Bush led Gore 51 percent
to 38 percent. And by a better than 2-to-1 margin, Hispanics voted
for Gore over Bush in California's March 7 primary.
</P>
<P>
   So far, ``there's not any obvious one or two issues grabbing the
attention of the voters,'' said Ed Goeas, a Republican pollster who
heads up the GOP side of the Battleground Poll.
</P>
<P>
   As has been the case in other polls, moral values ranks as the
No. 1 issue among respondents at 18 percent. Among mothers, 28
percent said moral values was their top issue. ``Moral values'' is
a catchall category that incorporates such things as Clinton and
the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal, X-rated rock lyrics, as well as
the shootings in Michigan last month and at Columbine High School
in Littleton, Colo., last year.
</P>
<P>
   Voters concerned about moral values tend to favor Bush. On the
question of personal characteristics, Bush leads Gore in terms of
``strength,'' ``trustworthiness'' and ``vision.'' But Gore leads
Bush on ``experience'' and as the candidate who ``cares about
people like you.''
</P>
<P>
   Among issues, education is No. 2 with 13 percent. Education is a
slim plus for Gore, with 44 percent of respondents favoring Gore as
the candidate who can do a better job, compared to 42 percent for
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also leads Bush on health care and propping up Social
Security. But Bush leads Gore on holding the line on taxes and
maintaining economic prosperity. On gun control the two are evenly
split.
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   The two recently departed challengers, Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., and former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, a Democrat, would
have only a small impact as running mates to their respective
parties' nominees.
</P>
<P>
   McCain would bump Bush's overall number up slightly _ from 47
percent to 48 percent. Bradley, however, would drag Gore down two
points to 42 percent.

&HT;     COURT TO DECIDE WHETHER STATES CAN SET TRADE POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, March 19)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK HELM  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Balancing moral values against a company's right to
do business overseas, the U.S. Supreme Court this week examines
whether cities and states can have their own foreign policy and
impose economic sanctions on countries with repressive regimes.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a Massachusetts law that prevents the commonwealth
government from making purchases from companies that do business
with Myanmar, also known as Burma. The court will hear arguments on
the case Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The broader issue in the case is whether trade restrictions
imposed by states and local governments infringe on the federal
government's constitutional role as the nation's arbiter of foreign
policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court is going to have to decide whether the United States
speaks with one voice on foreign policy or if each state will be
able to make its own, at least in terms of economic sanctions,''
said Peter Spiro, an expert on international law at Hofstra
University in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of state and local governments have passed laws that
restrict business with firms operating in such countries as China,
Cuba, Nigeria and Sudan. Some cities also have said they will not
do business with global firms that operate sweatshops abroad or
that fail to pay a living wage.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the statutes say cities and states are making foreign
policy decisions that should be left to the federal government. In
1998, a coalition of 34 firms represented by the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce and the National Foreign Trade Association (NFTA),
challenged the Massachusetts law.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the companies had business ties to Myanmar, which
prevented them from bidding for contracts with the commonwealth
government.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts enacted the so-called Myanmar law to protest the
government jailing in 1996 of Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu
Kyi, who overwhelming won a 1990 presidential election but was
never allowed to take the post.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union and Japan also joined the lawsuit, saying
firms in Britain, Germany or Japan should not be forced to choose
between doing business with Myanmar or Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The founding fathers did not intend for Massachusetts to make
foreign policy,'' NFTA Vice President Dan O'Flaherty said.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, the First Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston agreed
and struck down the law. Writing for the appeals court, Judge
Sandra L. Lynch said that while there was no dispute over the
``deplorable'' conditions imposed by the military government in
Myanmar, a state had no constitutional authority to regulate
conduct beyond its borders. Myanmar _ one of the world's poorest
countries, according the United Nations _ has been ruled for 38
years by a military dictatorship that has brutally put down several
democratic movements.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch said the Massachusetts law was a ``direct attempt to
regulate the flow of foreign commerce,'' an activity that was the
responsibility of the federal government under the foreign commerce
clause of the Constitution. That clause of Article I gives Congress
the power to ``regulate commerce with foreign nations.''Lynch,
noting that there are 39,000 different state and local governments
in the United States, said there was the potential for trade chaos
if many others followed the Massachusetts model.
</P>
<P>
   The commonwealth law ``interferes with the ability of the
federal government to speak with one voice,'' Lynch wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In its appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, Massachusetts argued
that nothing in the Constitution ``requires the states to trade
with dictators.''Commonwealth attorneys also noted that 23 states
and 80 cities once had laws restricting purchases from firms with
interests in South Africa to protest that country's policy of
racial Apartheid. ``Nothing in our federal Constitution denies to
the states the right to apply a moral standard to their spending
decisions,'' the commonwealth brief said.Several state and local
governments as well as nonprofit and human rights organizations
asked the court to overturn the decision by the appeals court.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the people of Massachusetts want to use their economy to
punish a dictatorship, they should be allowed to do that,'' said
Nick Penniman, spokesman for the Alliance for Democracy, a
Boston-based, human rights group.
</P>
<P>
   Business groups, which won the case in lower courts, also asked
the high court take the case so that the ruling by the appeals
court would be binding on the rest of the country. ``Burma is not a
big deal in terms of money, but other laws around the country have
restrictions on companies doing business in China and other
countries with huge markets,'' O'Flaherty said.
</P>
<P>
   Spiro said the case poses a tricky choice between two court
doctrines: the preeminence of the federal government in foreign
policy and trade, and the court's growing interest in
reinvigorating the role of states at the expense of federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   Spiro said he expects the court will come down on the side of
state sovereignty and rule in favor of Massachusetts. He said that
with the Cold War over, foreign policy issues have taken a back
seat to domestic debates in the eyes of the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years ago, if Massachusetts offended the Soviets, the
next thing you know we're in the World War III,'' Spiro said. ``But
today, with the Cold War over and huge amounts of foreign
investment across the United States, foreign governments are used
to dealing with state and local governments.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Spiro said that because economics has become so
important in global relations, giving states the ability to impose
trade sanctions would mean the federal government would lose one of
its most power weapons in dealing with other countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think about it, it's not that often that the
president or Congress orders our military into action to force
another country to do something,'' he said. ``Most of the time, the
U.S. government uses economics sanctions, and this case could
change all that.''

GOP LEADERS HOPE TO ZIP `GAS CRISIS' PAST VOTERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, March 19) 
 
By GREG McDONALD 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gas prices may be high, but Republican leaders hope
to get a lot of mileage by creating an election-year ``gas crisis''
campaign they can use against the Democrats and Vice President Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Republican congressional leaders, led by House Majority Whip Tom
DeLay of Texas, staged a protest last week at a Washington, D.C.,
Exxon station to spin a tale about a Clinton administration they
said has no energy policy to deal with rising gasoline prices.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay, joined by House Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas and
GOP Conference Chairman J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, accused the
administration of holding down domestic oil production, which he
said has caused an over-dependence on foreign oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``These gas prices are out of control,'' DeLay said, standing
near a sign advertising regular gas at a $1.68 a gallon. ``In the
real world skyrocketing costs like these cause real pain to working
Americans and families who are forced to absorb the hit of
needlessly high prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``This administration has done nothing to alleviate the
problem,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The staged protest is an example of how Republicans are trying
to exploit the plight of car-dependent Americans in an effort to
turn the price increase into a serious political problem, which
could help them defeat likely Democratic presidential nominee Gore
and Democratic incumbents this fall. But at the moment, they seem
as uncertain about what to do about high prices as the
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``If gas prices maybe yo-yo ... and end up with prices going up
significantly more ... that could turn into a serious issue (for
Gore),'' said congressional scholar Norman Ornstein, a senior
fellow at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But at the moment, he said Republicans can't expect to raise
doubts among voters about the solidness of the economy with
``antics'' such as holding a news conference at a gas station.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now most Americans seem to think this a temporary thing
... because they understand the laws of supply and demand,''
Ornstein said, adding that Americans also understand that Congress
has some responsibility, along with the president, for setting
energy policy.
</P>
<P>
   White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart made a similar
observation when he was asked to comment on DeLay's demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a Republican Congress that for a long time ... hasn't
wanted to move on things like energy efficiency,'' Lockhart said.
``And it's time (for them) to get ... out of the gas stations for
your, you know, political grandstanding, and start getting to
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the steady rise in gas prices since last summer, the
Republican leadership has shown little incentive to tackle the
problem with congressional action of their own, such as rolling
back the 4.3-cent federal gasoline tax or approving alternative
energy proposals designed to lessen U.S. consumption and dependence
on oil.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, they have dusted off and reintroduced
legislation that would allow drilling in the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge, but that measure is not expected to make it to a
vote anytime soon. The administration is still opposed to that
approach because of environmental concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic lawmakers called last week for a halt in the export
of Alaskan crude oil to Japan and other Asian countries, which
began in 1995 after a heavy lobbying effort by Republican lawmakers
from Alaska. The Democrats said a halt in the Alaskan exports,
which amount to about 60,000 barrels a day, could help ease prices.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the presumed
Republican presidential nominee, appeared last week to endorse the
idea of a temporary gas tax roll back while urging the
administration to take a stronger hand with oil-rich Middle Eastern
states the United States rescued from Saddam Hussein's grip in the
Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   At first, GOP lawmakers sounded like they would go along with a
roll back on the gas revenue, which they've taken to calling the
``Gore tax'' because the vice president cast the tie-breaking vote
in the Senate that put the tax in place in 1993 to help balance the
federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   But by week's end, they joined Bush in backing away from the
idea because it might force states to increase local taxes to pay
for highway and bridge projects that are now funded in large part
by the federal gasoline tax. Republicans also heeded the warning of
consumer experts who advised that cutting the small federal tax
would not help much to lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   Armey, for example, cautioned his GOP colleagues against getting
``bogged down,'' as he put it, ``on only one dimension of the
problem.'' He called a temporary repeal of the gas tax ``a
short-term dimension that offers scant relief.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the position Gore has staked out on the campaign trail.
In a series of interviews last week, he rejected the roll back
proposal precisely because it would force some states to increase
their own taxes on gasoline. The state and local taxes on gas are
already much higher than the federal tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're talking about is not the solution,'' Gore said,
adding that he hopes that ``tough negotiations'' now being
conducted with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
will result in increased production, which will drive prices lower.
</P>
<P>
   The OPEC group meets March 27 and Gore said statements from its
oil ministers in recent days seem to indicate that they will vote
to raise production.
</P>
<P>
   He said the administration had emphasized in its talks with the
ministers that stable oil prices are not only important to the
economic well-being of the United States, but to the world economy.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has not ruled out other options for bringing
down prices, however, including possible trade and other sanctions
against OPEC nations and the possible release of U.S. oil reserves
stockpiled for use in wartime or some other national emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans in Congress hope to force a vote this week on
legislation that would force Clinton to withhold U.S. aid to
countries that engage in oil ``price-fixing.'' But Clinton already
has that authority under an executive powers statute granting him
unilateral powers to deal with national emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   Even if OPEC ministers decide to increase production, it may be
several months or more before prices begin to come down and
stabilize. Democrats fear that if the high oil prices continue much
longer, they could give rise to inflation in other economic
sectors. There are already signs of that happening with increases
last month in producer prices and a hike in interest rates to help
keep inflation in check.
</P>
<P>
   There will likely be another interest rate increase this month
to help fend off inflation and slow the economy, and financial
experts say there could be one or two more before the November
elections. That could create a huge political problem for Gore,
whose presidential campaign is built in part on a gamble that the
unprecedented U.S. economic boom will continue at least through the
fall.
</P>
<P>
   If the boom starts to show serious signs of sputtering before
then, it could give Bush and Republicans the opening they need to
challenge Gore on economic policy.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, public opinion is still on Gore's side.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans, according to a CNN/Gallop poll last week,
believe the current rise in gasoline prices is only temporary and
has not yet reached the level of a ``crisis,'' as Republicans are
attempting to portray it.
</P>
<P>
   But a recent demonstration against high diesel fuel costs by
truckers on Capitol Hill was another indication that public opinion
could quickly turn if relief from the higher prices doesn't arrive
soon.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Outside a Gap store near Rockefeller Center late last
week, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals kicked off its
new multimillion dollar campaign against leather. Flanked by a few
dozen protesters, Chrissie Hynde, the lead singer of the
Pretenders, in black microfiber boots and a cowboy hat, held up a
sign deploring the chain's use of leather from Indian cows.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, two teen-agers from Westchester County, just outside New
York, were battling out the question that has been bugging fashion
insiders in recent weeks: Can the animal rights group make leather,
of all things, unfashionable?
</P>
<P>
   ``I totally believe that leather is totally disgusting,'' said
Sarah Stearns, 16, who became a vegetarian on New Year's Eve. She
was dressed in a vintage peasant blouse and jeans. ``I think it's
barbaric. It makes me want to throw up.''
</P>
<P>
   Her sister, Hannah, 15, shuddered beneath her oversize black
leather jacket. She was wearing imitation Fendi pony skin slides
and fingering a butter-colored suede shirt on the rack. ``You,''
she said, glancing at Sarah venomously, ``make me want to throw
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Their mother, Melanie Stearns, a social worker, smiled
painfully. ``Great,'' she said, her voice weary. ``We need a whole
new source of fights in the house. After all, the girls don't have
any fur to argue about. But I'm standing here thinking about shoes.
And belts. And how much I don't want to hear it.''
</P>
<P>
   It may seem surprising that the animal rights group is trying to
make leather the new fur now, considering the setbacks it has
suffered this last season. Dozens of designers returned to fur, and
overall fur sales rose 10 percent this winter. One might think the
group would go after more modest game. Instead, activists are
girding for what they call ``The Big One.'' They are convinced they
can coax and sloganize leather into a state of political
incorrectness.
</P>
<P>
   But that seems unlikely. Leather hasn't been as popular since
the Paleolithic period. Not only do most people consider it
synonymous with high-quality footwear, but this spring stores are
bulging with leather and exotic skins. Once seen as a winter
fabric, leather is now even being made into thin pastel suedes for
summer, washable white leather shirts and whisper-light calfskin
tankinis. Kidskin capris, Pucci slacks in pink and blue and python
sling-back shoes are best sellers at Jeffrey, the latest downtown
temple of style.
</P>
<P>
   Commune, a new restaurant in the Flatiron district, is set to
open in April with a 28-foot all-leather bar. And the April cover
of Harper's Bazaar will show the model Gisele, navel bared, in a
white Armani leather jacket. The magazine has never before put
leather on the cover so late in the year. ``Before, leather was
only seen as a sort of tough fabric, communicating only coolness
and fierceness,'' said Bazaar's editor in chief, Kate Betts. ``Now
it means everything.'' The Leather Apparel Association, a trade
group, said that leather sales have nearly tripled this decade, to
$2.7 billion last year from about $900 million in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   But there are some signs of a dissenting faction bubbling within
the core of the fashion world. People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals, or PETA, says it hopes that Stella McCartney, the Chloe
designer, will become an icon of leather-free chic. There is
widespread belief that McCartney _ the daughter of Paul and the
late Linda McCartney, staunch animal rights campaigners, and
herself a supporter of the group _ was offered the job as Gucci's
top designer but turned it down because of her aversion to working
with leather and fur. The idea that a young hot designer could
declare leather inessential to fashion sent a chill down Seventh
Avenue. ``Stella is our hero,'' said Dan Mathews, a spokesman for
PETA.
</P>
<P>
   To zero in on the mass market, the animal rights group is
targeting the Gap in spite of the fact that the chain is not the
country's biggest leather retailer and gets only 10 percent of its
leather from India. The Gap offers a public relations opportunity.
Some months ago, the company, unfamiliar with Hynde's longtime
public support of animal rights, wrote the singer a letter, seeking
permission to use one of her songs in a commercial for its
``Everyone in Leather'' campaign. PETA orchestrated a media blitz,
releasing the letter just as it began its first nationwide round of
protests.
</P>
<P>
   Why single out Indian imports when China has also been
criticized roundly in the international press for its treatment of
cows and sells more than 10 times the amount of leather to
manufacturers in the United States? Because in many parts of India,
cows are sacred. Making martyrs of Indian religious symbols is
meant to appeal to those who embrace such fashionable spiritual
concerns as yoga, Free Tibet and Cabala.
</P>
<P>
   Even the spiritually stylish may balk at surrendering their
skins. Unlike fur, leather is a byproduct of meat. Many people
sympathetic to the plight of furry little chinchillas seem to draw
the line at cows and sheep, whose flesh is also put to use. ``I
have raised money for PETA, and I don't wear fur,'' said Marie
Carr, a shoe designer from Seattle who was in Manhattan last week
on a scouting trip. ``But I'm sorry: I'm not a vegetarian, and I
just don't have a problem wearing leather. I'm comfortable with
that line.''
</P>
<P>
   That distinction has been echoed lately by several models,
including Trish Goff and Audrey Marnay, who have told designers
that they will wear only the fur or skin of animals that are eaten.
Mathews said he got fed up with fickle models and designers during
the anti-fur campaign of PETA. Bruised by the defections of former
supporters like Naomi Campbell and Donna Karan, the animal rights
group is cultivating new Hollywood friends like Drew Barrymore and
Pamela Anderson Lee.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who once wore plenty of leather herself and has been in an
on-again, off-again marriage with Tommy Lee, the leather-loving
member of Motley Crue, narrates the group's new video about the
abuse of Indian cows.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, whether leather can be rendered unfashionable may
depend less on moral arm-twisting or celebrity cheerleading than on
technology. There are more leather alternatives available now than
ever before. Gone is the cheap vinyl, plastic-looking pleather and
stifling rubber of the 1970s and 80s. Huge advances in fabric
technology have produced new artificial materials that are almost
indistinguishable from real animal skin and are somewhat cheaper.
Other cellulose-based products, which are in fact a little more
expensive than leather, even breathe like natural fibers,
manufacturers claim.
</P>
<P>
   Some young, urban companies _ often bellwethers for wider trends
_ are churning out fake-leather goods to meet popular demand. In
January, Dr. Martens, the London-based company whose hulking black
leather lace-up boots came to define the punk movement, began to
make a nonleather ``vegetarian'' version of its two most popular
models. Made of Lorica, a cellulose-based fiber from Spain, they
are 15 percent more expensive than leather Dr. Martens, retailing
for about $135. Now available in only 50 stores and on some Web
sites, the shoes are set to get wider distribution as soon as Dr.
Martens can meet demand. The shoes are sold out until June.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Thome, a Dr. Martens spokesman, said that for years the
company had been getting an escalating number of requests for
nonleather Dr. Martens, but until recently, there was no material
sufficiently comfortable and enough like leather to use. He said he
saw no conflict in a company's built on the nihilistic anti-hippie
ethos of punk now making a so-called vegetarian shoe. Most Dr.
Martens employees, including Thome, are 30 or younger, and he said
the company prefers to think of the new shoes as ``yet another way
we're rooted in alternative culture.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he believes that ``the anti-P.C. thing is very two years
ago,'' adding, ``Social consciousness is set for a comeback as soon
as the stock market tanks.''
</P>
<P>
   The rap impresario and clothing designer Russell Simmons, whose
Phat Farm apparel is among the most sought-after by boys in the
'hood and in the 'burbs, said he is also producing two new ``PETA
friendly'' lines. No Animal Phat Farm, a collection of ``extremely
expensive,'' real-looking fake furs for his women's line, will be
introduced this fall. Skins, a men's line of jackets and suits made
from cottons and vinyls but treated to look like leather, will soon
be shipped to stores. The crown jewel of that collection will be a
vinyl suit with Phat Farm logos. The inspiration, Simmons said, was
``my childhood obsession with Louis.''
</P>
<P>
   Not Armstrong. Vuitton.
</P>
<P>
   But Simmons, whose interest in producing nonanimal product lines
came from his recent conversion to veganism, the strict sort of
vegetarianism (no dairy, no wool clothing, no fish) espoused by
PETA, acknowledges that it will be tough to wean urban youths from
their love of leather. Even his own business plan points up the
essentially quixotic nature of the anti-leather quest. Much of the
Phat Farm line is made of leather and will continue to be. Despite
his own bias, the sales are too robust to pass up ``just yet,'' he
said, adding that he is committed eventually to abandon it.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Simmons' own life, leather is a hard habit to break. ``I
admit I'm wearing leather shoes,'' he said in a phone interview.
``And sometimes at a party I may even go for a shrimp. I'm not
perfect, but I'm striving to be, like we say in yoga. Basically,
life is aspirational. I think you can still be against leather
while you are wearing it.''

BRITISH AUTOWORKERS UNEASY ABOUT ROVER ACQUISITION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONGBRIDGE, England _ Around the same time that Jon Moulton, the
British venture capitalist who has just acquired Rover cars from
BMW of Germany, was laying out his strategy in London on Friday,
Andy McNeil, a worker at the Rover plant here, was pondering how he
would pay the mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   Moulton, 49, appeared before reporters in a button-down shirt
and business suit at an auditorium near the Strand. He told them
job reductions were inevitable as the Rover brand faded, to be
replaced by the MG marque under his new MG Car Co.
</P>
<P>
   McNeil, 37, fretted that he might be one of the losers. With
tattoos on his arms, gold rings in his ear, and hair plaited in a
slender ponytail, McNeil sipped a soda from a can under the chilly
gray skies outside the plant in central England and wondered out
loud what had happened since _ just five weeks ago _ BMW had hosted
an open day in the sprawl of Longbridge and had invited workers,
spouses and children.
</P>
<P>
   ```The future is here,' they said. `Everything's rosy,' they
said. But they've been negotiating this behind our backs for
months,'' McNeil said. ``And all they have been doing is telling us
lies.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there's nothing new about downsizing caused by
deal-making. There's nothing unusual about the shock of cultures
and perceptions between the pin-striped barons of the boardroom and
the oil-stained grunts on the shop floor.
</P>
<P>
   But here, in a region that once was the emblem of the British
auto industry, the abrupt and secretive nature of BMW's exit has
led to a blend of emotions _ shock, betrayal, anger and despondency
_ that reverberates not just among the 9,000 workers here but
beyond to the 50,000 people who depend on the auto industry for
their livelihoods and on to the highest levels of the British
government.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those feelings are directed against BMW. Someone even
spray-painted a BMW dealership here with a single word: ``scum.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It really feels as if they have stolen our heritage,'' said
Nigel Hastilow, the regional director of the Institute of
Directors, a London-based business advocacy group, as the British
government traded accusations with BMW about who really was to
blame.
</P>
<P>
   The disposal of this Rover plant was part of a broader move by
BMW to quit a disastrous six-year effort to turn money-losing Rover
around. Apart from its deal with Moulton's Alchemy Partners venture
capital firm, BMW also sold Rover's profitable Land Rover sport
utility vehicle division at nearby Solihull to Ford Motor Co. for
$2.9 billion, retaining only a new line of Mini to be built at its
Oxford plant.
</P>
<P>
   Joachim Milberg, BMW's chief executive, blamed the strength of
the British pound, which rose in value from 2.2 Deutsche marks to
3.2 during BMW's tenure here, for much of the problem. Rover cars
became more expensive in Europe, while cheaper imports undercut
Rover's home market.
</P>
<P>
   Milberg went further at BMW's Munich headquarters on Friday,
saying Britain's decision to remain outside the European single
currency system did not help. ``The British government complicated
BMW's position with the ongoing debate over the euro,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That drew a furious response from Britain, which accused BMW of
excluding the government from the discussion about Rover's future _
a debate laden with extensive political fallout when thousands of
jobs may be lost in a region where the 9 percent unemployment rate
is almost twice the national average.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Prime Minister Tony Blair said his office had
expressed to BMW ``the prime minister's anger at the way we have
been treated.'' He added, ``The government has been kept in the
dark about BMW's intentions.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Byers, the trade and industry minister, visited this
plant on the outskirts of Birmingham and said he was angry, too.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the Rover workers who expressed the anger of those
who stand to lose the most. Mark Gardner, a 35-year-old
production-line worker at Longbridge, said that after BMW arranged
its upbeat open day last month, he decided to buy a house. He had
been due to sign the contract Friday night, he said, but was now
too uncertain of the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the last five years, we really slogged,'' Gardner said.
``We gave this company everything. We got nothing. But it didn't
matter how hard we worked: We had a future. What kind of a future
do we have now?''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the workers have been toiling harder, the Longbridge
plant, a 94-year-old sprawling patchwork of assembly shops
interspersed with some advanced BMW facilities, has failed to
improve efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   While each worker at Longbridge produces 31 cars per year,
Nissan workers in Britain's northeast each produce 105 cars per
year. Honda scores 64 and Toyota 72, industry figures show.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the cataclysmic changes looming in Longbridge may
not be as great as they might once have been. In the 1970s and
early 1980s, Longbridge's stubborn, strike-prone labor unions kept
staff levels at 25,000. The city is not as dependent on the motor
industry as it once was, partly because of a shift toward service
industries such as conference centers. But it is still a major
employer.
</P>
<P>
   Hastilow at the Institute of Directors estimated that up to
25,000 jobs in the supply business might be lost from the shrinkage
at Longbridge.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Worries about job security have been compounded by the lack of
information about the new owners. ``People know so little about
Alchemy that there's bound to be a great deal of skepticism and
anxiety about what they plan to do,'' Hastilow said.
</P>
<P>
   Moulton sought to offer some faint solace for the survivors,
saying that while some will inevitably lose their jobs, those who
remain ``are about to get a great opportunity'' in a company
focused on producing fewer than 100,000 aluminum-bodied cars,
compared with the 343,000 cars that Longbridge produced in 1997 and
180,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
   People like McNeil and Marsden, though, said they saw
opportunities shrinking. Their pessimism was reinforced by a
colleague who handed them a management directive saying that they
would work shorter hours starting next week. ``It's the beginning
of the end, isn't it?'' McNeil said with a shrug.

   ASBESTOS-AGENCY (Washington) _ Davitt McAteer has spent a lot of
time agonizing about how his agency, the Mine Safety and Health
Administration, should have done more to prevent the slow, painful
deaths of hundreds of miners, processing plant workers and their
families who died of exposure to asbestos. He says he's going to
``make damn sure that it doesn't happen again.''

   AIDS (Seattle) _ Four years ago, a new class of anti-AIDS drugs
brought hope that the deadly disease could become a chronic,
manageable condition such as diabetes. A few even spoke of a cure.
Today, a grim realization is dawning that for many people, the
``miracle'' drugs are only buying time. Precious little time.

<P>
   AIDS-CAMERON (Seattle) _ Timm Cameron is waiting for a miracle.
It wouldn't be his first. Cameron, 38, has AIDS. He's been on every
possible combination of currently available drugs, but they aren't
working for him any more. It isn't the first time for that, either.

   AIDS-MIGLIORE (Burien, Wash.) _ Pat Migliore, 47, is one of the
few survivors of her generation of people with HIV. She has had HIV
since the early 1980s, the advent of the epidemic, and AIDS since
the early 1990s. So far, the ``miracle drugs'' of the 1990s are
working for her.

<P>
   FILM-ERIN (Undated) _ Review of ``Erin Brockovich,'' in which
Julia Roberts is gutter-mouthed, cute-as-a-bug, a great mother,
dresses like a hooker, makes lawyers look like fools, and lights up
the world with her smile. Looks like a winner.

<P>
   By William Arnold. (Story has moved in the ``e'' category.)

   FILM-GHOSTDOG (Undated) _ In ``Ghost Dog: The Way of the
Samurai,'' Forest Whitaker, playing a mysterious ronin-like hit man
named Ghost Dog, embraces the lessons of ``Hagakure, The Book of
the Samurai,'' while communing with the gangster-mentality of the
mob. The film is a cross-cultural walking movie reference and, for
its first half, the fusion of styles works.

   Here are the New York Times News Service Macintosh graphics
scheduled for Saturday, 03/18/2000. They are available to all NYT
graphic clients via satellite on Associated Press GraphicsNet, and
will be posted on PressLink, Newscom and the Wieck PhotoDatabase
web sites. For retransmission of graphics from the AP, call the AP
Service Desk at 212-621-7983.
</P>
<P>
   Non-subscribers may make individual graphics purchases or get
additional information by calling the NYT Photo/Graphics desk at

   ATTENTION GRAPHICS EDITORS -- WEATHER CHANGE ADVISORY:
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times News Service is planning an expanded weather
package, with a planned starting date of Monday, March 20, to be
transmitted Sunday, March 19. The package, consisting of a weather
map as a graphics file and a text file to accompany the map, is
available to graphics clients of the News Service.
</P>
<P>
   The new map grows to 4 columns in width (52 picas), from 3, and
is 6 inches deep; the old was 4 inches deep. This new size permits
the insertion of cloud cover information, previously a separate
map, and the addition of many new cities.
</P>
<P>
   The map is available both in color and in black and white.
Because the map is much more detailed, we have devised an entirely
new palette of colors to make it easier to read the added
information.
</P>
<P>
   A sample of the new map is available at Wieck, Newscom,
Presslink and AP's GraphicsNet.
</P>
<P>
   Some papers using the old map may need extra time to make the
transition to a 4-column format. We will, for a limited time,
produce a 3-col version of the new map, but with only some of the
new map's additional cities.

DISCOVERY: BIAS LEAVES ITS MARK ON EVERYONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   How do we hate? Let us count the ways.
</P>
<P>
   OK, maybe ``hate'' is too strong. But bias, prejudice,
intolerance _ call it what you will _ manage to creep into behavior
no matter how ``neutral'' we think we are. Virtually no one is a
walking, talking Switzerland, it turns out.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery Channel offers startling evidence Monday in ``How
Biased Are You?'' The first in a yearlong ``Hate and Violence: No
Simple Answers'' initiative, the program was produced by ``Dateline
NBC'' and is hosted by Forrest Sawyer. It takes an academic
approach to the question, focusing on psychological experiments
aimed at understanding perceptions of race differences among
children and adults.
</P>
<P>
   In the children's experiment, a subject is asked to interpret
what's happening in several pictures. In one, for instance, a boy
seems to be falling down the stairs while another boy behind him
has his arm outstetched. One interpretation could be that the boy
with the outstretched arm pushed the other boy. Another is that he
is reaching out to stop the boy from falling.
</P>
<P>
   What's interesting and troubling is how often the second
interpretation _ the ``good'' interpretation _ is offered if the
boy with the outstretched arm is depicted as being white, and how
often the first comes up if the same character is portrayed with
dark skin. Although the drawings are otherwise identical, it's also
instructive to see youngsters ascribe certain expressions to the
dark-skinned boy that they don't see in the light-skinned.
</P>
<P>
   Another study, this one targeting adults, asks people to pair
white faces with positive-sounding words and black faces with
negative-sounding words in rapid-fire order. Subjects of either
race have little trouble doing so, but when they're asked to pair
white faces with ``bad'' words and black faces with ``good'' words,
it's a different story altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Even among people who have spent their lives working for human
rights, the incidence of an unconscious preference for whites is
unmistakable.
</P>
<P>
   What this says about us is eye-opening. Ideally, it may be
mind-opening.
</P>
<P>
   How Biased Are You? One-hour program examining everyday
situations in which prejudice and hate manifest themselves, hosted
by Forrest Sawyer. Monday night on the Discovery Channel. Parental
guideline rating: TV-G.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+

 On FOX, `TITUS' LOOKS FOR THE `FUN' IN `DYSFUNCTIONAL'  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Christopher Titus isn't the first to try to find the ``fun'' in
``dysfunctional.'' ``Married ... With Children'' tried it for 10
seasons on Fox, the same network that presents the series premiere
of ``Titus'' Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   While I never warmed to that meanwhile-back-at-the-raunch style
of ``Married ... With Children,'' I've now seen three episodes of
``Titus'' and must admit it just might grow on me. Like a fungus.
(Hey, another ``fun'' word!)
</P>
<P>
   ``Titus'' has fun with the sorts of things you're not supposed
to have fun with on television: mental illness, physical abuse,
alcoholism. It's all based on his own life, Christopher Titus
insists, as if that somehow makes bad taste excusable. Then again,
as he explains in one episode: ``Once you've driven a drunk father
to Mom's parole hearing, what else is there?''
</P>
<P>
   What else, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Titus, a successful stand-up comic and hot-rod enthusiast in
real life, plays the owner of a custom-car shop in his show, which
has an appealing impertinence at the same time that it might make
you go, ``Eew, I can't believe he said that!'' For instance, here's
Titus' father remarking on the fact that his ex-wife _ Titus's
mother _ has been hospitalized for manic-depressive schizophrenia:
``Your mom is shacked up in the wacko basket!''
</P>
<P>
   Stacy Keach, playing the hard-drinking dad who treats matrimony
as a sport in which the one with the most trips down the aisle is
the winner, makes it work with a brutal delivery of black humor.
Credit, too, a smart supporting cast featuring Zack Ward as Titus'
zany stepbrother, Dave; Cynthia Watros as his too-good-to-be-true
girlfriend, Erin, and David Shatraw as his anal-retentive best
friend, Tommy.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many new shows these days, this one knocks down the
fourth wall so Christopher Titus can address the audience directly.
It's fast becoming a threadbare device, but in Titus' standup-savvy
hands it's an amusing way to provide all the back-story details
that can gum up the works if a show is poorly scripted. The idea of
having Titus deliver this personal information in black and white,
from what appears to be an interrogation room illuminated by a
single lightbulb, is also a clever touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Titus'' is a little like Fox's short-lived ``Action'' in its
willingness to go where TV comedies fear to tread. Its style is far
more conventional, with laughter from a studio audience punctuating
the funny lines. (Titus promises the laughter we hear is the real,
``unsweetened'' variety. If a particular episode is weak, he says,
it won't be juiced with a phony laugh track.)
</P>
<P>
   ``When we set the bar,'' Titus told critics recently, ``we
actually said, `Let's go back to ``All in the Family'' and the
great shows on television and try to do something like that as
opposed to smart-ass people yelling at each other.'''
</P>
<P>
   The danger lies down the road, if Titus the creator runs out of
real-life fodder for Titus the character. At that point, ``Titus''
could become a sitcommy caricature of itself. But, in the early
going, Titus is on the money when he says, ``Anything is funny if
the setup is right.''
</P>
<P>
   Titus. Half-hour comedy celebrating a dysfunctional family.
Starring Christopher Titus, Cynthia Watros, Stacy Keach, Zack Ward
and David Shatraw. Series premiere Monday night on Fox. Parental
guideline rating: TV-14.

THAT DOLPHIN GRIN GETS US EVERY TIME _ AND HAS THROUGHOUT HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By M.L. LYKE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The smile is as permanent as The Joker's. And the wild animal
wearing it is not, as romantics might suggest, a mystical, gentle
giant from the lost continent of Atlantis, but rather an extremely
efficient predator.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Tim Cahill was suckered in by the Flipper grin as he swam
alongside a bottlenose dolphin for the first time off the Japanese
island of Mikura.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dolphin moved with me. I could see her round, black eye
and the anatomical smile that meant precisely nothing at all.
Still, one feels obliged to smile back,'' writes the
philosophizing, humorizing adventurer in the new coffee-table book
``Dolphins'' (National Geographic, 216 pages, $35).
</P>
<P>
   His book is a companion to the Imax giant-screen documentary
film of the same name.
</P>
<P>
   That first dolphin encounter left Cahill mulling the
complexities of an animal that humans have revered through history,
yet still barely understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think dolphins are intelligent, social, highly verbal and
seem to take an inordinate pleasure in sex, especially after a fine
meal,'' Cahill said in a recent phone interview. ``In short, they
are very much like us.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is, Cahill notes, a dark side to this happy affinity.
</P>
<P>
   Dolphins can be brutes, tossing live prey into the air and
ramming them with their beaks, like a cats playing with a mouse.
Certain bullying bottlenose will harass and kill smaller harbor
porpoises simply for fun, not food.
</P>
<P>
   Males have been observed killing infants in order to mate with
their mothers or engaging in what Cahill describes as ``gang rape''
of females in estrus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dolphins are not all peace and love,'' says Cahill, ``and they
are not above a fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Those fighting instincts can kick in when humans fail to mind
their manners in the company of dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   Dolphins have bitten, bumped, severely injured and even, in one
case, killed humans who engaged in such social faux pas as touching
or aggressive pursuit of the animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to let the dolphins approach you,'' says
Cahill.
</P>
<P>
   He minded his underwater manners during that first encounter,
swimming belly to belly with the graceful creatures and coming away
from the experience with what he calls a ``dreamy feeling'' and a
lasting ``mush-headed affection.''
</P>
<P>
   The human-dolphin bond is long. Stories of interspecies
friendships wind back to ancient times. Cahill recounts the tale of
a small boy and dolphin told by Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder.
In the story the boy rides the dolphin to school every day across
the Bay of Naples. One day the boy dies. Only a few weeks later the
animal washes up on shore, dead.
</P>
<P>
   Was it heartbroken? Stories of Man's Other Best Friend
inevitably stir up such anthropomorphic emotions. For good reason.
</P>
<P>
   Cahill tells the story of JoJo, a solitary bottlenose dolphin
that hangs near beachside resorts in the Caribbean and is often
injured by personal watercraft and speed boats. JoJo befriended a
professional naturalist named Dean Bernal, who learned to
communicate with the dolphin and treat its injuries.
</P>
<P>
   JoJo had a chance to repay the kindness one day when Bernal was
diving. The naturalist didn't notice a large hammerhead shark
approaching him, but JoJo did. The dolphin quickly moved in front
of Bernal to protect him, then pressed its head against the back of
the shark and drove it 200 feet down to the bottom of the sea.
Bernal grabbed his videocamera and returned to the scene to capture
JoJo repeatedly harassing the dangerous man-eater. His footage is
incorporated into the Imax film.
</P>
<P>
   Cahill _ whose lively writing is familiar to readers of Rolling
Stone, Esquire, Men's Journal and Outside magazine, as well as fans
of his numerous adventure books _ served as co-writer on the
documentary produced by MacGillveray Freeman Films, creators of the
box-office hit ``Everest.''
</P>
<P>
   In book and film, the writer follows the exhilarating and
exasperating work of marine mammal scientists attempting to
document dolphins in the wild and to break their communication code
through analysis of movements and vocalizations.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike traditional researchers who work with captive dolphins
under controlled conditions, young marine biologist Kathleen
Dudzinski and her team must work on animal time. Wild dolphins show
up when they want to. And boat time costs big time.
</P>
<P>
   ``During a five- to six-month season in the Bahamas, Kathleen
got 20 hours of useful videotape,'' says Cahill. ``That's 20 hours
out of about 2,000, or a 1 percent return on the investment of
time.''
</P>
<P>
   In waters off the United States, pursuing wild dolphins for any
purpose can be read as harassment under the 1972 Marine Mammal
Protection Act. So the scientists headed to the Bahamas, Patagonia
and Japan for their documentary work, using specially adapted film
and audio equipment to record the bottle-nose, the Atlantic spotted
dolphin and the elusive dusky dolphin.
</P>
<P>
   Cahill spent four years on the dolphin project, a feather in the
baseball cap for the rumpled Montanan, whose adventures have left
him lying on his back counting stars in the Sahara Desert and, as
he recounts in the most recent edition of Men's Journal, narrowly
escaping a volcanic eruption in Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   He did not, he points out, escape that country's political coup.
</P>
<P>
   Coming up is a dog sled trip into Lapland. But no doubt dolphins
will still be swimming through his imagination as he swooshes
across the snow. ``Once you encounter a dolphin in a personal and
visceral manner, they invade and engage your conscience,'' says
Cahill.
</P>
<P>
   That could be a two-way engagement, he theorizes. Man studies
dolphin. Does dolphin study man?
</P>
<P>
   ``Dolphins are one of the few wild creatures that approach
humans in a friendly and apparently curious manner. The fascination
seems to be mutual,'' says Cahill. ``We think, `What's it like?
What's it like to be intelligent and live in the sea?'
</P>
<P>
   ``And maybe they think, `Hey you, you two-leggeds. What is it
like to be intelligent and live on the land. Can we talk?'''

A WINDOWSILL GARDEN WITH DANISH ALLURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, March 19)  
(lb) 
 By MARTY ROSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   My husband and I left our big American garden behind at the end
of May, when the rosebuds were about to burst, to move to Denmark
on a 15-month assignment.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone lives in apartments in Copenhagen, and I'm finding the
transition from a garden outside to one on table tops and
windowsills a little tricky. The scale and the focus are altogether
different from what I'm used to in the Midwest, but nevertheless,
I'm putting a garden together here.
</P>
<P>
   We found a fine apartment, with tall, bright double windows that
capture, in the windows of apartments across the way, the Danish
indoor gardening style. If I were an old-fashioned Dane, I'd buy
three matching plants, as all my neighbors have done, and place
each of them in an identical cachepot in the exact center of each
living-room window. The arrangement I've ended up with is a little
more fluid and organic.
</P>
<P>
   Most of our apartment's windows face northwest, but we're on the
fourth floor, just under the attic apartment, and the place is full
of soft Scandinavian light.
</P>
<P>
   There's no depth to my garden, because the windowsills are only
6 inches deep, but it is silhouetted against a 19th-century view of
stucco buildings with steep red tile roofs and dormer windows, and
behind them a green copper church spire with a weather vane like a
golden banner against the clouds roaring in from the North Sea. The
garden stretches like a parade from window to window and room to
room.
</P>
<P>
   When we moved in, magpies were nesting in the top of a locust
tree in our little square, and swallows came diving across every
day at dusk, practically touching our windowpanes on their way up
to nests under the tiles.
</P>
<P>
   One Saturday at the flea market, I snapped up a free-standing
planter _ a stylish bit of 1950s Danish design in cherry veneer,
lined with zinc. The local grocery store happened to be offering
flats of boxwood cuttings, and I planted a small hedge in my new
trough.
</P>
<P>
   Opposite the boxwood, on the coffee table, I placed a fine
prayer plant (Ctenanthe burle-marxii) that I bought at a flower
stall at the vegetable market. Our apartment is painted white
throughout, and the prayer plant's striking stripes had quite an
impact. After poking around in the plant shops, which seem to be
everywhere here, I found an excellent companion, an Alocasia
amazonica, known locally as giraffe plant.
</P>
<P>
   Chalk-white veins divide the Alocasia's leathery, deep green
leaves into large rectangles. From the back, the leaves look like
big purple hearts, which complement the wine-colored undersides of
the prayer plant's foliage. I'm more for balance than symmetry, and
the combination looks to me like a stroke of genius.
</P>
<P>
   The Alocasia came with a spider. She was no bigger than a sesame
seed, but she spun a delicate web among its slender stems and
seemed to feel right at home. It's not very buggy in Copenhagen,
even in the summer, so we snag fruit flies for her in the kitchen
and toss them into her web. She spins a nice bold stripe in her web
from time to time, but we do not know what she means by this.
</P>
<P>
   Healthy indoor plants don't really need much attention, it turns
out, but I make the rounds every day, just as I like to do in my
garden at home. I poke down into the soil, just to get my fingers
dirty, and sometimes tip the plants out of their pots, to admire
the roots.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't get to plant seeds at home last spring, but I bought
some seeds at the botanic garden here and tacked the packages to my
bulletin board. When summer turned to fall, I missed the familiar
heft of daffodil bulbs, but my pockets rattled with chestnuts,
acorns and bits of lichen on twigs that I picked up under the
magnificent trees in the King's Garden, a wonderful park two blocks
from our apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Pots of spring-flowering bulbs of every description started
popping up at the flower stalls in November. During the holidays,
paperwhites reached halfway up our windows. We buy plastic pots
stuffed with small bulbs, three pots for $5, and have had the
pleasure of sitting at the windows with pale grape hyacinths on
long, graceful green stems, dangling snowdrops, little checkered
fritillarias and bright yellow winter aconites at our shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   In the dining room, where I have my desk, the windowsills are
particularly full at the moment, although I have to leave a window
by my desk unobstructed because the queen's guard marches past at
11:37 every morning in bearskin hats, and I like to lean out and
listen to the band, which is exceedingly sharp.
</P>
<P>
   There is a fancy little myrtle in the corner window, clipped
like a poodle's tail, and a small Christmas poinsettia, still
brilliant in the soft gray light. I have a weakness for woody
plants, so I bought two dark hollies in tiny pots. I scattered
small alder cones from the botanic garden around them on the
windowsill, and it looks very woodsy.
</P>
<P>
   I established my shade garden in the guest room, which has the
largest windowsills but the least light. Here I grow a strange fern
with nearly blue fronds shaped like big, fat T's, possibly
Quercifilix zeylanica, and a terra-cotta tray of moss, which the
Danes like to use in their Christmas arrangements. I started
refreshing it with water as the holidays wore on, and it responded
so well that I've kept it.
</P>
<P>
   I've finally taken the plunge for a couple of orchids, which
I've always been too much in awe of to try to grow. A white
Phalaenopsis, which didn't seem happy in a cool window, has found
its place on my desk, where the snow-white flowers have opened one
by one above my lamp like fantastic moons. I'm determined to move
it back to a windowsill when the weather warms up, but it's almost
time to start seeds, and I'm going to need the space. We'll be here
until August, and I have it in mind to try some tomatoes.

BAKER'S RETURN SPARKS SONICS TO SEASON SWEEP OF GRIZZLIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Vancouver Grizzlies have probably seen enough of
the Sonics for one week.
</P>
<P>
   Vin Baker, on the other hand, apparently had seen enough of his
closet and the Sonics' training room. Baker stepped out of street
clothes Thursday and back into the lineup after missing two games
with a strained left hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics then yanked the welcome mat in KeyArena and bounced
the Grizzlies, 117-103, in the teams' second meeting in four days.
The victory was the Sonics' fourth against Vancouver, completing a
season sweep that included a 113-103 victory Monday at General
Motors Place.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the Sonics spared no offense _ and not much defense,
for that matter _ in sending Vancouver to its 10th straight loss.
The Grizzlies, who shot 54 percent, made an occasional threat but
the Sonics remained in command from the time both teams peeled away
warmup gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those professional wins,'' Sonics coach Paul
Westphal said. ``It was a game you had to take care of, and we
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Westphal's crew maintained its sixth-place standing in the
Western Conference playoff picture. The Sonics are behind three
games in the loss column to idle Phoenix (40-23) for the fifth seed
and are still within striking distance of fourth seed San Antonio
(42-23).
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics are ready for a Pacific Division showdown Saturday as
the Portland Trail Blazers visit KeyArena.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary (Payton) and I were talking in the showers,'' Sonics
guard Vernon Maxwell said. ``We have to make a statement in that
game. We haven't beaten those guys all year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics' record against winning teams is 16-19, but they
usually flex a little muscle against subpar opponents. Thursday
night, the Sonics improved to 23-7 against losing teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're supposed to beat those guys, but we knew it was going to
be a tougher game,'' center Horace Grant said. ``We can't take
these teams under .500 for granted. We lost to Atlanta here (on
Feb. 25). We learned our lesson.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics led by double digits most of the second half, but the
Grizzlies twice got to within seven. Each time the Sonics answered
Vancouver's run with a quick score. A Brent Barry 3-pointer put the
Sonics ahead 108-98 with 1:26 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't remember the last time we guarded anybody,'' Vancouver
coach Lionel Hollins said. ``We're just not guarding. I don't know
if we can get back to guarding people before the season ends, but
we have a few days to work on it.
</P>
<P>
   Barry finished with 21 points, and Payton led the Sonics with 30
points and 16 assists. Baker's game obviously wasn't hurt by the
time off. Despite picking up his fifth foul with 5:14 to play in
the third, Baker had 21 points and seven rebounds in 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have a lot of discomfort,'' Baker said. ``The time
off helped my knees a lot. It gave my legs a chance to rest so it
was like starting over again. ... I was really overzealous. It was
a nice rhythm.''
</P>
<P>
   As rhythm goes, the Sonics began the game much like their
meeting earlier this week. Payton fueled a dominant first quarter
by hitting seven of his first 10 shots. The Sonics' offense simply
ran through the Grizzlies' defense with Payton and his teammates
driving hard to the basket.
</P>
<P>
   With Payton resting on the bench, the Sonics' offense bogged
down at the start of the second quarter. The Grizzlies took
advantage of lagging defense as well and scored eight consecutive
points to pull within 40-34.
</P>
<P>
   A Greg Foster jumper then started a quick 7-3 run that put the
Sonics back in front 47-37. Payton later made two free throws that
gave the Sonics a 64-54 advantage just before the end of the
second.
</P>
<P>
   Payton tallied 23 points by halftime and the Sonics led 64-57 at
that point.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics jumped out to a 40-26 lead in the first, the most
points Seattle had scored in a quarter all season. The 40 also tied
a Vancouver record for the most points allowed in one period.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle shot 73 percent in the opening frame and 54 percent for
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They put the ball in the basket but we were able to find more
ways to get the ball in the basket,'' Westphal said. ``We did what
we had to do.''

PARENTS IGNORING V-CHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every day, television salesman Howard Raphel is peppered with
questions from customers about visual clarity, sound quality, or
features like picture-in-picture.
</P>
<P>
   But the one thing no customer asks about is the V-chip.
</P>
<P>
   Of the thousands of customers Raphel has dealt with in the nine
months since TV sets containing the V-chip became available, not a
single one has raised the issue with him. ``Most of them don't even
know what it means,'' said Raphel, who works for a suburban Boston
appliance store.
</P>
<P>
   What it means, at least in theory, is that parents now have a
technological tool to block violent or racy TV programs they don't
want their children to see. But in practice, to judge by interviews
with parents and retailers, the ``V'' in the much-ballyhooed V-chip
could stand for the gaping void in public awareness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never heard of it,'' said 47-year-old Debbie Nelson as
she shopped with her 13-year-old daughter in the electronics
department of Sears in Natick, Mass. Ten yards away, 44-year-old
Bill DiCarlo echoed that refrain, while salesman Jeff Dennis
remarked that only one person has asked him about the V-chip.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one cares about it,'' said Anne Marie Bouchet, spokeswoman
for the Tweeter Home Entertainment Group, which owns 15 stores in
Massachusetts. ``No one's asking for it. No one's basing their
purchase of a TV on the V-chip.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't supposed to be this way.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, when President Clinton signed into law a bill
authorizing the V-chip, it was envisioned by its champions _
prominently including US Representative Edward Markey (D-Mass.) _
as a way for parents to defend their children against a TV industry
seemingly intent on swamping them with violence, sex, and
profanity.
</P>
<P>
   But now that TV sets containing V-chips are flooding into the
stores _ adding up to $50 to the overall price tag _ those same
parents appear to be oblivious to its existence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main problem is there's no awareness of this,'' said
Federal Communications Commissioner Gloria Tristani, who chairs the
FCC's task force on the V-chip. ``I'm getting a little impatient,
hoping there can be a good public education campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   As of last July, the FCC required all manufacturers to include a
V-chip in half of all TVs with screens larger than 13 inches. Since
Jan. 1, a V-chip has been mandatory in all TVs over that size.
</P>
<P>
   Its use, however, is entirely optional. TV owners can block
objectionable shows by following a series of written and on-screen
instructions culminating in a menu of the ratings (such as TVMA for
Mature Audiences Only, or TV-PG for Parental Guidance Suggested)
that the networks agreed to put on their programs under pressure
from Congress. Once at the menu, viewers can activate the V-chip
and screen out any programs rated at a level they consider
inappropriate for their children.
</P>
<P>
   Though national TV sales are up 7 percent this year, retailers
don't pinpoint the V-chip as the reason, according to Lisa Fasold
of the Virginia-based Consumer Electronics Association. She says
the V-chip hasn't caused ``that much of a difference in the selling
of TV sets.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, even as it struggles for acceptance, the V-chip
already faces competition from other technologies. Cable companies
like MediaOne and Cablevision, as well as satellite TV companies,
now offer customers set-top boxes that enable parents to block out
certain channels _ but not individual programs _ as part of their
cable package.
</P>
<P>
   ``The V-chip is almost redundant,'' said Bruce Leichtman,
director of media and entertainment strategy at the Yankee Group, a
Boston consulting and market-research firm. ``It's a little
ludicrous. This is what happens when government gets involved and
it shouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The apparent public indifference to the V-chip is gratifying to
those who always opposed it as a form of governmental coercion.
``It at least has demonstrated that this is not going to be the
end-all and be-all that the government thought it would be,'' said
Marv Johnson, legislative counsel of the American Civil Liberties
Union.
</P>
<P>
   But Markey, who was principal congressional sponsor of the
V-chip legislation and popularized its name (``V'' standing for
violence), says the device was never intended to be more than ``an
option for families with small children.'' He argued that ``by
establishing the V-chip as a principle, we created a competition''
to create technologies that parents could use to block
objectionable programs, such as the set-top boxes the cable and
satellite industries devised.
</P>
<P>
   As for the V-chip itself, Markey argued that it will eventually
be embraced by ``a new generation of younger parents, more
technologically savvy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As television continues to lower its standards, I think that
we can expect more and more parents of this next generation of
children to take advantage of the technology,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, however, proponents of the V-chip are
disheartened, puzzled, and angry at the tepid reception for a
technology they believed parents would eagerly embrace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe how little publicity it's getting, given how
revolutionary it is,'' said Joanne Cantor, a communications
professor at the University of Wisconsin and author of ``Mommy, I'm
Scared: How TV and Movies Frighten Children and What We Can Do to
Protect Them.'' She contends that the V-chip ``could languish''
because the TV industry is ``keeping parents in the dark about
this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not to their advantage if a lot of people use the
V-chip,'' she said. ``Because the more people who use the V-chip
effectively, the fewer eyeballs will be delivered to advertisers.''
</P>
<P>
   Tristani of the FCC faulted manufacturers, retailers, and some
newspapers for not making more viewers aware of the V-chip, and
said the networks have been erratic in airing public service
announcements about the V-chip. ``Some months they run a lot, some
months they haven't run any,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kathryn Montgomery, president of the Washington-based Center for
Media Education, agreed, saying the networks ``haven't really
promoted it effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the networks don't see it that way. At ABC, spokeswoman
Julie Hoover notes that the networks encode their programs with the
ratings that are vital to the V-chip, and insisted: ``The PSAs have
gotten exposure.''
</P>
<P>
   At CBS, senior vice president Martin Franks said PSAs regarding
the V-chip have run during such popular prime-time programs as
``Touched by an Angel'' and ``Diagnosis Murder.'' Franks said ``the
V-chip is as heavy in our current (PSA) rotation as about any other
cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the finger-pointing, there are signs that many consumers
still like the concept of the V-chip. Robyn Williams, the mother of
a 2-year-old daughter, said she favors the V-chip because ``there's
so much violence on TV that I don't think (children) should be
subjected to.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-year-old Evon, who declined to give her last name, said
she had not heard of the V-chip but can see its usefulness, noting
that her 7-year-old niece ``knows too many things, and I know it's
from TV.'' A mother of three shopping in the Chestnut Hill Mall
near Boston, who declined to give her name, said she likes the idea
of the V-chip because ``there are a lot of times we're out and
can't monitor all that they're watching.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem for V-chip proponents is that though the public has
overwhelmingly supported the idea of the device in polls, their
words haven't yet been borne out by their actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes what the audience says they want doesn't necessarily
correspond with their behavior,'' said Meryl Marshall, president of
the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. ``They'll tell you
they don't want violence, and then they'll watch the World
Wrestling Federation or Jerry Springer.''
</P>
<P>
   Tristani said that due to high-profile episodes of real-life
violence ``a very legitimate parental concern'' remains about TV
violence. She is convinced the V-chip will eventually catch on.
``I'm going to keep up my optimism,'' she said. ``This is still the
beginning.''

MINE SAFETY CHIEF VOWS ACTION OVER ASBESTOS DISCLOSURES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW SCHNEIDER  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Davitt McAteer agonizes over how the federal
government's mine-safety agency failed to prevent hundreds of slow,
painful asbestos-related deaths.
</P>
<P>
   McAteer is not an outside critic. He is the boss of the Mine
Safety and Health Administration, and he backs up his anguish with
a vow: ``I will make damn sure that it doesn't happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   He has launched an aggressive examination of all the mines
across the nation that may be contaminated with asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   An investigation by the Seattle Post-Intelligencer into the
lethal legacy of a vermiculite mine owned by W.R. Grace &AMP; Co. in
Libby, Mont., moved McAteer to search his agency's archives.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper documented that almost 200 miners and members of
their families had died from diseases caused by exposure to
tremolite asbestos fibers, and hundreds more got fatal diseases _
asbestosis, lung cancer and mesothelioma _ from the mine's
asbestos-tainted ore.
</P>
<P>
   The P-I also reported that for decades, government agencies knew
the workers and their families were at risk, but did nothing to
stop it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a hard time believing what I was reading,'' McAteer
says. ``So I had all the reports pulled on Libby and found out it
was true. What I found bothered me a great deal. We could have done
more. We should have done more and we didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   His agency, a branch of the Department of Labor, ``failed to
detect, failed to alert, and failed to remedy the situation,'' he
says. ``We can't bring those people back, but we can make changes
in how we operate so we don't have any revelation of preventable
deaths 20 years from now. I want to ensure that this is not still
happening today in any of the mines we're responsible for.''
</P>
<P>
   A remarkable admission
</P>
<P>
   It's extraordinary when a boss of a federal agency admits that
lives could have been saved if the government had done a better
job. There's a lot that's extraordinary about McAteer.
</P>
<P>
   He came into government from the coal fields of West Virginia,
after founding and directing the Occupational Safety and Health Law
Center and working as the Solicitor for Safety for the United Mine
Workers. Before taking over as its chief, he was one of MSHA's
fiercest critics.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders and newspapers in mining country cheered President
Clinton's appointment of McAteer in 1994 as mine-safety boss, but
the industry cringed, lamenting that putting the safety zealot in
charge of keeping miners safe would be like naming Ralph Nader to
head the Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   McAteer, who eagerly accepts responsibility for the well-being
of the nation's 365,000 miners, admits that it's a challenge to
determine how big a health hazard workers face in asbestos-tainted
mines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a hard sell with miners where the asbestos is
a contaminant to their ore,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   For years, many mine operators have told their workers that the
problem existed only at the now-closed Libby mine, that there is no
asbestos in the ore they're mining. But government and
mining-company documents _ some going back 30 years _ indicate that
this may not be true.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until the real story of Libby was made public last fall, no
one understood how widespread the potential risks may be,'' McAteer
says. ``It's a difficult message to pass to miners who think
they're healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got get them to understand that just like silica and
coal dust, if asbestos is contaminating the dust that they're
breathing today, it may shorten their lives, may kill them before
they reach the age when they can play with their grandchildren,''
McAteer says.
</P>
<P>
   A career forged by tragedy
</P>
<P>
   A rumbling explosion at Consolidated Coal Company's Number 9
mine, eight miles from his home in Farmington, W. Va., in 1968
shoved McAteer into the world of mine safety.
</P>
<P>
   McAteer, then a law student at West Virginia University, stood a
somber vigil for days with the rest of the small town, watching the
rescue effort, hoping that boys he went to school with, their
fathers and grandfathers would somehow survive. Twenty-one miners
escaped, but 78 were entombed in the deep shafts as the mine was
sealed to halt continuing explosions.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, McAteer hunted down Ralph Nader, whose
reputation as a consumer advocate was spreading, and offered to run
a team of other law students to investigate mine safety in the
state. When McAteer's report was published five years later, West
Virginia passed laws that changed the way mines were regulated.
</P>
<P>
   Now, McAteer is wasting no time getting the asbestos message out
to the mining industry.
</P>
<P>
   Last week,the agency sent out a five-page bulletin to all mine
operators, miners' unions and associations in the country. It
discussed what happened at Libby, explained the hazards of asbestos
and explained how mine operators can protect workers from the
lethal fiber.
</P>
<P>
   Individual pocket safety cards are being printed now to be
distributed to every miner in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Education is vital in a situation like this, but so is
identifying precisely what the hazards are,'' McAteer says.
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors dispatched to mines
</P>
<P>
   MSHA has ordered special inspections of all mines where asbestos
may be present in the ore. Testing is being done at vermiculite
mines in Enoree, S.C., Woodruff, S.C., Louisa, Va., and Dillon,
Mont.; at the nation's only two operating asbestos mines near King
City, Calif.; at rock quarries in Sparta, N.J., North Branford,
Conn., and near San Jose, Calif.; at talc mines in Ludlow, Vt., and
Governeur, N.Y.; and at taconite mines in Hoyt Lakes and Silver
Bay, Minn., and two sites in northern Michigan. Several other
operations are on the list to be inspected.
</P>
<P>
   At each mine, the inspectors attached small, portable air pumps
to the workers while they did their normal jobs. Samples of the air
they were working in was drawn through fine filters. The filters
from the vacuum pumps were examined under a microscope at OHSA's
laboratory in Salt Lake City and the fibers of asbestos were
counted.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the initial testing showed levels below MSHA's
permissible exposure limit.
</P>
<P>
   That's not a clean bill of health, as some of the mine operators
boast, McAteer says.
</P>
<P>
   ``These say that the air testing came back below our limit,''
the safety boss says, waving a stack of test results. ``But MSHA's
limit is 20 times higher than OSHA's limit. There could be 20 times
more asbestos fibers in the sample than OSHA's limit and it could
be legal under our regulations. How can we say that's safe?''
</P>
<P>
   A try for safer limits
</P>
<P>
   The exposure standard that MSHA is working under was promulgated
27 years ago. Twelve years later, in 1989, the agency tried to
bring the asbestos exposure limits down to OSHA's safer standards.
</P>
<P>
   As it does every time the government proposes to reduce exposure
to any asbestos fiber, the industry flooded MSHA with opposition to
the agency's proposal. W.R. Grace said there was no need to lower
the permissible exposure limits for vermiculite mines, because it
claimed there was no asbestos in its South Carolina mines.
</P>
<P>
   The Asbestos Information Association, an industry-funded
lobbying group, cited medical studies which they claimed showed the
risk of asbestos exposure from the mines was minimal. But almost
all the studies the association cited were done by physicians and
researchers working on industry-funded projects.
</P>
<P>
   `Our asbestos isn't bad'
</P>
<P>
   ``The efforts to prevent the new standard were pretty much made
by the same people making the same statements they made in
defending Libby,'' McAteer says. ``They said `Our asbestos isn't
bad asbestos.' And, `these fibers are too short or the wrong shape
to be harmful' and `our mining process doesn't result in the kind
of asbestos problems exposure that would cause the disease.'''
</P>
<P>
   Agency files don't show why the effort was dropped in 1989. Now,
MSHA is again developing a proposal for a health standard for
asbestos that would lower the permissible exposure to OHSA's level.
There is little doubt that the opposition will quickly muster
against it once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure we'll being hearing from the industry as soon as the
word gets out,'' says Dr. Carol Jones, director of MSHA's Office of
Standards, who helped OSHA implement its exposure level.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that the miners will be safer if we can
reduce the exposure,'' Jones says. ``When you have a carcinogen
like asbestos, you want to have no exposure at all.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Jones, McAteer and other government experts who fight
to reduce the exposure level do a delicate balancing act _ lower
the standard as far as possible, but keep it high enough so the
mines can still operate.
</P>
<P>
   OSHA's .1 fiber per cubic centimeter of air still permits
exposure that is estimated to cause three or four cases of cancer
for each 1,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to go to a level which won't close the mines,'' she
says. ``So that's the reason that .1 fiber still has significant
risk, because we couldn't go any lower, because we couldn't drive
everyone out of business.''
</P>
<P>
   New samples sought
</P>
<P>
   OSHA's level of ``.1'' sounds like a minute amount, but Jones
says that's not the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's 100,000 fibers per cubic meter. We breathe 10 cubic
meters of air in a work day if we're working hard, so that's a
million fibers. And with asbestos, research shows that, in some
cases, just one fiber could get into one cell and cause it to
become a tumor cell. It multiplies and you've got cancer,'' Jones
explains.
</P>
<P>
   McAteer says that last week his inspection teams went back to
the mines to take more air samples as well as samples of ore.
</P>
<P>
   The South Carolina and Virginia vermiculite mines are owned by
Grace and Robert Sansom, a former associate EPA administrator.
Neither take kindly to government prodding too hard into their
operations.
</P>
<P>
   But McAteer says he doesn't expect any problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have authority to take samples when and where we believe
dangerous exposures might exist and that is precisely what our
inspectors will do,'' the administrator says.
</P>
<P>
   `That's why he got the job'
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the first time that McAteer stood up to powerful
interests.
</P>
<P>
   The 56-year-old father of five hadn't had time to hang his
mementos of the walls of his new office in 1994 before Republicans
in Congress began clamoring for MSHA to be gutted, its staff cut by
60 percent, if not completely dismantled. But McAteer hung in, and,
in fact, strengthened the agency's watchdog actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why he got the job,'' says former Labor Secretary
Robert Reich, who brought McAteer into the agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Davitt comes from a mining family and he cares deeply and
passionately about what happens in those mines,'' Reich says. ``He
knows more about mining, the technology and the dangers than almost
anyone I've ever encountered.
</P>
<P>
   Reich, who was never shy about expressing his views when he was
labor secretary, cheers McAteer's candor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says what he believes. It's not easy in Washington to tell
it like it is, but if you are telling the truth, giving an accurate
portrayal of reality and you have technical competence on your
side, then you're unassailable. That's the way he operates and he
thrives on challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   McAteer has made the health of miners a prime focus for his
agency, something, he says, that's no easy task.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had an epidemic of safety problems the magnitude of
Libby, with hundreds of miners dying, we'd take some action and do
so immediately,'' McAteer says. ``But with health problems, it
doesn't happen right away and it gets pushed back and pushed back
and pushed back until something forces it to the front again.
Meanwhile, lives that could have been saved have been lost. We
can't let this happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Safety problems, he says, can typically be corrected with a
mechanical fix.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a conveyor belt with a guard missing, you can put the
guard back on. A broken piece of equipment causes an accident, you
can repair it, but solving health problems is nowhere as simple,''
McAteer says. ``In health problems there's a latency period where
you don't see the impact for 15 years, typically. So it's a lot
harder to get people involved, be they the miners, be they the mine
operators, be they my own agency people.''
</P>
<P>
   `A public health matter'
</P>
<P>
   He's also not shy about asking other federal agencies to get
involved in solving problems, which is what he's proposing to do
with ore tainted with asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   ``A product like asbestos has potential for injury to workers at
a mine location, to workers at milling processors, and in other
manufacturing plants. This problem is a public health matter that
needs to be seriously addressed beyond the limits of our
authority,'' McAteer says, and adds, that a team effort is needed
to see how much of a problem the asbestos in the different ore may
be causing.
</P>
<P>
   ``MSHA will take the mines, OSHA will take the milling
operations and processing plants and the EPA the production plants
that use the ore,'' he says, drawing a triangle and pointing to the
corners.
</P>
<P>
   While McAteer plans for the future, he still worries about what
happened at Libby. His examination of the old reports showed that
the field inspectors did their job.
</P>
<P>
   ``The information about the dangers the workers faced at Libby
was passed on to Grace officials,'' he says. ``It should have been
passed up the chain to the head of this agency and it was not.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What worries me is that I can't tell you that that failure to
get the word to those of us who can make things happen isn't
happening today.''
</P>
<P>
   McAteer has done what he can to make sure that's not the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've spoken to all of our management and met with all of our
people up and down the line to say, `If you see a problem, you'd
better tell us.'
</P>
<P>
   `` We owe it to the miner.''

RAGGED ZAGS REKINDLE THEIR TOURNEY FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. _ For awhile, it looked as if Gonzaga had returned
to the NCAA tournament just to do some dirty dancing.
</P>
<P>
   Goodness knows, it was not all pretty.
</P>
<P>
   With senior swingman Mike Nilson on the bench with a ruptured
Achilles tendon and their rotation on a leash short enough to choke
the breath out of them, the Bulldogs were piling up turnovers
faster than a crew of Pillsbury Dough Boys. They were in danger of
imploding.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crowd wasn't safe,'' senior guard Matt Santangelo said.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the first half, Louisville ran up a seven-point
lead, and somehow it seemed like all the karma and all the magic
and all the deja vu all over again just wasn't going to happen this
time for the Bulldogs.
</P>
<P>
   But then what would we know?
</P>
<P>
   These are the Zags, right?
</P>
<P>
   Ornery, determined, hard-nosed with a winner's mentality. Did
someone dare suggest the Zags were almost down and out in Round 1
of this year's NCAA tourney because of a little first-half hiccup?
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, it was only seven points, and the reason we were down was
because we were doing some things that are very uncharacteristic
for us,'' Santangelo said afterward, with a grin, but not all that
sweet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been down in games before. We knew once we settled down,
we'd be all right. Seven points is not anything to start calling
home about.''
</P>
<P>
   No, that would have been very premature.
</P>
<P>
   And as much as the Zags like the serenity and security of their
Bing Crosby-John Stockton-neat-little-city-by-the-river out there
in Washington's Inland Empire, they just didn't figure it was time
to head back. Yet.
</P>
<P>
   We could get used to this, couldn't we?
</P>
<P>
   Or, rather: We have gotten used to all this Gonzaga stuff. It's
not really March Madness anymore as much as it's Zag Madness.
</P>
<P>
   And here they go, here we go again.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, riding the same No. 10 seed they used as a
jet-propulsion magic carpet one year ago, the Zags refused to let a
mess of 24 turnovers shoot down their latest mission.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the second half, the Zags turned up the heat on
No. 7-seed Louisville, riding senior shooting guard Richie Frahm's
31-point blastoff and nifty defense to, yes, another ``upset''
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 49-48, Louisville's Quintin Bailey was off on a
breakaway only to find his dunk attempt stuffed from behind from
Frahm. The momentum shift was enormous as Frahm broke back down
court, taking a pass on the right baseline from Santangelo and
burying a 3-point grenade.
</P>
<P>
   In the stands at the McKale Center, the legions of Gonzaga fans
erupted in glee.
</P>
<P>
   The Zags' lead was 52-48 and they were not done salting this one
away.
</P>
<P>
   Back down under the Louisville basket, it looked as if
Louisville coach Denny Crum had reason to be miffed when the Zags
roughed up one of his shooters. But without a call against Gonzaga,
Crum and his bench were instead whistled for a technical when the
refs called a foul on Reece Gaines on the Zags' next possession.
</P>
<P>
   Frahm hit one of the two free throws, and the Zags never looked
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was just huge. It was more than just a five-point
turnaround,'' Santangelo said. ``That was a huge shift in momentum.
It got the crowd back into it. It got Richie playing with a lot of
emotion and with high energy, and it lifted the team up.
</P>
<P>
   ``When one of your players goes out and makes a play that's pure
effort, that wasn't about skill. That just pure heart that got that
done, and it let us open up a little bit of a lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, that would explain the circus alley-oop jam Casey
Calvary threw down from a pin-point pass from Frahm to push the
Zag's lead to 58-52. And it would explain Calvary's ensuing blocked
shot _ the one that sent a Louisville jumpshot attempt into orbit
north towards Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the second half was rolling to a close, Louisville
had folded up its cards, crumbling under a 37-percent shooting
performance while the Zags, led by Frahm, hit for 57 percent.
</P>
<P>
   By the end, the turnovers were a mere footnote to the way Frahm
shot the Zags out of trouble and the way the entire team buckled
down to get the job done.
</P>
<P>
   But what else would you expect from these guys?
</P>
<P>
   ``This group is made up of a lot of winners,'' coach Mark Few
said.
</P>
<P>
   Which means the Zags are not done.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is actually nice to get that one win out of the way,''
Santangelo said. ``There's a little bit of weight off our
shoulders, but we didn't come here to play and get one win and go
home. We came to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kind of have a chip on our shoulder. We're still fighting
for a little bit of respect, I feel.''
</P>
<P>
   We know how it is with these guys. We've all been here before,
as in exactly one year ago. That's when the 10th-seeded Zags
knocked off seventh-seeded Minnesota at KeyArena and then rolled
through No. 2 Stanford and Florida in the Sweet 16 before falling
to UConn in the Elite Eight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of comforting to be the 10 seed playing the 7
seed, truthfully,'' Santangelo said. ``I just felt very comfortable
with it, like we had been in this position before.''
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the motivation against Stanford a year ago was immense.
The West Coast Conference champs wanted to prove something. The
Zags know the Cardinal like the back of their hands.
</P>
<P>
   But what the heck. If this year's No. 2 seed waiting for the
Zags is St. John's, the Zags say bring them on. They've been down
this yellow brick road before.

FEATURES TO CONSIDER WHEN TRUCK SHOPPING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Clarifies that not all all-wheel-drive models offer low range. l
and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why should you buy a truck-like vehicle? Conveniences,
flexibility, and safety are three good reasons. Trucks, according
to manufacturers, fall into three categories: pickups, sport
utilities, and minivans.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the things you should be considering when
shopping:
</P>
<P>
   Premium or regular: With gasoline prices nearing $1.80 a gallon
for premium fuels, check out the octane needs of the vehicle you
are looking at. Many SUVs require premium fuel. There are plenty
good SUV models which take just plain old regular octane gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Size: Your personal preferences will determine what size vehicle
you need. Are the truck's features only going to be used
occasionally? What will you be hauling: Lots of kids, cargo, or
some other combination? A pickup with a larger cab and an open
cargo bed could be used for family activities as well as hauling
yard trash or camping gear. A minivan might also serve your
purposes just as well. Consumer Reports found it could pack more
goods in the back of a minivan than a Jeep Grand Cherokee. The
Subaru Forester is a great choice for people who aren't looking for
a huge mass of vehicle, but one that offers all the plusses of an
SUV without being a gas-guzzler.
</P>
<P>
   Interior space: Newer pickup truck models which have rear
seating are now the rage. But not all these vehicles are created
equally when it comes to space. Even some supercab styles may offer
cramped seating for rear-seat passengers. Sport utilities come in
every size imaginable. If you really want space, consider the new
Chevrolet Suburban Tahoe or GMC Yukon. These are real people
carriers, and with rear seats removed, you can place sheets of
plywood on the floor inside. If you really need lots of room, look
to the Ford Excursion, with room for nine passengers plus cargo.
But size can be deceiving. Automobile magazine notes the Excursion
is only slightly bigger inside than the Suburban, and, because of
its size, cannot carry as much payload.
</P>
<P>
   Doors: The four-door pickup is here. But watch those doors. Some
are full-sized _ just like on cars _ and even open like car doors;
others are smaller and may only have door latches on the inside.
Consumers should also note how wide the doors open. The Dodge Quad
has rear doors that open to 90 degrees, making it easier to put
cargo as well as passengers in the back. The upcoming Chevrolet
Avalanche is designed to include a fifth door that opens onto the
bed, allowing extra-long items to be placed on an otherwise short
bed.
</P>
<P>
   Many minivans now have two side sliding doors which are
electrically controlled. The Chrysler Town &AMP; Country will soon
sport not only two electrically controlled side doors but also an
electrically controlled rear door.
</P>
<P>
   On SUVs, the Chevrolet Suburban and GMC Yukon are the only
models with a choice of rear doors. Buyers can choose between a
lift gate or a side-hinged rear cargo door.
</P>
<P>
   What drive? Two-wheel, four-wheel, all-wheel, part-time or
full-time: These are the choices. Just about every pickup truck and
SUV is available with a standard two-wheel-drive, similar to cars.
</P>
<P>
   Permanent four-wheel-drive vehicles have no two-wheel drive
option; these systems are effective in snow and mud and have a
differential that shifts power to wheels needing it. A low-range
drive is usually also found on these vehicles for off-road
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   All-wheel-drive handles all road conditions automatically. Power
is shifted between wheels as needed. Not all model models offer
low-range.
</P>
<P>
   Part-time four-wheel-drive operate on the road in
two-wheel-drive. If conditions call for four-wheel-drive, the
driver must select that mode with a lever or switch. Vehicles with
part-time 4WD do allow for ``shift on the fly'' to engage the
system. However, on these vehicles, the four-wheel-drive mode is
not suitable for use on dry pavement.
</P>
<P>
   Warranties: Check out what is covered on your vehicle and for
how long. Isuzu has expanded its powertrain warranty to 10 years,
120,000 miles on its Amigo, Rodeo, Trooper and VehiCross to cover
engine, transmission, steering assembly, suspension and axles.
Adjustment and maintenance items are not covered. The warranty is
only transferable to members of the original owner's family,
otherwise it reverts to a three-year, 50,000-mile warranty.
</P>
<P>
   Suspension: Isuzu's Rodeo and Amigo now have smart suspensions,
a new semiactive suspension system previously used only on luxury
cars and the Lexus LX470. The system increases comfort and reduces
oscillations in body roll. It is standard on models with Ironman
package and the top trim level of the Rodeo. It is not available on
the Trooper.
</P>
<P>
   On SUVs based on a car platform, the ride is much smoother than
on a vehicle with a truck platform. ABS: Antilock brakes prevent
lockups and provide straighter, quicker braking.
</P>
<P>
   Construction: Trucks originally were built on a solid frame,
cars on a unibody frame. The new Mitsubishi Montero has switched
from a frame construction to a unibody one for a more car-like
ride. In 1996, 31 of the 32 SUVs on the road had a truck platform;
by 2006, it is predicted that there will be 70 SUV nameplates, with
37 having truck-based platforms and 33 having car bases.
</P>
<P>
   Cargo bed: Once there were but two choices for pickups _ short
(6 feet) or long bed (8 feet). Then manufacturers built compact
pickups with narrow beds. Now come the blended pickup/SUV with even
shorter beds. &QL; 
 &QL; 
(Notes: Minivans are almost all front-wheel-drive. Chrysler Town &AMP;
Country and the Dodge Caravan have all-wheel-drive options. Only
the Chevrolet Astro and GMC Safari are rear drive. All-wheel-drive
options are available on these models . . . Mercedes Benz has a
solid four-wheel independent suspension on its sports utilities,
giving these models a more carlike ride than othe SUVs.)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Nasdaq stock market, which has more rpms these
days than a Nascar racer, hit a small speed bump last week. In the
first three trading sessions, the Nasdaq composite lost 9 percent
of its value. Happily for investors who have poured money into
technology stocks and mutual funds, the composite rebounded nicely
to close the week at 4,798.13.
</P>
<P>
   While the recent swerve was unsettling, the Nasdaq is still up
18 percent so far this year. One of the biggest factors behind its
surge has been the action in newly public companies.
</P>
<P>
   Initial public offerings, most of which trade on Nasdaq, are
averaging 100 percent gains in their first day of trading this
year, up from the 60 percent gains that were typical in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Eye-popping moves like these are almost entirely owing to the
tiny supply of shares in new companies, balanced _ or perhaps
imbalanced _ against the titanic demand for them. Which makes it
well worth noting that over the next two months, the supply-demand
equation in these shares will change significantly. That not only
could depress the highfliers, but it could dampen the performance
of the Nasdaq over all.
</P>
<P>
   According to Steven Galbraith, research analyst at Sanford C.
Bernstein &AMP; Co., the increased supply in new-company shares will
come from the inside. Top executives at companies going public
usually agree to abstain from selling their shares into the open
market for a period of time after the offering date. These
agreements are known as lock-up periods.
</P>
<P>
   Many lock-up periods are about to expire, unleashing what could
be a flood of shares onto the market. By Galbraith's reckoning,
over the next three months some 2.4 billion shares of stock in last
year's new issues _ more than twice the current number of shares
trading in these companies _ will be free to enter the market.
</P>
<P>
   Because these companies have seen huge price increases since
they came public, it is a good guess that many executives will be
eager to sell what they can of their holdings. How big are the
gains that the insiders are sitting on? While the initial value of
these offerings was $52 billion, their worth, as of last week, had
rocketed to $256 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Only one in four of these companies makes money, Galbraith
noted. ``It truly is the physical supply-demand dynamic of the
piece of paper that is determining the near-term valuation of these
securities, not the intrinsic value,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The current heat of the IPO market is encouraging even the
greenest, most untried companies to go public. In fact, Galbraith
argues that companies which might have been attractive bets to
early stage venture capital investors are now bypassing the
incubator stage and selling shares directly to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Given that about three-quarters of early venture investments
typically fail, Galbraith suspects that within a year or so, many
of these stocks will have hit the skids.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, that unwinding will hurt individual investors
much more than institutions. While institutions are the initial
owners of these shares _ 90 percent of IPOs are allocated to
favored mutual funds and other large investors _ individuals
typically own them in the months after their debuts. Galbraith
found that nine months after an offering, institutional ownership
amounted to around 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the companies that came public last year are already
trading well below their offering prices, a situation that will
only be exacerbated by a fresh supply of shares. The big guys in
these deals are long gone, having pocketed their enormous profits.
And individual investors? Once again, they will be left holding the
bag.

THE BAKSHEESH-POVERTY LINK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, March 19, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The big problem of the poor is they don't have enough money. And
a large part of that problem is they can't get the help they need
because their local government is corrupt. Dr. Tom Durant of Mass
General, who left Boston for flood-stricken Mozambique Thursday for
the American Refugee Committee, said in virtually every disaster
relief operation of his 40 years experience, the problems are
exacerbated by ``the three `B's: bribery, bureaucracy, and
baksheesh,'' the term for petty payoffs to officialdom.
</P>
<P>
   To try to get a handle on what the poor want for themselves,
beyond more money, the World Bank commissioned a massive study
interviewing 60,000 poor people in 60 countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voices of the Poor'' found that poor people are victimized by
some of the very systems intended to ameliorate their lot. It's
Murphy's Law compounded on a global scale: if it ain't one thing,
it's another, and whatever can go wrong will.
</P>
<P>
   Pervasive and systemic corruption at the grassroots level on a
global scale among civic and governmental organizations makes it
very difficult to lift the congenitally poor our of poverty,
declared World Bank President James D. Wolfensohn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corruption hampers economic growth, burdens the poor
disproportionately, and undermines the effectiveness of investment
and aid,'' he told a global forum on corruption.
</P>
<P>
   And because corruption erodes trust, ``Poor men and women often
do not trust government officials,'' said Deepa Narayan, leader of
the World Bank study team. ``This is based on their daily
experiences with corrupt officials, their attempts to get teachers
to teach their children, their inability to get medicines from
health clinics even after they have paid for them. It's also based
on their efforts to seek justice, get police to protect them, and
get institutional assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   The famous scene in ``The Godfather'' where an Italian immigrant
seeks the intervention of the Don exemplifies the inability of
people at the level of the peasantry to obtain relief from
governmental agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The poor have an almost universal fear of the rudeness,
humiliation or outright abuse that can result from a request for
help. ``They constantly say government has an important role to
play in their lives,'' said Narayan. ``But they are fed up with
being asked to participate, which takes time and costs them money,
without producing any returns.''
</P>
<P>
   The Archbishop of Canberbury, George Carey, critiqued the study,
and said ``The book communicates in a powerful way, the corruption
and often inhumane behavior of institutions that have direct
contact with the poor.''
</P>
<P>
   The poor have an all-too-keen understanding of how they are
being ripped off. A Bosnian testified about how local officials
stole the stove he'd been given by a UN program. A Ugandan woman
told of a long list of petty payoffs to get medical treatment.'' A
Ukranian worker amplified the mindset of those who find it morally
justified to steal from the state: ``The state steals from us all
the time so deceiving the state is not a sin.''
</P>
<P>
   How do you teach governments and peoples to be more honest? If
the World Bank could figure that out, it would succeed where the
world's religions failed. Constructing norms for human nature is
like building sand castles below the high tide mark. The study
focuses on identifying grass roots level corruption as a major
problem; stressing accountability and transparency in establishing
guidlelines; and rewarding honest behavior
</P>
<P>
   A different approach to alleviating poverty in the
hunger-fighting effort is being launched by Oxfam, which won a $2.9
million grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the
charitable donor arm of mighty Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who are disadvantaged know what they want,'' said
Adrienne Leicester Smith of Boston's Oxfam America's headquarters.
Unlike the Peace Corps, which sends volunteers abroad, Oxfarm
focuses on grants to help local and national non-profits which have
ongoing programs at the local level.
</P>
<P>
   The Gates' grant will go for a project to train young American
college students under the rubric ``Campuses Helping Achieve a New
Global Environment.'' Not by accident, the acronym spells CHANGE.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have no idea that other people don't have food like we
do,'' said Smith. Oxfam already conducts the annual hunger banquets
on college campuses to raise awareness and channel the idealism of
young people to combat world hunger.
</P>
<P>
   There are 100 million Americans under the age of 24. These are
the people Oxfam must convert if it is to make substantial inroads
in the food shortgage that affects the planet's poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our population is not the cause of hunger,'' said Smith.
``There is actually a surplus.'' But getting the food to the hungry
has always been the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is campaigning in Congress for
legislation that would forgive some of the debt amassed by the poor
nations, many of whom cannot cope with explosive population growth,
shifting tides of economic well-being triggered by globalization of
the world economy, and natural disasters like the floods that have
just devastated Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent Globe interview, Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers
said the Clinton administration believes debt relief is one of the
best ways for America lift the world's poor. With one billion
humans living on the equivalent of a dollar a day or less, taxing
those desperately poor people to pay back loans to international
bankers or wealthier countries makes little sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the largest moral issue facing mankind,''
said Summers. He linked debt relief with the moral obligation of
wealthy nations to pay for vaccines that could save millions of
impoverished people. The US is owed about $920 million of the $28
billion in debt packed under the Cologne Debt Relief Initiative.
Last year, Congress appropriated $110 million for debt relief, and
the Clinton administration wants to bump that up another $210
million.
</P>
<P>
   So the Clinton crowd, the Catholic bishops, the Anglican and
Episcopal Churches and other Protestant denominations, have joined
with outfits like Oxfam to urge the forgiveness of debt.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody's trying to do something; what are you doing?
</P>

FEATURES TO CONSIDER WHEN TRUCK SHOPPING

<TEXT>
<P>
   Why should you buy a truck-like vehicle? Conveniences,
flexibility, and safety are three good reasons. Trucks, according
to manufacturers, fall into three categories: pickups, sport
utilities, and minivans.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the things you should be considering when
shopping:
</P>
<P>
   Premium or regular: With gasoline prices nearing $1.80 a gallon
for premium fuels, check out the octane needs of the vehicle you
are looking at. Many SUVs require premium fuel. There are plenty
good SUV models which take just plain old regular octane gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Size: Your personal preferences will determine what size vehicle
you need. Are the truck's features only going to be used
occasionally? What will you be hauling: Lots of kids, cargo, or
some other combination? A pickup with a larger cab and an open
cargo bed could be used for family activities as well as hauling
yard trash or camping gear. A minivan might also serve your
purposes just as well. Consumer Reports found it could pack more
goods in the back of a minivan than a Jeep Grand Cherokee. The
Subaru Forester is a great choice for people who aren't looking for
a huge mass of vehicle, but one that offers all the plusses of an
SUV without being a gas-guzzler.
</P>
<P>
   Interior space: Newer pickup truck models which have rear
seating are now the rage. But not all these vehicles are created
equally when it comes to space. Even some supercab styles may offer
cramped seating for rear-seat passengers. Sport utilities come in
every size imaginable. If you really want space, consider the new
Chevrolet Suburban Tahoe or GMC Yukon. These are real people
carriers, and with rear seats removed, you can place sheets of
plywood on the floor inside. If you really need lots of room, look
to the Ford Excursion, with room for nine passengers plus cargo.
But size can be deceiving. Automobile magazine notes the Excursion
is only slightly bigger inside than the Suburban, and, because of
its size, cannot carry as much payload.
</P>
<P>
   Doors: The four-door pickup is here. But watch those doors. Some
are full-sized _ just like on cars _ and even open like car doors;
others are smaller and may only have door latches on the inside.
Consumers should also note how wide the doors open. The Dodge Quad
has rear doors that open to 90 degrees, making it easier to put
cargo as well as passengers in the back. The upcoming Chevrolet
Avalanche is designed to include a fifth door that opens onto the
bed, allowing extra-long items to be placed on an otherwise short
bed.
</P>
<P>
   Many minivans now have two side sliding doors which are
electrically controlled. The Chrysler Town &AMP; Country will soon
sport not only two electrically controlled side doors but also an
electrically controlled rear door.
</P>
<P>
   On SUVs, the Chevrolet Suburban and GMC Yukon are the only
models with a choice of rear doors. Buyers can choose between a
lift gate or a side-hinged rear cargo door.
</P>
<P>
   What drive? Two-wheel, four-wheel, all-wheel, part-time or
full-time: These are the choices. Just about every pickup truck and
SUV is available with a standard two-wheel-drive, similar to cars.
</P>
<P>
   Permanent four-wheel-drive vehicles have no two-wheel drive
option; these systems are effective in snow and mud and have a
differential that shifts power to wheels needing it. A low-range
drive is usually also found on these vehicles for off-road
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   All-wheel-drive handles all road conditions automatically. Power
is shifted between wheels as needed. Not all model models offer
low-range.
</P>
<P>
   Part-time four-wheel-drive operate on the road in
two-wheel-drive. If conditions call for four-wheel-drive, the
driver must select that mode with a lever or switch. Vehicles with
part-time 4WD do allow for ``shift on the fly'' to engage the
system. However, on these vehicles, the four-wheel-drive mode is
not suitable for use on dry pavement.
</P>
<P>
   Warranties: Check out what is covered on your vehicle and for
how long. Isuzu has expanded its powertrain warranty to 10 years,
120,000 miles on its Amigo, Rodeo, Trooper and VehiCross to cover
engine, transmission, steering assembly, suspension and axles.
Adjustment and maintenance items are not covered. The warranty is
only transferable to members of the original owner's family,
otherwise it reverts to a three-year, 50,000-mile warranty.
</P>
<P>
   Suspension: Isuzu's Rodeo and Amigo now have smart suspensions,
a new semiactive suspension system previously used only on luxury
cars and the Lexus LX470. The system increases comfort and reduces
oscillations in body roll. It is standard on models with Ironman
package and the top trim level of the Rodeo. It is not available on
the Trooper.
</P>
<P>
   On SUVs based on a car platform, the ride is much smoother than
on a vehicle with a truck platform. ABS: Antilock brakes prevent
lockups and provide straighter, quicker braking.
</P>
<P>
   Construction: Trucks originally were built on a solid frame,
cars on a unibody frame. The new Mitsubishi Montero has switched
from a frame construction to a unibody one for a more car-like
ride. In 1996, 31 of the 32 SUVs on the road had a truck platform;
by 2006, it is predicted that there will be 70 SUV nameplates, with
37 having truck-based platforms and 33 having car bases.
</P>
<P>
   Cargo bed: Once there were but two choices for pickups _ short
(6 feet) or long bed (8 feet). Then manufacturers built compact
pickups with narrow beds. Now come the blended pickup/SUV with even
shorter beds. &QL; 
 &QL; 
(Notes: Minivans are almost all front-wheel-drive. Chrysler Town &AMP;
Country and the Dodge Caravan have all-wheel-drive options. Only
the Chevrolet Astro and GMC Safari are rear drive. All-wheel-drive
options are available on these models . . . Mercedes Benz has a
solid four-wheel independent suspension on its sports utilities,
giving these models a more carlike ride than othe SUVs.)

   GUNS-SMITH (Washington) _ Smith &AMP; Wesson has agreed to provide
safety locks on its handguns within 60 days and to make them
child-resistant within a year, the Clinton administration announced
Friday. Under the unprecedented deal reached with the company by
the departments of Housing and Urban Development and Treasury and
officials representing state and local governments, Smith &AMP; Wesson
agreed to a ``code of conduct'' for sales and distribution of
handguns. By James Dao.

   WACO-REENACT (Waco, Texas) _ Early this Sunday, a select group
of government officials and private lawyers will meet at nearby
Fort Hood military base to watch an extraordinary experiment
intended to answer a question that has raged from Internet chat
rooms to the halls of Congress: Did federal agents fire gunshots
into the Branch Davidian compound occupied by David Koresh and his
followers shortly before the wooden structure burned to the ground
on April 19, 1993, claiming the lives of 80 men, women and
children? The furor over the incident at Waco remains one of the
most vexing issues still facing the Department of Justice in the
waning months of the Clinton Administration. By Jim Yardley.
</P>
<P>
   IRAN-U.S. (Washington) _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
on Friday lifted a narrow slice of America's broad economic
sanctions against Iran and declared a commitment to take far more
extensive steps toward ending two decades of hostility ``if Iran
indicates a desire and commitment to do so.'' In a speech here that
Clinton administration officials described as their most explicit
overture to the moderates who won Iranian parliamentary elections
last month, Albright described a road map for economic
normalization of relations, but she made no mention of a resumption
of full diplomatic relations. By David E. Sanger.

   RUSSIA-ICONS (Pskov, Russia) _ God moves in mysterious ways,
except, maybe, in Pskov, a city that has monasteries and grand
churches and religious artifacts the way Americans have
remote-control clickers. It suggests why the Rev. Andrei Davydov
was plucked out of a parish in Latvia six years ago and deposited
in Pskov, in a troubled little church _ a church that, when the
Russian Orthodox patriarchate regained it in 1991, was found to
harbor several skeletons in the vestibule, a single bullet hole in
each cranium. Every church needs a good priest. But an artist, it
turned out, was what this church needed most of all. In Andrei it
got both. For him, icon art became an almost transcendental
obsession. By Michael Wines.

   CLOTHING-OPTIONAL-DORM (Middletown, Conn.) _ When a Wesleyan
University freshman applied to live in a dorm that advertised
itself as diverse, multicultural and politically active, she
thought it would be a welcome change from her small hometown in
California. But she soon found out what diverse and multicultural
really meant at the dorm: clothing optional. By Neil MacFarquhar.

   INTERNET-APPLIANCE (Undated) _ A Texas company called Netpliance
has spent millions to reach its target market: non-technical folks
who want a simple, inexpensive device that will connect them to the
Internet without the need for a full-fledged personal computer. So
it came as something of a surprise this week when an insatiable
demand for its product emerged from a network of self-described
geeks. They had figured out how to tweak the company's $99 device,
the I-opener, so that it works like the fancy PCs it is supposed to
transcend. The army of I-opener modifiers may provide some low-cost
computers to those who can't otherwise afford them. But they may
also spell trouble for Netpliance, which just started offering
shares to the public Friday. The company loses money on each
machine it sells. Profits come from the $21.95 it charges customers
to connect to its Internet service. By Amy Harmon.

   MISSING-OSCARS (Hollywood) _ Police are being asked to keep an
eye out for several dozen bald, shiny men standing about 13 inches
high and weighing 8 pounds each, with strangely erect posture,
vaguely Cycladic features and a tendency to make motion picture
professionals gush, weep and suddenly remember their parents. Just
two weeks after the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences
was forced to resend 4,200 of this year's Oscar ballots because the
first batch had been mislaid by the U.S. Postal Service, the
academy had to announce Friday morning that somebody has stolen the
entire shipment of 55 gold-plated statuettes that were to be used
in this year's ceremonies on March 26 at Los Angeles' Shrine
Auditorium. By Rick Lyman.

PARENTS IGNORING V-CHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (e and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every day, television salesman Howard Raphel is peppered with
questions from customers about visual clarity, sound quality, or
features like picture-in-picture.
</P>
<P>
   But the one thing no customer asks about is the V-chip.
</P>
<P>
   Of the thousands of customers Raphel has dealt with in the nine
months since TV sets containing the V-chip became available, not a
single one has raised the issue with him. ``Most of them don't even
know what it means,'' said Raphel, who works for a suburban Boston
appliance store.
</P>
<P>
   What it means, at least in theory, is that parents now have a
technological tool to block violent or racy TV programs they don't
want their children to see. But in practice, to judge by interviews
with parents and retailers, the ``V'' in the much-ballyhooed V-chip
could stand for the gaping void in public awareness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never heard of it,'' said 47-year-old Debbie Nelson as
she shopped with her 13-year-old daughter in the electronics
department of Sears in Natick, Mass. Ten yards away, 44-year-old
Bill DiCarlo echoed that refrain, while salesman Jeff Dennis
remarked that only one person has asked him about the V-chip.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one cares about it,'' said Anne Marie Bouchet, spokeswoman
for the Tweeter Home Entertainment Group, which owns 15 stores in
Massachusetts. ``No one's asking for it. No one's basing their
purchase of a TV on the V-chip.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't supposed to be this way.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, when President Clinton signed into law a bill
authorizing the V-chip, it was envisioned by its champions _
prominently including US Representative Edward Markey (D-Mass.) _
as a way for parents to defend their children against a TV industry
seemingly intent on swamping them with violence, sex, and
profanity.
</P>
<P>
   But now that TV sets containing V-chips are flooding into the
stores _ adding up to $50 to the overall price tag _ those same
parents appear to be oblivious to its existence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main problem is there's no awareness of this,'' said
Federal Communications Commissioner Gloria Tristani, who chairs the
FCC's task force on the V-chip. ``I'm getting a little impatient,
hoping there can be a good public education campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   As of last July, the FCC required all manufacturers to include a
V-chip in half of all TVs with screens larger than 13 inches. Since
Jan. 1, a V-chip has been mandatory in all TVs over that size.
</P>
<P>
   Its use, however, is entirely optional. TV owners can block
objectionable shows by following a series of written and on-screen
instructions culminating in a menu of the ratings (such as TVMA for
Mature Audiences Only, or TV-PG for Parental Guidance Suggested)
that the networks agreed to put on their programs under pressure
from Congress. Once at the menu, viewers can activate the V-chip
and screen out any programs rated at a level they consider
inappropriate for their children.
</P>
<P>
   Though national TV sales are up 7 percent this year, retailers
don't pinpoint the V-chip as the reason, according to Lisa Fasold
of the Virginia-based Consumer Electronics Association. She says
the V-chip hasn't caused ``that much of a difference in the selling
of TV sets.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, even as it struggles for acceptance, the V-chip
already faces competition from other technologies. Cable companies
like MediaOne and Cablevision, as well as satellite TV companies,
now offer customers set-top boxes that enable parents to block out
certain channels _ but not individual programs _ as part of their
cable package.
</P>
<P>
   ``The V-chip is almost redundant,'' said Bruce Leichtman,
director of media and entertainment strategy at the Yankee Group, a
Boston consulting and market-research firm. ``It's a little
ludicrous. This is what happens when government gets involved and
it shouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The apparent public indifference to the V-chip is gratifying to
those who always opposed it as a form of governmental coercion.
``It at least has demonstrated that this is not going to be the
end-all and be-all that the government thought it would be,'' said
Marv Johnson, legislative counsel of the American Civil Liberties
Union.
</P>
<P>
   But Markey, who was principal congressional sponsor of the
V-chip legislation and popularized its name (``V'' standing for
violence), says the device was never intended to be more than ``an
option for families with small children.'' He argued that ``by
establishing the V-chip as a principle, we created a competition''
to create technologies that parents could use to block
objectionable programs, such as the set-top boxes the cable and
satellite industries devised.
</P>
<P>
   As for the V-chip itself, Markey argued that it will eventually
be embraced by ``a new generation of younger parents, more
technologically savvy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As television continues to lower its standards, I think that
we can expect more and more parents of this next generation of
children to take advantage of the technology,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, however, proponents of the V-chip are
disheartened, puzzled, and angry at the tepid reception for a
technology they believed parents would eagerly embrace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe how little publicity it's getting, given how
revolutionary it is,'' said Joanne Cantor, a communications
professor at the University of Wisconsin and author of ``Mommy, I'm
Scared: How TV and Movies Frighten Children and What We Can Do to
Protect Them.'' She contends that the V-chip ``could languish''
because the TV industry is ``keeping parents in the dark about
this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not to their advantage if a lot of people use the
V-chip,'' she said. ``Because the more people who use the V-chip
effectively, the fewer eyeballs will be delivered to advertisers.''
</P>
<P>
   Tristani of the FCC faulted manufacturers, retailers, and some
newspapers for not making more viewers aware of the V-chip, and
said the networks have been erratic in airing public service
announcements about the V-chip. ``Some months they run a lot, some
months they haven't run any,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kathryn Montgomery, president of the Washington-based Center for
Media Education, agreed, saying the networks ``haven't really
promoted it effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the networks don't see it that way. At ABC, spokeswoman
Julie Hoover notes that the networks encode their programs with the
ratings that are vital to the V-chip, and insisted: ``The PSAs have
gotten exposure.''
</P>
<P>
   At CBS, senior vice president Martin Franks said PSAs regarding
the V-chip have run during such popular prime-time programs as
``Touched by an Angel'' and ``Diagnosis Murder.'' Franks said ``the
V-chip is as heavy in our current (PSA) rotation as about any other
cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the finger-pointing, there are signs that many consumers
still like the concept of the V-chip. Robyn Williams, the mother of
a 2-year-old daughter, said she favors the V-chip because ``there's
so much violence on TV that I don't think (children) should be
subjected to.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-year-old Evon, who declined to give her last name, said
she had not heard of the V-chip but can see its usefulness, noting
that her 7-year-old niece ``knows too many things, and I know it's
from TV.'' A mother of three shopping in the Chestnut Hill Mall
near Boston, who declined to give her name, said she likes the idea
of the V-chip because ``there are a lot of times we're out and
can't monitor all that they're watching.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem for V-chip proponents is that though the public has
overwhelmingly supported the idea of the device in polls, their
words haven't yet been borne out by their actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes what the audience says they want doesn't necessarily
correspond with their behavior,'' said Meryl Marshall, president of
the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. ``They'll tell you
they don't want violence, and then they'll watch the World
Wrestling Federation or Jerry Springer.''
</P>
<P>
   Tristani said that due to high-profile episodes of real-life
violence ``a very legitimate parental concern'' remains about TV
violence. She is convinced the V-chip will eventually catch on.
``I'm going to keep up my optimism,'' she said. ``This is still the
beginning.''

ALBRIGHT OUTLINES STEPS TO ELIMINATE BARRIERS WITH IRAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Americans will soon be able once again to buy
Persian carpets, Caspian caviar, and pistachio nuts from the fields
of Iran. But Secretary of State Madeleine Albright hopes that's
just the beginning of a new relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged by Iran's ``refreshing'' youth-driven reform movement
and its third democratic election in three years, Albright
delivered a ground-breaking address Friday that the Clinton
administration hopes will eventually lead to the sight of two
enemies talking for the first time in 21 years.
</P>
<P>
   For Iranians, her most important words were likely those
recalling the two countries' poisonous history. She pointed not
only to the Iranian takeover of the US embassy in 1979, but also to
the Americans' ``significant role in orchestrating'' the 1953
overthrow of leftist Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in Iran to this day blunt any inquiry about the US
embassy takeover and hostage-taking with anger over the way CIA
operatives crushed their nascent democracy nearly a half-century
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Less than three hours after Albright spoke before the
American-Iranian Council, formed only three years ago to foster
better ties, Iranian Ambassador to the United Nations Mohammed Hadi
Nejad-Hoseinian told the same group that he welcomed the US measure
and said it ``will be reciprocated by Iran with a positive and
proportionate measure.''
</P>
<P>
   The Iranian ambassador declined to offer specifics and took no
questions, but he cautioned not to expect a breakthrough, such as
the start of official talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the problems with the offer of dialogue is that the US
has made it in an insolent and domineering spirit, and not in a
real and practical spirit of mutual respect,'' Nejad-Hoseinian
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the extraordinary display of public diplomacy in a
ballroom of a northwest Washington hotel raised some hope for
breaking down what Albright and Nejad-Hoseinian each termed a
``wall of mistrust.''
</P>
<P>
   As a gesture of goodwill, US officials emailed copies of
Albright's address to Iranian officials in Tehran and New York
before she spoke, enabling Nejad-Hoseinian to offer a direct
response.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said the US would now take three steps: partially lift
sanctions to allow trade in carpets, caviar, nuts, and dried fruit;
find ways to end ``unnecessary impediments'' such as invasive
searches of Iranians at US airports; increase contacts between
Iranian and American scholars, artists, and athletes; and attempt
to settle all outstanding legal claims between the two countries
before a tribunal at the Hague.
</P>
<P>
   Still, US sanctions remain on Iranian oil, which provides Iran
with 85 percent of its foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
   And Albright's hopeful words were balanced by demands that Iran
end its alleged support for terrorism. ``It's important to us to
see some changes in terms of the policies on proliferation, their
desire to acquire weapons of mass destruction, their support for
terrorism and their lack of support for the Middle East peace
process,'' she said in a news conference after the speech.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, she said the two countries shared a
number of goals, such as wanting a more moderate government in
Afghanistan, guaranteeing the free flow of oil in the Persian Gulf,
and stopping narco-trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   In her speech, Albright also said the US-backed government of
Mohammed Reza Shah Pahlavi ``brutally repressed political
dissent,'' and that US support for Iraq during the eight-year
Iran-Iraq war was ``regrettably shortsighted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither Iran, nor we, can forget the past,'' Albright said.
``It has scarred us both.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, she explained why she raised the history of the
countries' relations: ``I think that it's important for the
American people and the Iranian people to know that there has been
a difficult history . . . on both sides, but I also said that it
was important not to be frozen by the past and to look toward the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``If all our policies were simply based on past
history, we wouldn't be speaking to the United Kingdom.''
</P>
<P>
   Such remarks should be well received in Iran, said Ali Sajjadi,
editor of Par Monthly Journal, which examines Iranian issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the eyes of Iranians in Iran, you have to be clear about
the past before starting a new relationship,'' Sajjadi said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what effect the US overture might have, Sajjadi said,
``God knows. The situation in Iran is so tense right now. The
speech is important, but this is not the first priority in Iran.
The first one is to solve the domestic problems, such as the
hardliners versus the reformers.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Suzanne Maloney, a research associate at the Brookings
Institution who has spent four months over the past year in Iran,
said Albright's speech ``went far beyond'' what many expected in
terms of supporting a new US-Iranian relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Since reformist President Mohammed Khatami won election in May
1997, the administration has reacted cautiously on Iranian policy.
By comparison, Albright seemed bold Friday, she said.
</P>

   ``There's always the potential for gestures like this to push
things forward, to shake things up very quickly,'' Maloney said.

<P>
   Albright's speech drew mixed reaction in Congress, winning
support from three influential Republican senators _ Arlen Specter
of Pennsylvania, Chuck Hagel of Nebraska and Richard G. Lugar of
Indiana _ but Republican Senator Connie Mack of Florida denounced
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Principled foreign policy stands up to terrorism,'' Mack said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright herself remained cautious about what's ahead. But she
couldn't hide her hope that carpet-and-grain diplomacy could start
something.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something that happened inside Iran that indicates
that conceivably, maybe, they might wish to react,'' she said.

THAT DOLPHIN GRIN GETS US EVERY TIME _ AND HAS THROUGHOUT HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By M.L. LYKE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The smile is as permanent as The Joker's. And the wild animal
wearing it is not, as romantics might suggest, a mystical, gentle
giant from the lost continent of Atlantis, but rather an extremely
efficient predator.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Tim Cahill was suckered in by the Flipper grin as he swam
alongside a bottlenose dolphin for the first time off the Japanese
island of Mikura.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dolphin moved with me. I could see her round, black eye
and the anatomical smile that meant precisely nothing at all.
Still, one feels obliged to smile back,'' writes the
philosophizing, humorizing adventurer in the new coffee-table book
``Dolphins'' (National Geographic, 216 pages, $35).
</P>
<P>
   His book is a companion to the Imax giant-screen documentary
film of the same name.
</P>
<P>
   That first dolphin encounter left Cahill mulling the
complexities of an animal that humans have revered through history,
yet still barely understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think dolphins are intelligent, social, highly verbal and
seem to take an inordinate pleasure in sex, especially after a fine
meal,'' Cahill said in a recent phone interview. ``In short, they
are very much like us.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is, Cahill notes, a dark side to this happy affinity.
</P>
<P>
   Dolphins can be brutes, tossing live prey into the air and
ramming them with their beaks, like a cats playing with a mouse.
Certain bullying bottlenose will harass and kill smaller harbor
porpoises simply for fun, not food.
</P>
<P>
   Males have been observed killing infants in order to mate with
their mothers or engaging in what Cahill describes as ``gang rape''
of females in estrus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dolphins are not all peace and love,'' says Cahill, ``and they
are not above a fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Those fighting instincts can kick in when humans fail to mind
their manners in the company of dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   Dolphins have bitten, bumped, severely injured and even, in one
case, killed humans who engaged in such social faux pas as touching
or aggressive pursuit of the animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to let the dolphins approach you,'' says
Cahill.
</P>
<P>
   He minded his underwater manners during that first encounter,
swimming belly to belly with the graceful creatures and coming away
from the experience with what he calls a ``dreamy feeling'' and a
lasting ``mush-headed affection.''
</P>
<P>
   The human-dolphin bond is long. Stories of interspecies
friendships wind back to ancient times. Cahill recounts the tale of
a small boy and dolphin told by Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder.
In the story the boy rides the dolphin to school every day across
the Bay of Naples. One day the boy dies. Only a few weeks later the
animal washes up on shore, dead.
</P>
<P>
   Was it heartbroken? Stories of Man's Other Best Friend
inevitably stir up such anthropomorphic emotions. For good reason.
</P>
<P>
   Cahill tells the story of JoJo, a solitary bottlenose dolphin
that hangs near beachside resorts in the Caribbean and is often
injured by personal watercraft and speed boats. JoJo befriended a
professional naturalist named Dean Bernal, who learned to
communicate with the dolphin and treat its injuries.
</P>
<P>
   JoJo had a chance to repay the kindness one day when Bernal was
diving. The naturalist didn't notice a large hammerhead shark
approaching him, but JoJo did. The dolphin quickly moved in front
of Bernal to protect him, then pressed its head against the back of
the shark and drove it 200 feet down to the bottom of the sea.
Bernal grabbed his videocamera and returned to the scene to capture
JoJo repeatedly harassing the dangerous man-eater. His footage is
incorporated into the Imax film.
</P>
<P>
   Cahill _ whose lively writing is familiar to readers of Rolling
Stone, Esquire, Men's Journal and Outside magazine, as well as fans
of his numerous adventure books _ served as co-writer on the
documentary produced by MacGillveray Freeman Films, creators of the
box-office hit ``Everest.''
</P>
<P>
   In book and film, the writer follows the exhilarating and
exasperating work of marine mammal scientists attempting to
document dolphins in the wild and to break their communication code
through analysis of movements and vocalizations.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike traditional researchers who work with captive dolphins
under controlled conditions, young marine biologist Kathleen
Dudzinski and her team must work on animal time. Wild dolphins show
up when they want to. And boat time costs big time.
</P>
<P>
   ``During a five- to six-month season in the Bahamas, Kathleen
got 20 hours of useful videotape,'' says Cahill. ``That's 20 hours
out of about 2,000, or a 1 percent return on the investment of
time.''
</P>
<P>
   In waters off the United States, pursuing wild dolphins for any
purpose can be read as harassment under the 1972 Marine Mammal
Protection Act. So the scientists headed to the Bahamas, Patagonia
and Japan for their documentary work, using specially adapted film
and audio equipment to record the bottle-nose, the Atlantic spotted
dolphin and the elusive dusky dolphin.
</P>
<P>
   Cahill spent four years on the dolphin project, a feather in the
baseball cap for the rumpled Montanan, whose adventures have left
him lying on his back counting stars in the Sahara Desert and, as
he recounts in the most recent edition of Men's Journal, narrowly
escaping a volcanic eruption in Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   He did not, he points out, escape that country's political coup.
</P>
<P>
   Coming up is a dog sled trip into Lapland. But no doubt dolphins
will still be swimming through his imagination as he swooshes
across the snow. ``Once you encounter a dolphin in a personal and
visceral manner, they invade and engage your conscience,'' says
Cahill.
</P>
<P>
   That could be a two-way engagement, he theorizes. Man studies
dolphin. Does dolphin study man?
</P>
<P>
   ``Dolphins are one of the few wild creatures that approach
humans in a friendly and apparently curious manner. The fascination
seems to be mutual,'' says Cahill. ``We think, `What's it like?
What's it like to be intelligent and live in the sea?'
</P>
<P>
   ``And maybe they think, `Hey you, you two-leggeds. What is it
like to be intelligent and live on the land. Can we talk?'''

DISCOVERY: BIAS LEAVES ITS MARK ON EVERYONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   How do we hate? Let us count the ways.
</P>
<P>
   OK, maybe ``hate'' is too strong. But bias, prejudice,
intolerance _ call it what you will _ manage to creep into behavior
no matter how ``neutral'' we think we are. Virtually no one is a
walking, talking Switzerland, it turns out.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery Channel offers startling evidence Monday in ``How
Biased Are You?'' The first in a yearlong ``Hate and Violence: No
Simple Answers'' initiative, the program was produced by ``Dateline
NBC'' and is hosted by Forrest Sawyer. It takes an academic
approach to the question, focusing on psychological experiments
aimed at understanding perceptions of race differences among
children and adults.
</P>
<P>
   In the children's experiment, a subject is asked to interpret
what's happening in several pictures. In one, for instance, a boy
seems to be falling down the stairs while another boy behind him
has his arm outstetched. One interpretation could be that the boy
with the outstretched arm pushed the other boy. Another is that he
is reaching out to stop the boy from falling.
</P>
<P>
   What's interesting and troubling is how often the second
interpretation _ the ``good'' interpretation _ is offered if the
boy with the outstretched arm is depicted as being white, and how
often the first comes up if the same character is portrayed with
dark skin. Although the drawings are otherwise identical, it's also
instructive to see youngsters ascribe certain expressions to the
dark-skinned boy that they don't see in the light-skinned.
</P>
<P>
   Another study, this one targeting adults, asks people to pair
white faces with positive-sounding words and black faces with
negative-sounding words in rapid-fire order. Subjects of either
race have little trouble doing so, but when they're asked to pair
white faces with ``bad'' words and black faces with ``good'' words,
it's a different story altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Even among people who have spent their lives working for human
rights, the incidence of an unconscious preference for whites is
unmistakable.
</P>
<P>
   What this says about us is eye-opening. Ideally, it may be
mind-opening.
</P>
<P>
   How Biased Are You? One-hour program examining everyday
situations in which prejudice and hate manifest themselves, hosted
by Forrest Sawyer. Monday night on the Discovery Channel. Parental
guideline rating: TV-G.

 On FOX, `TITUS' LOOKS FOR THE `FUN' IN `DYSFUNCTIONAL'  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Christopher Titus isn't the first to try to find the ``fun'' in
``dysfunctional.'' ``Married ... With Children'' tried it for 10
seasons on Fox, the same network that presents the series premiere
of ``Titus'' Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   While I never warmed to that meanwhile-back-at-the-raunch style
of ``Married ... With Children,'' I've now seen three episodes of
``Titus'' and must admit it just might grow on me. Like a fungus.
(Hey, another ``fun'' word!)
</P>
<P>
   ``Titus'' has fun with the sorts of things you're not supposed
to have fun with on television: mental illness, physical abuse,
alcoholism. It's all based on his own life, Christopher Titus
insists, as if that somehow makes bad taste excusable. Then again,
as he explains in one episode: ``Once you've driven a drunk father
to Mom's parole hearing, what else is there?''
</P>
<P>
   What else, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Titus, a successful stand-up comic and hot-rod enthusiast in
real life, plays the owner of a custom-car shop in his show, which
has an appealing impertinence at the same time that it might make
you go, ``Eew, I can't believe he said that!'' For instance, here's
Titus' father remarking on the fact that his ex-wife _ Titus's
mother _ has been hospitalized for manic-depressive schizophrenia:
``Your mom is shacked up in the wacko basket!''
</P>
<P>
   Stacy Keach, playing the hard-drinking dad who treats matrimony
as a sport in which the one with the most trips down the aisle is
the winner, makes it work with a brutal delivery of black humor.
Credit, too, a smart supporting cast featuring Zack Ward as Titus'
zany stepbrother, Dave; Cynthia Watros as his too-good-to-be-true
girlfriend, Erin, and David Shatraw as his anal-retentive best
friend, Tommy.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many new shows these days, this one knocks down the
fourth wall so Christopher Titus can address the audience directly.
It's fast becoming a threadbare device, but in Titus' standup-savvy
hands it's an amusing way to provide all the back-story details
that can gum up the works if a show is poorly scripted. The idea of
having Titus deliver this personal information in black and white,
from what appears to be an interrogation room illuminated by a
single lightbulb, is also a clever touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Titus'' is a little like Fox's short-lived ``Action'' in its
willingness to go where TV comedies fear to tread. Its style is far
more conventional, with laughter from a studio audience punctuating
the funny lines. (Titus promises the laughter we hear is the real,
``unsweetened'' variety. If a particular episode is weak, he says,
it won't be juiced with a phony laugh track.)
</P>
<P>
   ``When we set the bar,'' Titus told critics recently, ``we
actually said, `Let's go back to ``All in the Family'' and the
great shows on television and try to do something like that as
opposed to smart-ass people yelling at each other.'''
</P>
<P>
   The danger lies down the road, if Titus the creator runs out of
real-life fodder for Titus the character. At that point, ``Titus''
could become a sitcommy caricature of itself. But, in the early
going, Titus is on the money when he says, ``Anything is funny if
the setup is right.''
</P>
<P>
   Titus. Half-hour comedy celebrating a dysfunctional family.

and David Shatraw. Series premiere Monday night on Fox. Parental

`THE GIRL' IS SET TO LEAD GERMANY'S DOMINANT POLITICAL PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ In paternal, if not quite patronizing, tones, Helmut
Kohl liked to call her ``das Maedchen'' _ ``the girl.'' Now the
wide-eyed girl from the east has turned on the former chancellor
and is about to usher in a German political revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Her name is Angela Merkel, and in the space of a few weeks all
resistance to her nomination as the next leader of Germany's
dominant postwar political force, the Christian Democratic Union,
has fallen away.
</P>
<P>
   With endorsements pouring in from all levels of the party, it is
now inevitable that the executive board of the Christian Democrats
will nominate her as the next party leader at a meeting here on
Monday, opening the way for Merkel to become the first woman to
head a major German party.
</P>
<P>
   But the change Merkel represents is much greater than one of
gender. It is religious, generational, moral and geographical. With
one of those strange lurches that characterize the way this
generally conservative country moves forward, Germany is reaching
out for entirely new political blood.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the lurch lies the financial scandal that has engulfed
the Christian Democrats, tarnishing the reputation of Kohl, who has
admitted accepting more than $1 million in illegal payments, and
ultimately obliging his party to look in directions unimaginable
until recently.
</P>
<P>
   Where Kohl comes from the Rhineland, home of Konrad Adenauer and
the heartland of the postwar Republic, Merkel grew up in the
formerly communist east. Where he is Catholic, she is Protestant.
</P>
<P>
   Where he is almost 70, a man indelibly marked by the Nazi years,
she is 45, a woman shaped by another trauma _ Germany's division
and unification. Where Kohl is domineering, she seeks grass-roots
consensus with a cool precision that seems to reflect her
physicist's training.
</P>
<P>
   It is a measure of the Christian Democrats' problems that this
radical change is being made through an overwhelming consensus. One
by one, Merkel's potential opponents for the leadership, including
heavyweights like the former defense minister, Volker Ruehe, have
dropped out with no more than a whimper.
</P>
<P>
   ``She represents a new departure, a totally new type of
political figure at the top,'' said Karl Kaiser, a political
analyst. ``To have a woman from the former communist East Germany
leading the country's foremost conservative party is a measure of
the political rupture of recent months.''
</P>
<P>
   It was precisely because he was Kohl's protege, and because he
himself also admitted taking secret donations, that Wolfgang
Schaeuble, the former chancellor's immediate successor as party
leader, was obliged to quit last month after just over a year at
the helm.
</P>
<P>
   Merkel, the party general-secretary, was waiting. From the start
of the financial scandal late last year, she had distinguished
herself by her evident dismay at the party slush funds, by her
determination to root out such practices, and by her indignation at
Kohl's insistence that his ``word of honor'' prevented him from
revealing the names of anonymous donors.
</P>
<P>
   In a much-noted article in the Frankfurter Allgemeine last
December, she wrote: ``Mr. Kohl's admissions have damaged the
Christian Democrats. Putting a word of honor above the law is not
comprehensible when one has committed a criminal act.''
</P>
<P>
   She continued: ``The Christian Democratic Party must learn to
walk by itself, without its old war horse, as Mr. Kohl often
referred to himself. Like someone in puberty, it must make the
break from home.''
</P>
<P>
   The words were literally stunning. They carried all the
straightforward indignation of an easterner who had absorbed years
of post-Cold War moral lessons on the iniquity of the communist
system only to discover abruptly that the venerated ``chancellor of
unification'' had been ready to place himself above the law.
</P>
<P>
   Merkel's clean break with Kohl _ made before that of any other
prominent party members _ impressed many people because the former
chancellor himself had plucked her from relative obscurity to
become his trophy easterner after unification.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Hamburg in 1954, Merkel moved as a child to the former
East Germany, where her father, a pastor with left-leaning ideals,
worked in Brandenburg. She trained as a physicist and worked as an
academic before beginning her political career as the deputy
spokeswoman for the first and last freely elected East German
government of Lothar de Maiziere in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   In the same year, she joined the Christian Democrats and, after
unification, was named minister for women and youth by Kohl. It was
then that he adopted the epithet ``das Maedchen'' for a woman whose
placid appearance and air of innocence belie intelligence and
ambition that are evidently fierce.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even after she became general-secretary of the party in 1998,
there was no suggestion that she might rise further until the old
guard _ and a fair swath of the younger party guard from the west _
were swept away by tales of Swiss bank accounts, cash in plastic
bags and rampant dishonesty.
</P>
<P>
   Picking her way through this debris in recent weeks, Merkel has
quietly undone the critics who once considered her too young or too
Protestant or too moderate or simply too female by emerging as the
only credible voice of change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to accept the consequences of what has happened,'' she
said on more than one occasion. ``And they are drastic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Angela Merkel is courageous,'' said Christian Wulff, one of
the first party members to promote her. ``She has the authenticity,
credibility and truthfulness that people are looking for in the
party.''
</P>
<P>
   That is certainly true. It is also true that Merkel has the
potential to emerge as a formidable opponent to the governing
Social Democrats and Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder because she will
appeal to women and to voters from the former east.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, she is a little-known quantity who owes her
meteoric rise as much to what she symbolizes as to what she has
said. Conservatives, especially Bavarian conservatives, suspect her
of standing too far to the left on economic issues, and she will
have a hard job shoring up the right wing of the party. Her long
cohabitation with the man who eventually became her second husband
in 1998 also raised concerns.
</P>
<P>
   But Merkel is no liberal. She campaigned last year against the
government decision to offer German citizenship to immigrants on
easier terms. More recently she has supported the bizarre electoral
slogan of Juergen Ruettgers, the Christian Democrat leader in North
Rhine-Westphalia.
</P>
<P>
   The slogan, whose xenophobic undertones appear clear, says,
``Kinder statt Inder'' _ ``Children not Indians'' _ a reference to
Schroeder's suggestion that Indians with talents in the field of
high technology should be offered residence permits as one way to
spur the German economy.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Merkel joined Kohl in parliament for a ceremony
marking the 10th anniversary of the first free election in east
Germany on March 18, 1990. It was the former chancellor's first
appearance in the Bundestag since November 24; his decline since
then was symbolized by his relegation to a less prominent seat.

TAIWANESE ABROAD RETURN TO SUPPORT REFORM CANDIDATE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe

<P>
   TAIPEI _ Chi-Tien Chang has never been so excited about an
election in his life. Never mind that he's an American now and
can't even vote here.
</P>
<P>
   In Taiwan's election Saturday what's at stake is not just
electing a president but the very future of Taiwanese democracy,
said Chang, one of a half dozen Taiwanese-born friends from Boston
who came back this week. What drew them was their desire to help
the first candidate with a realistic chance to break the 56-year
monopoly on power of the Kuomintang nationalist party.
</P>
<P>
   Chang, a pathologist at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical
Center, was barred from returning to his homeland for three decades
after speaking out against Taiwan's military dictatorship when he
was a student in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   But things have changed since the martial law was lifted in 1987
and free speech guaranteed in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, at the final rally for the independence-minded
Democratic Progressive Party, Chang joined a crowd estimated by
organizers at 400,000 people to shake green banners and cheer
themselves hoarse under a shower of confetti, fireworks, and
balloons at a muddy soccer stadium in the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the headquarters of opposition candidate Chen Shui-bian,
a former mayor of Taipei and stubborn opponent of political
corruption, hundreds of taxis blocked four lanes of traffic,
blowing their horns in support. Elsewhere in the city, rallies for
the ruling party's candidate, Vice President Lien Chan, and
independent rival James Soong lasted well after midnight, drawing
about the same numbers of supporters in a last push in the
neck-and-neck three-way race.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 15 million Taiwanese heading to the polls, why
would Chang and thousands of others who settled in the United
States and elsewhere spend their money and vacation time to rally
in the rain on the other side of the world, when they can't even
vote?
</P>
<P>
   Simple, said Chang, 56, who is on only his third visit since his
exile ended: ``I tasted freedom in Boston years ago, and I want the
same for my homeland.''
</P>
<P>
   The nationalist party, which bought up all the available
programming and commercial time on the three main TV networks,
boasts voters from overseas as well. But advertisements in The
Liberty Times, a Chinese-language newspaper in the United States,
state that supporters of the ruling party were offered ``a big
present'' and a ``gold medal'' to come back for the elections. When
asked about the apparent payment for votes, Charles Wu, head of
public relations for Lien's campaign, sputtered uncomfortably,
saying, ``This is a Chinese habit: When you receive visitors, you
give gifts . . . I'm certain it was only a small gift.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen's camp alleged that some supporters of independent James
Soong, who broke from the ruling party a few months ago, also paid
just $100 toward the cost of the trip and were given free
accommodation to lure them back to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Chen's party had little in its campaign coffers, and his
supporters had to buy their own green party vests, T-shirts, and
even campaign hats.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every taxi in Taipei was festooned with banners of their
favored candidates. The driver who brought the Boston group to its
rally wasn't flying a Chen flag on his antenna, but when he heard
they had come from the United States to support the opposition
leader, he confided that he did too, and would not accept the fare.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just a very small part of a group in Boston who fought
the dictatorship for years,'' said Tun-Hou Lee, 46, a professor of
virology at the Harvard School of Public Health. ``We all have
relatives here _ my parents and brothers are here _ and we'd like
to see Taiwan become a real democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   If Chen wins, it would be ``a clean slate. He could eradicate
all this corruption,'' Lee said. ``Even today, we know (the ruling
party) is buying votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee and his friends are not members of Chen's party, but along
with some 200 families in Greater Boston, they belong to the
Taiwanese Association of America, most of whose members support
permanent independence from China. The group has been meeting twice
a month to raise money and support for Chen.
</P>
<P>
   Some here criticize overseas Taiwanese for advocating
independence, despite threats of a military attack from communist
China, since they live in safety thousands of miles away and hold
foreign passports.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our hearts, we really wish Taiwan could be an independent
country, but we don't say it to our Taiwanese friends, because they
are really worried about the China threat,'' said Chen-Yuan Wang,
43, a transportation planner from Lexington, Mass. who will vote
Saturday since he still holds Taiwan citizenship. ``My response is
that my mother, my dad, my brothers all live here. Why would we
want anything to harm our own parents?'' Wang asked.
</P>
<P>
   As a candidate, Chen, who openly advocated independence for
years, has tempered his stance, promising not to declare Taiwan a
state, nor to change the flag or name of ``The Republic of China on
Taiwan,'' unless Beijing attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest threat to Taiwan now is not the (nationalists),
but China,'' said Wang. Here for their third trip in 13 years, Wang
and his wife took their son out of school for two weeks to witness
the election.
</P>
<P>
   None of the group has ever visited the mainland, and ``as long
as China threatens Taiwan, I don't want to,'' said San Lien, 58, a
Newton, Mass. engineer.
</P>
<P>
   If Chen loses, ``we will all cry together,'' said Mei Tsai, 53,
an accountant from Milford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   But she expected to be celebrating.

LEBANON GIVES ASYLUM TO JAPANESE RED ARMY MEMBER, SENDS 4 OTHERS TO
JORDAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOHN F. BURNS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ Lebanon granted political asylum Friday to
Kozo Okamoto, a 52-year-old Japanese who carried out a massacre of
26 people at an airport in Israel in 1972. Simultaneously, the
Beirut government ordered the deportation to Jordan of four other
members of the Japanese Red Army, an organization that was among
the world's most feared terrorist groups from the early 1970s to
the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The four deportees were immediately placed on an aircraft to
Amman, the Jordanian capital, where the government said without
further explanation that it had agreed to accept a Lebanese request
for assistance.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate confirmation of the whereabouts of
Okamoto, who like the other Japanese had been held in Lebanese
prisons since being arrested in 1997 on charges of being in Lebanon
illegally, forging documents and using false passports.
</P>
<P>
   The rulings on the five Japanese were handed down immediately
after a meeting of an official asylum committee headed by Lebanon's
interior minister, Michel Murr, and followed months of pressure on
Lebanon from Japan. Led by its prime minister, Keizo Obuchi, who
sent a personal emissary to Beirut late last year, Japan had sought
Lebanon's agreement to extradite the five Red Army members to Japan
for trial on charges of terrorism and offenses against the state.
</P>
<P>
   The Lebanese committee said it had decided to grant Okamoto's
request for political asylum ``because of the suffering he endured
in Israeli prisons,'' where he served 13 years of a life term for
the attack at the airport near Lod, outside Tel Aviv, on May 30,
1972. This appeared to be a reference to Okamoto's claims that he
was tortured during his time in Israeli prisons, which ended in
1985 when Israel released him as part of a prisoner exchange with
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The airport attack was considered one of the most brutal
terrorist attacks of its time. Okamoto and two other Red Army
members used machine-guns and grenades to attack passengers who had
arrived on an Air France flight from Rome. The dead included 16
Puerto Rican Roman Catholic pilgrims on a visit to the Holy Land as
well as eight Israelis. Another 74 people were injured. Israeli
police shot dead Okamoto's two Japanese accomplices.
</P>
<P>
   The four Japanese who were flown to Amman on Friday were Kazuo
Tohira, 47; Haruo Wako, 51; Masao Adachi, 59; and the only woman in
the group, Mariko Yamamoto, 59. Of the four, the one most wanted by
Japan was Wako, who was identified in the past by Japanese
anti-terrorist officials as the director of military operations for
the Red Army. All four were wanted by Japan for their links to a
series of aircraft hijackings, bombings and embassy takeovers that
occurred across Asia, the Middle East and Western Europe, mostly
during the group's heyday in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   While Lebanon presented its rulings on the five as a
humanitarian issue, domestic politics appeared to have been the
overriding concern. Okamoto, in particular, had been hailed as a
hero in Lebanon for the airport attack, which was viewed by leftist
and anti-Israeli groups not as an attack on innocent passengers but
as a strike for Arab rights. This was also the view pressed by
Okamoto, who wrote letters from prison in which said he had earned
the right, with the airport killings, to be considered ``a citizen
of all Arab countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats in Beirut said Lebanon's decision not to extradite the
five to Japan also appeared to have been influenced by increased
tensions in recent weeks between Lebanon and Israel. Prime Minister
Ehud Barak's announcement that Israel will withdraw by early July
from an occupation zone it has held in southern Lebanon since 1978
has led to an intensification of the warfare between Israeli forces
and Hezbollah, the Party of God, which has presented the Israeli
withdrawal as a triumph for its Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   With Hezbollah riding high in public opinion in Lebanon, the
Lebanese government, diplomats said, appeared not to have wanted to
incur popular displeasure by turning the five Japanese over to
Japan. Okamoto is particularly revered by Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
   Official Lebanese sensitivities may also have been heightened by
the decisions two weeks ago of Okamoto, Tohira and Yamamoto to
become Muslims and take Muslim first names. Adachi converted to
Christianity at the same time and married a Lebanese Christian
woman.
</P>
<P>
   The religious conversions all occurred days before the end of
the three-year prison terms imposed on the five Japanese for living
illegally in Lebanon expired on March 7, and were viewed in Lebanon
as a tactic to enhance the group's prospects of obtaining political
asylum in Lebanon, where the Arab population is divided roughly
equally between Muslims and Christians. The court that imposed the
prison terms after the five were discovered living in Lebanon's
Bekaa Valley in 1997 recommended that they all be deported after
serving the sentences.

COMMENTARY: `CASES THAT CRY OUT' 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ANTHONY LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, is a principal author of
the 1996 Immigration Act. He acknowledges now that it has had some
unduly harsh consequences, as in the case of the woman targeted for
deportation because she was convicted of pulling another woman's
hair. But he would like officials to handle those cases
administratively rather than have Congress amend the act.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think hardship cases are in the hundreds, not the
thousands,'' Smith said when we talked the other day. ``But I know
they are there, and I don't think those individuals should be
deported.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 act calls for the deportation of aliens here legally as
permanent residents if they have committed any of a long list of
crimes, even before the act was passed. People who were brought
here as infants and have lived here for 20 years or more have
suddenly found themselves deported to a country they do not know.
</P>
<P>
   Smith suggested two ways for the government to stop deportations
that, though required by the statute, would be inhumane.
</P>
<P>
   First, he called for the Immigration and Naturalization Service
to exercise prosecutorial discretion in hardship cases. That is,
immigration officials would simply decline to proceed with a
deportation case.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last several months the INS has been drafting
guidelines for the exercise of prosecutorial discretion. Officials
said they should be issued soon.
</P>
<P>
   But the INS argues that it would be far better to have
immigration judges formally lift deportation orders after a
hearing, as was done before 1996. They warn that merely exercising
prosecutorial discretion would leave the alien in a legal limbo,
still technically deportable and perhaps barred from re-entering
the country if she goes abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about that, Smith said the INS could deal with the problem
by flagging on its computers the name of anyone for whom discretion
had been exercised. Then officials at the border would know not to
touch that person.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Smith proposed that the attorney general use a provision
of immigration law that allows her to ``parole'' aliens into the
country for ``urgent humanitarian reasons.'' Parole, he argued,
could be used to prevent deportation as well as to allow entry. He
wrote Attorney General Janet Reno about that idea on March 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Justice Department or INS could assign one staff member to
look at these cases for parole,'' Smith said. ``He could probably
handle 10 cases a day.''
</P>
<P>
   I was struck by how Smith wanted officials to apply the law in
an expansive way. In some cases, INS officials have used the law
relentlessly, insisting on the deportation of individuals for minor
infractions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government can always do what it wants to do in hardship
cases,'' the congressman said. ``We should not let the letter of
the law get in the way of the spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   Public attention to harsh consequences of the 1996 act has been
growing. Newspapers and broadcasters around the country have told
the stories of people caught up in the deportation provisions for
minor misdeeds committed long ago. As a result, members of Congress
have introduced a number of bills to amend the statute.
</P>
<P>
   One bill, HR 1485, has 76 co-sponsors. It would provide a
hearing for aliens to seek relief from deportation if they were
convicted of crimes but sentenced to less than five years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who is chairman of the House Immigration Subcommittee,
said he would not move on that bill until he heard from Reno on his
parole idea. He is hesitant to amend the 1996 act, he said, because
loopholes might be created that let criminal aliens ``stall
deportation indefinitely.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I acknowledge that there are humanitarian cases,'' he said.
``I don't want to see them treated harshly. But I would handle them
on a case-by-case basis.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that a large number of ``hardened criminal'' aliens
were ``still slipping through the cracks'' and not being deported.
``Why not use your resources wisely?'' he asked. ``Why are they
spending their time on cases that cry out for compassion? They'll
never be able to persuade me that they can't do that.''

LIKELY NEW HEAD OF IMF OUTLINES GOALS FOR FUND 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The presumptive new leader of the International
Monetary Fund gave a general outline of his goals Friday, promising
to listen to criticism from outsiders and to make the fund ``a
cornerstone for promoting growth and stability.''
</P>
<P>
   Horst Koehler, whose way to become the IMF's managing director
was cleared when U.S. and Japanese rivals for the post dropped out
on Thursday, said he was committed to a dialogue with the U.S.
Congress, some of whose members have been sharply critical of the
fund in the past, and with the public in general.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think that it's an obligation to explain IMF policy,
better maybe than we have in the past,'' Koehler said at a
get-acquainted news conference at the fund headquarters here.
</P>
<P>
   The fund was founded in 1946 to promote economic stability
around the world, partly through loans to countries in need. From
time to time, it has been accused of straying from its original
mission and trying ineffectually to bring about profound social
changes.
</P>
<P>
   Koehler's remarks came just 10 days after a study commissioned
by Congress recommended that the fund and its sister organization,
the World Bank, be trimmed back. The commission further suggested
that the fund emphasize short-term, emergency aid to countries as
opposed to trying to effect profound social changes, like relieving
poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a question, Koehler said Friday that he would try
to keep the IMF focused on ``crisis prevention'' in individual
countries.
</P>
<P>
   On an especially sensitive subject, Russia, Koehler said he was
``open for a constructive dialogue'' with Russia's acting
president, Vladimir Putin, whom he met in December, and was willing
to give him the benefit of the doubt.
</P>
<P>
   The fund has met political resistance in Russia and has
repeatedly delayed disbursing its funds there. Moreover, the
institution that Koehler is leaving to head the IMF, the European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development, has had a series of bad
loans in Russia under Koehler's watch.
</P>
<P>
   Taking care not to appear over-confident, even though most of
the representatives of the fund's 182 member nations have signaled
their support for him, Koehler said he was ``honored by this
expression of confidence.'' He said he had had fruitful discussions
with Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and with Stanley Fischer,
the deputy managing director who was in the running for the
directorship.
</P>
<P>
   Koehler praised Fischer's ``intellectual brilliance and
experience'' and said he was pleased that Fischer had said he would
stay at the agency. The other man Koehler beat out was Eisuke
Sakakibara, a former Japan finance ministry official.
</P>
<P>
   Alluding to the weeks of controversy in which he emerged as the
top contender after the United States rejected German's first
choice, Caio Koch-Weser, Koehler said, ``I agree that this process
was really not the best I could imagine.''

EMC GAINS LUCRATIVE FOR EXECUTIVES, TOO, PROXY SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shares in data-storage maker EMC Corp. have more than doubled
over the past year as e-commerce companies have snapped up its
products. Among the biggest winners: EMC's top executives, who
received stock-option awards based on EMC's share price before the
run-up.
</P>
<P>
   EMC last year gave its co-founder and chairman Richard J. Egan
options for 474,300 shares in the Hopkinton, Mass. company, while
chief executive Michael C. Ruettgers was given 280,000 options,
according to the company's proxy filing to the US Securities &AMP;
Exchange Commission Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The document values the options based on EMC's price of $63.3125
on July 21. Assuming a 10 percent appreciation rate in coming
years, Egan's grant was worth $47.8 million and Ruettgers' was
worth $28.3 million, according to the filing.
</P>
<P>
   But both stakes would be worth more than twice those amounts
based on EMC's closing price Friday of $128.75; shares reached a
high of $132.125 earlier this month. The options are exercisable
over a multi-year period.
</P>
<P>
   Ruettgers also received a salary of $800,586, payments worth
about $70,000, and a bonus of $1.3 million tied to the company's
success meeting profitability goals, according to the filing.
</P>
<P>
   Egan received a bonus of $663,200, according to the filing, and
consulting and life insurance payouts worth $538,243. He transfered
the options he gained last year to a family trust.
</P>
<P>
   Few shareholders might complain so far, given the rise in the
company's total valuation as it rides a wave of interest in
Internet infrastructure. Based on Friday's closing price EMC was
worth $134 billion, the highest valuation of any public company in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   EMC dominates the market for ``Enterprise Data Storage,'' the
disk-drive systems that allow corporate computers to access vast
amounts of information and share it among many desktop PCs.
</P>
<P>
   These systems are in high demand from companies trying to create
e-commerce systems and applications. While the Internet sector is
seen as risky, EMC has attracted a broad following essentially as a
building-block maker for the new economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an insatiable demand for storage, and there aren't a
lot of companies that can fill that demand,'' said SunTrust
Equitable Securities analyst Mark Kelleher. He rates EMC a ``strong
buy.'' ``They've pretty well dominated the market'' by investing
heavily in research, he said.
</P>
<P>
   EMC's competitors include IBM Corp. and Hitachi for large
customer. IBM has been heavily promoting its system, known as
`Shark,' recently; Friday, however, analyst Gary Helmig of
SoundView Technology Group reported IBM will delay by up to six
months some software improvements to its Shark system. (IBM said
the upgrades will be available sooner to some customers.)
</P>
<P>
   Last year EMC bought Westborough-based Data General Corp. for
$1.05 billion in an effort to expand its sales of data-systems to
mid-sized businesses.
</P>
<P>
   EMC has set a revenue target of $12 billion by 2001. Last year
it earned $1.18 billion on revenue of $6.72 billion.

COURT BARS SOFTWARE THAT DEFEATS ANTI-PORN FILTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Opponents of a popular Internet filtering program say they won't
be stopped by a federal court order to stop promoting a method for
bypassing the software.
</P>
<P>
   Cyber Patrol of Framingham, Mass., a division of toymaker Mattel
Inc., obtained a temporary restraining order against computer
experts in Canada and Sweden who figured out a way to defeat Cyber
Patrol software. Cyber Patrol is used to block out access to
Internet sites that feature violent, prejudiced, or
sexually-explicit content.
</P>
<P>
   Many homes and schools use Cyber Patrol and similar products to
prevent children from visiting pornographic Web sites. Cyber Patrol
blocks Internet pages based on a list of unacceptable sites
included with the software. This list has been encrypted, so that a
user can't see exactly which sites are considered unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   But a number of Internet activists are opposed to all efforts to
restrict access. Two of them, Eddy Jansson of Sweden and Matthew
Skala of Canada, managed to decipher Cyber Patrol's list of blocked
Internet sites and publish it. The two also created a program that
allows users to bypass Cyber Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for Cyber Patrol went to federal court in Boston,
charging that the cracking of their software amounted to a
copyright violation. On Friday, Judge Edward Harrington issued a
temporary restraining order forcing the two men and their Internet
providers to stop distributing the material. On March 27,
Harrington will consider whether to issue a preliminary injunction
against the activists.
</P>
<P>
   But supporters of the two men say they'll sidestep the judge's
order by setting up copies of the information on ``mirror sites'' _
Internet servers based outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if Cyber Patrol is successful in shutting down the
original site in Sweden, they will not be able to shut down all
mirror sites around the world,'' said Bennett Haselton, operator of
the anti-censorship Web site Peacefire.org.

PROBE OF GARDNER ART THEFT CONTINUES, 10 YEARS LATER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHEN KURKJIAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Ten years ago today (March 18), two men disguised as
Boston Police officers forced their way into the Isabella Stuart
Gardner Museum two hours after midnight and pulled off the greatest
art theft in modern history.
</P>
<P>
   In less than 90 minutes, 13 pieces of art, including paintings
and sketches by Rembrandt, Vermeer, Degas, and Manet, were ripped
from their frames or the walls. The thieves then vanished into the
rainy night.
</P>
<P>
   Although hundreds of FBI agents have worked on the case
throughout the decade, running down leads from Boston to Japan,
investigators say they see no sign of a significant break in the
baffling case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The work is steady, but I am not personally looking for a
near-term solution as much as we'd all love to see it,'' said US
Attorney Donald K. Stern Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always said this case will be solved with 80 percent of
hard work, and 20 percent of luck,'' he said. ``We've doing the
hard work, now we're looking for a little bit of luck.''
</P>
<P>
   But the man who tantalized authorities in the summer of 1997 by
insisting he could facilitate the return of the artwork says Stern
ought not look to him for help _ unless and until his conditions
are met.
</P>
<P>
   William P. Youngworth III, a hard-luck antiques dealer who is
serving the final months of a three-year prison sentence for
possession of a stolen vehicle, wants museum and federal officials
to acknowledge that he was prosecuted for that crime only to force
his cooperation on the Gardner case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am willing to engage in a dialogue with them on what I know,
but before that happens I want to be restored to the station of
life I was in before they tried to break me,'' Youngworth said in
an interview at Southeastern Correctional Center in Bridgewater.
``At the very least that means an apology.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials rejected Youngworth's request for an apology,
noting that the case had been prosecuted by the Norfolk County
District Attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   Having rarely spoken publicly about the investigation, the
museum and authorities are using the 10th anniversary of the
stunning heist to engage in a major media campaign, in hopes of
convincing someone with valuable information to step forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to appeal to people's consciences,'' said Anne Hawley,
director of the museum. ``These are major works in Western
civilization and deserve to be returned to the public. The longer
they remain missing, the more the chance that they will be damaged,
and that would be such a tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Stern and W. Thomas Cassano, the lead FBI agent on the
case, say that those who may have access to the art but fear prison
time should know that authorities have said they are willing to
work out a deal for immunity. Since the five-year criminal statute
of limitations has run out for the theft, authorities can only
prosecute those who have been hiding the artwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're willing to be flexible,'' said Cassano, the veteran FBI
agent who has supervised the investigation since days after the
theft. ``Everything is negotiable.''
</P>
<P>
   Cassano, in fact, said he has put off his retirement in hopes of
seeing the case cracked.
</P>
<P>
   Although they would not discuss details of the most active leads
being pursued, the investigators and museum officials did provide
some speculation about who was responsible for the theft and their
current whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   Cassano said the paintings probably were not stolen to help
finance some political or criminal enterprise, such as the Irish
Republican Army or a Colombian drug cartel. And he doubted that
David Houghton and Robert Donati _ two local, low-level hoodlums
whose names surfaced during the investigation _ pulled off the
heist. Both men are now dead.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Cassano believes that the job was carried out in the
belief that the artwork was insured, and that within a reasonable
length of time the museum's insurance company would offer up a
customary reward _ 5 to 10 percent of the paintings' value.
</P>
<P>
   But the museum carried no theft insurance on the priceless
artwork because the premiums were too high.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities believe that the Gardner's $1 million reward,
boosted to $5 million in 1997, must have been considered too small
to risk negotiations on such a major crime.
</P>
<P>
   As for its current whereabouts, investigators don't believe the
pieces _ particularly the most celebrated paintings, Rembrandt's
``The Storm on the Sea of Galilee'' and ``A Lady and Gentleman in
Black,'' and Vermeer's ``The Concert'' _ are hanging in some
wealthy art lover's hideaway.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they said, the centuries-old art most likely is hidden
in some warehouse, cellar, or attic, vulnerable to deterioration
from extreme heat or cold, while those who control them await the
most advantageous moment to make their interests known.
</P>
<P>
   ``My fear is what's happened to them while they've been gone,''
Hawley said. ``They've been gone for a long, long time. Too long.''

<P>
   PSKOV, Russia _ God moves in mysterious ways, except, maybe, in
Pskov, a city that has monasteries and grand churches and religious
artifacts the way Americans have remote-control clickers and
half-read copies of People magazine. This is a town where you can
stand in one square _ they call it the square of seven churches _
and see, yes, seven churches. This sort of thing a god would
appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   It suggests why the Rev. Andrei Nikolayevich Davydov was plucked
out of a parish in Latvia six years ago and deposited in Pskov, in
a troubled little church _ a church whose front door opens onto a
Soviet radio condenser factory, a church with no heat and a dirt
floor, a church used in communist times as a garage for the KGB. A
church that, when the Russian Orthodox patriarchy regained it in
1991, was found to harbor a number of skeletons in the vestibule, a
single bullet hole in each cranium.
</P>
<P>
   This was a church in a jam. But Father Andrei and the church
have turned out to be a holy union of problem and solution, of
labor and love, of canvas and _ literally _ artist.
</P>
<P>
   Every church needs a good priest. But an artist, it turned out,
was what this church needed most of all.
</P>
<P>
   In Father Andrei, 43, intense, balding and bushy-bearded, it got
both. He grew up in Moscow. His father was a philosopher and
author. But from the very start, the son was an uncommonly talented
painter.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it's just a part of my biography,'' Father Andrei said
during a long conversation over tea in a spare, white-walled studio
next to the church. ``If I were not given a chance to paint, I
would probably die.''
</P>
<P>
   He began painting landscapes and other common scenes as a child.
As a young man, he graduated from the Moscow Art Theater, the
nation's top art institute, and worked as an illustrator of
children's books. But while most artists his age honed their
talents on bowls of fruit or portraits, he was somehow drawn to
paint religious icons: saints, Madonnas, crucifixions,
resurrections _ all on lacquered wooden panels, just as in medieval
times.
</P>
<P>
   These were not just knockoffs. For the young Andrei, icon art
became an almost transcendental obsession.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turned out to be so interesting that I realized that I
needed nothing else,'' he said. ``This is a way of depicting in
human terms the secrets of God's kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   ``What strikes me about icons is this ability to create an image
of someone you're conversing with. I think all our lives are a
search for interlocutors. You decide after years of searching that
you can't talk to this person; or that person cannot talk to you.
And after more years, you finally decide that the only one you can
have a real conversation with is your God.''
</P>
<P>
   It was icons that brought Father Andrei to the church, first in
an effort to better understand his art, then as a student of the
priesthood and, finally, a dozen years ago, as a priest. As he
became closer to his subject, he said, his icons improved _ ``just
as if I'd been making Fords, I'd understand much better what goes
into cars.''
</P>
<P>
   As icons go, Father Andrei came to produce not Fords, but
Bentleys. He makes rich, luminous images on parched spruce and fir:
portraits medieval in their primitiveness, but so finely wrought
and brightly shaded that they almost leap off the wood with life.
</P>
<P>
   He became well known, if not famous, for his work. His icons
came to be in demand in some European churches. None of this had
any real impact on his career as a priest, which took him and his
wife, Marina _ Russian Orthodox priests can marry _ out of Moscow
to a tiny parish in Lithuania, then to Latvia.
</P>
<P>
   In Latvia, feelings against the nation's former Soviet occupiers
were strong, and life as a Russian priest was difficult.
Immigration officials there demanded that Father Andrei choose
between Latvia and his legal residence in Moscow. Then, in 1994, he
was offered a post in Pskov _ a tiny cathedral laid low by 74 years
of Soviet occupation, with a factory on the outside, old scaffolds
and a dirt floor on the inside, and no money to do anything about
either.
</P>
<P>
   St. John the Baptist Nativity Cathedral, as it was called, is
not your average house of worship. It dates to 1124 _ the oldest
cathedral in Pskov, one of the oldest cities in all Russia.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Eleven princes and princesses of Pskov were interred in its
walls and in a six-acre monastery added in the 1200s.
</P>
<P>
   Architecturally, it is a singular example of Russian design in
the years before Ghengis Khan swept across the steppes: compact and
simple, a white stucco box with unassuming caps on its three drums
instead of the more flamboyant and common onion domes.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Its uniqueness probably saved it. The Communists tore down all
but two monastery buildings to build the radio parts factory, but
kept up the church's exterior as a tourist site. The interior was
left to decay: under communism, the little church was a KGB garage,
a peat store and a tannery.
</P>
<P>
   That was a historical tragedy, for St. John had been lavishly
decorated in frescoes and icons of the so-called Pskov school, from
the 1100s to the 1500s, among the world's leading examples of icon
design. Pskov icons became prized for their brilliant reds and deep
greens, their blending of religious and folk art and their
delicate, elongated depictions of people and animals.
</P>
<P>
   Once there were scores. But inside the old church, nothing was
left _ not even the traditional icon-hanging wall, called an
iconostasis, which separates Orthodox church altars from the nave
where worshipers gather. The cathedral's white stucco walls were
effectively as bare as a vast untouched swath of artist's canvas.
</P>
<P>
   Which was, of course, exactly what they were.
</P>
<P>
   Father Andrei says he was not brought to Pskov for his artistic
talents. But once he saw the church, he said, he knew he had found
a life's work.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are not so many 12th-century churches in Russia, you
know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that it was totally empty _ no frescoes, no iconostasis _
meant that I had to work here,'' he said. ``Had there been old
frescoes, there would have been a question of restoration, of how
to do some things. But this was an offer I could not turn down.''
</P>
<P>
   His art has proved to be the decaying church's other savior. To
buy and install an insulated spruce floor, Father Andrei produced
an intricate gold-on-copper icon for a Belgian church. A school of
iconography, now housed in the nave, produces other paintings that
are sold to finance renovations. Growing interest among Pskov's
elite has led the city to donate 30,000 rubles _ about $1,000 _ for
double-pane glass in the cathedral's 49 windows. A pine balcony,
the choir's home, has risen in the rear, up a flight of impossibly
steep 900-year-old stairs.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, icons and frescoes are reappearing. Father Andrei
and his family make their own paints from original materials,
hand-grinding lapis lazuli, malachite and cinnabar on glass plates
into deep blues and greens and reds _ big grains for bright colors,
fine dust for soft ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I use synthetic paints,'' he said, ``I don't get the same
crystalline structure and the icon doesn't reflect light the same
way. With paints I could buy, this blue'' _ he pointed to the
lining of a saint's robe _ ``would be black in the darkness of the
church. But with these paints, just with a candle, it's deep and
beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   The iconostasis, a glowing work in progress, already boasts
life-size portraits of Mary and Jesus, smaller depictions of John
and a Pskovian princess who founded the church, and the beginnings
of 12 icons depicting Christian holidays. On the left wall, in
recesses over tombs of early royalty, are two frescoes of biblical
scenes; on the right wall, another fresco shows the church's
founding, some of which can be seen on the Internet at
www.geocities.com/Paris/Pavilion/8345/english.html.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   St. John is by no means the only Pskov site with new icons.
Across the Velikaya River, the Mirozhsky monastery, also in
disrepair, has turned an abandoned building into a showcase of new
icon art; a church some 25 miles down the road has a flourishing
school of icon painting. Pskov's art museum is a center of icon
restoration.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   There are lot of blank walls still to fill: this city of 200,000
has 56 cathedrals built in or before the 17th century, less than
half of them open.
</P>
<P>
   A challenge for some ambitious artist, perhaps, but not for
Father Andrei, whose own church remains largely an untouched
canvas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's for my entire life,'' he said. ``I could be finished here
in a month. ``But I'm in no hurry at all.''

<P>
   The partnership announced last week between General Motors and
Fiat opens a window for the return of Alfa Romeo to the United
States. Until it withdrew in 1995, the Italian sports car maker was
best known for two-seat convertibles like the Duetto that Dustin
Hoffman drove in ``The Graduate.''
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, Alfa Romeo, which is part of Fiat, still sells a
sporty two-seat Spider convertible, as well as other models. Its
156, a successful small sport sedan, was voted Europe's 1998 Car of
the Year by auto journalists.
</P>
<P>
   This month, at the Geneva auto show, the company introduced its
156 Sportwagon, which goes on sale in Italy this month.
</P>
<P>
   The Alfisti, as Alfa enthusiasts are known, would love to see
these cars come to the United States. ``They are fantastic
vehicles,'' said Vic Cerami, chapter president of the Long Island
Alfa Romeo Owners Club. ``There is definitely an opening for
entry-level Italian sports cars here.'' But while reimporting Alfa
is under consideration at Fiat, it seems but a footnote to the
multibillion-dollar GM-Fiat agreement.
</P>
<P>
   As announced in Turin last week, GM will acquire 20 percent of
Fiat Auto in exchange for $2.4 billion of GM stock, which will make
Fiat the largest single shareholder of GM, with a 5.1 percent
stake. GM will also have the right to make an offer in the future
for the remaining 80 percent of Fiat Auto.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies will coordinate behind the scenes to cut costs
while continuing to be rivals in the marketplace. Fiat Auto's
European brands, including Fiat, Alfa Romeo and Lancia, compete
with the Opel and Vauxhall brands of GM.
</P>
<P>
   Each company brings different strengths to the partnership.
Fiat, the world's sixth-largest carmaker, has a strong line of
small cars, builds well-regarded transmissions and engines,
particularly small diesels, and is a market leader in Latin
America. GM, the world's largest car company, can offer products
that Fiat lacks, like a small pickup for Latin America; finance and
marketing expertise; and the ability to generate cost savings
through combined puchasing, finance and research operations.
</P>
<P>
   A common small-car platform _ with the potential to be the
world's biggest seller _ is a possibility by mid-decade, according
to a presentation Fiat made last week to securities analysts. Fiat
and GM said annual savings from the partnership could reach $1.2
billion after three years and $2 billion by the fifth year.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership also makes it possible for Fiat to consider
bringing Alfa back to the United States, where low sales could not
justify an independent dealer network. Access to GM's dealers
changes that equation.
</P>
<P>
   Paolo Vannini, a Fiat spokesman in New York, said the Spider
could come in 2003. The 156 does not meet American standards, but
the next-generation car could be designed with the United States in
mind.
</P>
<P>
   But distributing Alfa Romeos ``isn't even on the radar screen,''
a spokesman for GM, Tony Cervone, said. He said other parts of the
agreement were on the front burner.
</P>
<P>
   One barrier is choosing an appropriate partner among the GM
brands. ``I think the hardest part is coming up with a coherent,
sensible way to get the cars out,'' said Jim Hall, an analyst with
AutoPacific Group, a consulting firm. He said the logical partners
were Saab or Oldsmobile, GM's most internationally focused brands,
but neither would make a perfect fit with Alfa.
</P>
<P>
   Two other Fiat nameplates, Ferrari and Maserati, are unaffected
by the partnership since they are part of the larger Fiat Group _
and are not under the umbrella of Fiat Auto.
</P>
<P>
   Maserati, which left the United States in 1990, will return next
year with two models: the $70,000-and-up 3200 GT coupe, currently
on sale in Europe, and an all-new Spider, which will cost slightly
more. They will be sold by Ferrari dealers. &QL;

WHEN YOU ARE FIRST, AND STILL YOU DON'T SUCCEED  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 19) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are two tenets of unshakable faith in all management
bibles of the New Economy. One is that being the ``first mover''
into a market is a huge advantage. Get there first, as Amazon did,
and all the self-reinforcing ``network effects'' of the modern
economy work to your benefit.
</P>
<P>
   It may not guarantee permanent leadership, but it makes life
awfully difficult for the second, third and fourth movers.
</P>
<P>
   The second, related tenet is that the future belongs to the big
risk takers. Fear of failure is for losers. The American
entrepreneurial edge is that business failure carries none of the
stigma it bears in other nations. Failure here is a useful learning
experience, increasing the chances of success next time.
</P>
<P>
   What, then, to make of Iridium?
</P>
<P>
   The global satellite phone system, which cost $5 billion to
build, has been languishing in bankruptcy since last fall. On
Friday, Iridium asked the bankruptcy court for permission to shut
down completely, liquidate its ground assets and spend up to $50
million over the next nine months to ``deorbit'' its 66 satellites,
sending them hurtling into the Earth's atmosphere to burn up.
</P>
<P>
   Dreamed up in the mid-1980s by engineers at Motorola, its
creator and largest investor, Iridium was certainly a first mover
and a bold risk-taking project. Yet it is nobody's idea of a noble
failure; words like fiasco are more often heard. What are the
lessons in the Iridium experience?
</P>
<P>
   First, the project was fundamentally different from the kinds of
business ventures that turn heads today in the Internet economy.
Iridium really was a bold bet on the future, while most Internet
ventures are not.
</P>
<P>
   The ``network effects'' work so predictably on the Internet
because the network is in place. Iridium, by contrast, had to build
a network of ground stations and launch its satellites into orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Further, as a technology, the Internet is totally mainstream.
Most Internet start-ups today are built on a blend of incremental
innovations in software and the pursuit of some market niche. If
one venture fails, it is easy to move on to the next, refining the
software a bit and going after a different market. This is not
visionary risk-taking or innovation.
</P>
<P>
   Big corporations are embracing Internet technology for the same
reason _ because it is an important tool for overhauling the way
they do business, not because it requires much real risk-taking.
</P>
<P>
   Iridium was at the other end of the spectrum, a giant long-range
gamble on an unproven technology. For Paul Saffo, director of the
Institute for the Future, it calls to mind a cowboy adage: never
mistake a clear view for a short distance.
</P>
<P>
   In the post-mortems written on Iridium since its filing for
bankruptcy protection last August, Motorola's hapless management of
the project has come in for great criticism. Saffo agrees that
management matters, but he said its role in big, pioneering,
technology efforts tended to be overstated. Mostly, he said,
Motorola bet too early on the wrong technology: ``They zigged and
the world zagged.''
</P>
<P>
   Iridium's litany of troubles by now are well known. Everything
proved more costly than anticipated, from launching the satellites
to making the handsets, which cost $3,000 apiece when the system
went live in November 1998. The cost later fell by half, but too
late to do much good. The equipment was clunky, with handsets the
size of bricks and antennas like billy clubs. The hoped-for
millions of customers never signed up. Iridium now has 55,000
subscribers and debts of about $4.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   While Iridium sputtered, ground-based wireless phone service
grew at astounding rates in Europe, Asia and the United States.
Business travelers, the main market for Iridium's global service,
soon found that they could simply use their cell phones in major
cities around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kleeman, a former consultant at the Boston Consulting
Group who is a founder of a telecommunications start-up, said
Iridium was blindsided by the rapid growth of ground-based
competition. For its part, Iridium was dependent on its local
partners around the world, 28 traditional telephone companies and
government-owned post, telephone, and telegraph monopolies, known
as PTTs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iridium can be seen as the last gasp of the government
telecommunications cartels, the last of the big telecommunications
consortia tightly tied to the PTTs,'' Kleeman said. ``And Iridium
had the old mentality _ `Build it and we'll force people to use it'
_ as opposed to, ``Is there a market for this anyway?'''
</P>
<P>
   It is also instructive to ask, what is the (italics)wrong(end
italics) lesson to learn from Iridium's failure? ``The lesson you
don't want to learn is that satellite telephony is a bad idea,''
said Peter Schwartz, chairman of the Global Business Network, a
consulting firm. ``Iridium was a radical new system that leapt into
commercial use too soon.''

Whether the oil cartel continues on this course will touch directly
on American wallets and politics, by determining just what kinds of

surprising that serious scientists and researchers have begun to
explore darker, less inviting visions of the future. A look at some

   COACHES-MIKES-REVIEW (Undated) _ The never-ending rush for
``inside access'' to sports personalities hit a speed bump last
week: Several NBA coaches risked fines by refusing a league edict
to wear microphones during games. Their reasoning was that as much
as fans would love to hear snippets of how they sketched out that
last pick-and-roll or lit a fire under a sullen superstar, some
parts of their jobs can't be done properly with the specter of
millions of eavesdroppers. Rather than embrace what the media can
do for them, they fear what it can do TO them. By Alan Schwarz.
</P>
<P>
   L.A.-TRANSFORM-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ The sale of the Los
Angeles Times drove home the reality that Los Angeles' old civic
architecture has been largely dismantled in recent years, with no
one quite sure what will replace it. By selling its company, the
Chandler family seemed to acknowledge that it no longer had a stake
in a city it helped build, and that _ no longer dominated by a
white majority, shorn of most of its old-line corporate giants, and
whose public school students predominantly speak English as a

<P>
   MOST-WANTED-REVIEW (Washington) _ The FBI marked the 50th
anniversary of its 10 Most Wanted list with of pride and purpose,
and a touch of nostalgia. Of 458 people who have made the list, 429
have been caught, with several choosing to go down shooting it out
with their would-be captors. Cases against 15 people who were never
caught were eventually dropped, and another 4 fugitives were
removed from the list because others were deemed more deserving. A
look at some of the more famous cases. By David Stout.

<P>
   GASOLINE-MOTORISTS-REVIEW (Detroit) _ Car drivers probably feel
avenged when they see a hulking sport utility vehicle lumber up to
a gas station. Every bing and clank from the pump is another
reminder of the higher cost of filling a gas guzzler: up to $70 for
the biggest models. But higher gas prices actually hurt car owners
as much _ or more _ than SUV owners, who tend to have higher higher
incomes. By Keith Bradsher.

   CENSUS-RACE-REVIEW (Washington) _ The U.S. racial and ethnic mix

   BRITAIN-FITNESS-REVIEW (London) _ Even among the Britons who go
to health clubs to work out, there is often a lackadaisical
attitude toward fitness and health. Most of the truly
body-conscious gym-goers are foreigners. Most Britons would freely
confess that they don't care much about their physiques, and that
they don't want to give up the sort of habits that would upset the
U.S. surgeon general. Just as it is no surprise that many Americans
are clinically obese, it is no surprise that, by many standards,
Britons are stunningly unhealthy, and proud of it. By Sarah Lyall.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-TAIWAN-ARMS-REVIEW _ There's been much talk of war between
China and Taiwan recently, but the rhetoric obscures the fact that
military preparations remain modest in both countries and are
likely to stay that way. While China has slightly beefed up its
arsenal against Taiwan, there has been no dramatic increase in
spending that would signal a shift toward a war economy, since
China is not yet willing to risk the cost to its economic growth.
That may explain the increase in saber-rattling. By Craig Smith.
</P>
<P>
   IRAN-TENSIONS-REVIEW _ After 21 stressful years of living under
the clerical dictatorship imposed by the Islamic revolution that
overthrew the shah, most Iranians would happily settle for a more
normal life. But last week, just as they were celebrating the
reformist landslide in February's parliamentary elections and the
hope it brought of a peaceful progression towards a more democratic
society, an assassin's bullet on a Tehran street provided a
shocking reminder of how grim and uncertain a struggle may yet lie
ahead. By John F. Burns.

<P>
   POPE-MUSLIMS-REVIEW (Rome) _ When Pope John Paul II goes to the
Middle East this week to begin a Holy Year pilgrimage to retrace
the steps of Jesus, he will pursue his longtime dream of
reconciling Christians and Muslims after centuries of hostility and
mistrust. A look at the history of relations between the Catholic
Church and Islam. By Alessandra Stanley.

   IRAN-TENSIONS-REVIEW _ After 21 stressful years of living under
the clerical dictatorship imposed by the Islamic revolution that
overthrew the shah, most Iranians would happily settle for a more
normal life. But last week, just as they were celebrating the
reformist landslide in February's parliamentary elections and the
hope it brought of a peaceful progression towards a more democratic
society, an assassin's bullet on a Tehran street provided a
shocking reminder of how grim and uncertain a struggle may yet lie
ahead. By John F. Burns.

<P>
   POPE-MUSLIMS-REVIEW (Rome) _ When Pope John Paul II goes to the
Middle East this week to begin a Holy Year pilgrimage to retrace
the steps of Jesus, he will pursue his longtime dream of
reconciling Christians and Muslims after centuries of hostility and
mistrust. A look at the history of relations between the Catholic
Church and Islam. By Alessandra Stanley.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ If you had walked into an Olds dealership five years
ago, you would have seen the same familiar nameplates: Ninety
Eight, Eighty Eight, Cutlass Supreme, Ciera. These were mostly your
father's Oldsmobiles.
</P>
<P>
   You would also have seen a decidedly different car, the Aurora.
Introduced as a 1995 model, this was an all-new, radically styled
sedan intended to signal a profound change in direction for Olds, a
General Motors division that had lost its way.
</P>
<P>
   Known in the '40s and '50s for innovative engineering, Olds
captured the public's imagination in the '60s and '70s with its
powerful 4-4-2 and innovative front-drive Toronado. By the
mid-1980s, the division was selling more than a million cars a
year; its Cutlass Supreme was one of America's favorites.
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, Olds was a shadow of its former self; its sales
had fallen by two-thirds. In desperation, GM decided that
Oldsmobile would zero in on affluent buyers who were opting for
imports.
</P>
<P>
   The '95 Aurora was the first stab at fulfilling that tall order.
In its wake, Olds has built an entirely new lineup. The old cars
are gone, replaced by the compact Alero and the midsize Intrigue,
which both borrowed watered-down styling cues from the Aurora. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now Olds has a second-generation Aurora, a 2001 model that went
on sale in January 2000. Import shoppers are still the target; Olds
hopes to sell 40,000 Auroras annually. The '99 model found just
20,000 buyers.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the least expensive Aurora is now $6,000 cheaper
than the '99 model, on which GM had to offer large discounts. And
the styling, though it still has the horizontal headlamps and
sloping hood of the original love-it-or-hate-it design, has gone
conservative. The distinctive wide, rounded rump is now a
conventional Taurus-like design with individual taillamps flanking
the trunk lid.
</P>
<P>
   When Olds first displayed the new Aurora, at the New York auto
show last year, it seemed like yet another plain-vanilla GM car,
handsome enough not to offend but not stylish enough to turn heads.
So I was surprised at the attention the production version got on a
road test in Michigan. During a particularly hectic week of social
engagements, every valet who parked the car commented positively.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't believe how many people wanted a look at this
car,'' confided the attendant at a steakhouse near Ford
headquarters in Dearborn.
</P>
<P>
   Another change intended to attract more buyers is a choice of
engines. The Aurora 4.0 has an updated, 250-horsepower version of
the dual-cam V-8 that made its debut in the original Aurora. This
engine, a smaller version of Cadillac's famous Northstar, now runs
on regular gas, not just premium.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a V-6, and in contrast to the old pushrod power
plants used by two Aurora cousins, the Pontiac Bonneville and Buick
LeSabre, the Aurora 3.5 has the sophisticated twin-cam,
215-horsepower engine that made its debut last year in the
Intrigue. Both engines are coupled with electronic four-speed
automatic transmissions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 3.5 V-6 is surprisingly peppy, and its lighter weight means
the car feels better balanced between front and rear, so the
handling is more nimble. If I were buying an Aurora, I'd opt for
the 3.5. The V-8 is faster, but it is also $4,000 more expensive
and less fuel-efficient at a time when higher gas prices make a
difference.
</P>
<P>
   The front-drive Aurora rides on an entirely different
architecture than the previous model, which shared its basic
structure with the Buick Riviera, since discontinued. The more
rigid foundation should result in better crash protection and
higher quality, with fewer squeaks and rattles. While those
benefits are yet to be proved, I can attest to the quietness of the
car, which seemed nearly as hushed as a Lexus.
</P>
<P>
   The new structure also results in a car that is 6 inches shorter
than its predecessor and has a smaller trunk and noticeably less
legroom. Front-seat passengers complained that they felt cramped,
with a seat that could not be moved back far enough. Perhaps that
was by design; already, the rear-seat passengers have limited
legroom. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although it is still a full-size car, the Aurora has shed a
couple hundred pounds. Olds hopes the smaller dimensions, lighter
weight and greater agility will appeal to women. Indeed, I found
the car easier to park and far more pleasant to drive than the last
Aurora.
</P>
<P>
   While this is a car aimed at people who like to drive, some of
my passengers felt overlooked. My daughter protested that she
couldn't take charge of the radio or climate controls, which are
are on a section of the dash angled toward the driver.
</P>
<P>
   Despite my passengers' complaints, the cabin seemed competitive,
in terms of design, quality and quietness, with competitors like
the Lexus ES300, the Acura TL and RL, and the Lincoln LS.
</P>
<P>
   Trimmed in real walnut, rich leather and soft-touch surfaces,
the Aurora also has plenty of amenities. Standard features include
a driver information center with 27 functions; a power driver's
seat, an audio system with a CD player; keyless entry; side air
bags and daytime running lights. The 4.0 model also has 17-inch
wheels, separate climate controls for driver and passenger and
traction- and stability-control systems.
</P>
<P>
   The 3.5 starts at $30,800, including the shipping charge; the
4.0 is $34,975. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although I initially thought the styling lacked distinction, I
was surprised by how much I enjoyed driving the new Aurora. In the
end, even the look had grown on me. &QL;
</P>

MILWAUKEE PRELATE FINDS HARMONY IN APOLOGY TO JEWS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wis., Pa.)  (lb) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ In the living room of the 19th-century brick house
that serves as the residence of Archbishop Rembert G. Weakland
stands a studio grand piano, with sheets of Chopin waltzes spread
out above the keys.
</P>
<P>
   For a visitor, it is a reminder that the archbishop, the
spiritual head of nearly 700,000 Roman Catholics in southern
Wisconsin, was recently notified by Columbia University in New York
that he will soon receive his doctorate in music, completing a
degree he began working on in the 1950s and then halted, only to
resume a few years ago. His first music teacher, a nun at a
parochial school in Pennsylvania, would no doubt have been proud.
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday morning the talk turns from music to the spoken
word _ to two highly unusual homilies, one given by Pope John Paul
II last Sunday, the other four months earlier by Weakland. Both
were apologies for errors committed by Catholics against others.
</P>
<P>
   While the pope's remarks were broad and were timed for the first
Sunday in Lent, the archbishop was more specific, directing his
statements to Jews, in Milwaukee and elsewhere. Speaking in a local
synagogue last Nov. 7, Weakland said that conversion, the change of
attitude that precedes an effort to change one's life and society,
must include acknowledgment of wrongdoing, a request for
forgiveness and a resolve to reform.
</P>
<P>
   Both the timing of the speech and its ``interactive quality,''
in which the archbishop asked the Catholics who were listening to
say ``amen'' as he made his points, marked the occasion as a major
event, said Rabbi A. James Rudin, interreligious affairs director
of the American Jewish Committee. ``That Nov. 7 speech electrified
the Jewish community, not only in Milwaukee but throughout the
United States,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although other prelates have since offered apologies (notably
Cardinal Bernard Law, archbishop of Boston, and Cardinal Roger
Mahony, archbishop of Los Angeles), Weakland's homily ``was the
first of the millennial season, of the run-up to the year 2000,''
Rudin said.
</P>
<P>
   In his homily last November, Weakland said that ``we Catholics''
had acted ``contrary to God's law'' in dealings with Jews in the
past, that the Jewish community had been harmed as a result, and
that by preaching ``that the Jewish people were unfaithful,
hypocritical and God-killers,'' Catholics had reduced Jews' human
dignity. And that, he said, ``contributed to attitudes that made
the Holocaust possible.'' He called on members of both faiths to
work together to heal the world.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Weakland said: ``The ideas of apologies for the
past are difficult. We have only the sense of personal sin and
personal guilt.'' But he added that he did not think people could
move ahead unless they regarded themselves as part of a group and
were responsible for its actions. ``Otherwise,'' he said, ``the
fear remains that history will repeat.''
</P>
<P>
   Weakland said he did not want to be accusatory. But neither is
he finished with this process. He plans apologies to
African-Americans and probably to others as well. These must be
made on appropriate occasions, he said, lest the intent of the
message be lost and the apology be reduced to mere words.
</P>
<P>
   In a larger sense, he said, he sees the major religions as
standing at a unique juncture in history, when modern
communications have brought them into much closer proximity than
ever. ``How much must we hold in common in order to live in
common?'' he asked, adding that what religions contribute
positively to society will depend in part on how their members
cooperate with one another.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1977, when Pope Paul VI appointed him to the
archdiocese here, Weakland found an interfaith group already
established. His homily last November was timed for its 25th
anniversary. ``I was talking to a group that knew each other well,
that I knew well,'' he said, responding to a question about why he
had felt he could be more specific in his remarks than the pope
would be later. ``The pope had to be general, because he's talking
to the whole church,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Weakland has become known for a certain
outspokenness, perhaps more obvious now that the United States'
Catholic hierarchy, in its annual meetings, seems far more cautious
than it was a decade ago, when the bishops issued major pastoral
statements on peace and the economy.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Weakland said he could recall no single
instance that persuaded him he needed to preach the apology. But
then he recalled a trip that he made with parishioners to Poland in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting the city of Krakow, he said, they saw a wall with
anti-Semitic graffiti. When he asked a guide why the statements
were not painted over, she replied that whoever did it would just
put them up again. ``I had a feeling that what caused the Holocaust
was not completely over,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The archbishop will turn 73 in April. He became a Benedictine
monk at 22 and was ordained a priest two years later. He was, for a
time in his 30s, a music teacher at a Catholic college.
</P>
<P>
   His roots lie in Pennsylvania coal country, where he was one of
six children in a family that received public assistance. ``The
only possessions the family had,'' he said, ``were an upright piano
and 10 volumes of music.'' He tinkered at the keys, but it was his
fourth-grade teacher _ the nun _ who really taught him how to play.
</P>
<P>
   Is there any relationship between playing music and the
awareness that one needs to apologize for errors? Well, yes,
Weakland replied. Music, especially pieces like those that Mozart
composed, can be very difficult to get right. ``You realize that no
human being is perfect,'' he said.

 PRIMARY RESULTS SHOW GORE DISADVANTAGE IN SOUTHERN NUMBERS GAME   
 By CARL HULSE and SEAN LOUGHLIN  
NYT Regional Newspapers  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Al Gore underscored his plan to make a bold stand
in the South by visiting Florida Tuesday to await the presidential
primary returns. But those same results give ample evidence of the
daunting task the Democrat faces in trying to pry Southern states
away from Republican George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans voted in larger numbers than Democrats in four of
the five Southern states that held primaries _ Florida, Louisiana,
Texas, Tennessee and Mississippi _ demonstrating the strength of
the GOP base.
</P>
<P>
   In total, about 2.3 million Republicans trooped to the polls to
vote in what were perfunctory elections given the absence of
serious opposition to either Bush or Gore. In comparison, about 1.8
million Democrats voted. Only in Louisiana did Democrats outnumber
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans are simply more energized,'' said GOP Chairman Al
Cardenas of Florida, where about 700,000 Republicans out-polled
586,000 Democrats despite a Democratic edge in overall
registration.
</P>
<P>
   Gore nevertheless vowed he would mount a charge on the regional
Republican stronghold, declaring in Tallahassee that ``this Son of
the South'' would keep ``fighting for every vote and every state.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, most analysts put certain segments of the South off
limits to Democrats _ Alabama, Mississippi and South Carolina
particularly. The best Gore can probably hope to do is pick off
Tennessee and possibly another state or two, targeting Georgia,
Florida and perhaps Louisiana though the latter's proximity to
Texas might make it Bush territory.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats like to note that President Clinton took Louisiana
twice, Georgia in 1992 and Florida in 1996, giving hope to Gore.
But in those races, Clinton got help from Ross Perot, who siphoned
votes away from Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   A HEARTBEAT AWAY
</P>
<P>
   With the presidential nominations settled, speculation now turns
to the question of running mates. Although selections are not
usually announced until the respective party conventions, that
hasn't stopped supporters and pundits from throwing out a host of
names as vice presidential material.
</P>
<P>
   A number of Southerners figure into the talk. On the Democratic
side, Sen. Bob Graham of Florida is viewed as a contender because
of his popularity in a key electoral state. Democrats believe his
selection could cause Republicans to spend time and money in
Florida where Gov. Jeb Bush was expected to easily deliver the
state for his older brother, George.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, North Carolina Gov. Jim Hunt, who is retiring this
year, remains enormously popular in what is otherwise a
Republican-leaning state. While unlikely, his selection could again
force Bush to spend more time in a state he probably figured he
could take for granted. Former Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia could bring
foreign policy and defense expertise.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, retiring Sen. Connie Mack of Florida has
been touted as a contender, but that's seen as a long shot because
Bush already has a strong Florida connection through his brother.
Sen. Fred Thompson of Tennessee, who was a McCain supporter, could
help the Texas governor reach out to moderate and independent
voters.
</P>
<P>
   MOBILE HOME LAW IMPROVEMENTS
</P>
<P>
   Congress is advancing proposed mobile home standards that a
watchdog group says have been improved to the benefit of consumers
who rely on this popular Sunbelt housing option.
</P>
<P>
   Key House and Senate panels gave consumers a larger role in
recommending federal mobile home standards, established minimum
installation requirements and allowed states to determine whether
installers or manufacturers are responsible for fixing defects.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think there has been real progress,'' said Roy Green, a
lobbyist for AARP, which opposed an earlier proposal.
</P>
<P>
   He credited Sens. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., and John Edwards,
D-N.C., with helping negotiate the improvements. The standards have
not been upgraded since the mid-1970s and are based more on motor
vehicle laws than housing codes.
</P>
<P>
   A TAXING STORM
</P>
<P>
   This just might be the only silver lining for victims of last
year's Hurricane Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   The Internal Revenue Service will expedite tax refunds for
hurricane victims claiming loses in their 1999 tax returns. All
taxpayers must do is write ``HURRICANE FLOYD'' in red on the top of
their return and mail it to the IRS Memphis Service Center at P.O.
Box 2079 in Memphis, Tenn. The ZIP code is 38101.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is another small step towards helping our neighbors fully
recover from Floyd,'' said Rep. David Price, D-N.C. He has been
leading efforts on Capitol Hill to secure more federal aid for
eastern North Carolina, which got battered by the storm.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Did last week's stock market hubbub change anything?
Of course, the highflying Nasdaq market has suffered repeated
sinking spells but the latest one _ last week's three consecutive
triple-digit declines amounting to just under 10 percent _ was
accompanied by a revival in industrial stocks of the Old Economy.
The Dow Jones industrial average soared nearly 500 points on
Thursday, the most ever.
</P>
<P>
   This sharply divergent performance inspired much talk that
perhaps investors had finally decided technology valuations had
stretched to the breaking point. Maybe, the thinking seemed to be,
it was time to scoop up some workaday stocks that had become too
cheap to ignore any longer.
</P>
<P>
   The market's sharp reaction to a statement by President Bill
Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony Blair on biotechnology
policy seemed to demonstrate Nasdaq's fragility and make it seem
plausible that such a shift in sentiment had begun.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew W. Johnson, 34, chief trader of Nasdaq stocks for Lehman
Brothers, took some time early Friday to express his own, somewhat
different, view. Here are excerpts from the conversation:
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you think there is a sea change under way in the market? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. No. The Old Economy stocks got to levels that were way
oversold. If the move lasts more than a couple days, it's
predicting that the Fed will be out of the picture, either out
completely without raising rates next week _ which I don't think is
totally out of the question _ or will raise only one more time. I'm
sort of going against the trend. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. So the pyrotechnics were not signaling the end of Nasdaq's
ride? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Right. I think Nasdaq's short-term correction was certainly
necessary. They had moved too far, too fast. And these stocks could
consolidate, could move sideways until we see what first-quarter
earnings will look like. But every indication is that the numbers
are going to be good, in some cases very, very good for tech
stocks. It looks like our bull market continues. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. But prices in many cases are still sky-high. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The hardest part for a lot of us on Wall Street who have
taken traditional valuation measures, if you try to apply them
today you'd probably never buy a stock. I'm a believer in the new
paradigm. Traffic on the Internet is doubling every 100 days; if
you think about that, you begin to understand the magnitude of this
technology revolution and you can understand investors' willingness
to take the risks they're taking. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are investors taking on too much risk? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The brokerage community used to look at the general public as
ignorant _ not understanding companies, valuations, how the market
works. But with the Internet and the tremendous interest in stock
investing, the public has become more educated and has a stomach
that can absorb more risk than they ever have before. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is there a bubble here, with too much bought on credit? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Nothing about the market worries me except the speculation
that has been taking place within the Bulletin Board in penny
stocks. I don't consider what has taken place within Nasdaq to be
speculation. It reflects the promise of tomorrow and the belief
that this is a technology revolution that will change the world
economy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What does the biotech blowup tell us? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It reflects high valuations. Biotech has been one of the best
performers. When you have the threat of government intervention,
certainly they're vulnerable. Am I surprised by the magnitude of
the drop? No. There's a lot more talk about huge drops than the
huge gains. These things have had unbelievable moves; 12 biotech
stocks represent the entire gain in Russell 2000 this year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is the effect of huge gyrations, day trading and
skyrocketing volume, which has recently hit 2 billion shares a
day? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Sure, I imagine volatility causes some investors angst and
consternation, absolutely. But day traders add liquidity and while
some on Wall Street disdain them, it takes a lot of guts to do what
they do. And there are some good ones out there. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is there more business than can be properly handled? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. We are so busy that our technology and our people are being
pushed to the limit every day. When people ask me what will be the
catalyst, if there is one, to set this market in a spiral downward
_ which I don't think will take place _ I say we will need to pause
for awhile to give the infrastructure a chance to catch up. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. And would decimalization make the strains worse?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The investment community as a whole, including the public,
cannot handle decimalization right now. This is a 200-year-old
pricing dynamic that we're planning to change overnight _ and that
scares me.

`DESIGNER DRUGS' THE RAGE AMONG YOUNG CLUB GOERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHANIE EBBERT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A young man is slumped on the floor in the stairwell as
a woman is being dragged outside by a friend. In a throne-like
chair upstairs, a 21-year-old sinks lifeless as a ragdoll, her
abbreviated miniskirt riding up so high her white panties are
showing. Her friends try to stave off a Boston Police officer, but
by 1 a.m., she'll be hauled into the New England Medical Center,
the latest to survive an apparent drug overdose at a club.
</P>
<P>
   It's House Night at the Roxy, half past midnight. These are the
night's casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the night has just begun: A pulsing, sweating, strutting
mass of 1,400 people is throbbing in sync with techno music,
glowing with pink and blue laser sticks twirled like batons.
Dancers routinely run their hands down the backs of strangers, in
sensual yet noncommittal displays of affection.
</P>
<P>
   A patron named Jack explains: ``Everybody in here is doing
Ecstasy.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston may be a city scorned for its Puritanical tendencies and
famously early closing times, but it's a wild night in between for
those in the know. Stunned by the city's suddenly obvious market
for so-called designer drugs like Ecstasy and GHB, Boston Police
are accusing clubs like The Roxy of condoning drug use _ most
egregiously by hiring a private ambulance to wait in a back alley
and to shuttle overdosed patrons out to hospitals, rather than
alerting city emergency services.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you hire them, then you know you have a problem,'' said
Sgt. Detective Margot Hill, spokeswoman for the department.
``You're addressing a symptom instead of a problem. The problem is,
illegal drugs or dangerous drugs being purveyed on your premises.''
</P>
<P>
   Roxy owner Lou Delpidio said he hired an ambulance detail last
year, not to handle overdoses, but for minor medical emergencies
that occur in the three nightclubs and hotel sharing space in the
tightly squeezed Theatre District. He considered it unnecessary to
bring out the city's various emergency vehicles whenever someone
slipped and fell. ``Every time you call an ambulance, the fire
department comes with the ambulance and blocks up the whole
street,'' Delpidio said.
</P>
<P>
   He canceled the service last Saturday, after the police
criticized the ambulance detail publicly. Now, clubs like his are
facing greater scrutiny, as the police Bureau of Investigative
Services calls owners in to meet with public health and licensing
officials to seek cooperation on combatting designer drug use.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the issue has been fanned by a spate of
overdoses at The Roxy and the closure of the Paradise due to
licensing violations. The Roxy faces a Licensing Board hearing on
April 4, due to four nonfatal drug overdoses Feb. 13. Three men
were also arrested that weekend for dealing or possessing ecstasy
in the club.
</P>
<P>
   Delpidio, a co-owner of Il Panino restaurants, is also a
minority partner in the group trying to buy the Paradise. He
asserts that people take Ecstasy before they go out, making it
impossible for him to police or prevent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't go up to every person and say, `You look like you're
having too good a time, you have to leave,' '' Delpidio said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Boston Police sends four officers and a supervisor to a
detail at the Roxy on weekends, they've made just a handful of
arrests. Capt. Bernard O'Rourke said designer drugs are so small
and easily concealed that arrests are more difficult than with
other drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest telltale sign is the water consumption,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Which is the drink of choice at The Roxy on a Saturday night.
Most patrons are toting bottles of water, sold for $4. Alcohol
dulls the effect of Ecstasy, which itself causes dehydration and
exhaustion, so most users drink water or fruit juice. Water is also
preferred when taking GHB, since alcohol can also dramatically
increase or complicate its effects.
</P>
<P>
   Delpidio said he would do anything he can to prevent drug use in
his clubs _ he already has sting operations and just posted police
warning signs in bathrooms. Several times a night at the Roxy, a
Euro deejay offers a police-crafted public service announcement,
warning that accepting drugs dropped into drinks is dangerous, if
not deadly.
</P>
<P>
   GHB, he warns, is not cool.
</P>
<P>
   But the atmosphere would indicate otherwise. In a room charged
with sexual energy, men are taking off their shirts and women are
wearing strappy halters and barely-there skirts. For some, the
touching of strangers seems like affection for its own sake. Others
are lost in the dancing, meeting the mounting beat of the techno
music.
</P>
<P>
   Ecstasy causes seemingly contradictory effects _ high energy,
talkativeness, insomnia, and acclerated heartbeat combined with
deep relaxation and generalized happiness _ that users say puts
them in a lucid, peaceful and uninhibited state. An internal
euphoria mixes with an external emotional warmth to deliver the
nickname ``the hug drug'' and make someone feel that all is right
with the world.
</P>
<P>
   The side effects: A brutal hangover, a wringing restoration of
emotions in the ensuing hours and days, and involuntary tooth
grinding, which some combat by sucking on pacifiers or lollipops.
</P>
<P>
   The new problem, police say, is the combination with GHB, an
odorless, tasteless drug dropped into drinks that produces some
similar effects _ and, ill effects _ when combined with alcohol or
Ecstasy. Gamma Hydroxybutyric Acid (GHB), sometimes called Liquid X
or G, was first used by bodybuilders for its ability to stimulate
growth hormones, but clubgoers began using it for induced euphoria.
It's also known as ``the date-rape drug' because it can reduce
inhibitions, cause unconsciousness, and even induce a coma or
death. This week, three teenagers were convicted of killing a
15-year-old Detroit girl by spiking her soda with the drug last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Another form of the drug, Gamma Butyrolactone (GBL) _ a liquid
either clear or in shades of fluorescent yellow, green, blue or red
_ becomes GHB when metabolized in the body. It's illegal to
manufacture GBL for human consumption but it is legally sold as a
household solvent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, people misconstrue the word `legal' to mean
`safe,' said Sgt. Detective Hill.
</P>
<P>
   With disturbing frequency, the combinations have been leading to
overdoses. Four people were taken to the New England Medical Center
on Feb. 13, after ingesting drinks laced with ``Liquid G'' at the
Roxy, according to a police report. One, a 28-year-old waitress,
drank what she thought was water and was unconscious within a
half-hour. On Feb. 20, an 18-year-old woman passed out at The Roxy
and was taken to the hospital for an apparent overdose of Liquid G.
On March 5, a 21-year-old woman overdosed on GHP and ecstasy. Her
boyfriend, arrested for possession, told police he buys the drugs
inside The Roxy.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, before 1 a.m., March 12, one of the paid details
inside The Roxy tended to the 21-year-old, whose head moved side to
side as her friends tried to revive her. Eventually, she was taken
to New England Medical Center, treated for another apparent
overdose.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, a three-person EasCare Ambulance crew worked a
detail at The Roxy on Saturdays, for about $400 a night (plus a
minimum of $300 charged to each patient transported). Two
paramedics patrolled upstairs with radios.
</P>
<P>
   City officials allege the private ambulances have been used in
an effort to skirt the attention of police and licensing officials
that would follow up reports of overdoses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We track all of our calls where we see trends, whether it's
overdoses or heat emergencies or cold emergencies,'' said Richard
Serino, Boston EMS superintendent-in-chief.
</P>
<P>
   But Delpidio said he expects the problem to diminish with
increased attention.
</P>
<P>
   Even since last week, he says, ``It has gone down dramatically.
We are on the ball here and we are looking to have them arrested. I
won't put up with it.''

<P>
   When photography first arrived in the middle of the 19th century
with all its vaunted truthfulness, painters and sculptors did not
like it one bit. They were threatened. They were miffed. They were
scornful. Finally they took the matter into their own hands. They
turned photography inside out.
</P>
<P>
   Honore Daumier said, ``Photography imitates everything and
expresses nothing.'' Paul Gauguin said, ``Machines have come, art
has fled, and I am far from thinking photography can help us.''
Vincent van Gogh referred to ``the photographic and empty
perfection of certain people.''
</P>
<P>
   Photography, they suggested, was too objective and too
superficial. If people wanted that kind of perfect, mechanical
thing, then let them have it.
</P>
<P>
   But scorn of the camera did not stop some artists _ including
Pierre Bonnard, Edouard Vuillard, Constantin Brancusi, Medardo
Rosso, Edgar Degas, Edvard Munch and even Gauguin _ from dabbling
in photography. Some did it openly, others surreptitiously. (The
heirs of Gustave Moreau hid his photographs to preserve his
reputation.)
</P>
<P>
   What were these artists doing with the rival medium? Were they
trying to sneak a peek at a reality that was more accurate than the
one they saw with the naked eye?
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, yes. ``The Artist and the Camera: Degas to
Picasso,'' an exhibition at the Dallas Museum of Art, surveys a
dozen artists who used photography to further their art. Degas
copied dancers and horses from photographs _ his own and those of
Eadweard Muybridge. Bonnard's intimate paintings, cropped in odd
ways, look as if they had borrowed something from his family
snapshots. Artists, it seemed, though outwardly suspicious of
photography, didn't mind taking cues about reality from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a doubt the commonplace view of photography ever since
its inception ... is that it records a moment of reality as it
actually appeared,'' writes Martin Jay, a professor of history at
the University of California at Berkeley, in his book ``Downcast
Eyes: The Denigration of Vision in 20th-Century French Thought.''
But that, he suggests, is not the whole story.
</P>
<P>
   If photographs seemed to offer a better and more prolonged
glimpse of reality, they also planted a doubt about the human
ability to grasp reality and even the definition of reality. By the
end of the 19th century, photography began to generate ``a
subcurrent of skepticism,'' Jay writes.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first major blows was dealt by Muybridge, an English
photographer. His famous photographs of galloping horses, published
in 1878, revealed something that the human eye was blind to. As
Aaron Scharf describes it in ``Art and Photography'': ``They
contradicted almost all of the previous representations made by
artists. The most startling thing was that, unlike the traditional
flying gallop in which all four legs were shown off the turf,
spread out like those of a frozen rabbit, they were at one moment
proved to be jack-knifed beneath the body of the animal.''
</P>
<P>
   In his painting and sculpture Degas happily followed Muybridge's
lead. Others disparaged the new truth. Auguste Rodin insisted the
old way of depicting a gallop, typified by Theodore Gericault, was
better. ``For now I believe it is Gericault who is right, and not
the camera, for his horses appear to run and, though false, they
are nevertheless true.''
</P>
<P>
   To add to the confusion, people began to learn that photographs
could be manipulated. ``By the mid-1840s,'' writes Jay,
``photographers discovered that they could retouch their
photographs or even combine them to make a composite.''
</P>
<P>
   Francis Galton, for example, was known for ``combining a number
of underexposed photographic negatives of social types (such as
criminals) into a `sandwich' that could then be used to print a
single composite positive of that type,'' writes Robert A.
Sobieszek in the catalog ``Photography and the Human Soul.'' In
this way Galton created portraits of Jews, consumptives, healthy
people and criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Amid this confusion, ocularcentrism, or sight-centeredness,
began to erode. And fantasy, spiritualism, symbolism and surrealism
rushed in to fill the vacuum. This is when the story of art and
photography took an unexpected turn.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the artists who were most entranced by photography were
Symbolists like Fernand Khnopff, Munch, Gauguin and Moreau. They
were not at all interested in realism but rather in the ``inner
landscape,'' the invisible truth. Dorothy Kosinski, the curator of
``The Artist and the Camera,'' says that for these Symbolists,
``the photograph suggested a new scopic realm, inflected with
issues of time, memory, nostalgia, motion and space.'' Reality was
``something internal, private'' for them. And they thought the
camera could help them capture it.
</P>
<P>
   Degas is not normally thought of as a Symbolist, but his
engagement with photography suggests otherwise. He would seat his
photographic subjects in ``almost total darkness, as though
searching with his lens for something hidden within those faces
that could not readily be perceived by the human eye in the light
of day,'' Elizabeth Childs, a professor of art history at
Washington University, writes in the catalog for the ``The Artist
and the Camera.'' He was not searching for reality. He was looking
for souls to emerge, for something the ordinary eye could not see.
</P>
<P>
   One of Degas' most famous photographs is a double portrait of
Renoir, the Impressionist painter, and Stephane Mallarme, the
Symbolist poet. In the photograph Mallarme leans against a wall,
Renoir leans against a mirror that reflects his image and Degas is
obliterated by the glare of the flash in the mirror. Childs
suggests that by using mirrors and flashes, Degas seemed to say
that ``what we view here are not just individuals'' but ``the
consciousness of viewing itself.'' It is the eye turned inward.
</P>
<P>
   Munch, despite his ambivalence toward photography, took
photographs of himself, focusing on his eyes, by holding the camera
at arm's length, hoping to capture his own ``raw feelings.'' The
eye might have been questioned as the organ of vision, but it was
still, apparently, a trusted organ of feeling.
</P>
<P>
   Gauguin was famously antipathetic to the camera's version of the
truth, once testily asking: ``What truth? The true color of the
sky, of a tree, of all of material nature?'' But his doubts about
the truthfulness of photographs seemed to free him to use them as
documents of a fantasy world in Tahiti and Samoa that he knew no
longer existed. Gauguin collected faked, colonialist photographs of
natives carrying bananas, building huts and drinking at waterfalls.
He used what he knew were false documents of native life as models
for his nostalgic evocations of savage life.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the artists who turned to photography did it not so much
for their realism as for the access they provided to the invisible.
This trend continued into the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Marcel Duchamp, who obviously owed something to Muybridge for
his fragmented ``Nude Descending a Staircase,'' became interested
in X-rays around 1910. As Linda Dalrymple Henderson writes in
``Duchamp in Context,'' (Princeton, 1999) he was drawn in not only
because those naughty X-rays could ``penetrate clothing and flesh''
but also because they promised something more: ``Here was a new
kind of light that allowed a painter to go beyond the preoccupation
of earlier artists with surface appearances'' _ or the retinal in
Duchamp's derogatory term. It was one step in ``the quest for
invisible reality.''
</P>
<P>
   The beat went on. Surrealists used photographs to evoke
uncanniness, Dadaists cut and pasted photographs for the sake of
nonsense. Andy Warhol lined up row upon row of silk-screen photos,
mining them for their mind-numbing, commercial effect.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that artists have always resented photography for
capturing visible reality and always loved it for capturing
invisible reality. Go figure.

<P>
   GENEVA _ On a winding country road near here, a century-old
mansion set in impeccably manicured grounds overlooking Lake Geneva
houses what may be Switzerland's unlikeliest factory.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, watchmakers labor over high wooden tables, peering
through microscopes to fashion the precise and complicated luxury
watches that are the stock in trade of Franck Muller Watchland, as
music plays and breathtaking views of the Alps beckon through
mullioned windows.
</P>
<P>
   The company is swimming against powerful tides in more ways than
just its sumptuous headquarters, set in a village-like campus. For
all its importance to the country's economy, the $10 billion Swiss
watch industry is going through a profound transformation.
</P>
<P>
   The making of movements _ the mechanical working parts _ has
been steadily migrating out of the country in search of cheaper
labor, leaving only the most expensive models made entirely in
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a once-clubby, insular industry populated by
scores of family-owned companies with 200- and 300-year pedigrees
is rapidly being consolidated. A handful of corporations like
Swatch Group and LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton have been
assembling stables of venerable brands while the total number of
manufacturers has dwindled to fewer than 100.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall alone, LVMH acquired Tag Heuer and Ebel, two prominent
luxury brands, as well as Zenith International, a component maker;
it also bought Chaumet, a French watch maker.
</P>
<P>
   Swatch, the world's largest watchmaker, recently bought one of
the most prestigious names in Switzerland, Group Horloge Breguet,
whose watches can cost up to $1 million. Both companies are said by
analysts to be actively searching for more acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   The industry is not growing quickly in terms of the number of
watches sold. Exports fell 3 percent last year, to around 31
million watches, and are forecast to manage only 2 percent or 3
percent growth this year, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   The financial state of the industry is hard to gauge because
only two of its companies, Swatch and Compagnie Financiere
Richemont (which also has tobacco and direct-marketing businesses),
are publicly held.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as unpromising as this climate would seem for a start-up,
Franck Muller thought there was room for a maverick, especially at
the top end of the market, home to what growth there is.
</P>
<P>
   Since its founding in 1992, his company has grown to 120
employees turning out 16,000 watches a year, ranging in price from
$3,000 to $100,000, depending on the watch's complexity. The
company's specialty is complicated mechanisms like the Master
Banker, which tracks three time zones at once, and the World
Premiere, which combines all of the company's most inventive
specialty features. It has introduced a total of 10 new models this
year, too.
</P>
<P>
   In the villa, Muller said, he can oversee ``watches being made
from beginning to end'' _ both the traditional, painstaking hand
work and the computer-aided design systems used to develop watch
mechanisms. Muller particularly prides himself on one such
component, a tourbillon, which compensates for gravity's effects on
time-keeping.
</P>
<P>
   Muller, 41, restored antique watches before beginning his own
company, and decorates his elegant office with an extensive
collection of antique watchmaking tools. Their modern equivalents
are seen busily fashioning some of the company's more exotic
products during a tour of the Watchland workshops.
</P>
<P>
   One large watch encrusted with black diamonds was being fitted
with a new gold-and-black diamond dial. Muller would not say who
had ordered it or how much it cost, though the watch face, engraved
with a Moscow landmark, gave a clue.
</P>
<P>
   Up in the eaves of the villa, across from an engraver working on
a watch face with an erotic theme, engineers sat at computer design
workstations. The company buys some movements from foreign
suppliers, but designs and makes most of its components itself, as
Swiss firms have done since the days four centuries ago when John
Calvin turned Geneva into a magnet for Huguenot craftsmen driven
from France by religious persecution.
</P>
<P>
   When Asian markets took a nose-dive two years ago, the luxury
watch business turned wobbly, but prosperity in the United States
has helped shore it up since then. Total American spending on
luxury watches rose 14 percent in 1999, according to the Federation
of the Swiss Watch Industry.
</P>
<P>
   Swatch's results for the second half of 1999, announced last
Thursday, reflect that trend. Profits were up sharply from the same
period in 1998, thanks largely to strong demand for luxury goods in
North America and the company's success in raising prices,
especially for its Longines and Omega brands.
</P>
<P>
   About 7 in 10 customers at the top end of the market are men,
for whom a prestigious watch serves the same purpose that jewelry
does for women. Indeed, Calvin's religious proscription against
jewelry in the 16th century spurred the development of the
beautiful decorated watches that built Switzerland's enduring
reputation.
</P>
<P>
   To reach men, manufacturers like TAG Heuer often sponsor
sporting events. Others, like Omega, also market their wares to
women; Muller said women bought 40 percent of his watches.
</P>
<P>
   The industry believes the era of ``one watch for life'' has
largely ended, and it is counting on many customers to buy several
expensive watches _ typically a sports watch and a dress watch, at
minimum. Some analysts predict the industry's future will see a
melding of watch and jewelry making, bringing it full circle,
historically speaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be more mergers. This phenomenon will go on,'' said
Jean-Daniel Pasche, director of the industry federation. Pierre
Tissot, vice president of Lombard Odier &AMP; Cie bank and a specialist
in the industry, said economies of scale were the reason _ not so
much in making watches as in marketing and distributing them.
``Size does matter, because it is difficult for a single company to
find its way to the customer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There will always be exceptions like Franck Muller, which
confines itself to a specific market niche and does as much work as
it can in-house. But, Tissot said, ``If you want to be global and
offset economic downturns in various regions, you need to be
larger.''
</P>
<P>
   Muller would not provide figures for the company's performance,
saying only that ``my cash flow is good.'' But he said he had no
intention of selling his business to a larger company.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a family organization,'' Muller said. ``I can do
everything I want to do now, with no reporting to anybody.''

DYLAN SHINES ON `WONDER BOYS' SOUNDTRACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BILL DEAN   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   These days, any new music from Bob Dylan is eagerly awaited by
those who pine for the days when poetry blew in the wind and
brilliance knocked on heaven's door.
</P>
<P>
   With just one new Dylan song, the soundtrack for the new film
``Wonder Boys'' offers only a morsel of freshness from the original
genius of folk rock.
</P>
<P>
   On this compilation of essentially like-minded material, the new
Dylan song ``Things Have Changed'' plays welcome quarterback to a
CD of 12 older tunes from various artists, including three other
songs by Dylan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things Have Changed,'' is basically a mid-tempo, 12-bar blues
song with sprightly played acoustic guitar licks. It serves the
soundtrack's melancholy mission well, and Dylan's voice is in full
Popeye-drunk-on-ripple-wine mode.
</P>
<P>
   The movie stars Michael Douglas as a successful novelist
dreading the prospect of failure; in other words, fear has stalled
his progress on a followup.
</P>
<P>
   Producer-director Curtis Hanson (``L.A. Confidential'') packed
his soundtrack with revealing tales from the ``wonder boys'' of
music to match Douglas' portrayal of a literary wonder boy.
</P>
<P>
   In the album's liner notes, Hanson says he chose such tunes as
Neil Young's ``Old Man,'' John Lennon's ``Watching the Wheels'' and
Van Morrison's ``Philosophers Stone'' because they ``underscore the
bittersweetness of success (and its aftermath) as well as the
yearning for purpose ... that connects the movie's central
characters.''
</P>
<P>
   And he calls Dylan, also represented here with songs from 1975's
``Blood on the Tracks,'' 1989's ``Oh Mercy'' and 1997's ``Time Out
of Mind,'' the ``consummate `wonder boy' of rock whose miraculous
creativity has ceaselessly amazed us all over four decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanson could only have penned that after hearing the new
``Things Have Changed,'' in which Dylan breathlessly sneers of dead
ends and desperate situations.
</P>
<P>
   In one verse, he's ``standing on the gallows with my head in the
noose; any minute ... expecting all hell to break loose.''
</P>
<P>
   That sets up the chorus: ``People are crazy and times are
strange; I'm locked in tight, I'm out of range. I used to care ...
but things have changed.''
</P>
<P>
   With his own ``Shooting Star,'' ``Not Dark Yet'' and ``Buckets
of Rain'' filling out the soundtrack (along with Clarence Carter's
``Slip Away,'' Leonard Cohen's ``Waiting For the Miracle'' and
others) Dylan proves Hanson right.
</P>
<P>
   He also makes happy those nibbling on ``Wonder Boys,'' the
soundtrack.

 By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is no originality in imagining science's horrors. Since
the Romantic era, it has been difficult to imagine anything else:
Science creates machinery of destruction. It spawns mutants. It
spews radiation. Its objective pose is a cover for callous
indifference. Scientists murder (as Wordsworth once said of Newton)
to dissect.
</P>
<P>
   Such are the premises of many science fiction novels and most
science fiction films. They help motivate the new discipline of
``science studies.'' They erupt into public life, in debates about
disarmament and the environment. And since the Manhattan Project,
some misgivings are justified: science has now put human survival
in human hands.
</P>
<P>
   So why should a a sober warning about technology's dangers be
treated as a revelation after being featured in the April issue of
Wired magazine? In the last week, Bill Joy, the author of the
article, ``Why the Future Doesn't Need Us,'' has been interviewed
on television, written about in newspapers and argued about on the
Internet. Yet there is not a single point that has not already been
made elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Joy, who is a co-founder and chief scientist of Sun Microsystems
and one of the most respected idea men in the computer field,
anticipates this dd objection, admitting that ``all this has been
written about before'': ``This is nothing new.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not even new that he turns his attention from old
technology nuclear threats to new technology dangers of genetic
engineering, or turns from imaginings of ecological disaster to the
threat of ambitious, hyper-intelligent robots. Who is in the dark
about the ethical problems involved in cloning, the genome project
and genetic testing? What science fiction writer has neglected the
theme of rebellious robots?
</P>
<P>
   But what is new is that Joy's essay appears in Wired, a magazine
that is more used to celebrating the brave new wired world. In a
piece written about Joy in August 1998 by Kevin Kelley _ one of
Wired's founders _ and Spencer Reiss _ a Wired editor, the
Internet, for example, is glowingly imagined as a ``vast planetary
system'' of interacting machines, ``expanding by its own internal
logic.'' It is a ``global nervous system.''
</P>
<P>
   As it evolves it will alter human life as we know it. Wired has
published speculations that this global nervous system may actually
lead to a new life form, currently beyond imagining. This
enthusiastic expectation is not the exception. Internet visionaries
of the 1990s often indulged in ecstatic imaginings of human
transformation.
</P>
<P>
   Joy's comments are also related to the exuberant arguments in
Ray Kurzweil's recent book, ``The Age of Spiritual Machines.''
Kurzweil, a prolific and brilliant inventor, argues that not only
are computer speeds increasing and computer sizes decreasing at
exponential rates, but that this kind of explosive change will
continue without foreseeable limits. By the year 2030, Kurzweil
suggests, computers will be about a million times more powerful
than they are today; they will start to resemble life forms. Humans
will also contain machines: miniaturization will allow nanobots _
microscopic robots _ to be injected into the bloodstream and heal
their host organisms. Humans will merge with their machines; we
will all be cyborgs. This, Kurzweil argues, is good news.
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising that in a world of surging entrepreneurial
energy, the prospects of technological change are being celebrated.
Even Joy is ordinarily somewhat of a utopian visionary in his work
for Sun. Fortune magazine called Joy ``The Edison of the
Internet'': he designed crucial system software, three of Sun's
microprocessors, and developed the Java programming language. More
recently he has been working on a computer-based system known as
Jini, which will allow household appliances to ``talk'' to one
another: use a Palm Pilot to start a car, have a computer send a
warning e-mail when the refrigerator gets too warm or ask a
camcorder to transmit pictures through a cell phone. Sun promised
Jini appliances last year, but they still aren't even close. I
don't see a compelling need for Jini, but no matter: it is utopian
because it makes the impossible seem possible.
</P>
<P>
   So it is no surprise that out of such an inventive and innocent
world, Joy's dissent would seem thunderous. What, then, is to be
done? Joy's proposals _ that we ``take personal responsibility'' or
hold Aspen Institute-type conferences _ will not make much of a
difference. Knowledge will increase; so will applications; so will
temptations. Any evil that grows out of technology will not arise
through nefarious plotting, but unpredictably and incidentally: by
letting Jini-like innovations out the bottle, by increasing human
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   One of the problems, in fact, might not be in technology itself,
but in the ways in which technological culture has already undercut
the special status of the human. In studying computer simulations
of life, some theorists have argued that sophisticated simulations
are themselves primitive life forms. Among other thinkers it is
also becoming more common to think of humans as ``hosts'' for
``memes'': memes are ideas _ like ``justice'' or ``evil,'' the
opening of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, or the taste for tatoos _
that replicate and spread from body to body like genes; their
particular meanings are unimportant. These sorts of speculations
treat human nature as a sophisticated form of information
processing. Why should tampering with such codes matter? Genetic
engineering is just another form of re-programming.
</P>
<P>
   This view of human life grows directly out of the culture Wired
celebrates. It does not encourage experimental restraint. Instead,
it encourages speculation about how we can control our memes and
genes, and encourages optimism that the possibilities are
unlimited. So Joy's argument needs amplification: there are not
only risks latent in technology, there are risks latent in certain
celebrations of technology. The dangers lie not in our technology
but in ourselves.

   A judge ruled in favor of white farmers, saying black squatters
on their farms were breaking the law. The judge said the squatters
had 24 hours to leave the hundreds of farms they have occupied. The
squatters, veterans of Zimbabwe's war of independence, had invaded

   Less than a month before a meeting in Kenya on endangered

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If history is any guide, Thursday's powerful
499-point gain in the Dow Jones industrial average augurs good news
for investors for the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, past performance is no guarantee of future success,
as many a mutual fund advertisement has noted. But the statistics
are unambiguous.
</P>
<P>
   Before this week, the Dow, which gained 4.9 percent Thursday,
had rallied 4 percent or more 10 times since the current bull
market began in 1982. On eight of those occasions, stocks extended
their gains for at least three months after the big one-day move,
according to Richard McCabe, chief market strategist at Merrill
Lynch. And the gains were substantial. Even factoring in the two
times the Dow did not continue to rally, the index averaged a 7.5
percent gain over the three months after the end of its big day.
</P>
<P>
   Over a longer period, the positive results are even more
pronounced, according to a study by Birinyi Associates. Including
Thursday, Birinyi looked at the Dow's 25 best days since 1970, a
period that covers both bull and bear markets. The firm found they
presaged a gain of more than 14 percent over the next six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the last move is showing is that investors have not
abandoned stocks,'' said Robin Griffiths, the chief technical
analyst at HSBC Securities. ``This is greed rather than fear, and
as long as we have greed around, we have a bull market.''
</P>
<P>
   After Thursday's big gains, the Dow pulled back slightly Friday,
falling 35.37 points, to 10,595.23, a 0.33 percent drop. The Nasdaq
composite index rose 80.74 points, or 1.71 percent, to 4,798.13,
while the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index gained 6 points, or
0.41 percent, to 1,464.47.
</P>
<P>
   Despite history's promise of further gains, Wall Street's
technical analysts said that this week's rally may be an exception
to the rule.
</P>
<P>
   These technicians earn their keep by trying to divine the future
moves of stocks from their price histories. To the large group of
investors and economists who believe that stocks are impossible to
predict that way, technicians are little more than psychics with
computers. But nearly every major Wall Street firm keeps at least a
couple of technical analysts on staff.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to price movements, technicians generally look for a
rally with heavy trading and breadth, meaning several stocks rise
for each stock that falls. Thursday's move seems to fit all three
categories. Almost 1.5 billion shares were traded on the New York
Stock Exchange, an all-time record, and seven stocks rose for every
two that dropped on the Big Board.
</P>
<P>
   Rallies like Thursday's ``have tended to mean that the market
will go up for a number of weeks and in many cases a number of
months,'' said Ricky Harrington, technical analyst for Wachovia
Securities in North Carolina. But Harrington said he remained
``very cautious about this market,'' in part because the Dow
remains below its average of the last 200 days, a trend technicians
view as bearish.
</P>
<P>
   McCabe is also uncertain that Thursday's gains will hold, though
for a different reason. He is worried that investors are overly
bullish. It may sound counterintuitive, but technical analysts say
that the strongest rallies begin when most investors have turned
very negative and selling pressure has reached a climax. Recent
surveys show that investors are very complacent, as opposed to
negative, about the market, McCabe said. He fears that stocks will
turn down again ``sometime in the spring.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Dickey, managing director for technical analysis at Dain
Rauscher, said he expected stocks to remain in a tight range over
the next several months and finish the year not far from their
current levels. Slipping a bit of fundamental analysis into his
explanation, Dickey said, ``We're in a period of rising interest
rates similar to 1994, and so I think this year will be similar to
1994,'' a year most stocks ended slightly down.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, ``Don't fight the Fed'' is one of Wall Street's
hoariest maxims, and Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan has
repeatedly indicated his discomfort with the level of stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   But though the Fed has raised short-term interest rates four
times since June in an effort to slow the U.S. economy, corporate
profits continue to chug along. They are expected to rise 17.7
percent this year, following a rise of 18 percent last year,
according to First Call/Thomson Financial. Long-term interest rates
have also dropped substantially since hitting highs in January.
Lower interest rates are good for stocks, because they lessen the
cost of corporate borrowing while making bonds less attractive as
an investment alternative.

<P>
   Sally Hershberger was slaloming around the limos in the parking
lot of the Ron Herman/Fred Segal Melrose store in Los Angeles.
``Just so you know,'' she said, pausing at the entrance, ``I am the
fastest shopper.''
</P>
<P>
   Hershberger, the Hollywood hairstylist who has become something
of a celebrity in her own right coiffing stars like Meg Ryan,
Michelle Pfeiffer and Tom Cruise, was on a high-speed mission: to
outfit both herself and her new Los Angeles salon, Sally
Hershberger at John Frieda, for its opening party this coming
Friday. ``Generally, I live in black leather pants and a T-shirt,''
she said. ``But for the party I might try something more vivid.''
</P>
<P>
   Something, no doubt, epitomizing what appear to be her three e's
of style: easy, edge-pushing, expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's go!''
</P>
<P>
   No dawdling. Hershberger, 40, who resembles a cross between
Annette Bening and Mackenzie Phillips, seems to be in perpetual
motion, chop-chopping between Los Angeles, where she grew up; the
John Frieda Salon in New York; her homes in Los Angeles, New York,
Connecticut and East Hampton; promotions for the John Frieda Sheer
Blonde line of hair products she helped develop; and on-location
jobs for her star clients. While she is renowned for her signature
undone hairdos, it is through her combination of charisma and blunt
confidence that she has managed to pull away from the pack of
fame-hungry cut-and-colorists and corner the glam hair market. When
Hillary Clinton was going on the cover of Vogue, Hershberger got
the call. The first woman to achieve the status of an Oribe or
Frederic Fekkai, Hershberger can command $400 for a regular haircut
and a day rate of $4,000 for fashion shoots. But she has not
adopted the schmoozy, cosseting approach of her male counterparts.
She issues style dictums and fashion tips to clients with the
authority of a hip generalissimo. When one admired her vintage
Gucci bracelet at her salon recently, she replied: ``Maxfield's.
You must go. Go! Right now!''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in a town like Los Angeles, where salons double as social
scenes, Hershberger will be put to a new test. Her name is now on
the building, and her reputation will be scrutinized afresh. Hence
the importance of her opening party. It has to set exactly the
right tone. While this prospect might make fainter hearts flutter,
it appears to be having the opposite effect on her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never ponder, never agonize,'' she said, galloping up the
stairs at Fred Segal. Racing by a long shelf of cashmere sweaters
with graphic designs, she tapped her finger on each sweater and
sprinted through her commentary: ``Love, don't love, love, kind of
love,'' Then, pausing at a $600 cream ribbed crew neck with a large
blue heart on the front: ``Looooove.'' At that instant, a $110
glitter-appliqued ``I Love You'' baseball T by Chloe caught her
eye. ``Oh, really love. That's faaaabulous.'' She grabbed it and
turned on her heel. ``OK Downstairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Back on the first floor, she made a beeline for the Bedazzled
section, a line of embellished vintage denim, where she ran into
two friends, the actress Peggy Lipton and Lulu, the British singer
best known for ``To Sir, With Love.'' Furiously rifling through the
racks, Hershberger held up a pair of $1,100 dirty-denim jeans
studded with colored rhinestones in an elaborate floral pattern.
``I die over these,'' she said to the two women.
</P>
<P>
   Lulu clapped her hands. A quick spin in and out of the dressing
room and it was settled: the jeans and shirt would be Hershberger's
opening-night ensemble. ``Done,'' she said. ``On we go!''
</P>
<P>
   Total shopping time: 18 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Next stop: Fahey/Klein, a Los Angeles gallery that specializes
in fashion photography. There she met with John Frieda to choose
art for their salon. ``I want photographs of models, I want
fashion, I want beauty,'' Hershberger declared.
</P>
<P>
   One of her first celebrity connections was the photographer Herb
Ritts, who met Hershberger when she was 23 and a few years out of
beauty school, working on Olivia Newton-John's ``Let's Get
Physical'' tour. ``He was shooting the concert, and I was doing
hair,'' Hershberger recalled. ``One day, he said we should do
editorial together, and we ended up working together, like, every
day after that for years.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also through her association with Ritts that Hershberger
solidified her aesthetic sensibility, which she described as
follows: ``All things simple and beautiful, but eminently livable.
It doesn't matter whether you're talking about hair or houses or
clothes _ they should be clean, glamorous, but not too perfect.
Perfection should be a little wrecked. It has to be lived in.''
</P>
<P>
   As obliging Fahey/Klein employees brought out a succession of
Irving Penn and Helmut Newton prints, Hershberger shook her head.
</P>
<P>
   ``No _ what else? No _ what else? Too small. We need big. Big.
Bigger. Bigger _ and in color!'' She and Frieda did a quick huddle
on the couch, leafing through catalogs and books.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adoring this David Bailey,'' Hershberger remarked, pointing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Frieda said, ``except if we want it, we can just call
David. What about this one of Twiggy?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, except if we want it, we can just call Twiggy,''
Hershberger said.
</P>
<P>
   For a moment, their very plugged-inness seemed to paralyze them.
If they knew all the artists, what were they doing at the gallery?
The tepid breath of indecision threatened to descend _ until
Hershberger snapped out of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enough,'' she said. ``Let's move.'' She selected several
(great big) Irving Penn black-and-white shots of Amber Valetta,
Shalom Harlow and Naomi Campbell, ranging from $6,500 to $19,000,
to be held for eventual purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Elapsed art-buying time: 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Back at the salon, a team of party planners waited. Along with
two John Frieda publicists, they stood awkwardly clustered in the
entrance to the airy white and glass 3,600-square-foot structure,
staring at the three sleek black marble fireplaces, the indoor pool
and the flowing water wall that serve as the visual centerpieces.
Even when Hershberger and Frieda joined them, they remained
standing. Hershberger seems to prefer conducting business on her
feet, as if perpetually poised for a speedy exit _ perhaps the same
reason she chose a career that requires her to stand.
</P>
<P>
   The party planners began with a list of potential food styles:
Japanese, Asian-fusion, Indian. It soon became clear, however, that
the real issue was less about eating and more about chic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indian,'' Hershberger declared. ``Indian is sexier than
Japanese. Really sexy Indian food with really sexy waiters. All
good-looking guys not wearing a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Drinks?
</P>
<P>
   ``Wine and beautiful juices, maybe mango Bellinis. Do Bellinis
match Indian?''
</P>
<P>
   Music?
</P>
<P>
   ``Indian music, but not too mellow. Upbeat Indian music.''
</P>
<P>
   And decoration?
</P>
<P>
   ``Incense, lounge pillows, candles everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, with the hushed importance and deliberation of a
military invasion, possible dates for the party were discussed.
``When is Barry Diller's party?'' Hershberger asked. ``When is
Elton's party? Find out.'' An assistant was dispatched to draft a
top-secret, off-the-record guest list. Party-planning time
expended: 24 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, Hershberger was in New York to continue her
quest for the perfect salon furnishings: Arts and Crafts-style
chairs for the reception area, '60s-modern floor lamps, mirrors to
hang over fireplaces. The salon, she said, should have ``a New York
feel within a California structure.'' Hershberger hurtled out the
revolving door of her West Village apartment building.
</P>
<P>
   So what was she looking for at Wyeth, the by-appointment vintage
furniture store on Franklin Street? ``Important pieces!''
</P>
<P>
   At Wyeth, Hershberger threw her black Tse cashmere coat on a
chair and stalked the room in a black Jil Sander T-shirt and
leather pants. She eyed an $80,000 set of urns and an Annie
Leibovitz photograph that, she was informed, was already sold.
``Well, if it's sold, why do you have it out?'' she asked, piqued
at having wasted 40 seconds looking at it.
</P>
<P>
   After shooting Polaroids of a $3,800 wall mirror and a $4,400
floor lamp, she asked the manager to hold them for her and whisked
uptown in a hired car to Troy, on Greene Street, where she put
aside a $9,500 Alexander Vethers abstract black-and-white image of
a fashion runway _ ``for the wall behind my station, it's
geeenius!'' _ and bought several $380 glass block vases.
</P>
<P>
   Salon furnishings time: 42 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   With a little jig of impatience, Hershberger ducked into Louis
Vuitton to pick up a $1,260 logo suitcase on wheels (``Perfect for
shoots _ kind of over the top, but that's why it's funny''), and
share her yoga mantra with the manager. ``It's Oon namah shivaya,''
she said. ``Here, let me write it down for you. Oon namah shivaya,
oonnamahshivaya.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, people think that yoga is all mellow and laid-back,
but they're wrong. To be yogic is to be precise. It's to know what
you want, figure out how to get it and take action. It's about
clarity. Clarity gives you energy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And energy,'' she said, spinning around and heading for the
door, ``is, you know _ gooorgeous.''
</P>
<P>
   Spiritual exploration: three minutes.

SMITH &AMP; WESSON AGREES TO GUN SAFETY MEASURES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and w coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Facing the threat of a costly federal lawsuit, the
nation's largest handgun manufacturer Friday agreed to sweeping
safety measures intended to control both the sale and use of their
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Springfield-based Smith &AMP; Wesson, which is among a group of gun
manufacturers being sued by localities across the country including
Boston, said it would put safety locks on its handguns, add ``smart
gun'' technology to new guns to prevent unauthorized usage, and
would refuse to peddle weapons at gun shows where background checks
of buyers are not done.
</P>
<P>
   ``This agreement is a major victory for America's families,''
President Clinton said in an Oval Office address. ``It means gun
makers can and will share in the responsibility to keep their
products out of the wrong hands. And it says that gun makers can
and will make their guns much safer without infringing on anyone's
rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Though it is not clear whether other gun makers will follow, the
deal is a major political victory for Clinton, who has been the
personal target of recent TV ads by the National Rifle Association.
In an unusually blistering attack on the president, NRA Executive
Vice President Wayne LaPierre last weekend accused Clinton of being
``willing to accept a certain level of killing to further his
political agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith &AMP; Wesson was being sued by more than 20 cities and
counties, which were seeking new safety measures and monetary
damages to cover the cost of gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   Boston was not mentioned at Friday's announcement of the
agreement, but Mayor Thomas M. Menino said the city would go along
with the deal, even though it meant Boston could be forgoing any
cash windfall from Smith &AMP; Wesson if the city won its pending
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about money. It's about making guns safe. That's the
bottom line,'' Menino said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Boston will proceed with its suit against 19 other gun
manufacturers, Menino said, although federal and local officials
hope smaller gun manufacturers will follow Smith &AMP; Wesson's example
and make similar settlements.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement came after the federal Department of Housing and
Urban Development threatened to file a class-action suit by the
nation's 3,200 public housing authorities against the gun
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   The agency never filed suit and did not join the municipalities
already suing the weapons makers. But the specter of what was
likely to be a lengthy, expensive lawsuit helped convince Smith &AMP;
Wesson that a settlement was in their best interests, agency
officals said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal ``will not be popular with everyone,'' said L.E. ``Ed''
Shultz, president and chief executive officer of Smith &AMP; Wesson,
after signing the agreement in a video simulcast ceremony with
government officials. ``But to us, it makes sense and is the right
thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Gun-control opponents were stunned. The National Shooting Sports
Foundation, based in Connecticut, said Smith &AMP; Wesson had
``violated a trust with their consumers and with the entire
domestic firearms industry'' by inking the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, President Clinton's heavy-handed approach is a
major victory for gun-control proponents at the expense of the
Second Amendment to the Constitution,'' said Representative Bob
Barr, Republican of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The targeting of the gun makers, which developed after
legislative attempts to limit gun sales stalled, ``has gotten very
irritating,'' said Gary Mehalik, spokesman for Taurus International
Firearms, based in Hialeah, Fla. The company is among those being
sued by municipalities.
</P>
<P>
   Taurus installs safety latches on its guns, and ``everyone we
sell to is licensed by the federal government,'' he said. ``How
much more regulated can you be?''
</P>
<P>
   Mehalik said he did not believe other gun makers would agree to
a deal like the one Smith &AMP; Wesson signed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules of the agreement, Smith &AMP; Wesson will put
external locking devices on its guns withing 60 days, and install
child-proof safety locks within one year. Within two years,
internal locking devices will be installed on all guns.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of three years, ``smart gun'' technology, meant to
prevent anyone except the owner from operating the gun, will be
included on new firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Smith &AMP; Wesson also agreed to unprecedented restrictions on its
marketing and sales practices. The company will not market to
children or criminals. For example, it will not advertise a gun as
``fingerprint-proof,'' a HUD official explained, and it will not
sell weapons at gun shows unless all weapons sold there, even those
not made by Smith &AMP; Wesson, are restricted to buyers who have
undergone background checks.
</P>
<P>
   The company agreed not to sell large-capacity magazines, which
might be attractive to criminals, and it agreed to force buyers to
wait 14 days for multiple gun purchases, allowing law enforcement
to track suspicious activity.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the company will work toward developing a ballistics
imaging system, under which the company would fire the gun before
purchase and enter the digital image into a special computer
system. The technology would help the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms trace guns.
</P>
<P>
   The entire deal will be overseen and enforced by a government
commission.
</P>
<P>
   HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo said the tragic gun violence of the
past few weeks _ especially the fatal shooting of a Michigan
first-grader by a classmate _ put added pressure on Smith &AMP; Wesson.
As for the other gun companies, ``Yes, we are prepared to litigate.
Yes, we are prepared to negotiate,'' Cuomo said.
</P>
<P>
   Emboldened by the win, gun-control advocates are planning an
added push. New York's attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, said he was
gathering support in his state for a plan to refuse government
contracts to any gun maker that does not adhere to the Smith &AMP;
Wesson restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the federal government would issue such a provocative
rule is still under discussion. ``We're thinking about it,'' said
Bruce Reed, Clinton's domestic policy adviser.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an interesting idea,'' said Cuomo. But ``I don't think we
can do it legally.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats on Capitol Hill are also planning to introduce
legislation next week to fund added enforcement of existing gun
laws. The move, shepherded by Senators Charles Schumer of New York
and Edward M. Kennedy, is meant to test Republican resolve on guns.
</P>
<P>
   Capitol Hill Republicans have long argued that new gun-control
measures are not needed, and that police need only enforce current
laws. ``Momentum for additional action is building,'' Kennedy said.

NASDAQ ACKNOWLEDGES COMPTER OVERLOAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Nasdaq exchange, which has seen trading volume balloon as
investors have rushed into technology stocks, experienced computer
problems earlier this month, a Nasdaq official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Although a March 6 computer glitch was not as severe as one that
effectively crippled the exchange and halted trades last November
for about 20 minutes, the recent malfunction has reignited concerns
among traders and investment managers about whether the nation's
hottest exchange can handle an unexpected and unprecedented rise in
volume of the computer stocks that are its primary business.
</P>
<P>
   The March 6 incident was ``like a hang nail,'' the Nasdaq
official said, compared with the November shutdown, which he
characterized as a ``heart attack.''
</P>
<P>
   But traders said it became very difficult to complete trades
during the entire 17-minute March incident, from about 2:55 p.m.
until 3:12, after a Nasdaq price-feeding system stopped working.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stopped receiving prices from Nasdaq, and when you have no
prices, there is no trading,'' said one trader at a large Manhattan
firm who refused to be quoted.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is volume. The number of transactions on Nasdaq has
exploded, from less then 800,000 shares per day, on average, during
1998 to 1.7 million shares daily in January and February of this
year. In recent weeks _ as the Nasdaq index level soared to a
record 5,000-plus closing and then plunged 9 percent _ trading
routinely surpassed 2 million shares a day.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange, on its Web site, reported another minor system
problem Feb. 18 amid a surge in volume.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq official, who spoke on condition that his name not be
used, said a software problem on March 6 caused one of the
exchange's computer systems to ``get stuck in a loop'' for one
minute and 17 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Although trading was not disrupted, the official said the brief
glitch caused an interrupt in the feed of ``last sale prices'' on
completed transactions for a total of 17 minutes, as technicians
repaired the software problem.
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices could not be fed into the workstations on traders'
desks or into the program that calculates the Nasdaq's index level.
``Rather than disseminate bad information, for a while we
disseminated no information,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Computers that process trades are separate from those that
provide pricing updates in the Nasdaq computer system, which has
layer upon layer of backup computers to ensure uninterrupted
trading. Nasdaq was ``accepting the trade reports, we were locking
in the trade reports,'' he added. ``Everything was functioning.''
</P>
<P>
   But while few investors or traders blame Nasdaq for the volume
crunch, it is no secret on Wall Street that Nasdaq has problems
keeping up with leaps in trading volume in a bull market for
technology stocks that no one had anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing how many trades there are,'' said Michael Ryan,
head of equity trading for State Street Resarch &AMP; Management, a
Boston investment firm. About Nasdaq, he said, ``They're
overloaded.''

SECURITY COUNCIL MEMBERS WEIGH HELMS' INVITATION TO WASHINGTON 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Should they or shouldn't they?
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Security Council are pondering an invitation to
Washington from Sen. Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican who
is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Sen.
Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, the ranking Democrat on the
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone on the 15-member council is thrilled by the
prospect. Helms has been a leading critic of the United Nations,
and diplomats are also concerned about how the image of this
powerful panel trundling off to Capitol Hill would play around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials are trying to broaden the scope
of the visit, adding meetings with high-level State Department and
perhaps White House officials, capped by a social evening with
international guests, according to some private groups helping with
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of day would be different, several Security Council
members said. But some are eager to go even without the add-ons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is, there has been an estrangement between the U.S.
and the U.N.,'' a diplomat said. What is important, he added, is
``getting back together.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright sent her own
invitation to the 15 ambassadors on the Security Council, urging
them to make the trip to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Helms first extended the invitation to meet his committee when
he spoke to the Security Council in January during an extraordinary
session in which he criticized the United Nations and said he was
speaking for the American people. Early this month he proposed a
date, March 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``We very much appreciated the warm welcome extended to us
during our visit to the United Nations in January, and the
constructive discussion at that time,'' he and Biden said in a
letter to this month's council president, Anwarul Karim Chowdhury
of Bangladesh. ``It will be a pleasure to repay your hospitality.''
</P>
<P>
   All council members were sent identical letters. A few diplomats
have already responded to the committee, which made the point of
inviting them as individuals rather than as an official body.
Senate committee members are prepared to see a few decline the
invitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Helms felt that we began a very constructive dialogue
in New York, and he wants to continue that dialogue,'' said Marc
Thiessen, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee spokesman. ``He
said in his speech that the only way we're going to be able to fix
the U.S.-U.N. relationship is if we understand each other better.
He felt that we had stated that up in New York, and he didn't want
it to be a one-time thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard C. Holbrooke, the U.S. representative, who arranged
Helms' appearance in New York in January, is expected to do his
utmost to persuade wavering diplomats to accept the invitation to
Washington in the interests of what one waverer acknowledged Friday
could be ``a useful exchange of views.'' Holbrooke, whose powers of
persuasion diplomats say they never underestimate, is now in Asia
arguing the case for lower U.S. payments to the United Nations, a
subject dear to Helms.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There was also some chemistry in New York in January between the
Security Council and Helms and his committee members, many of them
Senate veterans accustomed to the traditional, even exaggerated
courtesies of earlier, less partisan years in Congress. The
Security Council sits in a chamber replete with ceremony and
diplomatic niceties. Before Helms left New York, he had donned a
U.N. cap and was exchanging toasts with council members at the
staid Metropolitan Club.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, Albright reminded the Security Council that
the administration made foreign policy and did not always share the
views of Helms. In their letter to Chowdhury, dated March 3 but not
released by Helms' staff until two days ago, the senators suggested
a morning tour of the Capitol, a lunch with the committee and an
afternoon round-table discussion. Events planned by the
administration would have to fit around that schedule.

Shultz, president and chief executive officer of Smith &AMP; Wesson,
after signing the agreement in a video simulcast ceremony with
government officials. ``But to us, it makes sense and is the right
thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Gun-control opponents were stunned. The National Shooting Sports
Foundation, based in Connecticut, said Smith &AMP; Wesson had
``violated a trust with their consumers and with the entire
domestic firearms industry'' by inking the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, President Clinton's heavy-handed approach is a
major victory for gun-control proponents at the expense of the
Second Amendment to the Constitution,'' said Representative Bob
Barr, Republican of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The targeting of the gun makers, which developed after
legislative attempts to limit gun sales stalled, ``has gotten very
irritating,'' said Gary Mehalik, spokesman for Taurus International
Firearms, based in Hialeah, Fla. The company is among those being
sued by municipalities.
</P>
<P>
   Taurus installs safety latches on its guns, and ``everyone we
sell to is licensed by the federal government,'' he said. ``How
much more regulated can you be?''
</P>
<P>
   Mehalik said he did not believe other gun makers would agree to
a deal like the one Smith &AMP; Wesson signed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules of the agreement, Smith &AMP; Wesson will put
external locking devices on its guns withing 60 days, and install
child-proof safety locks within one year. Within two years,
internal locking devices will be installed on all guns.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of three years, ``smart gun'' technology, meant to
prevent anyone except the owner from operating the gun, will be
included on new firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Smith &AMP; Wesson also agreed to unprecedented restrictions on its
marketing and sales practices. The company will not market to
children or criminals. For example, it will not advertise a gun as
``fingerprint-proof,'' a HUD official explained, and it will not
sell weapons at gun shows unless all weapons sold there, even those
not made by Smith &AMP; Wesson, are restricted to buyers who have
undergone background checks.
</P>
<P>
   The company agreed not to sell large-capacity magazines, which
might be attractive to criminals, and it agreed to force buyers to
wait 14 days for multiple gun purchases, allowing law enforcement
to track suspicious activity.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the company will work toward developing a ballistics
imaging system, under which the company would fire the gun before
purchase and enter the digital image into a special computer
system. The technology would help the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms trace guns.
</P>
<P>
   The entire deal will be overseen and enforced by a government
commission.
</P>
<P>
   HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo said the tragic gun violence of the
past few weeks _ especially the fatal shooting of a Michigan
first-grader by a classmate _ put added pressure on Smith &AMP; Wesson.
As for the other gun companies, ``Yes, we are prepared to litigate.
Yes, we are prepared to negotiate,'' Cuomo said.
</P>
<P>
   Emboldened by the win, gun-control advocates are planning an
added push. New York's attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, said he was
gathering support in his state for a plan to refuse government
contracts to any gun maker that does not adhere to the Smith &AMP;
Wesson restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the federal government would issue such a provocative
rule is still under discussion. ``We're thinking about it,'' said
Bruce Reed, Clinton's domestic policy adviser.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an interesting idea,'' said Cuomo. But ``I don't think we
can do it legally.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats on Capitol Hill are also planning to introduce
legislation next week to fund added enforcement of existing gun
laws. The move, shepherded by Senators Charles Schumer of New York
and Edward M. Kennedy, is meant to test Republican resolve on guns.
</P>
<P>
   Capitol Hill Republicans have long argued that new gun-control
measures are not needed, and that police need only enforce current
laws. ``Momentum for additional action is building,'' Kennedy said.

STAPLES EFFORT PACKS A PUNCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The official announcement will come Monday at a
scheduled press conference at Staples Center, but the most
lucrative boxing match in California history _ Oscar De La Hoya
against Sugar Shane Mosley _ will be staged at the new Los Angeles
arena on June 17.
</P>
<P>
   And I can't believe it.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't think Staples Center _ or any other arena outside Las
Vegas _ would wind up with such an appealing match, especially when
places like Caesars Palace, the MGM Grand and the Mandalay Bay all
reportedly desired it.
</P>
<P>
   But I guess I underestimated the resolve of Staples Center
president Tim Leiweke and his top lieutenant, Bobby Goldwater, in
wanting to make the downtown edifice a major new player on the
boxing scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a fight that belongs in L.A., and we're going to bill
it as `California Destiny,' '' says Bob Arum, the promoter who
negotiated the deal with Leiweke.
</P>
<P>
   It might belong in L.A. because De La Hoya is a native of the
city and Mosley hails from Pomona, but one idly wonders why the
shrewd Arum would pass on Las Vegas casinos who routinely fork out
$6 million site fees for a fight of this caliber.
</P>
<P>
   Is Staples Center coming up with such a sum?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' answered Arum firmly. ``What we've agreed to do is share
receipts with Staples Center from the gate. Staples Center also
will guarantee that a certain amount of tickets will be sold. We
look for the gate to be in the seven million dollar range.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be slightly more than the California record
established a few years ago in Sacramento by Tony Lopez and Jorge
Paez when their fight pulled in more than $700,000.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Arum wouldn't be specific on what the percentage take
would be for his Top Rank organization, but you can be sure it will
be high if Staples Center indeed hasn't put up a seven-figure
offering to hold such a high-profile event.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've wanted to take this fight from the start to L.A.,'' says
Arum. ``And the Staples people wanted it. The only holdup was the
tax situation. L.A. has a three percent city tax, which we can live
with. But, as it stands right now, there is a five percent tax on
fight tickets that goes to the California State Athletic
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just too much taxation. You can't have eight percent of
the gate going to taxes. It just cuts into the profit margin too
much. A bill soon will be introduced in the California state
legislature that would put a $50,000 ceiling on the taxes that
would go to the athletic commission from this fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what they did in New York before the Lennox
Lewis-Evander Holyfield heavyweight fight. If the bill fails,
Staples Center has agreed to make up the monetary difference with
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Arum has scaled the house at $900, $700, $300 and, showing he's
the milk of human kindness, even will have 2,300 tickets priced at
$100 and 3,200 at $50.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've heard complaints now for years from Oscar's fans in L.A.
that they never had the opportunity to see him fight, but now they
will have it,'' says Arum.
</P>
<P>
   The fight itself should be a thriller, with the sport's reigning
Golden Boy, De La Hoya, whose sheen was somewhat tarnished with his
late follies against Felix Trinidad, trying to regain lost stature
against the quick-striking, quick-hitting bundle of energy that is
the undefeated Mosley.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I'm glad De La Hoya is fighting Mosley rather than
Trinidad because I'm afraid De La Hoya would have employed the same
tedious, cautious tactics had he fought Trinidad again, whereas he
just might be willing to be slightly bolder and more aggressive
against the smaller Mosley. ...
</P>
<P>
   -The only complaint I have about Wayne Morgan's Long Beach State
49ers is that they unfortunately lost their three most important
games of the season.
</P>
<P>
   If the 49ers had beaten Utah State at the Pyramid , they would
have been the top-seeded team in the Big West tournament and would
have faced quite beatable Nevada in the semifinals instead of New
Mexico State.
</P>
<P>
   If the 49ers had beaten New Mexico State, they would have
advanced to the conference title game, and would have received an
automatic NCAA bid had they been able to win it.
</P>
<P>
   If they had beaten California the other night in their NIT
opener, they would have received the national exposure that Morgan
craves by next facing Georgetown on ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Comeback College Basketball Coach Of The Year Morgan
should be commended for finally turning the desperately struggling
49er program around after three consecutive losing seasons. He soon
will be rewarded with a three-year contract extension from athletic
director Bill Shumard, once a fierce Morgan critic but now a
booster.
</P>
<P>
   And I'm sure it's only a matter of time when one of Morgan's
teams wins a game when it counts most. ...
</P>
<P>
   -Terrific investigative reporting this week in the
Press-Telegram on the Artesia High basketball program by Billy
Witz, Steve Irvine and Fausto Ramos, our own version of Woodward &AMP;
Bernstein. ...
</P>
<P>
   -I didn't shed a tear about the retirement of Dan Marino, a
multi-millionaire who's lived a charmed life the rest of us can
only wistfully envy. Indeed, anyone who watched his ghastly work
the past season for the Miami Dolphins wondered why he hadn't
already retired. ...
</P>
<P>
   -I, like everyone else, am rooting heartily for Sean Elliott,
while I, like everyone else, am wondering why in tarnation the San
Antonio Spurs' forward would be attempting a comeback fraught with
such physical risks. As one well-known doctor told me, ``No athlete
has ever tried to play professional sports seven months after
having a kidney transplant, and the medical field just doesn't know
for sure what will happen. I personally would be against Elliott
playing, but I certainly wouldn't stop him if he wanted to.''. ...
</P>
<P>
   -Long Beach public relations demon Mario Perez informs me two of
the best runners in the history of the Rams, Eric Dickerson and
Marhsall Faulk, are scheduled to participate in the first annual
Mazda Golf Tournament Monday at the Mesa Verde Country Club in
Costa Mesa. Proceeds will benefit the Orange Coast College
Foundation. ...
</P>
<P>
   -I'm not surprised Schea Cotton left Alabama prematurely, but I
will be surprised if I ever see him playing in the NBA. ...
</P>
<P>
   -The only thing I detest more than basketball players wearing
those silly headbands _ do they realize how goofy they look? _ is
coaches adorn in mustaches. ...
</P>
<P>
   -Bob Arum, on the future of boxing: ``The era of the big
megabuck events at casinos in Las Vegas is beginning to fade
because of the corporate consolidation in the gambling business.
Now that MGM has taken over the Mirage, Bellagio and Treasure
Island, do you think it wants to bring in its high rollers for
fights staged by Park Place, which owns Caesars Palace and the
Hilton properties? No way. And vice versa. The competition among
these groups for high rollers has grown bitterly fierce. And we
promoters have to change with the times. That's why you're seeing
more fights at Madison Square Garden and that's why you're going to
see some big fights at Staples Center.''
</P>
<P>
   -They were mourning this week at St. John Bosco High the passing
of one of the school's most passionate boosters, Tom Reilly, who
for more than 30 years was an active volunteer in the Braves'
athletic program. He was eulogized glowingly by St. John Bosco's
football coach, Kiki Mendoza, and many of the school's football
players attended Mr. Reilly's funeral mass wearing their jerseys.

NASDAQ ACKNOWLEDGES COMPUTER OVERLOAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Nasdaq exchange, which has seen trading volume balloon as
investors have rushed into technology stocks, experienced computer
problems earlier this month, a Nasdaq official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Although a March 6 computer glitch was not as severe as one that
effectively crippled the exchange and halted trades last November
for about 20 minutes, the recent malfunction has reignited concerns
among traders and investment managers about whether the nation's
hottest exchange can handle an unexpected and unprecedented rise in
volume of the computer stocks that are its primary business.
</P>
<P>
   The March 6 incident was ``like a hang nail,'' the Nasdaq
official said, compared with the November shutdown, which he
characterized as a ``heart attack.''
</P>
<P>
   But traders said it became very difficult to complete trades
during the entire 17-minute March incident, from about 2:55 p.m.
until 3:12, after a Nasdaq price-feeding system stopped working.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stopped receiving prices from Nasdaq, and when you have no
prices, there is no trading,'' said one trader at a large Manhattan
firm who refused to be quoted.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is volume. The number of transactions on Nasdaq has
exploded, from less then 800,000 shares per day, on average, during
1998 to 1.7 million shares daily in January and February of this
year. In recent weeks _ as the Nasdaq index level soared to a
record 5,000-plus closing and then plunged 9 percent _ trading
routinely surpassed 2 million shares a day.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange, on its Web site, reported another minor system
problem Feb. 18 amid a surge in volume.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq official, who spoke on condition that his name not be
used, said a software problem on March 6 caused one of the
exchange's computer systems to ``get stuck in a loop'' for one
minute and 17 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Although trading was not disrupted, the official said the brief
glitch caused an interrupt in the feed of ``last sale prices'' on
completed transactions for a total of 17 minutes, as technicians
repaired the software problem.
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices could not be fed into the workstations on traders'
desks or into the program that calculates the Nasdaq's index level.
``Rather than disseminate bad information, for a while we
disseminated no information,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Computers that process trades are separate from those that
provide pricing updates in the Nasdaq computer system, which has
layer upon layer of backup computers to ensure uninterrupted
trading. Nasdaq was ``accepting the trade reports, we were locking
in the trade reports,'' he added. ``Everything was functioning.''
</P>
<P>
   But while few investors or traders blame Nasdaq for the volume
crunch, it is no secret on Wall Street that Nasdaq has problems
keeping up with leaps in trading volume in a bull market for
technology stocks that no one had anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing how many trades there are,'' said Michael Ryan,
head of equity trading for State Street Resarch &AMP; Management, a
Boston investment firm. About Nasdaq, he said, ``They're
overloaded.''

   TOKYO _ Tucked amid the instant noodles, pantyhose and canned
drinks at the local Lawson, Japan's second-largest convenience
store chain, customers now find a computer terminal that gives them
access to a system called Loppi. With a few stabs at the keyboard,
they can order concert tickets, make train and plane reservations
and pay at the cash register on the way out.
</P>
<P>
   Need a book? Seven-Eleven Japan, the country's largest
convenience store operator, lets a customer hop online to
eShopping! Books, a site owned by Softbank, Seven-Eleven, Yahoo!
Japan and Tohan, Japan's leading book distributor. A day or so
later, on the way home from work perhaps, the customer picks up the
selection and pays for it at the local Seven-Eleven.
</P>
<P>
   Seven-Eleven can also help with elderly parents. Just order a
meal online and the company will deliver it.
</P>
<P>
   With no further room to expand physically in this densely packed
country and with competition intensifying as new stores cannibalize
old, the neighborhood convenience store, or ``conbini,'' is betting
on the new economy in Japan, moving to embrace technology. Long
accustomed to adding some 50 new products to its merchandise mix
every week on average, the conbini is fast grabbing hunks of
cyberspace to expand its limited shelf space.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, deregulation that has been unfolding since the
mid-1990s is allowing Japanese convenience stores to encroach on
territory long out of their reach, like beauty and health aids and
banking.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last year, the convenience store has become an
indispensable part of the mosaic that is electronic commerce,''
said Kenyu Adachi, director of the distribution industry division
of the Ministry of Trade and Industry. ``Without the convenience
store, e-commerce in Japan would have more trouble taking off.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Adachi and his ministry express a more tempered
enthusiasm for e-tailing in Japan than do investors, who have, at
least initially, bid up the stocks of any Japanese company remotely
associated with the Internet and information technology to
astonishing levels.
</P>
<P>
   A study last year by the ministry and Andersen Consulting
concluded that while e-commerce in Japan would one day enjoy the
same market share it has in the United States, Japan's less
developed information technology infrastructure and its still
significant regulatory hurdles would mean a much slower rollout.
</P>
<P>
   But the big convenience store chains, which have the lion's
share of the market, are adding new ``virtual'' services and
connections at such a clip that analysts complain they cannot keep
track of it all. Almost simultaneously, the major chains have begun
introducing Internet strategies, raising questions about the
profitability of such ventures.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Convenience stores have a special place in Japanese society,
where tiny homes with space for only miniature refrigerators and
minimal storage make frequent shopping a necessity. Because of its
size, averaging about 100 square meters, the convenience store
escaped the reach of Japanese regulators and thus can be far
nimbler and more responsive to customer whims and fancies than its
larger brethren.
</P>
<P>
   At Seven-Eleven, inventory is controlled by some of the most
sophisticated inventory management and technology. Plus, unlike
other stores, most conbini are open round the clock.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 33,000 convenience stores throughout the
country and traffic in them is high: Some 900 people a day visit
the average Seven-Eleven store, while two other large chains,
FamilyMart and the Circle K Japan unit of UNY Corp., have about 700
customers a day. (Lawson, part of the Japanese retailer Daiei Inc.,
does not make its numbers available.) Makoto Usui, director and
general manager of information systems at Seven-Eleven, said the
average customer visits a Seven-Eleven store once every other day.
</P>
<P>
   The bonds are deep. When Hidetoshi Nakata, the Japanese soccer
star who plays for Rome, was asked an interview what he most missed
about home, he answered, ``Conbini.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Convenience stories' ubiquity and popularity make them
attractive partners to the many virtually unknown e-commerce
companies out there, whose biggest expense is likely to be
marketing. ``They have a huge advantage over the typical Internet
start-up,'' said Mike Allen, a retail analyst at ING Barings in
Tokyo. ``The biggest cost that has prevented dot-com companies from
making money is promotion, and convenience stores have almost no
promotional costs because customers flock to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The conbini have helped Japanese e-commerce pioneers like
Softbank Corp. and Rakuten Ichiba, an online bazaar, leap two major
hurdles: payment and delivery. Japanese consumers are more
reluctant than their American counterparts to send their credit
card account numbers out into cyberspace. And the product orders
can piggyback onto the stores' existing distribution system.
</P>
<P>
   The conbini also give consumers access to a computer terminal.
Though computers have been selling at a blistering pace here of
late, penetration is still lower than in the United States and
Internet access charges are still high in comparison with those in
other parts of the world. And though conbini customers cannot yet
surf the entire World Wide Web, they soon will be able to.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does a convenience store have that makes it attractive to
us and our customers?'' said Yasuhiro Suzuki, president and chief
executive of e-Shopping Information Corp., the Softbank unit that
manages e-commerce ventures. ``In a word, convenience.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Operations like Suzuki's would, in turn, appear to solve a major
problem for Japanese convenience stores: the lack of space. The
only way they have kept sales moving forward is by opening more
stores; in general, sales in stores open at least one year are
falling. But there are few practical locations left.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The backdrop of expanding our business to include e-commerce
is the need to expand our current offering of goods and services
and increase our ability to meet the needs of customers without
expanding our space,'' said Usui of Seven-Eleven.
</P>
<P>
   Whether e-commerce will help the convenience stores become more
profitable is unclear. Take the introduction of so-called energy
drinks. Previously sold only in drugstores, convenience stores
started selling the vitamin- and herb-laced drinks last spring,
when deregulation opened the market to them.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the addition of beer and sake to the merchandise mix
five years ago, the introduction of energy drinks has not
significantly increased the stores' overall revenues. While sales
of the new product have met projections, they merely replaced those
of the other items that previously occupied the selling space.
</P>
<P>
   Though those constraints do not exist in cyberspace, there, too,
profitability may be a problem. E-Shopping! Books, the joint
venture, was billed as a baby Amazon.com, but sales so far are
minuscule: as of the end of January, each Seven-Eleven store was
selling four books every 10 days on average.
</P>
<P>
   Suzuki said that represented a quadrupling in volume since the
service started in November, and added, ``The progress we've seen
in the business has been better than expected.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was confident the business would turn profitable, in
part because its cost structure may be lower than Amazon.com's.
E-Shopping! Books does not shoulder the costs of warehousing
merchandise, since it can use Tohan's and Seven-Eleven's
warehouses, and it pays for the books only after they have been
sold. The business will also share the e-shopping! name,
administrative functions and technological infrastructure with
Softbank's online toy and car parts businesses, as well as others
introduced in the future, cutting marketing and administrative
costs.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``A newcomer to the business would have a tough time finding
temporary warehousing for delivery to customers, but convenience
stores can act as the final pick-up point quite easily because of
their infrastructure,'' said Ken Sakamura, a professor at Tokyo
University. ``They already have warehouses.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But while such teamwork lowers costs, it also means that
profits, should they materialize, have to be divided.
</P>
<P>
   The same sort of division of the spoils has so far, in an
experimental stage, proven unprofitable for the conbini. Although
polls show that consumers here have long wished for automated
teller machines in convenience stores, they haven't used the ATMs
enough in the few months they have been available to make it
worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   The machines allow customers to do everything from arrange money
transfers to make deposits and withdrawals and even obtain small
consumer loans. Allen at ING Barings said 100 transactions a day
were needed to make store-based ATMs profitable. In test cases by
various convenience store chains, which have placed ATMs in their
bigger stores, transactions are running at 10 to 50 a day, a level
that generates a loss for the stores after they pay their banking
partner and their technology and software providers.
</P>
<P>
   To help overcome this barrier to profitability, Ito-Yokado Co.,
which controls Seven-Eleven, plans to apply for a banking license.
</P>
<P>
   The most promising area of new business for the convenience
stores is likely to be online services like ticketing and
reservations. Such services are popular _ and go quickly _ because
people typically know exactly what they are looking for, said
Hideki Tanaka, an e-commerce analyst at the Fujitsu Research
Institute. ``But I question whether the typical convenience store
customer is going to take 10 or 20 extra minutes to stand at a
computer terminal in the store browsing for goods they want to
buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering that the most popular use of Loppi, Lawson's online
system, is looking up one's horoscope, that is a question well
worth contemplating.

   Surging petroleum prices pushed the Consumer Price Index in
February to its highest level in three years, the Labor Department
reported Friday. But beyond fuel and energy, the nation remained
remarkably free of the rising inflation that the booming economy
was expected to have produced by now.
</P>
<P>
   The index, the nation's best-known inflation gauge, has risen by
3.2 percent over the last 12 months, the first time the yearlong
rate had gone above 3 percent since February 1997. But with energy
excluded, the annual rate was only 2.1 percent, unchanged for many
months, although some economists had expected a much greater impact
from labor shortages and rising wages.
</P>
<P>
   The inflation rate remained at 2.1 percent when food was
excluded as well as energy. Prices in these sectors often jump
around from month to month, so economists subtract them to get a
``core'' inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a certain bizarre way, life would be easier for Alan
Greenspan and the Federal Reserve if there had been a bad CPI,''
said Robert Barbera, chief economist for Hoenig Group. ``They could
then have dealt with their real problem, an excessively high stock
market, and blamed their actions on inflation in goods and
services.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's policy-makers are expected to raise interest rates
when they meet on Tuesday, but not by enough to inhibit stock
market investors, many analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Most of last month's increase of 0.5 percent _ the largest
one-month rise since last April _ reflected the runup in petroleum
prices. Gasoline at the pump averaged $1.42 a gallon, up from $1.36
in January. Airline fares rose as airlines tacked on surcharges to
cover higher fuel prices. And the cost of running a home rose,
reflecting higher prices for heating oil and natural gas, whose
price fluctuates with that of petroleum.
</P>
<P>
   Natural gas is widely used to generate electricity, and
electricity rates jumped by 0.8 percent in February, the biggest
increase since July 1997. So far, however, the rise in petroleum
and natural gas prices has not spread to other products, like
plastics, which are made from oil or natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   Toy prices, for example, did not rise, and vehicle prices,
adjusted for quality improvements, fell last month, the Bureau of
Labor Statistics reported. Even truckers have not managed to jack
up freight rates, although the squeeze on their earnings from
higher fuel prices has truckers protesting in Washington for
relief.
</P>
<P>
   That will change, says Chris Varvares, a partner at
Macroeconomic Advisers LLC in St. Louis, if the petroleum-producing
countries somehow manage to make the oil price increases stick.
</P>
<P>
   ``If companies expect the increase to be temporary, they will
eat the cost and squeeze profit margins temporarily,'' he said.
``But if energy prices stay high, firms will try to restore their
profits by raising prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond energy, there were scattered price increases, in
cigarettes, for example, and hospital rates. Meat and pork prices
rose by 1.7 percent, which is more than usual, and such increases
may repeat themselves because of a supply shortage, said Patrick
Jackman, a senior economist in the consumer price division at the
Bureau of Labor Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Fruit and vegetable prices also rose last month, but the 0.7
percent increase mainly reflected an aberration in the way prices
are adjusted for seasonal factors, Jackman said.
</P>
<P>
   And some prices fell in February. Vehicle prices dropped by 0.1
percent after a 0.3 percent drop in January. Long-distance
telephone rates also fell, along with the cost of purchasing and
using a cell phone.

 &HT;    Program helps congregations clean up flooded churches
 &HT;    By Travis Fain
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRIFTON, N.C. _ Even when floodwaters rose up inside, the old
brick chapel was home for Janet Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   It had been for 42 years. No water was going to change that.
</P>
<P>
   ``'Been a lot of places and come back here,'' she said last
week, standing in the doorway of Grifton Chapel Church of Christ.
``Wouldn't take anything in the world for it still.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson's church was hit hard by the flood. Waters took the
cushioned pews and ruined every one. Water warped the wood floors,
soaked the walls and rotted the joints of the building. Water took
the Bibles and hymnals. It stole the church piano and all the
electrical wiring.
</P>
<P>
   But it could not steal the faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the backbone of the community, especially in times of
devastation,'' Nelson said. ``There's just something about
exhibiting the faith. It just all extends from the churches.''
</P>
<P>
   Devastation came to eastern North Carolina through the clouds
Sept. 15. Prayers were lifted, but they did not keep the water out
of area churches. So the source of strength for many at the center
of recovery efforts in times past was faced with recovery itself.
</P>
<P>
   An exact count of how many churches were damaged doesn't exist,
but the number easily reaches into the hundreds. When the
floodwaters hit, no government programs existed to help
congregations rebuild. So the state organized the Church2Church
program, which matches funds and volunteers from donor churches to
the needs of flooded ones.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 eastern North Carolina churches have requested the
program's help since the water receded. Forty of them still have
major needs, according Sherrie Stutler, program coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve of the 100 churches are in Pitt County. One of them _ New
Covenant Holy Church in Ayden _ will probably have to be demolished
and relocated, Stutler said.
</P>
<P>
   The government side of Church2Church closes shop March 31, but
the hope is that the church partnerships will endure. Stutler said
members separated by distance and denomination find themselves
forging lifelong friendships through the program.
</P>
<P>
   Without these type of volunteer efforts, it would take some
churches years to recover, according to area pastors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd be at a standstill, really,'' said the Rev. Jesse L.
Wilson of Grifton Free Will Baptist Church. ``Because 80 percent of
my membership lost their homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's church is on Contentnea Drive. Up and down the street
near Contentnea Creek, mobile homes were floated off their
moorings, some deposited on their sides. The church building
remains, but not much else. Inside the chapel, volunteers and
congregation members are starting from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true across the street. There, Coley's Chapel is
vacant and unmarked. A few flood-soaked Bibles and ruined church
pews offer the only clues that the gutted building was once a house
of worship. Both churches are leaning on volunteers from the
Baptist Men Disaster Recovery effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't classify it as a tragedy,'' said Wilson. ``I would
classify it as an opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am amazed, yet thankful.''
</P>
<P>
   The Baptist Men are rebuilding 10 churches in Pitt County and
the surrounding area, mostly with volunteer help from outside of
eastern North Carolina. The organization is also repairing or
demolishing close to 400 homes, according to Beddie Tarlton of
Wingate, who is coordinating the effort from Grifton with her
husband, Billy.
</P>
<P>
   The couple is living in a camper while the work is done. They
slept on cots in a Sunday School room when they first arrived.
They'll stay as long as they can help, Tarlton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just to see the desperation on the pastors' faces and hear
them talk, and we present them with a plan of help _ you can see
the weight lifted off their shoulders,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the churches Tarlton's group is helping are in Grifton.
They're rebuilding Zion Temple African Methodist Episcopal Zion
Church, which sits without a floor down the street from Grifton
Free Will Baptist. They're working on New Covenant Church and are
already finished at the Tabernacle of Prayer.
</P>
<P>
   And when they get done at Grifton Chapel Church of Christ,
members expect the sanctuary to be better than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lord has provided abundantly in terms of volunteer help,
as well as financial resources,'' said Clifton Manuel, rebuilding
project coordinator at the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things will get back to normal. I have no doubt. I never had
any.''
</P>
<P>
   What amazes Vernon Morris about the help that's come to eastern
North Carolina is how it cuts across denominational lines.
</P>
<P>
   The Church of God sanctuary, where he once pastored and will
still attend services once construction reclaims it from the flood,
wouldn't have stood a chance without help from a Baptist church in
Raleigh, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Eight feet of water washed into the Mumford Road church in the
days following Hurricane Floyd. After the water receded, members of
Hayes Barton Baptist Church just walked right up and asked to help,
Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   That members of another denomination would volunteer so readily
has renewed Morris' faith in Christianity, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Church that's not part of our denomination _ don't know us
from Adam,'' he said. ``They said they just want to be a
blessing.''
</P>
<P>
   Tarlton and Stutler said the same is true of volunteers with
their programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work well with Methodists, Presbyterians ... We pick a lot
(on each other),'' Tarlton said. ``We have a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   The floodwaters that flowed through Morris' church and turned
Mumford Road in to a river also took his mother's home in nearby
Tice Mobile Home Park. The congregation of about 30 has kept up
services, rotating between people's homes, but 77-year-old Ann
Morris misses the church.
</P>
<P>
   But both son and mother say they will rebuild and that things
will be better once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shocks you, but it didn't knock you down,'' Vernon said.
``You lean back on the Lord and say, 'Well, we built it once, we'll
build it again.'''
</P>
<P>
   The roof has already been replaced at the church. There's no way
the tiny congregation could have moved so quickly without help.
</P>
<P>
   ``God sent 'em here,'' Ann said of the volunteers. ``I believe
that. It's just a miracle.''

   GUNS-SMITH (Washington) _ Smith &AMP; Wesson, the nation's oldest
and largest manufacturer of handguns, agrees to accept a wide array
of restrictions on the way it makes, sells and distributes hundreds
of thousands of handguns each year in exchange for ending some of
the law suits that threatened to bankrupt it. The agreement
represents a major splintering in the powerful alliance of gun
makers and owners that has thwarted tough gun laws in Washington
and state capitals for years. And it opens a new avenue for
regulating the firearms industry without action from Congress,
where partisan gridlock has stalled even modest gun-control
legislation in recent months. By James Dao. (We plan to move the

U.S. AGENCY PUTS MORATORIUM ON RAIL MERGERS, BLOCKING A MAJOR
DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Canada, N.D.)   (bl)  
 By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Regulators in Washington imposed a 15-month moratorium on all
rail mergers Friday, abruptly blocking a plan to create an enormous
cross-border freight system but giving a boost to rail stocks that
have languished since the proposed North American rail merger was
announced in December.
</P>
<P>
   The three members of the Surface Transportation Board said the
delay would provide an opportunity to formulate new merger rules
that would tighten performance standards and prevent the kind of
service interruptions that have plagued recent rail mergers.
</P>
<P>
   They also agreed with competing railroads that a merger at this
time was likely to trigger a wild round of deal making and
consolidations that would limit competition and end, eventually,
with just two huge rail systems left to serve all of North America.
</P>
<P>
   ``It simply makes no sense to attempt to develop new merger
rules in the middle of what could be the final round of major
railroad mergers,'' the board said in its decision.
</P>
<P>
   The rail companies that planned to merge, Burlington Northern
Santa Fe Corp. Railroad and the Canadian National Railway,
responded testily to Friday's decision, charging that there is no
justification for the board to delay their application based on
problems caused by their competitors' inability to complete their
own mergers smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian National on Friday filed an appeal at the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit challenging the
regulatory board's authority to issue a moratorium.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``The effect of the STB decision is to deprive CN and BNSF of
their statutory right to a prompt and fair hearing,'' Paul M.
Tellier, the president of Canadian National, said in a written
statement from company headquarters in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   All railroad stocks have suffered since the merger was announced
last year, but none more so than Burlington Northern and Canadian
National. Both hit 52-week lows last week.
</P>
<P>
   But prices rose Friday after the board's decision was announced.
Shares of Burlington Northern increased $1.25, to $22.25, and
Canadian National shares jumped 93.75 cents, to $28.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gray cloud that has hovered over every railroad has been
lifted, at least temporarily,'' said Douglas W. Rockel, a railroad
analyst with ING Barings.
</P>
<P>
   What is not certain, said Rockel and other analysts, is whether
the moratorium and the change in rules will delay or kill the
planned merger between Burlington Northern and Canadian National.
</P>
<P>
   James J. Valentine, an analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter,
said the two railroads may be forced to rethink the terms of the
merger. ``What was valid six months ago when this deal was first
put together,'' Valentine said, ``may no longer be valid in about
three years, which would be the soonest the merger could happen
with this latest delay.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It can take the board up to 16 months to reach a decision on a
merger application.
</P>
<P>
   In issuing its first moratorium on mergers, the STB acted in
contradiction to Transportation Secretary Rodney E. Slater, who at
public hearings last week opposed a formal delay while encouraging
a comprehensive review of the rail industry.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, a spate of mergers had reduced the number of
large railroads in the United States and Canada to just seven. The
consolidations caused major shipping disruptions as the new
railroads tried to coordinate their activities.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Burlington Northern and Canadian National surprised
regulators by announcing plans to combine their lines and create a
50,000-mile international rail system that would provide
uninterrupted freight service in more than 30 states and 8 Canadian
provinces.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Canadian laws governing Canadian National, which was
state-run until the early 1990s, the new company, to be called
North American Railways, would have its headquarters in Montreal. A
majority of its board members also would have to be Canadian.
</P>
<P>
   Company executives on both sides of the border questioned the
fairness of changing the rules after the two lines had already
begun the process of merging.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to believe that a federal agency can change the
rules and deny us a forum, established by law, to have our case
heard,'' Robert D. Krebs, chairman and chief executive of
Burlington Northern said in a statement from company headquarters
in Fort Worth. ``If the STB decision survives judicial review,''
Krebs added, Burlington Northern and Canadian National, as well as
shippers that rely on the line to transport their products, ``will
be denied the opportunity to realize service and efficiency
improvements.''
</P>
<P>
   In its written decision, the Surface Transportation Board, which
succeeded the Interstate Commerce Commission as regulator of the
rail industry, cited concerns from shippers and competing lines
that the rail freight industry has yet to recover from previous
mergers, a complaint repeated frequently during four days of
hearings before the board last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot in good conscience allow further actions to occur
that I believe would run the risk of creating more disruption and
instability,''said Linda J. Morgan, the board chairwoman, in a
commentary accompanying the decision.
</P>
<P>
   There was some disagreement within the board over the length of
a delay. Morgan indicated that she had initially favored a full
two-year moratorium, while another member of the board, the vice
chairman Wayne O. Burkes, argued that two years was too long.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., opposed the merger and favored a
moratorium of up to five years. He said the 15-month delay was ``a
good start'' and, along with the new standards, ``may well result
in no additional mergers in the rail industry.''

SWEET BUYS IN LEMONS OF CAR-DEALER STOCKS?  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 19) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ore., N.Y., N.C.)   (af)  
 By MICHELLE LEDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At first, it hardly seems worth the effort to kick the tires of
beaten-up auto dealership stocks. Interest rates are rising,
gasoline is more than $1.50 a gallon at the pump, and competition
from online car dealers like Autobytel.com and Autoweb has scared
investors.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, America's largest automotive dealership,
AutoNation, under its chairman, H. Wayne Huizenga, has put a chill
on the sector. Analysts say it overpaid for acquisitions, found
itself undercut on prices because of a misguided ``no haggle''
pricing policy and was forced to shutter 23 used-car superstores.
</P>
<P>
   Its rental car division, which includes Alamo and National, has
also suffered and is being spun off to shareholders. AutoNation's
stock is down 37.2 percent over the last 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Its rivals, the UnitedAuto Group, Lithia Motors and Sonic
Automotive have not had these same problems. Yet all of their
stocks have hit 52-week lows in the last two months.
</P>
<P>
   So, are any of these stocks good values? Well, Americans'
penchant for new cars shows few signs of easing. In February,
United States car and light truck sales rose 6.1 percent, putting
the nation on course to hit a record 17.7 million in vehicle sales
this year versus 16.96 million vehicles last year.
</P>
<P>
   And the dealership companies as a whole posted 37.5 percent
earnings growth in 1999 and should grow 20 percent to 30 percent
this year, said Tom Thomson, an analyst at First Union Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the industry remains ripe for consolidation. ``This is
a very fragmented market, with the top 10 players only accounting
for 5 percent of the market,'' said Timothy G. Fogarty, an analyst
at ING Barings.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is prompting some investors to take a closer look at
auto dealers. Juliet Ellis, manager of the Chase Vista Small Cap
Equity fund, said she considered Lithia of Medford, Ore., to be a
growth stock because the company's earnings rose 40 percent in
1999. But its sharp drop in price also makes the stock appealing to
value investors, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Lithia, with 101 dealer franchises, is focused on six Western
states and has been growing quickly through well-priced
acquisitions. ``They know what they are doing,'' Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   She added that Lithia is relatively well-insulated from a
possible downturn of the economy, because its fixed costs are low
and its margins are high. Lithia's Class A shares closed on Friday
at $15.50. Fogarty has a strong buy on the stock, and a 12-month
price target of $30.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of UnitedAuto, which is based in Manhattan but operates
104 franchises mostly in the South, hit a 52-week low of $7.4375
last Tuesday. But sales for franchises open at least a year were up
9.7 percent for the fourth quarter, and its financing and insurance
business revenues were up an impressive 22.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The company is unloading underperforming dealerships and is
benefiting from the leadership, analysts say, of Roger Penske,
named chief executive last May. Penske, who is also chairman of
Penske Corp., the transportation giant, holds a stake of more than
40 percent in UnitedAuto. In December, the company announced plans
to buy back three million of its shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``Penske is a winner, or at least he has been in previous
business ventures,'' said Gordon Grender, manager of the GAMerica
Capital fund. Shares now trade at $8.6875, or 7.9 times his 2000
earnings estimate of $1.10 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Sonic Automotive, of Charlotte, N.C., operates 165 franchises in
12 states, mostly in the Southeast and California. The company's
earnings growth has been 50 percent or more for nine consecutive
quarters. The stock now trades at $8.5625.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sonic is the best of the bunch,'' said N. Richard Nelson Jr.,
an analyst at Stephens Inc., who thinks the shares can hit $25 in
12 months.

CLINTON'S REQUEST FOR POSTPONEMENT DENIED BY ARKANSAS LAWYERS
PANEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The special lawyers committee in Arkansas that is
considering an ethics complaint against President Clinton that
could lead to the suspension or revocation of his law license
Friday rejected his request to postpone the case until after he
leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   The committee chairman, Ken Reeves, said in a letter that
Clinton has only until April 21 to answer the complaints that he
lied under oath about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky and
should be disciplined. Clinton's lawyer, David Kendall, said
Thursday that he had asked the committee to extend the time for the
president to file a response until one month after he leaves
office, or sometime in February 2001.
</P>
<P>
   But Reeves, who is chairman of the Committee on Professional
Conduct of the Supreme Court of Arkansas, said in a letter sent to
one of the parties who first brought the complaint that he has set
April 21 as the deadline to respond.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to L. Lynn Hogue, a lawyer with the Southeastern
Legal Foundation, the conservative group that brought one
complaint, Reeves said that the committee had considered Kendall's
request for an extension of nearly a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``After consultation with the committee, I, as committee
chairman, have granted an extension until Friday, April 21, 2000,
for a response to be filed,'' Reeves added.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall did not return telephone calls Friday for comment.
Stephen Engstrom, a Little Rock lawyer who represents Clinton
before the disciplinary committee, declined comment when reached by
telephone.
</P>
<P>
   The case involves Clinton's statements under oath on Jan. 17,
1998, when he gave a deposition in the sexual misconduct lawsuit
brought against him by Paula Jones. In the presence of Judge Susan
Weber Wright, who was presiding over the civil lawsuit, Clinton
said that he had never engaged in a sexual relationship with
Lewinsky, a one-time White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton has continued to insist his answer was legally
accurate, Wright strongly disagreed and ruled that he was in civil
contempt of court. She said that the president had subverted the
rule of law and violated Jones' right to information in her civil
rights lawsuit, and she asked the disciplinary committee to
consider some kind of action against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew J. Glavin, the president of the Southeastern Legal
Foundation said Friday night that he was gratified that the
committee did not accede to Kendall's request for a delay of nearly
a year.
</P>
<P>
   The committee imposes some kind of sanctions on as many as 100
people a year who are licensed to practice law in Arkansas as is
Clinton. Typically, the seven-member committee recommends
disbarment, the most severe sanction, only in cases in which a
lawyer has stolen money from a client. Lesser punishments may
include suspension of a license for up to two years or a public
reprimand.

ESIASON SAYS ALL THE WRONG THINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The TV sports world according to me:
</P>
<P>
   Boomer Esiason isn't the first athlete with a lack of
perspective about his career. He is the most recent, though, to
announce it to the world.
</P>
<P>
   When the former NFL quarterback was fired as the analyst on
ABC's Monday Night Football, he lashed out at his employers and
play-by-play man Al Michaels, saying he did everything he was asked
and putting some of the blame on Michaels. ``Al has what ... he's
always wanted, a single-man booth,'' said Esiason.
</P>
<P>
   Esiason entirely misses the reasons why he was fired. He came
into games unprepared, and it showed in his shallow analysis. He
never improved in important areas, like making his points
succinctly. Late into his second year, he was still talking over
live plays and not matching his comments to replays or Michaels
comments between plays. His enthusiasm was all over the place, too.
</P>
<P>
   Esiason's smack at Michaels was cheap. Michaels is one of the
few play-by-play men who can offer astute analysis on games, yet
he's one of the best at setting up his colormen and creating
quality team broadcasting. The proof: Dan Dierdorf for a decade on
MNF, and Jim Palmer and Tim McCarver on baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Michaels defended Esiason all season as critics and viewers took
shots at his partner, and he declined to be drawn into a
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Worse yet, Esiason ignored the suggestions of the producer
(Kenny Wolfe) and director (Craig Janoff) and wound up taking them
down with him. ABC Sports President Howard Katz has named one-time
MNF producer Don Ohlmeyer as Executive Producer for MNF and handed
him the task of rebuilding the program.
</P>
<P>
   Ohlmeyer's mandate is to raise the entertainment level on the
telecast, which has waned some the last five years. While there's
plenty of candidates -- Bill Parcells, Jimmy Johnson, Dan Marino,
John Elway, Dick Vermeil -- they don't have the kind of charisma or
presence ABC is looking for.
</P>
<P>
   The one person ABC wants is Steve Young, who excelled as a
studio guest during ABC's Super Bowl coverage, but he's determined
to continue his career despite having suffered several concussions.
Joe Theismann, an analyst on ESPN's Sunday night telecasts, is also
a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Talk talk
</P>
<P>
   Fox Sports' latest pre-emptive media move this week was to sign
a programming and licensing agreement with Premiere Radio, a
separate company within Clear Channel, which owns XTRA (690 AM),
KXTA (1150 am) and KIIS (102.7 FM). Premiere owns Jim Rome's show,
which is heard on both AM stations.
</P>
<P>
   Fox will provide talent and editorial content and Premier will
find affiliates for its sports-talk shows and handle the
advertising and sales end. Tony Bruno, who left ESPN Radio late
last year, has joined Premiere as a morning talk show host, and
Fox/Premiere hopes to create radio opportunities for Terry
Bradshaw, Howie Long, Cris Collinsworth and Keith Olbermann.
</P>
<P>
   The deal isn't likely to have an immediate impact on either XTRA
or KXTA. XTRA is happy with its current lineup, and most of the
on-air people at KXTA have contracts into 2001, including the
Indianapolis-based Bob and Tom morning show. Olbermann currently
has a separate radio deal with the Sports Fan Radio Network.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ideally, we'd like to pickup some night and weekend
programming,'' said KXTA station manager Mike Thompson. ``We carry
a lot of ESPN programming now, but we don't have a contract with
them.'' ESPN talk shows and events are aired on an ad barter basis.
</P>
<P>
   Clear Channel has a pending deal to buy AMFM, another radio
power which owns KFI, KLAC and two FM stations. The launch of a
third sports talk station might be spreading things thin, but
having a relationship with KLAC could solve some game programming
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   And now the news
</P>
<P>
   One-on-One Sports (KCTD, 1540 am) will air Los Angeles Avengers
indoor football games beginning with an exhibition game March 27.
Larry Kahn and Mike Lamb, the one-time voices of USC football, will
handle the broadcasts ... CBS has paired former Laker star James
Worthy, who has done some special work at Fox Sports Net, with Dick
Enberg, replacing Al Maguire, who chose to retire on the eve of the
tourney for health reasons. He suffers from anemia, and felt he
couldn't handle the first weekend workload (six games). ... Regards
go out to the family and friends of Bill Daniels, the cable czar
who created Prime Ticket (now Fox Sports Net) and passed away March
7. Daniels was a terrific businessman and gentleman before the
current era of corporate ownership of cable companies and sports
franchises. ... Angels games will be heard on KRLA (1110 am) this
season, with KCTD and KIK (94.3 FM) taking games farmed out because
of programming conflicts. ... XTRA's Joe Tutino and partner Rick
Davis launch the new MLS season for the Galaxy with Saturday's
simulcast (7:30 p.m., Fox Sports Net, KRLA). ... Long Beach Grand
Prix COO Jim Michaelian guests on Irv Kaze's KIEV (870 am) talk
show Saturday (6 p.m.). ... ESPN2's ``Big League Challenge,'' a new
version of Home Run Derby, begins a two-week run Monday (2:30 p.m.,
with later repeats). Mark McGwire, ex-Dirtbag Jason Giambi, the
Dodgers' Shawn Green and former Dodger Mike Piazza are among the
participants. ESPN reruns the shows beginning April 6 (4 p.m.). ...
HBO's ``Real Sports'' Monday (10 p.m.) includes a piece on Bobby
Knight and ex-Indiana star Luke Recker. ... Howie Long's acting
career continues. He begins shooting ``3,000 Miles to Graceland''
this week with sports thespians Kevin Costner (three baseball
films) and Kurt Russell (one football flick).

CLINTON'S TRIP TO INDIA IS SEEN AS MAINLY SYMBOLIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also INDIA-U.S.) 
(lb) 
 By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Like a family preparing for a sumptuous
wedding that will unite two great ancestral lines, India has been
dressing itself up for its first visit from a U.S. president in
over two decades _ a visit in which the world's largest democracy
and its most powerful one will again try to build an alliance that
has eluded them for a half-century.
</P>
<P>
   With President Clinton touching down here on Sunday evening,
workmen were out in force on Saturday. There were battalions of
malis _ or gardeners _ planting frowsy-headed yellow dahlias along
the route he will drive. Sweepers with spiky brooms were ridding
lawns of leaves and teams of men were pushing wheelbarrows of
steaming tar to spread in potholes.
</P>
<P>
   But if the relationship between India and the United States is
to progress, it will require more of the genuine love that builds a
good marriage than the decoration and repair undertaken before a
wedding party.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton _ cast as an Indian bridegroom on the cover of a news
magazine here in a full-length golden jacket and curly-toed
slippers _ recently decided to make the trip despite the failure of
intensive U.S. efforts to persuade India to sign the nuclear test
ban treaty or to cap their nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   But with his tenure as president running out, Clinton's timing,
again, has not proved lucky, as relations between India and its
longtime rival and neighbor, Pakistan, have continued to
deteriorate sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's decision to pay the briefest of visits to the United
States' old ally, Pakistan _ despite the explicit opposition of the
Indian prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, and his request that
the Americans instead put Pakistan on a list of terrorist states _
has tempered any euphoria here about the president's far longer,
five-day visit to India.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. diplomats, businessmen and policy analysts have been trying
to convince India, the subcontinent's economic power, that the
president's visit is fundamentally about building a broader, deeper
relationship _ one that will encompass cooperative efforts in
trade, science and technology, the environment and health, among
others.
</P>
<P>
   And the Indians, who do not like being treated as though their
country is no more important than far smaller Pakistan, seem
encouraged by a speech that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
gave last week, and its not-so-veiled criticisms of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   While declaring India's decision to conduct nuclear tests ``a
historic mistake,'' she also said that Pakistan should take steps
to ``address the effects of terror on Pakistan's neighbors, notably
India.'' The United States has asked Pakistan to ban a
Pakistan-based Islamic fundamentalist group that the Americans have
categorized as terrorist _ and whose members are waging a holy war
against India in the disputed territory of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians in India applauded the remarks meant for Pakistan in
which Albright also said the so-called line of control that divides
Kashmir into Indian- and Pakistani-held portions must be respected.
India holds Pakistan responsible for organizing an incursion into
Indian territory last summer that led to a vicious confrontation
between these two nuclear-armed nations.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian foreign minister, Jaswant Singh, referred with
satisfaction on Thursday to Albright's ``reaffirmation of the
validity of the Line of Control.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Wisner, who was the U.S. ambassador to India from 1994 to
1997, said Albright's speech was an indication of the United
States' willingness to talk turkey to the Pakistanis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having watched us be careful and nuanced over the years, that
was not careful and nuanced; that was blunt,'' he said. ``If this
speech does not make clear the explicit difference in the American
view of India and Pakistan, I don't know what else you need. A
four-and-a-half day visit to India and a four-and-a-half hour visit
to Pakistan?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The estrangement between India and the United States _ two
great, multicultural democracies that would seem to have so much in
common _ stretches back to the 1950s and the height of the Cold
War. India, the proud new nation finally freed of colonial
domination, chose the path of nonalignment, while Pakistan, its
smaller, insecure neighbor, sought to ally with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, the Americans grew cozy with Pakistan's
military dictators, funneling billions of dollars in military aid
that sometimes wound up turned against India. By the early 1970s,
India had drawn closer to the Soviet Union. When the Soviets
invaded Afghanistan in 1979, India refused to condemn the
aggression, while Pakistan was a key player in U.S. support for the
Islamic mujahedeen battling the Soviet army.
</P>
<P>
   With the crumbling of the Soviet Union and India's decision in
1991 to begin loosening barriers to trade and investment, the
conditions that had kept socialist India and capitalist America
apart were profoundly changed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, old habits of mistrust die hard. India, craving
recognition as a global power, often finds what it sees as U.S.
arrogance hard to take. In the eyes of many Indians, the U.S.
opposition to the nuclear tests seemed the height of hypocrisy,
coming from a nation that still has thousands of nuclear warheads.
</P>
<P>
   The former Indian foreign secretary, J.N. Dixit, has described
the Indo-American relationship with the Hindi word ``panga,'' which
roughly translates as prickly, petulant, confrontational.
</P>
<P>
   K. Subrahmanyam, who recently headed a committee that looked
into army intelligence failures for the Indian government, offered
a perfect illustration of panga in his contentious reaction to
Clinton's tour of India.
</P>
<P>
   ``This visit is purely symbolic of the fact that two years after
the nuclear tests, India has done nothing to comply with the
stentorian demands of the nuclear hegemonists and still the U.S.
president is coming to visit,'' Subrahmanyam declared in his own
stentorian tones. ``In spite of all the rhetoric, the United States
accepts reality.''
</P>
<P>
   A stream of Americans from Washington institutions have come
through Delhi in recent weeks and many of them have been advising
the president to brave the thorny task of talking with the Indians
for the sake of the rose _ better relations with a country that is
the second-most populous in the world, with an economy growing at a
rate that has averaged over 6 percent since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Few expect any developments of earth-shaking importance from the
visit. India has already declared that the test ban treaty and its
relations with Pakistan are not open for negotiation. Still, given
the history, the symbolism of the visit itself may have content.
</P>
<P>
   Like the rituals of a wedding, the ceremonies of a state visit
could lay the foundations for a new understanding _ at least that
is what diplomats on both sides hope.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd I. Rudolph, an old India hand and a political scientist at
the University of Chicago, said that after over 20 years of neglect
_ the last visit of a U.S. president was that of Jimmy Carter in
1976 _ the Americans need to finally go and pay their respects.
``You sometimes have to have a cup of tea before people will trust
you,'' he said.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ A Muslim cleric formerly known as H. Rap Brown, a
leader of the Black Panthers in the 1960s, was the subject of an
intense citywide manhunt Friday after a Fulton County sheriff's
deputy said the cleric shot him and another deputy near downtown
Atlanta late Wednesday. The second deputy died of his injuries this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The cleric, now known as Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin, has lived in
relative peace in Atlanta's West End neighborhood after serving
five years behind bars in New York for attempted armed robbery.
Atlanta Police Chief Beverly Harvard said the deputy selected
Al-Amin's picture from a photo array as the man who fired an
assault rifle at the two deputies at close range. The department is
now seeking him on a murder warrant.
</P>
<P>
   One of the deputies, Ricky Kinchen, 35, lost most of his blood
at the scene and died at Grady Memorial Hospital on Friday
afternoon after undergoing three operations. The other deputy,
Aldranon English, 28, was less seriously wounded and was able to
describe the shooting incident to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   According to Harvard, the deputies, who are black, were
attempting to arrest Al-Amin on a warrant issued by suburban Cobb
County in January after Al-Amin failed to appear in court to answer
charges in connection with a traffic stop last May. Al-Amin had
been accused of driving a stolen Ford Explorer, having improper
insurance documents, and of impersonating a police officer by
flashing a fake badge and claiming he was a police officer in
Whitehall, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   The deputies _ who knew nothing of Al-Amin's background _ were
unable to find him at his house or his nearby grocery store when
they arrived at about 10:30 Wednesday, Harvard said, and were
circling the area when a black Mercedes pulled up near the rear of
the store. The deputies approached the car and asked the driver to
get out, which he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the deputies was concerned that he could not see the
person's hands after he had asked him to get out of the vehicle,''
Harvard said, apparently referring to the gunman's long coat. ``The
deputy then asked him to show his hands, and the person responded
by saying, `Okay, here they are.' And at that point in time, the
two sheriff's deputies were fired upon.'' One of the deputies also
managed to shoot the gunman.
</P>
<P>
   Police investigators later found shell casings from a
.223-caliber semi-automatic assault rifle and a 9-mm handgun. The
rifle's immense power apparently tore through the deputies'
bulletproof vests; one doctor at Grady told the sheriff's
department that the wounds reminded him of those seen in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   English was able to radio for help, but by the time the police
arrived, the gunman and the Mercedes were gone, and the deputies
could not get a license number. Harvard said police also found a
blood trail leading to a vacant house a block and a half away, but
no one was in the house. She said the deputies did not know whether
the bleeding gunman had fled on foot, or driven away, or whether a
second person might have moved the car. Late Friday, the police
said they were also looking for a green Toyota in connection with
the case, but would not explain the car's connection.
</P>
<P>
   Police and sheriff's investigators searched the four-block area
for hours last night with SWAT teams, dogs and helicopters, but the
gunman was not found. Now the search has been extended throughout
the city, she said, including airports and transportation hubs. The
Police Department later said a nationwide all-points bulletin had
been issued for his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, H. Rap Brown's beret, goatee, and direct,
confrontational language made him one of the best-known leaders of
the Black Panther party. The Baton Rouge native had earlier been a
leader of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee,
registering voters in Alabama, but grew disenchanted with civil
disobedience and began advocating violence as justice minister of
the Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be trying to love that honky to death,'' he told a crowd
in Cambridge, Md., in July 1967. ``Shoot him to death. Shoot him to
death, brother, because that's what he is out to do to you.'' A few
hours later, a riot began in the town during which police officers
and black residents exchanged gunfire. Brown was charged with
inciting a riot, and after being freed on bail, was later charged
with carrying a gun across state lines while under indictment. He
went underground and was captured in 1971, after a shootout with
police in a New York City bar in a botched robbery.
</P>
<P>
   He converted to Islam while serving time on the robbery charges
at Rikers Island in New York City, and moved to Atlanta after he
was paroled in 1976. Since then, he has become one of the city's
most prominent Muslim clerics, opening a Sunni mosque known as the
Community Masjid in a ramshackle house across from the shooting
site, and working with neighborhood leaders to help clean up the
impoverished area. His friends and colleagues said they thought he
had renounced violence, and found it hard to imagine that he would
have gunned down two law enforcement officers,
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a principled man, a no-nonsense man with strong beliefs,
but not a violent man,'' said William Abdur-Rahim, imam of the
Masjid Al-Muminun and a member of the city's police Civilian Review
Board who has known Al-Amin for 20 years. ``There are those who
believe he's been pursued for years by entities of law enforcement
who held grievances against him. But we just do not know what could
have happened here.''

GETTING THE GUNS OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all the gun-control propositions, one of the least
controversial is the gun buyback program, which several cities have
used to reduce the arsenal of firearms in closets, under
mattresses, or in car glove compartments. Even the most dogged
defenders of the right to bear arms cannot object to governments
paying $50 for guns that might otherwise end up in a first-grade
classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a Republican congressman from New York has found a legal
basis to oppose a Clinton administration initiative to use Drug
Elimination Program money to allow public housing projects to
finance gun-buyback efforts. If Representative James T. Walsh of
Syracuse succeeds in blocking this effort on the grounds that
buying back guns does not qualify as an antidrug measure, the
Clinton administration should put him and others to the test and
fight for a straight appropriation for federal gun-buyback
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Under the contested program, Housing and Urban Development has
invited public housing authorities to use HUD grants to arrange
with their local police to buy up firearms _ from anyone, not just
public housing residents. Housing authorities in Worcester,
Springfield, and Malden have signed on.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh believes _ and says he has an informal opinion from the
General Accounting Office backing him up _ that HUD lacks legal
authority to spend antidrug money this way. HUD disagrees, pointing
to opinions from its lawyers backing this use of the money and
noting that funds from the Drug Elimination Program have been used
in other indirect ways to limit drug dealing, such as installing
fencing or organizing after-school activities for teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   Gun-buybacks are not a cure-all for lethal drug-related assaults
or for the casual availability of firearms in America's
communities, but money for them should not be stalled by a dispute
among lawyers. However they are funded, buybacks are a sensible way
for the federal government to help communities deal with a gun
problem made worse by Congress's feckless failure to pass other
gun-control measures.

MIDEAST BACKSLIDING

<TEXT>
<P>
   Political and military regressions in the Mideast peace process
this past week trace an all-too-familiar pattern. The moment
progress on the negotiating track is thwarted, the parties revert
to old habits of hostility. And because regional diplomacy
resembles Chinese checkers, a game usually played by more than two
players, each hesitation on the path to peace invites several
troublemaking parties to make whatever trouble they can.
</P>
<P>
   When Syrian dictator Hafez Assad, frustrated at not getting his
way in negotiations with Israel, gave a green light to the
Hezbollah militia in southern Lebanon for escalating attacks on
Israeli forces and their Lebanese proxies, Prime Minister Ehud
Barak responded by bombing civilian targets in Lebanon in early
February.
</P>
<P>
   The Arab League then moved a meeting from Cairo to Beirut in a
show of sympathy with Lebanon and its de facto colonizer, Syria.
Caught up in the spirit of Arab solidarity, the Arab League issued
a statement reiterating the rhetoric that Assad had coached his
Lebanese puppets to pronounce: an implausible threat that if Israel
had the temerity to withdraw unilaterally from Lebanon, the
government in Beirut would not be able to prevent radical
Palestinian groups in their tightly controlled refugee camps and
Syrian-monitored bases from attacking Israel.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Israel fell for the provocation and resumed bombing
and artillery attacks in Lebanon, killing Lebanese civilians. A
new, more pointed message was sent by Israeli bombing runs against
the camps of two Palestinian groups that reject Yasser Arafat's
peacemaking and have been under the wing of Damascus for many
years. These camps are located along the border between Lebanon and
Syria.
</P>
<P>
   This is what happens when negotiations are suspended; the
parties send messages to each other with bombs and rockets. Fringe
groups opposed to the compromises required for a negotiated peace
come to the fore. More than ever, there is no tolerable alternative
to negotiated peace agreements in the Middle East.

<P>
   President Clinton's trip this week to South Asia, the first
official visit to the region by an American head of state in 22
years, is an opportunity to build relations of trust and confidence
with India and Pakistan. Their nuclear tests in May 1998 and their
escalating clashes in the disputed territory of Kashmir make the
subcontinent the world's most dangerous flashpoint.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton flies out to India Sunday he will be heading toward
a region drenched in contradictions and dangers. Indian software
engineers are making their mark around the world while Hindu
fundamentalists exert more and more influence in India's social and
political life. In Pakistan, the Supreme Court has called for
Islamization of the economy, meaning that within a year it will be
forbidden to charge interest in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton can hardly affect the ebb and flow of tradition and
modernization in India or Pakistan, but there is a lot he can do to
reduce the risk of a nuclear calamity.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate peril he should confront is India's declared
intention to deploy its nuclear warheads. Once India does what its
new nuclear doctrine calls for _ makes its missiles operational _
Pakistan is sure to follow suit. At that point, the people of the
subcontinent will live under the threat of an accidental launch of
nuclear weapons. The deployed nuclear warheads will also create a
constant anxiety about surprise attack that could induce a
preemptive first strike by one side or the other.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's ability to persuade India and Pakistan to sign and
ratify the nuclear test ban treaty was compromised last October by
the refusal of the US Senate to ratify the treaty. Nevertheless, he
should urge both governments to maintain their voluntary moratorium
on further testing and persist in trying to convince them to sign
the test ban.
</P>
<P>
   India does not want to hear about third-party mediation of the
Kashmir conflict, but Clinton has a chance to begin a diplomatic
dialogue that may one day lead to a peaceful resolution of the
dispute. The effort is worthwhile because there can be no global
stability without a stable South Asia.

<P>
   Shares of the old Oracle Corp. traded last April for as little
as $10.50.
</P>
<P>
   The new Oracle closed Friday at $79.8125. But the thing for
investors to bear in mind is that there has been little or no
change in the company's fundamentals in the last year. Sure, last
week it reported that results for its 2000 third quarter exceeded
analysts' estimates by four cents, but in the three preceding
quarters it outperformed in two by more modest amounts, and fell
short in one. So why has Oracle's valuation gone up by a multiple
of nearly eight?
</P>
<P>
   The answer lies in positioning and perception, some of it real,
some of it still in the realm of hopes and dreams.
</P>
<P>
   The old Oracle was the gorilla of relational database software,
popular corporate products that manage data in a simple format and
then analyzes them. Although a solid multibillion-dollar business,
it was nearing that stage of the corporate life cycle so dreaded by
growth investors: maturity.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle, and rivals like Sybase and Informix, had done too good a
job selling database software to corporate America. Not only did
every company have one, most had more capacity than they needed.
</P>
<P>
   The new Oracle has positioned itself as the software locomotive
engine of the Internet. Companies embracing electronic commerce and
moving other business practices to the World Wide Web increasingly
use Oracle's database and application software. And Oracle has also
used the Internet internally to cut costs, centralizing tasks like
human resources that used to spread across many continents. To its
credit, Oracle began redesigning its software to embrace the
Internet as far back as 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oracle's database and e-business applications have become the
software standard for the Internet,'' said Larry Ellison, Oracle's
co-founder and chief executive. ``All 10 of the world's biggest Web
sites use Oracle. Ninety-three percent of the public dot-com
companies use Oracle. Now the leading companies in traditional
industries _ Chevron, Ford, General Motors, Carrefour and Sears _
are choosing Oracle to move them to the Internet. The faster the
Internet grows _ the faster we grow.''
</P>
<P>
   This is all true, although many of those dot-coms also use
products from Oracle competitors, like IBM, Ariba or Siebel
Systems. The problem is that all of Oracle's growth is reflected in
today's stock price, which is a staggering 124 times this year's
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Even some analysts who recommend buying Oracle, have
reservations at the current price. ``Frankly, Oracle has become a
concept stock,'' said Andrew C. Brosseau, an analyst with S.G.
Cowen. ``Its valuation has far outstripped its operating
performance,'' he said, noting that revenue growth of 14 percent is
not usually associated with trailing price-to-earnings multiples of
180. ``It's very difficult to talk about the stock in connection
with any fundamentals.''
</P>
<P>
   Brosseau said Oracle's series of e-commerce announcements, with
the likes of Ford and Sears, had given it a high profile in the hot
B2B, or business-to-business sector, but that it remained unclear
how these deals would contribute to revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in a conference call on Tuesday, Ellison said that these
exchanges were costing Oracle money because it had so many
consultants working on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been pushing out a new press release a week about the
next B2B model,'' Brosseau said. ``Unfortunately, there's not a lot
of `there, there,' and a lot of uncertainty about how it will pan
out.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kevin Landis, a fund manager with Firsthand Capital
Management in San Jose, Calif., a big holder of Oracle shares, said
Oracle's valuation was easier to justify by evaluating sales growth
by unit, rather than looking at overall revenue. ``In a really big
company with pieces growing at different rates, usually the market
cap doesn't map to where the revenue is, it maps to where the
growth is,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the most recent quarter, Oracle's database software sales
increased 32 percent, to $778 million. Total applications software
sales rose 35 percent, to $199 million. Within that total, sales of
applications for customer-relationship management, or CRM, grew at
a 179 percent rate, to $49 million, and Internet purchasing
software, grew by 231 percent, to $26 million. But consulting,
education and support revenue grew just 10 percent, to $1.4
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Landis notes that the businesses most closely associated with
e-commerce, CRM and Internet purchasing had growth rates exceeding
Oracle's multiple to this year's earnings. ``In many cases, Oracle
is bigger, growing faster and better positioned than some of the
pure plays,'' in these areas, he said. If Oracle did not already
trade at such a high multiple, there would be pressure to spin off
its e-commerce business as a tracking stock, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Austrian, an analyst with Banc of America Securities, is
another enthusiastic supporter of Oracle. ``You recommend it
gingerly because the stock will be hard-pressed to do more than
double from here,'' he said. But he said Oracle was perhaps the
best positioned of all companies to benefit from electronic
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent the run-up in Oracle shares reflects the blurring
of marketing and investor relations that characterizes all of the
Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a brilliantly orchestrated repositioning away from
being a slow-growth database provider toward being an Internet
enabler,'' said William Epifanio 2nd, an analyst with J.P. Morgan.
``Now they've got to start delivering on it.''

A CALENDAR FOR REFORM

   Attempts to reform the electoral system share one basic
difficulty: The officials who have the power to create a new system
were elected under the old one. It is only human nature for them to
assume that the process that put them in office ain't broke.
</P>
<P>
   This has been a formidable hurdle for campaign finance reform
and will likely prove a barrier also to those seeking to change the
nominating process. Despite the obvious fact that this year's
nominees were chosen at least two months too early, and after a
process that included only six weeks of actual voting, neither Al
Gore nor George W. Bush has much incentive to open the process to
more voters _ and perhaps to more candidates. Indeed, if one of the
two is running for reelection in 2004, he would naturally favor a
system controlled by the party establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Another difficulty is the question of whether Iowa and New
Hampshire should continue to go first on the nomination calendar.
</P>
<P>
   Gore faced a serious threat from Bill Bradley in New Hampshire
but overcame it, partly by campaigning more openly, and Bradley
never recovered. This was the pivotal win for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, however, suffered his worst setback in New Hampshire,
forcing him into a five-week scrap with John McCain in which Bush
spent a lot of money, embraced his party's right wing, and
sustained heavy criticism from McCain _ all of which will make his
task harder in the general election. Bush therefore is no friend of
New Hampshire, and, if elected, can be expected to try to scuttle
the early primary there. That would be a dark day for democracy.
</P>
<P>
   However, Bush also suffered because Republicans in several
states, such as Michigan, insisted on holding primaries before
March 7. Since the national Democratic Party exercised more
discipline and refused to permit such early events, the GOP
contests attracted many independents and Democrats. Bush will
likely try to stop that, whether or not he wins the White House.
This would be healthy.
</P>
<P>
   The best overall plan would retain Iowa and New Hampshire first,
followed by four regional primaries a month apart. Elected
officials will not implement this, however, without public
prodding.

   MIDDLETOWN, Conn. _ Finding herself assigned to what is often
dubbed The Naked Dorm came as a shock to Martha Reicher, but now
she would rather not live anywhere else. It took a while, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first week of school I would have said I live in The Naked
Dorm, but now it would not be the first thing I say,'' Reicher, a
Wesleyan University freshman, said recently. ``Still, it is
definitely the part that gets the most attention.''
</P>
<P>
   This story, about how one well-choreographed rite of passage
from high school to college life can go unexpectedly awry, actually
started last year. Reicher, along with myriad high school seniors
across the country, was eagerly awaiting a college acceptance
letter. She dreamed of attending a strong liberal arts college in
the East.
</P>
<P>
   She was ecstatic when Wesleyan accepted her, and doubly thrilled
when she was assigned to her first choice of a residence hall, a
place called West College. She had been particularly drawn to West
College because it advertised itself as a diverse, multicultural,
politically active dormitory for men and women. Westco (as it is
known at Wesleyan) even required freshmen to compete for spots by
writing essays about their interests.
</P>
<P>
   Reicher thought it would be a welcome change from her hometown,
Piedmont, Calif., an upscale community in the Oakland hills. Just
how different quickly became evident.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the first night we had a dorm meeting, and the resident
advisers said that it is a tradition of Westco that it is clothing
optional,'' she said. ``Most of the people were yelling things
like, `That is awesome!' or `This is great!' or `Wow!'''
</P>
<P>
   But Reicher doesn't recall yelling anything. Instead, she began
turning over in her head everything she had read and heard about
the dorm. ``I was shocked, thinking `Is this really what diverse
means?''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the interest of full disclosure, it should be noted that
Westco consists of four buildings housing about 175 students, most
of whom stay clothed a lot. It's not as though residents shed their
garments as they walk in the door.
</P>
<P>
   The statement about the dormitory sent to incoming students
said, in part: ``In the past, residents have organized musical and
artistic events, planned mid-semester festivals and been committed
to artistic expression, political and social activism and community
responsibility. West College strives to improve upon its tradition
by giving residents the opportunity and resources to express
themselves and create new group initiatives.'' It mentioned nothing
about clothing, optional or otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Reicher, 18, called her parents. Her dad laughed. Her mother
called the school and suggested that her daughter be allowed to
move if she wanted. (Her cousin, somewhat later, called a
reporter.)
</P>
<P>
   The students soon learned that, aside from residents who
developed a habit of leaving the stall doors open while they
showered in the mostly coed bathrooms, not that many people go
naked. But they can if so inspired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just sometimes feel the need to be nude; I have body
piercings to show off,'' said Jacob Z.B. Goldsmith, a 19-year-old
freshman, who neither volunteered, nor was asked, where the body
piercings might be, but did strip off his pants as he talked.
``There's an exhibitionist part of me. If I feel the need to take
off my pants, I take my pants off. It's kind of cool that there is
a place you can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the point of Westco. It encourages students to expose
all their interests in the theory that everyone will be enriched.
If a time traveler wanted to find a place where the ethos of the
1960s still flowered, Westco would be a holistic choice.
</P>
<P>
   Take the concept of time. Nothing officially starts on the hour
_ or even the half-hour or quarter-hour _ in Westco. The regular
wine-and-cheese social hours that rotate among the various hallways
are supposed to start at 9:13 p.m. ``Guidance,'' the name for
weekly Monday night meetings, sort of open town halls where
decisions about running the dorm are made, begins at 10:07 p.m. The
odd times are intended to jog the memory.
</P>
<P>
   Not a lot of students show up at Guidance, but its deliberations
are considered worthy of tracking for posterity. The freestyle
minutes are kept in a series of journals called ``The Book of
Love,'' kept in the head resident's room.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Amongst prodigious doodling, the books brim with notations of
resolutions taken in recent years, like, ``Make people aware of
injustice on and off campus.'' Another entry recorded a discussion
weighing a collective hair-dying session just before parents'
weekend ``just in case your parents thought you were normal.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At least once last fall the weekly telephone messages summoning
all students to Guidance trumpeted that particular meeting as
clothing optional. (The dorm's term of choice.) This tactic had
mixed results, however, with some students avoiding the gathering
and many present clad in just towels. (For those of you skimming
this article looking for the naked bits, you are here.)
</P>
<P>
   ``People have realized that having a clothing-optional Guidance
is not the best way to have a meeting,'' said Christopher C.
Connor, 22, a senior and the head resident for all of Westco. ``A
lot of people don't want to participate and a lot come just for the
spectacle.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Guidance, there are other random moments when
nakedness is encouraged, like one corridor's periodic ``Naked
Hour,'' when anyone in the mood can show up and socialize.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if one resident objects, Connor asks the naked to
dress. He said he never encounters flak.
</P>
<P>
   The university, for its part, denies that there is an official
``naked dorm.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is folklore that it is a clothing-optional unit, but
that is not true,'' said Freddye Hill, the dean of the college and
the senior representative for students in the administration. ``We
tell students that nudity is offensive to some people, and we have
to tell people not to engage in it.''
</P>
<P>
   University officials said the written rules do not specifically
ban nudity, out of concern that anything so specific would only
encourage it. But they said anyone habitually walking around in the
buff in public areas would risk being hauled in front of the
seven-member Student Judiciary Board. No one could recall such a
case.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Tamara Raimundi, a senior administration official for
residential life, said one woman in Westco asked to be moved out
this year, citing nudity as one reason. ``Westco seems to be the
place that people try to do that sort of thing because they hear
the folklore and want to grab onto it,'' Raimundi said.
</P>
<P>
   Westco has a more assertive student government than the other
dorms, so naturally the very idea of letting a reporter visit had
to go before the student government for a general discussion and
vote. Then someone alerted the college newspaper, The Argus, which
wrote a front-page story about the visit. Its reporter asked
questions like, ``Is it true that you wanted to write an article
about sex and drugs and nudity at Westco four months ago but the
university president wouldn't allow it?'' (The only idea there that
is vaguely accurate is that it took four months for the dorm
consensus and the reporter's schedule to coincide.)
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Parties at the dorm, understandably, are among the most popular
on campus. And some students living elsewhere either find a way to
move in or just hang out. Katrina E. Nordine, 19, moved from nearby
Clark Hall. ``There is no life there other than beer,'' she said.
``It was not about being alive and creating things, it was about
being drunk.''
</P>
<P>
   When the weather is warm enough, some Westco students take their
clothing optional selves outdoors. (At least the guys. It is
usually the guys.)
</P>
<P>
   Reicher recalls an early fall visit by her boyfriend, ``He
walked in and said that he hadn't seen anybody naked, and he didn't
know what I was talking about, and then he looked to his left and
there were 10 guys playing Frisbee naked.''
</P>
<P>
   The whole tradition, according to Adam D. Hurter, a sophomore
and onetime resident, stems from the fact that in the late 1960s
the dorm was devised as communal housing for students and faculty
where they could delve more intensely into issues of the day. That
particular experiment ended in 1974, he said, but some of the
wackier traditions prevail.
</P>
<P>
   ``People aren't just generally wandering around naked just for
the sake of being naked,'' said Matthew D. Lerner, 18, one of the
dorm's five elected presidents. ``It's the idea of not judging
anyone, of respecting one another's beliefs. It does not have
sexual undertones.''
</P>
<P>
   That last idea takes some acclimatizing. But residents swear
that the disrobed gradually become part of the background tapestry
in a dorm teeming with musicians, painters and political
organizers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not all for attention, ooooooohhhhh, let's get naked and
have fun,'' said Reicher, who has never joined in the dorm's unclad
life. ``I guess it's normal to me now. It is part of being not
judged at all, I can be who I want to be. But I guess when I try to
describe it to my parents or relatives, they can't see how it can
be an acceptable thing.''

ENTERPRISING IN MAINE

<P>
   Maine's governor, Angus King, is boldly going where no education
system has gone before. His idea is to give a computer and Internet
access to each of the state's 16,000 seventh-graders and then stand
back and watch Maine leap into the technological age. Computers
have been handed out in other school systems, but not on a
statewide scale. The governor wants to be able to go to Switzerland
or Silicon Valley and say that Maine is the most digitally literate
place on earth.
</P>
<P>
   Contrarians say money should be spent on books and school
buildings. Others say the computers could be lost, stolen, sold, or
go unused, giving students little more than a high-tech
paperweight.
</P>
<P>
   But even with these risks, the proposal is brilliant. To finance
it, King would take an unexpected one-time $50 million budget
surplus, add another $15 million in private and federal funds, and
set up a trust fund. The interest would pay for smaller computers
costing about $500. Even if the program failed miserably, the
original pot of money would remain intact.
</P>
<P>
   Maine would spend $1 million to train teachers on how to
incorporate computers into the curriculum. This is essential. Some
students have more technical know-how than their teachers. But it's
up to teachers to set high educational standards for how the
technology is used.
</P>
<P>
   By picking up half the tab, the state would help teachers buy
their own computers. Basic devices could block thieves from using
stolen computers. An existing state prison program that has inmates
refurbish computers could, ideally, handle repairs. By purchasing
new equipment each year, the state wouldn't have to maintain
obsolete computers.
</P>
<P>
   As for books and school construction, the state is already
investing millions of dollars. Given this, it makes sense to push
forward on the two fronts of traditional and new resources.
</P>
<P>
   To succeed, Maine will need to weather unforeseen glitches. That
will require learning from similar programs and devising its own
innovations. Doing this could propel Maine and the states that
follow into a new educational frontier.

 &HT;    Search for shooting suspect disturbs sleep, security in tidy
neighborhood
 &HT;    By Mark Bixler
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The police dragnet in Hattie Stegall's neighborhood
lifted Friday almost as suddenly as it came down.
</P>
<P>
   Gone by noon were policemen with guns drawn and search dogs. The
thumping of helicopter blades faded when authorities concluded the
man they were after, a former black militant once known as justice
minister for the Black Panthers, was long gone.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say the suspect, Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin, opened
fire with an assault rifle on two Fulton County sheriff's deputies
Thursday evening. One died. The other is in the hospital. Police
searched Stegall's neighborhood, where Al-Amin led a mosque and ran
a store and where the shooting happened, but came up empty. They
left by mid-morning to look elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Stegall and her neighbors found a largely peaceful
neighborhood returned to them. As birds chirped and dogs barked,
they tried to reconcile their image of Al-Amin as a devout Muslim
who purged the neighborhood of drugs with a portrait that emerged
from police accounts of a man who ambushed two deputies and left
them to die.
</P>
<P>
   Stegall, 73, and her neighbors were encouraged in this
reflection by news reporters and photographers who went
door-to-door on Egleston Street and West End Place throughout the
day. By 2 p.m., five satellite TV trucks and 11 cars, pickup trucks
and minivans of reporters were parked on grass across from
Al-Alim's store. Several residents, particularly Muslims who
worshiped in Al-Amin's mosque, declined to talk publicly about him.
Others praised him as someone willing to help those in need.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether Al-Amin could have done what the police
allege, Stegall paused for seven seconds and stared at the front
door of her screened-in porch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't know. I just don't know,'' she said softly. ``He
looks like such a good person, but you just don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   She lives around the corner from Al-Amin's mosque, a converted
house with lime green siding. She can look out her bedroom and
kitchen windows and see the mosque and a store down the street
where the deputies fell as they tried to execute a warrant for
Al-Amin's arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``See that back door? That's where the shooting was. That's
where they knocked on the back door with that warrant,'' Stegall
said, tapping on the glass of her kitchen window.
</P>
<P>
   Stegall said she was awakened Thursday night by a series of
gunshots _ police said at least 35 bullets were fired. Two of her
grandchildren, ages 10 and 12, were in a bed beside her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them to jump up and run. Somebody's shooting!'' said
Stegall, who moved into her house in 1969 and has known Al-Amin
since he arrived in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   She said Al-Amin frequently checked on her and instructed other
Muslims to help her.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all call me Big Momma. He tells the rest of them to go
see about Big Momma,'' she said. ``When my sister died, he was
right here asking if there was anything he could do for me.''
</P>
<P>
   She cocked her head to one side for a moment when four speakers
atop the mosque began broadcasting a hypnotic chant just before 1
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's their music. I don't understand it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Most houses along Egleston Street and West End Place are small
but neatly maintained. A few are in disrepair, but contractors are
renovating others. Many residents, such as Stegall, are older, but
some young couples with children have moved in recently. Muslim
women with cloths covering their faces walk quietly from the mosque
to their houses.
</P>
<P>
   Stegall and her neighbor, Wendy Daniel, said they had a hard
time sleeping Thursday night and Friday morning because so many
officers with flashlights were marching through the neighborhood,
trying in the wee hours to root out their suspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I laid down, but I just couldn't sleep,'' Daniel said.
</P>
<P>
   Just after the shooting, she said, one of her two daughters was
awakened by the family dog, Disco, who began barking incessantly
after the gunfire. She said she had to tell her daughter that two
men had been shot near their house and that she had looked through
the kitchen window and seen one of them stagger and fall.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday morning, she let her other daughter walk to school
because she thought police had captured the gunman. When she
learned they had not, she said, she went to the school to make sure
her daughter had made it safely to her fifth-grade class.

A TEST OF WEB SPEECH

 c.2000 The Boston Globe

<P>
   North Adams Mayor John Barrett III has every right to sue two
residents who set up a Web site in which they accuse him of
offenses he says are groundless and defamatory. Barrett goes too
far, however, when he seeks an injunction Monday remove material
from the site without benefit of a trial. This would set an ominous
precedent for throttling political commentary in this new medium.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Polk, Barrett's lawyer, narrowed the scope of his request
for an injunction Friday so that it no longer seeks to bar the two
defendants from putting future statements about the mayor on the
Internet. That request would have been an attempt at prior
restraint, which the courts wisely regard as presumptively
unconstitutional because it stifles speech before it can be
uttered.
</P>
<P>
   It is understandable that Barrett would wish to remove offensive
items from the Web site, (www.northadamsfree.com), but it is better
that they stay there for now rather than establish a precedent for
censorship. The US Supreme Court has made libel and defamation
against public figures hard to prove to encourage the freewheeling
discussions for which the Internet is an ideal and inexpensive
medium. The costs of a controversial Web site would soar if its
operators had to fend off injunctions. Barrett and Polk ought to
withdraw the petition for an injunction and instead seek a speedy
trial.
</P>
<P>
   John Choquette and William Davis, the defendants, accuse the
mayor of everything from theft to child abuse in a semi-coherent
attack. The Supreme Court has set a high standard for defamation
suits by public figures, but Barrett ought to prevail if he can
prove that false accusations were made maliciously, with knowledge
that they were untrue.
</P>
<P>
   Internet law is still in its infancy. Much work needs to be done
to develop sound precedents for statements made in e-mail and chat
rooms. But the World Wide Web, with its sites available to anyone
with a search engine, is like a television station or newspaper. If
Superior Court Judge Thomas Curley refuses to shut the Web site,
and sets an early date for trial, he will be applying
tried-and-true legal standards to a new medium of free expression.

WHAT? A QUIET TEXAS BILLIONAIRE? 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 19) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Texas)   (af)  
 By ROBERT BRYCE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it comes to Texas billionaires, L. Lowry Mays doesn't seem
eccentric enough. Sure, he has a ranch or two, and he takes some
nice vacations with a little hunting and fishing thrown in. But he
just doesn't live as large as some of his peers. No monstrous
mansions, helicopters or yachts. And no trophy wives or
stop-and-start presidential campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Mays, 64, is among the richest but least-known media
tycoons in the land.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman and chief executive of Clear Channel Communications,
however, Mays has provided his stockholders with gaudy returns,
averaging 64 percent a year over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   The company, based in San Antonio, is already the world's
largest owner of billboards and, with its agreement last October to
buy AMFM Inc. for $17.4 billion, it will be the world's largest
owner of radio stations, too. The deal-making continued on Feb. 29,
when Clear Channel agreed to buy SFX Entertainment, a concert
producer, arena owner and sports promoter, for $3.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The two deals are the latest of the media acquisitions that
began in 1972, when Mays and Red McCombs (now owner of the
Minnesota Vikings) bought a struggling San Antonio radio station.
For Mays, buying media properties was always more about
considerations like free cash flow than a chance to hang out with
celebrities. He soon saw the efficiencies, and the attractiveness
for advertisers, to be gained from consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   Mays now oversees a media empire upon which the sun never sets,
from gospel radio in Greensboro, N.C., to billboards in Beijing.
Including pending acquisitions, the company will have operations in
32 countries and will own or have stakes in 19 television stations,
550,000 billboards and 110 entertainment venues.
</P>
<P>
   It will also own all or part of 1,100 radio stations, although
some are being sold to satisfy regulators. For dessert, it will use
SFX's agents to handle elite sports figures like Michael Jordan and
Andre Agassi.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Mays presents himself as a modest sort. ``I'm not
concerned with how big we are,'' he said. ``I'm not even sure I
know what big means.'' Of course, in expanding the company, he has
proceeded with a good deal of calculation.
</P>
<P>
   He buys radio and TV stations and billboards in the same market,
then cuts costs and sells advertising packages across the three
media. With radio stations in most major markets, Mays can deliver
audiences that were once available only on prime-time television.
</P>
<P>
   But Mays is starting to hear some static. Media buyers have
begun complaining about the company's advertising rates, which,
they say, have risen in recent months. The higher tariffs have led
some advertisers to desert.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Gallagher, the media director at Starcom Worldwide, a unit
of the Leo Group, the ad agency based in Chicago, said he recently
advised a client to switch to television. Although Gallagher would
not criticize Clear Channel's rates, he said, ``at a certain point
radio isn't worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his reservations, Gallagher said Clear Channel offered
an attractive one-stop-shopping option combining outlets like
billboards and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Other criticism comes from outside the industry. Andrew Jay
Schwartzman, president of the Media Access Project, a public
interest law firm that promotes broad access to electronic media,
says Clear Channel's economies come at a cost. ``They are done at
the expense of local news and public affairs programming,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mays says those objections are misplaced. ``We are doing more
public service work within our communities than we ever have
before,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Clear Channel's growth has caused some controversy, Mays'
personal exploits are unlikely to stir much attention. A Dallas
native who speaks with just a hint of a twang, he received a
petroleum engineering degree from Texas A&AMP;M and an MBA from
Harvard. He has been married to his wife, Peggy, for 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   They live in a comfortable, if not lavish, five-bedroom house in
San Antonio. On weekends, they often retreat to a 2,000-acre ranch
near Spring Branch, 40 miles north of San Antonio, where they raise
registered longhorns. They spend much of their free time with their
four children and 10 grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Mark, 36, is Clear Channel's president and chief operating
officer. Randall, 34, is its chief financial officer and Kathryn
Mays Johnson, 39, is director of communications. Linda Mays McCaul,
38, doesn't work at the company.
</P>
<P>
   As the owner of 30.3 million shares of Clear Channel stock worth
about $2.08 billion, Mays plans to give away much of his fortune.
So far, his pet causes have been local or regional, including gifts
to Texas A&AMP;M and to the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife have started a foundation that now has $25
million in assets; he hopes it will grow to $250 million. But Mays
isn't ready to focus full-time on philanthropy just yet.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he is preparing Clear Channel for an assault on the
Internet. By the end of next year, Mays predicted, all the Web
sites of the company's radio stations will have streaming audio.
That, combined with SFX's concerts, could let it offer pay-per-view
concerts over the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Mays says the Internet will become a growing source of
advertising revenue for the company. ``We have 110 million people a
week listening to our radio stations,'' he said. ``That's damn near
half the nation. If we can move a portion of those listeners to our
Web sites, we have the power to create more traffic than anyone
else on the Net. We will have the most active Web sites in the
country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Given investors' frenzied embrace of Internet stocks, Mays hopes
the company's recent and future moves will help buoy Clear
Channel's stock. It slumped after the SFX announcement, as some
analysts questioned whether the deal would pay off.
</P>
<P>
   And for Mays, the chance to hang out with rock stars is not much
of a payoff, either. Nor with most of the sports stars. ``I'd be
embarrassed to play tennis with Andre,'' he said, but conceded: ``I
wouldn't mind playing golf with Jordan.''

   ``Which idiot in this company is responsible for hiring a temp
to work on mergers?''
</P>
<P>
   That shout from the audience greeted Henry M. Paulson, chairman
and chief executive of Goldman Sachs Group, all of five minutes
into the company's first shareholder meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The security breach that allowed a temporary employee to steal
and sell inside information on pending merger deals, which led last
week to criminal charges against 19 people, was just one of the
unpleasant topics Paulson had to discuss Friday morning when two
stockholders commandeered what might have been a short, sweet
gathering. The doubling of Goldman's stock price since it went
public in May was nearly lost amid the fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   As she often does at annual meetings, the woman who shouted,
Evelyn Y. Davis, did most of the talking, lambasting the board over
the affair of the temp. Another investor, Harry Korba, chimed in to
ask Paulson if he had considered declining his $16 million bonus
for 1999. ``No, I didn't,'' Paulson replied.
</P>
<P>
   Davis also griped that too little Goldman stock went to
individual investors. She said she had to call David H. Komansky,
chairman of Merrill Lynch, to obtain 100 shares. Paulson joked that
Komansky had done Goldman ``a big favor.''

   In a bizarre coup of sorts, The Financial Times last Monday
prominently featured a review of ``Sense and Nonsense in the
Office,'' Lucy Kellaway's new book about good management. The
reviewer was Robert J. Ayling, who just the previous Friday had
been ousted as chief executive of British Airways for poor
management.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coincidence,'' said John Gapper, features editor of The
Financial Times. Ayling had written the review, titled ``Beware the
Bear Trap,'' about a week before his surprise dismissal, Gapper
explained, and the review had been scheduled to appear in last
Monday's issue before he knew ``all of the hoo-ha.''
</P>
<P>
   When the news broke, Gapper called the airline, worried that he
would have to kill the article. Perhaps with an eye toward future
career options, Ayling surprised Gapper by personally giving it a
green light. &QL;

<P>
   Eric Seleznow may have been the only person in Maryland who was
not surprised when a team of young prison inmates took second prize
in a stock-picking contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in jail are risk-takers; people who play the market are
risk-takers,'' said Seleznow, spokesman for the Montgomery County
Detention Center in Rockville.
</P>
<P>
   The detention center team, competing against high school
students in Maryland and the District of Columbia, turned an
imaginary $100,000 into $196,000 in 10 weeks, second best behind
the $253,000 racked up by North Harford High School.
</P>
<P>
   One of the inmates, Ryan Green, 21, said their selections were
far from scientific. ``We were sitting around one day and Viagra
was in the news, and I asked, `Who makes it?''' he said. So they
``bought'' Pfizer, plus America Online ( Green subscribes), Nokia
(his father likes his cell phone), Yahoo, Amazon.com and Network
Solutions (``It seemed to be doing well'').
</P>
<P>
   Green was eligible for the team because of a drunken night
shooting out parked car windows with a BB gun. ``I'm not proud of
what I did,'' he said, meaning the BBs, not the stocks. ``I'm
trying to change.''

CAREY'S VOICE COMPETES WITH VIDEO, RAPPERS ON CONCERT STAGE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A famous show-biz adage says never to follow animals or cuddly
kids on stage. Mariah Carey did both Thursday at Staples Center in
the opening night of her first U.S. tour in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   The pop-soul diva threw in everything but the kitchen sink
(although a prop refrigerator was used) in an often grueling
two-hour set that was long on artifice but woefully short on
artistry.
</P>
<P>
   Carey seemed to be coasting while making little effort in the
sold-out love fest. Maybe it's because her record sales of 128
million have paid Sony Music's rent for years that the entire show
was apparently designed not to tire the cooing gold mine.
</P>
<P>
   In a performance packed with time-consuming video segments,
tacky set pieces that included a pseudo-boxing match, a beauty
pageant and dance routines, plus a cameo from a couple of live
lambs, Carey managed to sing less than two-dozen numbers. Even the
lambs looked puzzled.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns that Carey is largely a studio creation whose vocal
performances are painstakingly patched together by top producers
seemed to be borne out when her much-touted range fell flat several
times during the evening, particularly when she attempted high
Minnie Riperton-like squeals that careened out of human earshot.
The lambs, however, looked pleased.
</P>
<P>
   The concert opened with a 10-minute video setting up a running
joke that Carey has an evil twin named Bianca (think of her as
Mariah Scary) who runs around trying to sabotage the good Mariah.
The fact that Carey thinks any of this is witty or entertaining is
far more frightening than anything Bianca could come up with.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Carey rose from beneath the stage, singing her 1991
chart-topper ``Emotions,'' followed by other hits including ``My
All,'' ``Heartbreaker'' and ``Dreamlover.''
</P>
<P>
   It all came together in ``X-Girlfriend,'' a hip-hop-flavored
tune from the ``Rainbow'' album that successfully blended a hard
urban beat with some surprisingly soulful crooning.
</P>
<P>
   For an audience packed with little Mariahs and often their moms,
Carey accented her hip-hop leanings, bringing on rappers Krazy Bone
of Bone Thugs-N-Harmony and opening act Da Brat for duets on ``I
Still Believe,'' as well as performing several numbers with video
accompaniment from Snoop Dogg and Wu-Tang Clan's Ol' Dirty Bastard.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Carey, who turns 30 on March 27, is still
marketed as the girl next door, which is a little hard to swallow
when she's performing raunchy dance routines one minute and rapping
with alleged street thugs the next.
</P>
<P>
   Carey wasn't entirely devoid of humor, though, even if much of
it was unintentional. At one point, after bringing a couple of
young fans on stage for tearful hugs, she demanded: ``Somebody take
a picture! Who has a camera?''
</P>
<P>
   Somebody should clue Carey to the fact that patrons of her
concerts are routinely held up at the door while security guards
stop just short of a full cavity search looking for just those
devices. &QL;

ONLINE FILM FESTIVAL COMING TO A STREET NEAR YOU
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: David Bloom's weekly column on the intersection of
entertainment, art and technology; with DIGITAL-LA-SITE.) 
By DAVID BLOOM 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Film festivals have been hot tickets in recent years, giving
independent filmmakers a chance to reach audiences _ and
distribution deals _ they might not otherwise ever find.
</P>
<P>
   Such festivals have even migrated to the Internet, an odd notion
given that the Net's biggest virtue is to let filmmakers dispense
with annoyances like distribution deals and instead have their work
seen year round, worldwide (albeit slowly and on a small-screen
window). But what are we to make of an online film festival being
held offline?
</P>
<P>
   That's the question for this week's Yahoo! Internet Life Online
Film Festival, which will be camping out on the Sunset Strip this
Wednesday and Thursday (and online at www.onlinefilmfestival.com).
</P>
<P>
   ``There are other online film festivals that are strictly
online, but our belief is the Net won't completely replace
in-person viewing, it will just augment it,'' said Jesse Jacobs,
the festival director.
</P>
<P>
   The festival's online component is nonetheless strong. A jury
winnowed down entries to a manageable dozen shorts and animated
pieces, which viewers at the festival's site voted on. The jury
also picked six feature-length shows with some significant Net
relationship, such as being cast or financed online.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with about three-dozen exhibitors and a series of
substantial panels and keynote speakers, the festival looks like
it'll be a worthwhile warm-up and counterpoint to next weekend's
Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   Keynote speakers include film critic Roger Ebert, producer Peter
Guber and Powerful Media's Kurt Andersen.
</P>
<P>
   Discussion panels will feature many of the up-and-coming online
content companies _ AtomFilms, Wirebreak.com, Load Media, IFILM,
Sightsound.com, Mediatrip.com, Nibblebox.com and Threshold
Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The features on display include the premiere of ``Time Code'' by
Oscar-nominated writer/director Mike Figgis, the Oscar-nominated
short ``Humdrum'' from Aardman Animation's Peter Peake and the Web
documentary ``Home Page.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was to elevate this whole space, to take it offline,
off Yahoo! and into the real world,'' Jacobs said. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
BRUCE THE BRAND
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Haring had one of the bully pulpits of the technology age,
writing about digital entertainment for USA Today for five years.
Then he did what a lot of journalists have been doing lately: going
Web.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, after covering music and technology for USA Today,
Daily Variety, Billboard and other publications, he's taken it a
step further, creating a site built around his own writing.
</P>
<P>
   The result is OFF the CHARTS (at www.offthecharts.com). He'll
syndicate material, including a column called ``The Line'' about
digital convergence issues, to other sites and also plans to bring
other writers on board to create yet more syndicated content.
</P>
<P>
   To help build interest, Haring said he expects to soon announce
deals with five ``tastemaker'' music sites and their collections of
online music.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're aiming off the charts, instead of the mainstream,
focusing on ways the musicians out there can bring themselves to
the market,'' Haring said.
</P>
<P>
   Haring, 44, also will write a column analyzing music industry
trends for another interesting startup, Powerful Media's new
entertainment industry site, www.inside.com.
</P>
<P>
   Haring has his old-media moments still, of course. He just
published ``Beyond the Charts,'' a book about MP-3 audio software's
impact on the music business.
</P>
<P>
   But even with the book, Haring isn't totally old school: He
self-published the first 5,000 copies and is selling it through his
own site and ``finer online booksellers everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Haring said he will remain based in Los Angeles, calling it
``sort of ground-zero for the digital music revolution.'' The
lesson of Web music, however, could be the lesson for Haring's own
move to become the Brand Man.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can do it yourself,'' Haring said. ``That's one of the
messages being obscured right now because the majors are getting
into it.'' &QL;

DAVID BLOOM'S SITE OF THE WEEK
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: With DIGITAL-LA-COLUMN, David Bloom's weekly column on the
intersection of entertainment, art and technology) 
By DAVID BLOOM 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
 
THE SITE: Oscar.com: The official site for next week's Academy
Awards, with lots of material on all the events building up to and
moving into Hollywood's biggest night. 
WHERE: www.oscar.com 
WHAT'S COOL: Behind-the-scenes video of Oscar preparations, the

lots of video on the big night of red-carpet arrivals, backstage
winners' interviews and Governors Ball entrances. 
FEATURES: A ton of historical data on previous winners; details on
best picture nominees; transcripts of acceptance speeches
(shudder); trivia; electronic greeting cards; printable ballots

 &HT;    Green space in Savannah
 &HT;    By Dan Chapman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAVANNAH, Ga. _ Sogs and goats were dyed green, as were the
hooves of horses.
</P>
<P>
   The cheeks of marching cadets and the beer bellies of gamboling
Shriners also were smudged green from the lips of very friendly, or
very inebriated (or very both) women.
</P>
<P>
   Friday was just another typical St. Patrick's Day parade and
party for citizens of this South Georgia port city and maybe
400,000 of their closest, green-garbed friends.
</P>
<P>
   While as many as 600,000 revelers were expected along the
1.9-mile parade route, considerably fewer people lined Abercorn,
Bay and Broughton streets. Heavy rains and tornado watches on the
Georgia coast Thursday surely scared off many a partygoer.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the weather turned perfect for the nation's second-largest
parade honoring the Irish and their culture.
</P>
<P>
   By midday, midway through the four-hour marathon, the skies
cleared and the temperature hit the mid-70s.
</P>
<P>
   Perfect weather for families, Spring Break exiles and others to
cheer on high school marching bands, Civil War re-enactors, honor
guards, Dalmatians and all those Shriners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just having a party, the usual St. Patrick's Day
party,'' said Gene Warren, 65, observing the whirl of pageantry
from an East Broad Street porch.
</P>
<P>
   Retired military, Warren embodied the spirit (and spirits) of
St. Paddy's Day. He wore a bright green jacket and green and white
stovepipe hat festooned with shamrocks. His newly reddened face was
nicely framed by white hair and moustache. His Bloody Mary, though,
was empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'll have another,'' he said, and he did.
</P>
<P>
   City leaders' efforts to curtail the booze-fueled hijinks
associated with the parade and accompanying three-day Festival on
the River appeared to be working well Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 500 revelers were arrested or cited, mostly for
underage drinking, relieving themselves in public, and other
alcohol-related indiscretions. Early Friday, Savannah police had
arrested 50 people, the largest number of them for public
indecency.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the debauchery emanates from the festival, the music and
beer bash along the Savannah River.
</P>
<P>
   Yet organizers again this year are trying to ratchet down the
party by restricting the size of beer mugs (16 ounces); number of
beer trucks (seven); and shutting bars earlier (1 a.m.).
</P>
<P>
   It's all part of an effort to draw more hotel-staying,
restaurant-dining families and less booze-guzzling, money-conscious
young adults.
</P>
<P>
   Hotels and motels up to 100 miles away were booked this weekend.
Many Savannah hotels, requiring minimum two-night stays, were
filled before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The family is key to the whole thing,'' said Joe Cetti,
general chairman of the St. Patrick's Day Parade. ``That's good for
the merchants. They'll do quite well. This is just going to have a
great dollar impact.''
</P>
<P>
   It was mostly families along the parade corridor's upper half.
Folks four, five and six deep watched a lot of old guys in shiny
old cars belonging to various Orders and Societies and Clans, wend
their way down Abercorn Street.
</P>
<P>
   The closer to the river, the rowdier the crowds. They lustily
cheered the Marching Dalmatians, the Irish Elvis, the Piggly Wiggly
float, the Budweiser Clydesdales, Miss Georgia and others as they
paraded past the centuries-old homes, green-dyed fountains and
moss-covered oak trees..
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' said Warren, ``is what makes Savannah special.''

   A firestorm of criticism descended a few weeks ago on
DoubleClick, the Internet advertising and consumer data tracking
firm, when it said it would begin linking its trove of heretofore
anonymous data about people's Internet activities with the real
names, addresses and profiles of consumers in a database it had
acquired. The outcry led the company to suspend its plans.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin O'Connor, the chief executive of DoubleClick, said the
problem was simply that ``we got ahead of ourselves'' by moving
before the industry had developed clear guidelines on privacy and
data gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the information in the databases to be linked as
``very innocuous, like if I bought a sweater or something,''
O'Connor said one of the reasons DoubleClick had overreached was,
in fact, that it is ``a very good company, a very ethical and moral
company'' that meant to help consumers by saving marketers money.
``The less people spend on marketing, the cheaper products are,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics saw it far differently. ``I'm appalled at DoubleClick's
approach to this,'' said David Shenk, a seasoned Internet observer
and the author of ``Data Smog'' (HarperCollins, 1997). ``It's clear
they did it with no sensitivity whatsoever to people's privacy.
They were just testing the waters to see if they could get away
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   But sincere or not, DoubleClick's we-mean-no-harm defense fails
to get at the underlying ethical issues surrounding the assembling
of dossiers on people for commercial gain.
</P>
<P>
   DoubleClick and its competitors, which manage the banner ads
that appear on Web sites _ and while they are at it, take note of
which sites you visited, which links you clicked on, what you
bought and so on _ do their tracking as invisibly as possible.
Before the controversy over database-linking, many Internet users
had no idea it went on.
</P>
<P>
   And for all but the most technically adept, it remains next to
impossible to tell when or by whom you are being tracked as you
surf the Web. The vague privacy-policy fine print on most
commercial Web sites is no help.
</P>
<P>
   All this secrecy and obfuscation is a dead giveaway to a
fundamental ethical problem: no informed consent. And that is by
design, because when it comes to being spied on, the more people
are informed, the less they consent.
</P>
<P>
   DoubleClick allows people to ``opt out'' of being tracked by
using a page on its own site, but if you've never heard of
DoubleClick, how would you know to visit it? DoubleClick's name is
nowhere on its clients' sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go to somebody's Web page and you see a banner ad,
there's no process there for the consumer to ever say anything,''
said Lori Fena, chairwoman of TRUSTe, a nonprofit organization that
monitors Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in the dot-com world don't see what the big deal is.
``The truth is that privacy protection is not really privacy
protection; it's annoyance avoidance,'' says Don Peppers, an author
and marketing expert who also serves on DoubleClick's board. But
when people are annoyed without any way to know who is invading
their privacy, what data they are gathering, whether it is
accurate, what will be done with it or how to stop it, it is
natural to see evil lurking.
</P>
<P>
   Once the tracking goes beyond anonymous click trails and begins
matching offline identities to online behavior, as DoubleClick and
others may yet do, another ethical problem appears: how to keep
``tailored marketing'' from drifting over the line into serious
abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget whether you get served an annoying ad or not; it gets a
lot more interesting when you start to deal with potential digital
red-lining,'' Fena said. The same database that permits a marketer
to selectively send you ads for the same kind of sweater you bought
last fall can also be used to exclude you selectively from seeing
attractive prices or offerings because, say, you've been seen to
buy gangsta rap music online, or to visit Spanish-language sites,
or have otherwise electronically flagged yourself as ``not our kind
of customer.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor would rather not use the word tracking for what his
company does. ``I hate it,'' he said. ``It's a pejorative term.
We're not selling tracking services; we're selling advertising
services.''
</P>
<P>
   His wincing at ``tracking'' highlights the conundrum facing
businesses like his, not to mention their clients: How can they go
on collecting powerful, potentially abusable information about
people on the sly and still persuade themselves that they are
respecting people's privacy _ and doing them a favor besides?
</P>
<P>
   ``The ugly side of privacy loss is that which happens
surreptitiously,'' said Nicholas Negroponte, director of MIT's
Media Lab. ``We trade privacy for various levels of
personalization. What is annoying is when this happens without your
knowing it.'' &QL;

GADZURIC MAKES BIG DIFFERENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ It took all of 182 seconds to see the biggest
change in UCLA's postseason picture. That's when center Dan
Gadzuric entered the Ball State game _ and when the Bruins'
frontline morphed from decent to dominant.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing quite like having a 6-11, 250-pounder with NBA
talent to repel upset nippings of first-round foes and protect the
basket against the best and biggest March Madness has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having Dan makes a huge difference,'' UCLA guard Earl Watson
said. ``Dan dominates the boards. His outlet passes help get us
easy shots. His presence intimidates the other teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Gadzuric did not play in the first-round loss to Detroit Mercy
last year because of a knee injury. But he made an immediate impact
Thursday with 10 points, 12 rebounds and two blocks. He denied Ball
State second shots and made the Cardinals think twice about
entering the lane _ the things he must do against No. 3 seed
Maryland this afternoon for the Bruins to advance to the Sweet 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just tried to post-up hard and play defense,'' said
Gadzuric, who's averaging 10.4 points and 7.9 rebounds during
UCLA's seven-game winning streak. ``I had some butterflies since it
was my first (tournament) game. But I expected that. That's good.
If I didn't, there would be something wrong. But after a while, I
got in the flow.''
</P>
<P>
   Gadzuric's appearance marked the first time in four years UCLA's
big man has been available for the crucial tournament game.
</P>
<P>
   Jelani McCoy missed most of the 1997 Elite Eight loss to
Minnesota because of a bruised sternum. McCoy quit the team weeks
before the 1998 tournament, leaving the tiny Bruins to face massive
Kentucky in the Sweet 16. Last year, Gadzuric missed the Detroit
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan will make life easier for the whole team,'' power forward
Jerome Moiso said. ``(Against Ball State), we were all over the
place until he came in and completed us. It's not just me. He helps
everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins need Gadzuric's size and his fouls against Maryland,
which has five players 6-8 or taller, including all-ACC center
Lonny Baxter and 6-9 forward Terence Morris, who has Lottery Pick
talent.
</P>
<P>
   Like UCLA, the Terps are athletic and aggressive. Freshman point
guard Steve Blake generates much of their offense with penetration;
once the defense collapses, he passes to shooting guard Juan Dixon
for 3-pointers. What's more, they're an excellent offensive
rebounding team, snatching 53 percent of the rebounds available
under the opponent's basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got a strong inside presence,'' Bruins Coach Steve
Lavin said. ``When a shot goes up, they get themselves second- and
third-opportunities. If we don't clean up the glass and limit them
to one shot, we're in for a long night.''
</P>
<P>
   The similarities don't end with frontcourt talent. Both teams
have replaced star point guards. (Maryland's Steve Francis was the
No. 2 pick in the NBA Draft. UCLA's Baron Davis was the No. 3
pick.) Both teams have super shooters (Maryland's Dixon, UCLA's
Jason Kapono). Both teams like to run and both are deep.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, both teams are playing well. The Bruins have won
seven straight games, while the Terps have won 12 of 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Bruins) are playing as well as anybody in the country,''
Maryland coach Gary Williams said. ``UCLA is one of those teams
that has great size and depth at most of (its) positions.''
</P>
<P>
   Including center _ for the first time in four tournaments.

 &HT;    Atlanta's game for `Jeopardy!'
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ With the game show ``Jeopardy!'' taping in Atlanta
this weekend, host Alex Trebek swung over to Athens Friday to speak
to University of Georgia journalism students and take a few
good-natured swings at ABC's ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to wonder about some of the contestants on that
program,'' Trebek said, launching into an imitation host Regis
Philbin and an imaginary player.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the usual color of Post-its?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Uhhhhhhh. . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   Trebek also took a poke at Reege (the two are friends), pointing
out that Philbin has been on ``Celebrity Jeopardy!'' twice. ``And
he finished third both times.''
</P>
<P>
   His ribbing segued into an ode to ``Jeopardy!,'' still
considered to be the toughest game show despite the popularity of
``Millionaire.'' (``Millionaire,'' however, is averaging about 28
million viewers per show to ``Jeopardy!'s'' 18 million.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Granted our (prize) money is nowhere comparable to those other
shows,'' Trebek said, ``but so what? People on our program aren't
there for the money, they're there for the glory, to show off their
intellectual prowess.''
</P>
<P>
   That trivia firepower will be on full display today and Sunday
at the Atlanta Civic Center, when ``Jeopardy!'s''Tournament of
Champions tapes on the road for the first time. The show rarely
leaves Los Angeles because the large electronic board is so
difficult to move and set up.
</P>
<P>
   The quarterfinals start this morning for the 15 champions,
including Eddie Timanus, the blind USA Today sportswriter who is
the show's first blind champion, and Robin Carroll of Marietta,
Ga., who squeaked in by winning her fifth game Friday night. The
finals will wind up Sunday afternoon, and the shows will air the
weeks of May 8 and May 15 (at 7:30 p.m. on Channel 11).
</P>
<P>
   About 16,000 Atlantans will see the tapings live, in four
seatings of 4,000 each. All tickets were given out weeks ago to
people who wrote to ``Jeopardy!'' or won TV or radio contests.
``Jeopardy!'' producer chose Atlanta after taping ``Wheel of
Fortune'' here for the 1996 Olympics and being impressed with the
audience's enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   Trebek, 59, estimated ``Jeopardy!'' has given away between $20
million and $30 million in the 16 years of its present version. A
Canadian broadcaster who had hosted several game shows, Trebek
launched the syndicated version in 1984; NBC ran the original
``Jeopardy!'' from 1964-'75, when it was hosted by Art Fleming.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started we had such a limited budget for our research
library that we called World Book Encyclopedia and asked if they
would send us a set in return for a mention on the air,'' Trebek
recalled. ``Now we make great use of the Internet in our research,
as well as having a full library.''
</P>
<P>
   Sporting a green pocket square in honor of St. Patrick's Day,
Trebek fielded questions from UGA journalism students, including
whether he had seen the vicious and hilarious spoofs of ``Celebrity
Jeopardy!'' that ``Saturday Night Live'' has run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen one or two of them,'' he said. ``I like them.
They're fun. When you become part of the American cultural scene,
you don't mind when people do take-offs. Hey, we're in show
business _ you can't take yourself too seriously.''

 &HT;    Rapper's belongings moved from apartment
 &HT;    By David Pendered
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A rap artist has moved from the apartment complex
where five people were wounded Sunday in a limousine outside her
residence.
</P>
<P>
   Shawntae Harris, known professionally as Da Brat, was not
evident at the apartment as movers emptied it Friday.
</P>
<P>
   She was slated as an opening act Friday night for a Mariah Carey
concert in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Four moving men wheeled the contents from the fourth-floor
dwelling at Post Chastain in Buckhead, an upscale residential area
and entertainment district. The belongings were loaded into an
unmarked white truck. The men declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Two women packing items in the apartment said the residence was
not Harris' home. One said she was the occupant. The other wore a
yellow T-shirt with the So So Def record logo, Harris' record
label.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta police and Post Properties officials have confirmed that
Harris resided in that apartment.
</P>
<P>
   The belongings in Harris' apartment included a big-screen TV, a
cat's scratching post covered in beige carpet and a large wall
display. There were more than 20 cardboard boxes, and a large
hanging wardrobe was marked ``Coats,'' while most others were
unmarked.
</P>
<P>
   Harris is slated to appear April 13 in Atlanta Municipal Court
on charges from a March 7 brawl.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, 25, allegedly struck a woman with either a pistol or a
shot glass after an argument in the Chili Pepper nightclub in
Buckhead. Harris was charged with battery.
</P>
<P>
   Five days later, two men shot 15 times at a limousine loaded
with nine passengers outside Harris' apartment, wounding five.
</P>
<P>
   There are conflicting accounts as to the relationship between
the limousine's passengers and Harris.
</P>
<P>
   The limousine occupants initially told police they were friends
and relatives of Harris, but later denied knowing her.

TEXAS TROOPERS REPRIMANDED FOR WEARING KKK-TYPE HOODS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ One state trooper will be fired and five others
were suspended without pay for ``unprofessional conduct'' in
connection with a 1988 birthday party in which the officers donned
paper hats that looked like Ku Klux Klan hoods, Department of
Public Safety officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The reprimanded troopers have the right to appeal their
punishments, which were ordered by DPS Col. Thomas A. Davis Jr.,
after a two-month internal affairs investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The only other two officers who wore the makeshift hoods already
have left the force, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have completed our investigation into this unfortunate
incident and taken the disciplinary action we believe is proper,''
Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   The reprimanded officers are white; the former trooper being
honored at the party in the Livingston office is black.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston, a city of 7,300 people, is about 70 miles northeast
of downtown Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The hood-donning, captured in a photograph that has been seen
around the world, was brought to light in January by former trooper
Darron Anderson. It showed him seated with a birthday cake in his
lap surrounded by eight hooded men.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson claimed he was traumatized by the incident 11 years
ago, when he was a rookie trooper and the only African-American
assigned to the Livingston office.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, a Houston native, was dismissed from the DPS last year
after being indicted for arson in connection with a fire that
destroyed his truck on April 19, 1999. He filed an insurance claim,
but later withdrew it, repaid his insurer and admitted torching his
own vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Anderson nor a spokesman could be reached for comment
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   He disclosed the ``intimidating'' hood-donning incident on the
day before his still-pending arson charge initially was set for
trial. Later, colleagues said Anderson had asked the officers to
pose with the paper hoods, as officers had done for another
African-American trooper four years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Recommended for dismal was patrol Sgt. Darryl Wright of
Woodville, although it was not disclosed why he drew the harshest
penalty. He will remain suspended with pay while the appeal of his
recommended discharge runs its course, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Wright was suspended with pay on Jan. 11 after being accused of
making racist statements to a deputy in the Tyler County sheriff's
office on Jan. 6, the day after Anderson went public with his
complaint. He was later identified as one of the troopers in the
party photo.
</P>
<P>
   The others also were suspended with pay pending the outcome of
the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The five reprimanded officers were suspended without pay for
periods ranging from three to five days, so all will be back on
duty next week, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Suspended for five days was Trooper Wilburn Glen Goodwin of
Livingston. Receiving three-day suspensions were Troopers Bobby
Perry, Ricky Thigpen and Larry Pitts, all of Livingston; and Cpl.
Paul Hearne of Lufkin.
</P>
<P>
   Two other troopers who appeared in the photograph had retired by
the time Anderson called attention to the incident, Davis added.

   When David Robb was a child, he spent much time at school
sketching cars and airplanes and much time at home putting together
plastic models of them. Today, Robb, who turns 45 in a few days,
directs motorcycle design for BMW, whose bike sales increased by
one-third last year, to a record 65,000 worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Robb's greatest success is the new luxury touring model, the K
1200 LT, built for two riders. In six months on the market, it has
become BMW's best-selling motorcycle. It is also its most
expensive, at just under $20,000, with options like a six-disc CD
player, a dual-control heated seat system, heated hand grips,
cruise control, an on-board computer, an intercom and cup holders.
</P>
<P>
   Before Robb came along, BMW motorcycles had a reputation for
sturdiness but not style.``They were like the CPA parents wanted
their daughter to marry,'' said Robb, who works in Munich.
``Meanwhile, she was dreaming of James Dean.''
</P>
<P>
   Although devoted to sports like hang gliding and skydiving, Robb
did not ride motorcycles until he was nearly 30. After studying at
the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, Calif., he went to
work for Chrysler as a car designer.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, his job became a casualty of the company's effort to
avoid bankruptcy, so Robb bought a Eurail pass, toured the
continent and returned with a half-dozen job offers. He took one at
Audi, then moved to BMW four years later.
</P>
<P>
   After being put in charge of bike design in 1993, Robb took on
the heart of the motorcycle market _ the cruiser. To differentiate
BMW, he narrowed the bike's ``waist'' and imparted a sinuous ``S''
shape to its frame and seat.
</P>
<P>
   A test-track accident several years ago did not diminish Robb's
enthusiasm for riding. On his Powerbook is a digital photograph
taken recently at a test track. It shows his bike cornering at an
acute angle; visible inside the helmet is a distinct smile.

FORMER ACTIVIST H. RAP BROWN SOUGHT FOR SHOOTING OFFICERS IN
ATLANTA 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This article is part of TIMES EXPRESS. It is a condensed
version of a story that will appear in tomorrow's New York Times.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A Muslim cleric formerly known as H. Rap Brown, a
leader of the Black Panthers in the 1960s, was the subject of an
intense citywide manhunt Friday after a Fulton County sheriff's
deputy said the cleric shot him and another deputy near downtown
Atlanta late Wednesday. The second deputy died of his injuries
Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The cleric, now known as Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin, has lived in
relative peace in Atlanta's West End neighborhood after serving
five years behind bars in New York for attempted armed robbery.
Atlanta Police Chief Beverly Harvard said the deputy selected
Al-Amin's picture from a photo array as the man who fired an
assault rifle at the two deputies at close range. The department is
now seeking him on a murder warrant.
</P>
<P>
   One of the deputies, Ricky Kinchen, 35, lost most of his blood
at the scene and died at Grady Memorial Hospital on Friday
afternoon after undergoing three operations. The other deputy,
Aldranon English, 28, was less seriously wounded and was able to
describe the shooting incident to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   According to Harvard, the deputies, who are black, were
attempting to arrest Al-Amin on a warrant issued by suburban Cobb
County in January after Al-Amin failed to appear in court to answer
charges in connection with a traffic stop last May. Al-Amin had
been accused of driving a stolen Ford Explorer, having improper
insurance documents, and of impersonating a police officer by
flashing a fake badge and claiming he was a police officer in
Whitehall, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   The deputies were circling the area near his house and grocery
store when a black Mercedes pulled up near the rear of the store.
The deputies approached the car and asked the driver to get out,
which he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deputy then asked him to show his hands, and the person
responded by saying, `Okay, here they are,''' Harvard said,
explaining that the man opened fire. One of the deputies also
managed to shoot the gunman.
</P>
<P>
   The Police Department later said a nationwide all-points
bulletin had been issued for his arrest.

THE WARNING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, March 19, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If anyone can be said to speak for the accumulated learning of
technical economics on the subject of today's stock market, it is
probably Robert J. Shiller. He is centrally located in the
profession: trained at Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
professor at Yale University, a deacon of the famous Cowles
Foundation for research in Economics. He is distinguished: in 1996
his ``Market Volatility and Macro Markets'' won the first Paul
Samuelson Award for the year's best writing on finance. He is
practical, a partner in the prosperous firm of Case Shiller Weiss,
Inc., which sells market data to real estate industry. He's still
young enough (53) that when he makes a prediction his reputation is
at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Most significantly, he is self-aware. Shiller operates in the
shadow of what surely is the most famous prediction by an economist
in the 20th century. It was in October 1929 that Yale's Irving
Fisher _ the best known economist of his day _ pronounced his
opinion that stocks had reached a new and permanently high plateau.
</P>
<P>
   That he lost a considerable personal fortune in the ensuinmg
crash only buttressed Fisher's place in history as a symbol of the
shortcomings of economists. Yale had to buy his house to save him
from eviction. The very real contributions Fisher had made to
deepening economic understanding were overlooked for the rest of
his lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Thus it is an event of some significance that Shiller has
written a crystal-clear and tough-minded critique of the factors
that have driven US stock markets to their current levels and
called his book ``Irrational Exuberance.'' In it, he argues that
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan had it exactly right when
he uttered the famous phrase in a speech in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The current high levels of the market don't represent a
consensus judgement by a cadre of sober experts, says Shiller.
Instead, today's market is sky-high because of wishful thinking by
millions of people, egged on by professionals in and around Wall
Street whose incentives all run in the direction of the more the
merrier.
</P>
<P>
   The speculative frenzy is comparable to periods during which the
stock prices peaked (measured in terms of price-earnings ratios) in
1901, 1929 and 1966, says Shiller. It simply is not likely to last.
And though he is careful not to say when he expects the fever to
break, he is clear that he expects it to happen within the next few
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lack of sobriety about its downside and the
consequences that would ensue'' if the Dow Jones Insustrial Average
dropped to, say, 6000 and stayed there for some years, he writes.
The harmful effects would be enormous _ to individuals, pension
funds, college endowments and charitable organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Averaged tripled between 1994 and 1999.
Nothing else in the economy tripled during those years. So Shiller
surveys an even dozen factors he says have contributed to the
self-fulfilling psychology of the bull market in stocks. Taken
together, he says, they comprise the ``skin'' of the bubble.
</P>
<P>
   _ The arrival of Internet technology at a time when corporate
earnings already were high has given rise to an exaggerated sense
of technical change.
</P>
<P>
   _ The decline of foreign rivals and the resultant surge of
American triumphalism has given rise to a pattern in which all news
is viewed as good news.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cultural changes favoring business, trends in the compensation
of executives in particular, has fastened ever-greater attention to
market capitalization.
</P>
<P>
   _ A Republican Congress, having made capital gains tax cuts in
1997, has intimated the possibiility of further cuts, leading
investors to hold on to appreciated assents they otherwise might
have sold.
</P>
<P>
   _ The sheer size pf the generation of the baby boom is widely
believed to have a salutary effect on the market (though its likely
ultimate effects may be quite ?.)
</P>
<P>
   _ An expansion in media reporting of business news, including
sport-page-style coverage of market ups and downs, has stimulated
increased demand for stocks.
</P>
<P>
   _ Analysts' increasingly optimistic forcasts show a distinct
upward bias, something like ``grade inflation'' in the nation's
schools.
</P>
<P>
   _ The expansion of defined contribution pension plans has
dramatically increased interest in the stock market as individuals
take responsibility for their own pensions.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mutual funds have all but replaced bank accounts as a vehicle
for savings.
</P>
<P>
   _ The decline of inflation has accentuated the distorion
economists know as ``money illusion'' since stockprices are rarely
expressed in terms of constant dollars.
</P>
<P>
   _ The expansion of trade through the introduction of discount
brokers, day-trading and round-the-clock trading possibilities has
lowered the cost of trading and contributed to the near-doubling of
the turnover-rate since 1982.
</P>
<P>
   _ The advent of widespread new opporunities for gambling _
everything from riverboat and indian reservation casinos to
off-track betting, video poker and all manner of Internet games _
has fostered a get-rich-quick mentality.
</P>
<P>
   Shiller's book is a fascinating tour of insights gleaned from
anthropology, sociology, psychology and other skiens that recently
have been joined to form the field known as behavior finance.
(Shiller is co-director with Richard Thaler of the University of
Chicago of a pioneering project in the field sponsored by the
Russell Sage Foundation.) He is downright withering when describing
the breathless business coverage and the proliferation of various
``new era'' scenarios _ key factors in the propagation of
bubble-thought.
</P>
<P>
   To the reason most often ventured by serious economists for a
plausible change in the investing regime _ the rise of an
ever-broader global market _ Shiller's answer is that
considerations of fairness and resentment may give rise to
corporate and governmental strategies abroad that undercut American
dominance.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose you accept Shiller's analysis. What should investors do
now? Lighten up on stocks, of course _ rigorous diversification is
always a good idea. But we can't all get out of the market, he
rightly observes. And those who have bought at market highs have
already made their mistake. So the single best step that
individuals can take would be to increase their personal savings
rate _ as much as an additional 10 percent of pretax income
maintained for a number of years.
</P>
<P>
   Shiller acknowledges in his book that he runs a substantial risk
of embarrassment by arguing that stock market returns will be low
or negative in coming years. Still, he argues, it seems to have
been quite possible to tell when returns were inappropriately high
or low during earlier bubbles and subsequent busts.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, he continues, ``An observor who remains silent about
unjustified high values because he or she could be wrong about the
outlook is no better than a doctor who, having disagnosed high
blood pressuee in a patient, says nothing because the patient might
be lucky and show no ill effects.'' Shiller's book might be wrong _
but it has no peer as a differential diagnosis of today's stock
market.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, even doctors who send their patients away with good
news ringing in their ears may sometimes change their minds _ after
the stroke has occurred. Irving Fisher, it should be remembered,
modified his views as the Great Depression deepened. In 1932 he
characterized the problem as an innovation-led boom which got out
of hand, culminating in a recession, aggravated by poor monetary
policy and heavy debt burdens into a depression _ an analysis which
stands up quite well today.

WEIRD WORLD OF `TITUS'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below; ``tonight'' refers to Mon., March 20) 
Our rating: 3 stars 
By REPORTER NAME 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Normal people terrify me,'' proclaims Christopher Titus at the
beginning of his new sitcom, economically titled ``Titus.'' Normal
people may reciprocate and find his show's depiction of family life
equally terrifying. However, things tilt in ``Titus''' favor as he
cites a study suggesting 63 percent of the country is in
dysfunctional relationships _ meaning, of course, the majority of
the country will easily be able to relate to what sometimes can be
gallows humor here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Titus,'' the situation comedy, is not to be confused with
Julie Taymor's cinematic atrocity exhibition, though the characters
here almost treat one another as viciously as in that Shakespearean
film. Based upon the life of stand-up comic Christopher Titus, the
show explores some of the grimmest parts of family dysfunction with
both insight and humor. Some of the jokes here will jolt you from
the typical sitcom complacency _ no slack-jawed viewing allowed
here _ and if each episode doesn't quite find a moment of
redemption after mining these hearts of darkness, they leave you
amused enough that you can continue soldiering on in your own
imperfect life.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Titus plays a version of himself who works as a
hotheaded hot-rod customizer. His world, whether he likes it or
not, revolves around his father Ken, equal parts gruff charm and
pure, heartless cluelessness when it comes to parenting (is it a
compliment to say that Stacy Keach is perfect in the role?).
</P>
<P>
   Christopher's dim-bulb brother Dave (Zack Ward) is even more
cowed by his pop but still lives with him. Episodes are filled with
flashbacks reflecting their dad's inhumanity to his young men _
flinging kids into lakes to teach them to swim, reading to his
poker buddies from his son's diary with mock teariness.
</P>
<P>
   Through the dysfunction, somehow, Christopher still manages to
hold on to his girlfriend Erin (played with charm and subtlety by
Cynthia Watros) without threatening the relationship too much.
Titus shares his thoughts and explains his and his family's twisted
motivations in black-and-white sequences set in what he calls a
``neutral space,'' suggesting that even though his life has been a
horror show, he's come out on the other side intact enough to find
the humor therein.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's episode, alas, is not the hilariously edgy pilot, in
which Christopher and his brother fear their father is dead simply
because he hasn't left his bedroom for a beer in four days but fear
him too much to actually intrude upon his privacy. Instead, it's
about his confusion over the fact that his girlfriend has seemed
distant and troubled lately, so he goes to her office to confront
her about what he assumes is an affair. Instead, when he finds out
that she's being sexually harassed, he crumples at her feet and
sighs, ``Thank God!''
</P>
<P>
   A future episode probes, with disarming candor, the mind-set of
a person whose discomfort with happiness forces him to torpedo a
relationship and focuses on a time the real Christopher and Erin
cheated on one another. ``Brave'' is a word used too often and
frequently fatuously when describing show-biz products or
performances, but ``Titus'' comes close, laying bare one man's
genuine pain and inviting the world to have a really good laugh at
it. &QL;

<P>
   PSKOV, Russia _ God moves in mysterious ways, except, maybe, in
Pskov, a city that has monasteries and grand churches and religious
artifacts the way Americans have remote-control clickers and
half-read copies of People magazine. This is a town where you can
stand in one square _ they call it the square of seven churches _
and see, yes, seven churches. This sort of thing a god would
appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   It suggests why the Rev. Andrei Nikolayevich Davydov was plucked
out of a parish in Latvia six years ago and deposited in Pskov, in
a troubled little church _ a church whose front door opens onto a
Soviet radio condenser factory, a church with no heat and a dirt
floor, a church used in communist times as a garage for the KGB. A
church that, when the Russian Orthodox patriarchy regained it in
1991, was found to harbor a number of skeletons in the vestibule, a
single bullet hole in each cranium.
</P>
<P>
   This was a church in a jam. But Father Andrei and the church
have turned out to be a holy union of problem and solution, of
labor and love, of canvas and _ literally _ artist.
</P>
<P>
   Every church needs a good priest. But an artist, it turned out,
was what this church needed most of all.
</P>
<P>
   In Father Andrei, 43, intense, balding and bushy-bearded, it got
both. He grew up in Moscow. His father was a philosopher and
author. But from the very start, the son was an uncommonly talented
painter.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it's just a part of my biography,'' Father Andrei said
during a long conversation over tea in a spare, white-walled studio
next to the church. ``If I were not given a chance to paint, I
would probably die.''
</P>
<P>
   He began painting landscapes and other common scenes as a child.
As a young man, he graduated from the Moscow Art Theater, the
nation's top art institute, and worked as an illustrator of
children's books. But while most artists his age honed their
talents on bowls of fruit or portraits, he was somehow drawn to
paint religious icons: saints, Madonnas, crucifixions,
resurrections _ all on lacquered wooden panels, just as in medieval
times.
</P>
<P>
   These were not just knockoffs. For the young Andrei, icon art
became an almost transcendental obsession.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turned out to be so interesting that I realized that I
needed nothing else,'' he said. ``This is a way of depicting in
human terms the secrets of God's kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   ``What strikes me about icons is this ability to create an image
of someone you're conversing with. I think all our lives are a
search for interlocutors. You decide after years of searching that
you can't talk to this person; or that person cannot talk to you.
And after more years, you finally decide that the only one you can
have a real conversation with is your God.''
</P>
<P>
   It was icons that brought Father Andrei to the church, first in
an effort to better understand his art, then as a student of the
priesthood and, finally, a dozen years ago, as a priest. As he
became closer to his subject, he said, his icons improved _ ``just
as if I'd been making Fords, I'd understand much better what goes
into cars.''
</P>
<P>
   As icons go, Father Andrei came to produce not Fords, but
Bentleys. He makes rich, luminous images on parched spruce and fir:
portraits medieval in their primitiveness, but so finely wrought
and brightly shaded that they almost leap off the wood with life.
</P>
<P>
   He became well known, if not famous, for his work. His icons
came to be in demand in some European churches. None of this had
any real impact on his career as a priest, which took him and his
wife, Marina _ Russian Orthodox priests can marry _ out of Moscow
to a tiny parish in Lithuania, then to Latvia.
</P>
<P>
   In Latvia, feelings against the nation's former Soviet occupiers
were strong, and life as a Russian priest was difficult.
Immigration officials there demanded that Father Andrei choose
between Latvia and his legal residence in Moscow. Then, in 1994, he
was offered a post in Pskov _ a tiny cathedral laid low by 74 years
of Soviet occupation, with a factory on the outside, old scaffolds
and a dirt floor on the inside, and no money to do anything about
either.
</P>
<P>
   The Cathedral of the Nativity of St. John the Baptist, as it was
called, is not your average house of worship. It dates to 1124 _
the oldest cathedral in Pskov, one of the oldest cities in all
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Eleven princes and princesses of Pskov were interred in its
walls and in a six-acre monastery added in the 1200s.
</P>
<P>
   Architecturally, it is a singular example of Russian design in
the years before Genghis Khan swept across the steppes: compact and
simple, a white stucco box with unassuming caps on its three drums
instead of the more flamboyant and common onion domes.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Its uniqueness probably saved it. The Communists tore down all
but two monastery buildings to build the radio parts factory, but
kept up the church's exterior as a tourist site. The interior was
left to decay: under communism, the little church was a KGB garage,
a peat store and a tannery.
</P>
<P>
   That was a historical tragedy, for St. John had been lavishly
decorated in frescoes and icons of the so-called Pskov school, from
the 1100s to the 1500s, among the world's leading examples of icon
design. Pskov icons became prized for their brilliant reds and deep
greens, their blending of religious and folk art and their
delicate, elongated depictions of people and animals.
</P>
<P>
   Once there were scores. But inside the old church, nothing was
left _ not even the traditional icon-hanging wall, called an
iconostasis, which separates Orthodox church altars from the nave
where worshipers gather. The cathedral's white stucco walls were
effectively as bare as a vast untouched swath of artist's canvas.
</P>
<P>
   Which was, of course, exactly what they were.
</P>
<P>
   Father Andrei says he was not brought to Pskov for his artistic
talents. But once he saw the church, he said, he knew he had found
a life's work.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are not so many 12th-century churches in Russia, you
know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that it was totally empty _ no frescoes, no iconostasis _
meant that I had to work here,'' he said. ``Had there been old
frescoes, there would have been a question of restoration, of how
to do some things. But this was an offer I could not turn down.''
</P>
<P>
   His art has proved to be the decaying church's other savior. To
buy and install an insulated spruce floor, Father Andrei produced
an intricate gold-on-copper icon for a Belgian church. A school of
iconography, now housed in the nave, produces other paintings that
are sold to finance renovations. Growing interest among Pskov's
elite has led the city to donate 30,000 rubles _ about $1,000 _ for
double-pane glass in the cathedral's 49 windows. A pine balcony,
the choir's home, has risen in the rear, up a flight of impossibly
steep 900-year-old stairs.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, icons and frescoes are reappearing. Father Andrei
and his family make their own paints from traditional materials,
hand-grinding lapis lazuli, malachite and cinnabar on glass plates
into deep blues and greens and reds _ big grains for bright colors,
fine dust for soft ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I use synthetic paints,'' he said, ``I don't get the same
crystalline structure and the icon doesn't reflect light the same
way. With paints I could buy, this blue'' _ he pointed to the
lining of a saint's robe _ ``would be black in the darkness of the
church. But with these paints, just with a candle, it's deep and
beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   The iconostasis, a glowing work in progress, already boasts
life-size portraits of Mary and Jesus, smaller depictions of John
and a Pskovian princess who founded the church, and the beginnings
of 12 icons depicting Christian holidays. On the left wall, in
recesses over tombs of early royalty, are two frescoes of biblical
scenes; on the right wall, another fresco shows the church's
founding, some of which can be seen on the Internet at
www.geocities.com/Paris/Pavilion/8345/english.html.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   St. John is by no means the only Pskov site with new icons.
Across the Velikaya River, the Mirozhsky monastery, also in
disrepair, has turned an abandoned building into a showcase of new
icon art; a church some 25 miles down the road has a flourishing
school of icon painting. Pskov's art museum is a center of icon
restoration.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of blank walls still to fill: this city of
200,000 has 56 cathedrals built in or before the 17th century, less
than half of them open.
</P>
<P>
   A challenge for some ambitious artist, perhaps, but not for
Father Andrei, whose own church remains largely an untouched
canvas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's for my entire life,'' he said. ``I could be finished here
in a month. ``But I'm in no hurry at all.''

NICK LETS KIDS PICK

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kids can't go into the gym at all today. Some people came to
school this morning and put an extra American flag up outside, and
all day a bunch of grown-ups have been walking into the gym and
talking quietly. They don't stay long.
</P>
<P>
   That's probably what an election day looks like to a blissfully
unaware grade-schooler.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Ellerbee, the veteran government and political
correspondent who anchors Nickelodeon's Nick News programs, wants
to get kids involved in the political process _ as more than
distant observers of polling precincts in their gyms and libraries
_ and to hear them out on what they want and need from their
national leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the top-rated cable network is airing Ellerbee's ``Nick
News Special Edition: Kids Pick the Issues,'' a town hall meeting
of sorts for U.S. citizens who will have to wait five to 10 years
before they can cast their first real ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The special kicks off the network's fourth ``Kids Pick the
President'' campaign culminating in October with a viewer
``voting'' poll, one which in past years has accurately
foreshadowed the actual winner.
</P>
<P>
   Ellerbee was relaxed, confident and enthusiastic about the
program, and probably about life in general, as she talked over
lunch on a Beverly Hills hotel patio.
</P>
<P>
   Ellerbee, who turns 56 this year, is healthy nearly eight years
after her breast cancer surgery and more than 10 years after
quitting drinking. She had changed her dark brown hair to sandy
blond and celebrated a 60-pound weight loss by starting the
interview in snug size 6 jeans, and later changing to a short slim
skirt and red spike heels for a TV appearance.
</P>
<P>
   She referred frequently to notes scrawled over nearly every
square inch of several sheets of paper and, like a good journalist
should, anticipated most of the questions and answered them well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real difference between this show and the other Nick
specials we've done is our other Nick specials are always about
kids, for kids,'' Ellerbee said. ``This one is also about kids, for
kids, but beyond that what we're saying is we want grown-ups to
watch this show, we want people in power to hear kids' voices on
this subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids have serious thoughts about what the issues are, and they
have some ideas about what ought to be done. And we think it would
be important for people in power to listen. Why? Right now kids are
20 percent of the population, but they're 100 percent of the
future. And elections are about the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Nickelodeon doesn't expect political power brokers to tune into
the special by accident while looking for the latest episode of
``Little Bill'' or another kid-oriented series. The network is
sending tapes of the program to every member of Congress as well as
business leaders, children's activists, broadcasters and others.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the issues that have come up when Ellerbee talks with
kids about government include:
</P>
<P>
   !bbox!Schools feeling more like prisons under security
crackdowns imposed since the Columbine High shootings.
</P>
<P>
   !bbox!Budget cutbacks that have led to cancellation of art,
music, sports and other school programs.
</P>
<P>
   !bbox!Health concerns, ranging from peer pressure over drug and
alcohol use to the lack of medical insurance and its affect on
their families.
</P>
<P>
   !bbox!Technology, especially how to access the Internet for
educational or harmless uses while teachers, librarians and parents
are trying to shield kids from pornography and predators.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basis of Nick News, and one of the ways we've always been
able to reach kids on serious issues, is that every kid has a
built-in, inborn sense of fairness,'' Ellerbee said. ``You'll hear
them say things like, `That's not FAIR.' That's as good a point to
start a political discussion as I know.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Nick News won journalism's coveted Peabody Award for
Ellerbee's special devoted to the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Nick
News had deliberately avoided the story for the sake of its mostly
sexually naive viewership until the very explicit Starr report was
released on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Ellerbee, not given to tooting her own horn, was proud not only
of the honor, but of the Peabody committee's reasoning in giving
its only Lewinsky-related award to Nick News.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said that in explaining it to kids, we had actually
explained it better to grown-ups than anyone else,'' she said,
noting there was no detailed discussion about the sexual affair
between the White House intern and President Clinton, only what
came after.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really all we said was the president had an inappropriate
relationship with a woman to whom he was not married, and when
caught, lied about it. And right there, instantly we were able to
move into issues: Is it ever OK for the president to lie? Is it
ever OK for you to lie? What happens when you lie? Do you know what
censure is? What is impeachment?
</P>
<P>
   ``And we explained all these various options, and then we asked
kids not what they thought would happen, because that implies a
broader political grasp. We asked them what they thought
!ital!should happen,'' Ellerbee said. ``And their answers were
fascinating and they made sense, although my one favorite was a
10-year-old boy who said, 'Couldn't we just put him in a time-out
until he says he's sorry?'''
</P>
<P>
   Ellerbee said adults often complain there shouldn't be news
shows for kids because children already are overwhelmed by the
media.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons Nick News exists is because we do believe
that kids are bombarded with a lot of information from a lot of
sources, and it's not being given to them in an age-appropriate
manner or in context,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the worries that we all have about kids being
overexposed, and they're legitimate, but what are you going to do?
Are you going to stand at the edge of the ocean and turn back the
tide? I don't think so.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you can do is teach your child to be media literate, and
that starts the day you stop pretending that, if you ignore it,
television will go away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watch TV with your children, watch a sitcom,'' Ellerbee said.
``Watch a commercial and ask, 'What are they selling here _
toothpaste or popularity?' ... Watch the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you work with your child and watch and do simple things
like that, you will raise a child who can use these technologies as
a tool rather than becoming a tool of these technologies,'' she
said. ``It's not that difficult, and it's a lot better than
throwing your hands in the air and saying it's all terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the kids on her Clinton-Lewinsky special believed the
Starr report should not have been put out on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a self-governing factor in there that you have to
admire,'' Ellerbee said. ``We tend to think of kids as dumb instead
of just smaller, and tend to think as we get older we get smarter.
And sometimes we just get older.'' &QL;

<P>
   MONTPELIER, Vt. _ As the Vermont House of Representatives was
approving a bill creating ``civil unions'' for same-sex couples
Thursday night, Nancy Elder turned to her partner of four years as
they sat in the chamber watching together, swallowed hard and said,
``So, Theresa, do you really want to do this?''
</P>
<P>
   As she all but proposed, she said Friday, she was thinking that
now that Vermont appeared on the verge of creating a sort of
parallel marriage system for same-sex couples, ``Wow, you really
have to put your money where your mouth is.'' Responded Theresa,
who also uses the last name of Elder, ``Absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   Many other newly unite-able couples will likely be standing,
like the Elders, in lines at town clerks for civil union licenses
this fall if the Vermont bill is passed into law as expected and
takes effect in September. The law, passed in response to a state
Supreme Court ruling last December that same-sex couples were being
unconstitutionally discriminated against, would give them virtually
all the state rights, benefits and responsibilities that
heterosexual spouses have, in areas from child custody to probate
law. Among her circle of lesbian friends, Elder said Friday,
``Everyone I've talked to will be doing it'' _ at least five or six
couples.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, that would not have been the case. Many feminist
lesbians long regarded marriage as an oppressive and patriarchal
institution. Gay men long evinced little interest in marriage as
well. Some had similar aversions to such an ``establishment''
model; some chose other battles to fight for more basic acceptance.
Many gay men and lesbians also worried about sparking greater
hostility from the conservative public _ and success in pushing for
marriage seemed so remote a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, as public acceptance of gay and lesbian
couples has grown, a national push for same-sex marriage has gained
momentum, and it appears to have drawn its impetus not only from
the gay rights advocates who organized it but from the most grass
roots of levels: same-sex couples deciding they wanted, and would
demand, the very same status as their straight counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I think has happened is that over the last 10 or so
years, we have seen an unprecedented increase in the visibility and
identity of gay and lesbian people as families,'' said Paula
Ettelbrick, family policy director of the National Gay and Lesbian
Task Force Policy Institute. ``We have claimed that identity and
the world has allowed us increasingly to claim that identity.''
</P>
<P>
   Many factors may be at work, she and others said, including: a
baby boom, particularly among lesbian couples, which has led them
to be more concerned about gaining rights and protections for their
families; the gay male experience of lacking the rights of spouses
when partners died of AIDS; the maturing and aging of a generation
of openly gay men and lesbians, and a general rise in their
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Purely and simply,'' Ettelbrick said, ``You allow yourself to
expect to be treated equally in all regards. You allow yourself to
want the things you thought were so unattainable.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews in Vermont and New York Friday, several gay and
lesbian partners described how their own attitudes toward marriage
and partnership have been evolving.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Kletecka, a 46-year-old social worker, lives in Waterbury,
Vt., with his partner of nearly 16 years, Robert Dostis, who is
director of the nonprofit Vermont Campaign to End Childhood Hunger.
Though they have bought houses and taken in foster children
together, he said, for a long time they did not even think about
marriage or some more formal union.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed so unattainable,'' Kletecka said. And as the Vermont
push for marriage mounted, he said, he worried that ``we were
really maybe trying to push the envelope too quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   But at some point, he said, ``it all of a sudden dawned on me
that this is not about pushing envelopes or imposing agendas, this
is just about recognizing relationships. And if, in fact, my
relationship with Robert is a significant, valuable relationship,
it makes no sense that we shouldn't have the same options, even if
they're flawed options, that any other couple has.''
</P>
<P>
   Kletecka said that though there was broad consensus in Vermont's
gay and lesbian populations that the civil unions bill should pass,
he expected only perhaps 25 or 30 percent of Vermont's same-sex
couples to seek civil union licenses _ ``at least half the women
and a third or a quarter of the men,'' he guessed. ``It's all sort
of unknown territory.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, John Murphy, 40, a publicist who has been with
his partner, Hal Moskowitz, 46, since 1981 said that when they
first met, ``to me the whole notion of getting married was silly.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time people were more anti-establishment than they were
now and we were living on the edge, being openly gay,'' he said.
``Why would we want to mimic an institution like marriage?''
</P>
<P>
   But three years ago Murphy and Moskowitz held a commitment
ceremony with a Jewish cantor and Episcopalian minister. And today,
Murphy carries in his briefcase the legal papers which, taken
together, create a sort of make-your-own civil union: a health care
proxy, durable power of attorney and an Article 81 nomination, a
New York legal document making Moskowitz the guardian of Murphy if
he was to become mentally incapacitated.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said he thought gay and lesbian couples had always really
wanted the right to marry, even if many in the community have been
skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people have always wanted that, but maybe they did not
want to ask,'' he said. ``I don't think our wants are any
different. Some people want to get married, some people don't. Our
community is no different than any other.''

</P>
<P>
   Charles W. Keeler III, who has lived in Staten Island, N.Y.,
with his partner for 18 years, said he believes the gay community
is still split over marriage. ``Some gays oppose the idea of
marriage because they don't want to pattern themselves on the state
model, which hasn't worked out too well, with half of marriages
ending in divorce,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Keeler, who is the president of Integrity/Staten Island, a
gay and lesbian ministry within the Episcopal Church, said he was
excited by the Vermont compromise of providing rights and benefits
without using the word marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Several partners interviewed Friday said that though they wanted
the rights and responsibilities of marriage, they actually liked
the fact that the Vermont bill did not use the word, because it
left them with the image that they were creating a different kind
of partnership, more egalitarian and perhaps more successful.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Elder of Vermont was once married to a man and vowed never
to marry again, she said. But this is different.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see marriage as very patriarchal and very much about
property and ownership,'' she said, ``but I see civil union as a
completely level playing field; Theresa and I are equal partners
and we are willingly doing this as equals.''
</P>
<P>
   Nick Dowen, 57, of Staten Island, said: ``Maybe there is a part
of me that rebels against marriage and I suppose I like civil
unions. It makes it clear its something like a contract, a
relationship in civil society.''
</P>
<P>
   A book editor who has been with his partner for 20 years, he
said he has witnessed a shifting tide in gay men's feelings about
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Attitudes have changed as time has passed and more and more
couples have lived in stable relationships,'' Dowen said.
``Marriage is not just some kind of suburban complacency but people
realize there are real legal tangible benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Among some prominent gay rights advocates, attitudes toward
marriage seem to be evolving as well.
</P>
<P>
   Ettelbrick of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force Policy
Institute said she and her partner, with whom she has two children,
have always told each other in good feminist fashion that they
would never marry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of us say, why do we need it?'' she said. ``Our
commitment is clear. Our families love and support us. We don't
need this.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, she continued, ``I will admit to being very awed by the
developments in Vermont, and just personally, it has made me
rethink the opportunity it might provide for me and for my
children.''
</P>
<P>
   She still believes strongly that all families, traditional or
not, deserve equal protections, she said, and will keep fighting
that fight. ``But at the same time, I have to say the possibility
of a border state to New York allowing something like this is
really very emotional, and part of it is that it signifies a very
long road to being included as citizens of this country.''

 &HT;    Lawsuit against Smith &AMP; Wesson settled
 &HT;    By Julie B. Hairston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A settlement Friday between local governments and the
country's largest gun manufacturer is being hailed as a
breakthrough in controversial lawsuits against weapons makers.
</P>
<P>
   The governments announced they would drop Smith &AMP; Wesson from
their lawsuits, which seek to hold gun makers liable for the toll
of handgun violence. In return, the Connecticut-based company
agreed to ship its guns with safety locks installed and make other
safety improvements. Joining the deal were more than a dozen cities
and counties that have filed gun suits, as well as the federal
government, which has threatened to do so.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton declared the agreement an act of ``courage and
vision'' by Smith &AMP; Wesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a panacea. It will not solve gun violence, but it
is a great first step,'' said Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell, who was
present at the Washington, D.C., announcement. He said the city
would drop its gun safety suit against the other 16 companies named
as defendants if they agree to the deal.
</P>
<P>
   In the deal, brokered by the federal departments of the Treasury
and Housing and Urban Development, Smith &AMP; Wesson agreed to put
external safety locks on all new guns within 60 days and promised
that within 36 months its new guns will incorporate technology that
allows only their owners to fire them.
</P>
<P>
   Within 12 months, no new gun sold by Smith &AMP; Wesson will be able
to be fired by a child under 6 years old, the company pledged.
</P>
<P>
   Dealers and distributors of Smith &AMP; Wesson guns will be required
to perform background checks for all sales. They also will not
permit retail customers to take possession of more than one gun
within a two-week period.
</P>
<P>
   A dealer or distributor will face cancellation of its Smith &AMP;
Wesson contract if ``a disproportionate number'' of crimes is
committed with guns it has sold.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association declined to comment on the deal.
But the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a firearms industry
organization, condemned Smith &AMP; Wesson, saying it had ``violated a
trust with their consumers and with the entire domestic firearms
industry'' by entering the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an ill-conceived action on the part of one of the most
revered names in the American firearms industry,'' said Robert
Delfay, the foundation's president and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   But cities are likely to use the deal to leverage similar
concessions from other gunmakers. Campbell said Atlanta and other
state and local governments have pledged not to buy guns from
manufacturers who do not agree to abide by the terms of the deal.
Government agencies such as police departments are the largest
legal purchasers of guns.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton encouraged governments to use their economic clout to
support the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smith &AMP; Wesson stuck their neck out here,'' he said. ``I think
all of us, including the federal government, in our procurement
policies _ if we are really serious about making America safer _
ought to send a clear signal that we appreciate what they did.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell _ who has pursued the city's lawsuit despite state
efforts to quash it _ noted that the deal affects only new guns and
will do nothing to improve the safety of ``the hundreds of
thousands of weapons already available.'' But he compared the
change to the introduction of cars with seat belts and medicine
bottles with child safety caps.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, he said, ``is a floor, not a ceiling.''
</P>
<P>
   A Smith &AMP; Wesson spokesman said the agreement will affect how
the company does business but will not infringe on gun owners'
Second Amendment rights. The company's president said it will help
ensure ``the future viability'' of Smith &AMP; Wesson.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Blair Jr., a multiparty lawsuit specialist with the firm of
Baker, Donelson, Bearman &AMP; Caldwell in Memphis, Tenn., said the
settlement makes more sense than fighting the lawsuits, even if
Smith &AMP; Wesson could have won in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could win every case and still face a significant loss,''
Blair said. The expense of litigation would ultimately be as
expensive as any possible settlement, he said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo said Friday's announcement
was the most important one he's made as a member of the Clinton
Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've heard the statistics many times. ... A rate of firearm
deaths for children in this country is 12 times higher than the
other 25 industrialized countries combined,'' Cuomo said. ``So we
approached the process in the belief that reasonable gun
manufacturers could sit down ... to stop the senseless gun
violence.''

   Rick Pitino and Celtic owner Paul Gaston had a private/secret
meeting in New York last week to discuss the future. Gaston told
Pitino he wanted Rick to stay the course and continue to coach the
club. Pitino reportedly offered to quit coaching the Celtics if
Gaston wanted him to. Gaston said, although he had hoped the team
would be further along, he understood the problems Pitino was
having trying to make the team better and supported him as the
coach. Pitino has four years to go on his contract.

   Boston Mayor Tom Menino is supposed to be looking for financial
numbers this weekend from the Red Sox. Menino met with Red Sox boss
John Harrington last week and said he wanted to know what the team
would want the city to put into the project and how the city gets a
return on the money. Menino told Harrington the city money is an
investment, not a donation, and wants the Red Sox to show him how
Boston financially benefits from this in the future. Menino wants a
deal out of a new Fenway Park, similar to what he feels the city
will get from the new convention center in South Boston when it is
finished. The city put $170 million toward the convention center
after its supporters showed Menino how the city would get the money
back from tourism spending.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the Red Sox, their ticket sales passed 1.6 million
this week, which puts them 200,000 ahead of a year ago, an increase
of 14 percent. It is a major leap for a team that put 2.4 million
people into Fenway Park last year.
</P>
<P>
   Just to get it straight, here's what happened in the Dominican
Republic series between the Red Sox and Houston Astros last
weekend. Major League Baseball came to the teams and asked them to
play the two-game series because both of their lineups are stocked
with Dominican players. MLB paid the teams' expenses. That's all
they got. They didn't make any money. MLB cut the deals with the
Caribbean Winter League officials in the Dominican Republic to
promote the game and use whatever money they made to promote
baseball on the island. MLB and the Dominican baseball authority
set the ticket prices: $3.50 in the bleachers, $33 for the top box
seat. Supposedly, this is the same ticket price scale used for the
Caribbean World Series. So if there was any ticket scalping, it was
by the locals. They set the prices. They controlled the tickets.
Boston and Houston simply provided the entertainment.

   University of Massachusetts basketball coaches, who thought a
few weeks back they would be given another year, got the feeling
after losing to Siena Thursday night in the NIT that they might get
whacked over the weekend. UMass officials have been concerned about
the way interest in the men's varsity basketball team has dipped
and have to decide if keeping coach Bruiser Flint around another
year is going to turn the program around. Reportedly, the coaches
would like to know their fate immediately, because if they are
going to get fired some of them feel they can hook on with former
UMass coach John Calipari, who took over at Memphis last week.

   Supposedly, this is the reason Patriots coach Bill Belichick let
Terry Glenn off the hook for the fine levied on him last season by
former coach Pete Carroll: Chances were Glenn was going to win his
arbitration case and would have gotten the money back anyhow. We're
told the Management Counsel, the league's legal squad, advised the
Patriots they would most likely lose the upcoming appeal because
the team did not follow the proper procedure when Carroll suspended
Glenn and fined him a game check for not showing up to practice.
Reportedly, when Glenn showed this week for a head-to-head meeting
with Belichick, he was told the team would give up the case and
give him his money back _ but this was the last break he was
getting and that it was time to grow up and play football. It's not
that Belichick and the Patriots wanted to give him the money back
and let him think he got away with another one, but rather they
most likely weren't going to win anyhow, so why not make a deal
that could start Glenn and Belichick fresh.

   Coaching legend Bill Fitch feels the NBA's attempt to place a
microphone on coaches during games and to open the dressing room to
television cameras is a fool's errand. ``Coaches wearing mikes has
been optional for 20 years, so to demand it now and fine coaches
for not doing it is an insult. Coaches and players don't like
change. The locker room is the sanctuary for the players. This is
the one place they can go and have their own time. Coaches don't
want what they said taped. I can remember our (Celtics) playoff
series (NBA Final) with Houston in 1981. They asked me to be miked.
I said no. (Houston coach) Del Harris said OK. Even back in those
days, I was into taping games (off television), so I had someone
tape the game for me. The next day I was watching the tape, and I
heard Del telling Robert Reid to go into the corner as a ``decoy''
on this particular play. In that game, Mike Dunleavy killed us
scoring a bunch of points off the play they were talking about.
From hearing what Del said (in the privacy of a team huddle), I
told our guys the rest of the series not to worry about Reid on
that play. Don't even cover him. They never hurt us again with that
play, and we shut Dunleavy down after that. I'd like to see them
put a mike on (NBA commisioner) David Stern when he shows up two
hours late from dinner some night and see what his wife has to say
about it.'' Chris Ford, former Celtics coach, agrees with Fitch.
``Wearing a mike inhibits you as a coach, or having someone stick a
mike into the huddle does the same thing. There are things coaches
do in the heat of battle, they want to stay private between them
and the players. And I don't see what mikes on the bench or cameras
in the locker room add to a game.'' Fitch has retired and Ford was
fired by the Los Angeles Clippers this year. Snooping television
cameras and mikes led to K.C. Jones's being fired as the coach of
the Washington Bullets in 1976. Washington was involved in the
final game of a playoff series on national television. Close game,
handful of seconds left, Washington with the ball for one last
shot. As the camera is stuck into the Washington bench, assistant
coach Bernie Bickerstaff asks Jones if he wants him to ``draw up
the play.'' Jones says OK. The camera focuses on Bickerstaff
telling the players what to do. Jones just says a couple of words
before the team heads back on the floor. The play fails. The next
day, some in the Washington media called for Jones's head, saying
he didn't know how to coach, and Jones got fired. Red Auerbach
always maintained that the fallout from that bench episode was the
culprit. In reality, Jones told Bickerstaff what play to draw up,
which is done all the time in the NBA, and it was a play the team
had been using all year. But television gave the impression that he
didn't want to make the call under the pressure of a big game and
wasn't really coaching in that situation.

   Drew Bledsoe's thoughts on the Patriots' disappointing finish
after a sparkling 6-2 start: ``What makes what happened so hard to
swallow is how well (offensively) we played the first half of the
year. Everything felt so great. Even when we started to lose a
couple at the start of the second half of the season, I kept
thinking we were going to start winning and turn this thing around.
I thought we were going to get on another (winning) roll, and we
never did. What happened to me is a nightmare. I keep looking back
on some of the individual plays I made, or some of the games I
played, and think if only I had done better, it wouldn't have been
that way. What happened should have never happened. I should be too
smart by now to turn the ball over as many times as I did, or throw
three, four interceptions in a game. I tried to force things to
happen, and I shouldn't have. The second half of the season teams
(defensively) started to go in our face. They disrupted our timing.
This gave their pass rushers a better chance to get to me. They
challenged us, and we didn't deal with it.''

   When I first heard McDonald's was going to bring its annual high
school all-star game to the FleetCenter, I thought it was going to
bomb. But no so. To date, more than 13,000 tickets have been sold
for the March 29 event. The seats available will be limited to
16,900, which might make the remaining seats very valuable. The two
highest-priced tickets this winter among the local ticket brokers
(scalpers) were not Bruins or Celtics game, but rather the last big
wrestling show in the building (WWF's ``Smackdown'' taping) and the
Beanpot finals featuring BC and BU. Those tickets sold in the $150
range or about five times face value. Smart people tell me three
NBA first-rounders are scheduled to play in this game, if these
kids opt to go pro rather than go to college. They are Eddie
Griffin (Roman Catholic High, Philadelphia), Darius Miles (East St.
Louis, Ill.), and Gerald Wallace (Childersburg, Ala.).

   Flyers general manager Bobby Clarke phoned this week to say that
his offer for Ray Borque was legitimate. ``We offered Boston four
players and a fourth-round draft choice. We wanted Ray. Ray wanted
us. But Harry (Sinden) didn't want to deal with us or Detroit.'' To
which Sinden responded, ``Six teams were interested. When we got
all of the offers in, Philly was last behind Detroit. Colorado had
the best as far as we were concerned. I didn't care where Ray
played. I wanted what I felt was best for the Bruins and thought
the Colorado offer was the best.''

   Here are the three reasons the Celtics aren't better. First,
they don't have anyone to defend against a top center. Second,
their backcourt is terrible on defense. Third, as a team, they lack
speed. So if the Celtics meet a team that doesn't have a dominant
center, can't take advantage of their defensive weakness in the
backcourt, and isn't very athletic, they can win. Otherwise, let's
hope they miss the playoffs, get into the draft lottery, and get
lucky.

   Three weeks before he left for London to fight Shea Neary for
the world junior welterweight title last Saturday, Lowell's Micky
Ward said he found a way to win watching tapes of Neary's fights.
Ward said he could beat Neary with left hooks to the body, which
would eventually make him drop his elbow to protect against the
shots allowing Ward to come over the top with a left hook to the
head. And that's exactly what happened as Ward took the
previously-undefeated Neary out with two knockdowns in the eighth
round to win the title, and $100,000, for the first time.

WACO INVESTIGATORS PLAN EXERCISE SIMULATING DEADLY ENCOUNTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JIM YARDLEY and ROSS MILLOY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Early this Sunday, a select group of government
officials and private lawyers will meet at nearby Fort Hood, the
nation's largest military base. For several hours, maybe longer,
they will watch an extraordinary simulation intended to answer a
question that has raged from Internet chat rooms to the halls of
Congress:
</P>
<P>
   Did federal agents fire gunshots into the Branch Davidian
compound occupied by David Koresh and his followers shortly before
the largely-wooden facility burned to the ground on April 19, 1993,
claiming the lives of some 80 men, women and children?
</P>
<P>
   The exercise is intended to address one of the unresolved
mysteries of the Branch Davidian standoff, an episode widely
regarded as one of the most troubling in American law enforcement
history. On that final day, an infrared aerial surveillance video
by the FBI captured unexplained ``flashes'' near the compound just
before the fire erupted.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials have steadfastly denied that agents fired
any weapons, but lawyers representing survivors and descendants of
the Branch Davidians in a wrongful-death lawsuit claim that the
flashes indicated gunfire. The answer could be critical in
determining whether the government was truthful in its account of
how it carried out the siege.
</P>
<P>
   That such an exercise will occur is another reminder that the
furor over the incident remains one of the most vexing issues still
facing the Justice Department in the waning months of the Clinton
administration. Since the fall, former Sen. John C. Danforth,
R-Mo., has led a special investigation to re-examine the
government's role in the siege.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth's staff is overseeing Sunday's exercise, the first such
major simulation involving the government since investigators
re-enacted the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts question how far even Sunday's test will go in
answering the most troubling questions. Others are adamant about
its value.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are right, and if we prove there is gunfire, the
implications go far beyond the whole issue of just whether the
Davidians were killed or not,'' said Michael Caddell, the lead
lawyer for the Branch Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   The field test, which was ordered in December by Judge Walter S.
Smith of U.S. District Court, who is presiding over the civil
lawsuit, is a major logistical undertaking. An FBI airplane and a
British helicopter will be equipped with cameras similar to the
Forward Looking Infrared, or FLIR, device used by the FBI on April
19. On the ground, eight participants _ six postal inspectors and
two Army soldiers _ will fire weapons from prone, kneeling and
standing positions. Tanks and armored vehicles will rumble over a
field of debris intended to replicate the Branch Davidian compound.
There will be a rehearsal of the exercise Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Once completed, the new footage will be compared to the FLIR
video account of the fire. Caddell believes that the staged gunfire
will produce flashes similar to those recorded on the original
video and confirm his contention that agents fired into the
compound. Caddell said he plans to release copies of the video as
soon as Monday so that the public can draw its own conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   The exercise will be conducted in secrecy. Smith denied access
to news organizations, including The New York Times, that had
sought it.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that people are going to make up their own
minds on this,'' Caddell said. ``Do you have to have an expert tell
you the difference between the sun and the moon?''
</P>
<P>
   But Mike Bradford, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of
Texas and one of the lead government lawyers in the case, said he
was concerned that the experiment could simply create more
confusion. Bradford said government lawyers initially opposed the
test because they regarded it as a misguided and inauthentic
attempt to re-enact the final day of the standoff. But, he said,
the protocol for Sunday is not a re-enactment and he hopes the test
will dispel the speculation that has surrounded the role of FBI
agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``These flashes do appear on the tape that seem to have created
some doubts,'' Bradford said. ``We are hopeful that maybe this test
will make it clear that what you see on the tape of the 19th could
not be agents moving and shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The standoff began on Feb. 28, 1993, after a gun battle at the
compound near Waco left four federal agents and six Branch
Davidians dead. The agents had gone to the compound to serve an
arrest warrant on Koresh on weapons charges. For 51 days
thereafter, a standoff ensued until the morning of April 19, when
government tanks poked holes in the building and began spreading
tear gas. Within a short time, the building erupted in flames.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials describe Koresh as a madman who ordered his
followers to set the compound on fire as part of a suicide pact.
</P>
<P>
   But the role played by federal agents has continued to draw
scrutiny. In September, Attorney General Janet Reno appointed
Danforth as a special counsel to re-examine the April 19 FBI raid
after disclosures that FBI agents might have fired flammable
tear-gas canisters at a concrete bunker near the Davidian building.
The FBI had previously maintained that it had not fired any device
that day capable of starting a fire.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Since the fall, Danforth's 68-person staff has sifted through
piles of evidence and examined weapons and bullet casings used by
federal agents during the standoff and fire. In January, Danforth
moved to perform toxicology test on the tissue and bones of the
Davidians who died to determine if they were affected by the tear
gas pumped into the compound. Danforth, who promised on the day of
his appointment to answer ``the dark questions,'' has not commented
since.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has maintained a code of silence throughout the
investigation,'' said Jan Diltz, a spokeswoman for Danforth's
office. ``He is going to tell the American people at the conclusion
what the facts are, and we'll just go with that.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At Smith's request, Danforth's staff has organized Sunday's
field test, which will be conducted by a British company. In
October, Caddell filed a motion seeking the test. His lawsuit
contends that federal agents fired gunshots from behind the
compound. As a result Caddell contends, people were trapped inside
when the fire erupted. Government lawyers have fiercely denied such
an explanation, pointing out that there is no concrete evidence
that any agents fired that day. This month Caddell dropped his
action against one well-known government sniper, Lon Horiuchi,
because ballistics tests failed to show he had fired his weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Government lawyers initially tried to prevent the Sunday field
test by telling the court that the FLIR camera used on April 19 no
longer existed, a position they retracted after Danforth's staff
located the device in England. When it became clear that both
Danforth and Judge Smith favored the test, the government reversed
course and agreed to participate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows the court takes the case very seriously and is
looking for every opportunity to let the parties get to the
truth,'' said Bill Johnston, a former assistant United States
attorney, who was intimately involved in the Branch Davidian case
before he resigned earlier this year to enter private practice.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Coulson, the deputy assistant director of the FBI at the
time of the standoff, acknowledged that the field test could
further inflame speculation by conspiracy theorists and others
critical of the government. Coulson himself disputes allegations
that FBI agents fired weapons. But he said the test was essential
if the FBI wanted to finally expunge any public doubts about the
agency's role.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there were people out there shooting, we need to know
that,'' said Coulson, who has retired from the FBI and now works as
an author and security consultant. ``In order for the FBI to have
any credibility with certain segments of society, we need to
resolve it. If the FBI doesn't have any credibility, its ability to
function is greatly diminished.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``It's crazy, but if we can put this to rest, I think
that is good for the country.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, experts for Caddell and the government have
offered conflicting opinions on whether the flashes on the original
tape could have been gunfire. FBI officials have suggested that the
flashes came from reflections of standing water or other debris
around the compound. Caddell hired two experts, who determined that
the flashes were gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   The civil trial in the wrongful-death suit is scheduled to begin
May 15, and this week Caddell filed a motion claiming that the
government has ``lost, altered or tampered with'' key evidence in
the case. Government lawyers have not yet responded to the motion.

 &HT;    Southern drought could fan wildfires
 &HT;    By John Harmon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The U.S. Forest Service predicts the upcoming spring
could be one of the worst fire seasons on record in the South.
</P>
<P>
   Conditions in Florida are worse than in the summer of 1998, when
wildfires devastated 500,000 acres and destroyed or damaged 300
homes, forestry officials warned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drought conditions in the South are forecast to continue for a
third straight year,'' said Elizabeth Estill, a Southern regional
forester in Atlanta, on Friday. ``Already a higher number of fire
crews than normal have been dispatched to respond to fires
throughout the 13-state Southern region.''
</P>
<P>
   The Southern region stretches from Texas to Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got drought conditions in South Georgia that are as bad
as Florida,'' said Ron Coats, director of the Southern region's
fire and aviation unit. Since the beginning of March, 6,981 fires
have burned 129,935 acres in Southern states, Coats noted.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, smoke from wildfires temporarily closed Interstate 75
near Valdosta, Ga. The odd thing about the Valdosta fire is that it
was burning in a swamp, a sign of trouble ahead, said Alan Dozier,
chief of fire protection for the Georgia Forestry Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are swamps in South Georgia that are just dry,'' he
said. ``These places are usually wet and won't burn. We usually use
the swamps as fire breaks. But that strategy isn't working this
year and it's burning bigger areas.''
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina last week, crews fought 50 fires in six
Southeastern counties, and crews remained dispersed in the region
waiting for more. In Harnett County, fires threatened homes and
destroyed 1,000 acres of woodlands. At least 30 small fires have
broken out in the state's four national forests since the beginning
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Already this year Georgia has seen 31,366 acres burned. Usually,
9,000 acres burn during January through March. Firefighters this
year have battled a 7,800-acre blaze in Charlton County and other
large fires.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not supposed to have fires that big in Georgia,'' Dozier
said. The worst conditions are in southeast Georgia, he said, while
the northern part of the state is less critical because of recent
rains.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for the fires, the Forest Service has brought in
additional staff, equipment and aircraft, Coats said. The region
may need to increase fire crews and equipment by more than 50
percent, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Division of Forestry has beefed up its fire-attack
capabilities with the formation of three wildfire management teams,
said Larry Woods, chief of fire protection. The six-person teams
are available at a moment's notice to assist a district fire crew
battling a blaze.
</P>
<P>
   The crews are still in training and will not be available for
the full season, he said. Also, Florida is reconditioning three of
its helicopters and has purchased two surplus military Cobra
choppers.
</P>
<P>
   The spring fire season normally runs from mid-February to
mid-May.
</P>
<P>
   But drought conditions last year kept firefighters busy
throughout the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depending on where you are in Florida we're 15 to 20 inches
below normal in rainfall,'' said Woods. ``It's worse than 1998.''
</P>
<P>
   Coats urged people to take care with outdoor burning, noting
that 65 percent of Southern wildfires are caused by humans.

SMITH &AMP; WESSON TO INSTALL CHILD-SAFETY LOCKS ON GUNS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gunmaking giant Smith &AMP; Wesson said Friday that it
will put child-safety locks on its handguns as part of a landmark
agreement to stave off potential federal and local lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   No other gun maker joined the accord, which Smith &AMP; Wesson
reached under the threat of litigation and much to the dismay of
industry colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, speaking from the Oval Office, praised the
agreement as ``a major victory for America's families'' in the
fight against gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   Under the accord, which ends threatened lawsuits from federal,
state and local governments, Smith &AMP; Wesson said it will put
external, unremovable trigger locks on new handguns within 60 days
and install internal locking devices on new firearms within two
years.
</P>
<P>
   The company, the largest U.S. firearms manufacturer, also
pledged to restrict sales at gun shows, a main provision of
Clinton's proposed firearm-control legislation that congressional
Republicans and the National Rifle Association have scorned.
</P>
<P>
   In lauding Smith &AMP; Wesson's ``socially responsible'' act, a
leading spokesman for House Republicans said the accord
demonstrates that federal laws are unnecessary to encourage gun
manufacturers to make their products safer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though we hail Smith &AMP; Wesson for taking a pro-active approach
to the problem of violence in our country, this step does not mean
gun crimes will go away,'' said Rep. J.C. Watts Jr., R-Okla. and
chairman of the House Republican Conference. ``We must re-double
our efforts to enforce existing laws and prosecute all violent
criminals. In addition when it comes to kids and guns, our nation
must take a closer look at why kids are killing kids and ask why
our culture is adrift.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration reached the accord with Smith &AMP; Wesson amid
stepped up attacks on Clinton from the NRA, which has assailed the
president for endorsing restrictive anti-gun laws while failing to
enforce existing statutes prohibiting illegal firearms possession.
</P>
<P>
   NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre this week accused
Clinton of being willing to ``accept a certain level of killing to
further his political agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made no direct reference to the NRA in praising what he
called Smith &AMP; Wesson's bravery and urging other gun makers to
reach similar agreements with the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are responsible citizens in the gun industry,'' Clinton
said. ``The effort to reduce gun violence ... is not about
politics. It is about saving lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The NRA declined to comment on the Smith &AMP; Wesson agreement,
referring callers to the National Shooting Sports Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation, which represents gun manufacturers, assailed
Smith &AMP; Wesson for breaking ranks and reaching an ``ill-conceived''
settlement with the government. Group president Robert Delfay said
industry leaders have been discussing among themselves ways to make
their firearms safer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smith &AMP; Wesson has taken a list of suggestions and initiatives
that have been discussed in confidential industry talks and run off
and cut their own deal with the Clinton administration and a list
of anti-gun government officials,'' Delfay added. ``We are
confident that no other major manufacturers will desert this
coordinated effort in favor of their own deal.''
</P>
<P>
   But Smith &AMP; Wesson President Ed Shultz defended his company's
decision to reach the out-of-court settlement as a smart business
move. Speaking via telephone at a news conference with federal
officials, Shultz said the settlement saves the company the
potentially exorbitant costs of litigation and allows it to focus
on making its guns ``better and safer for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Gun violence kills more than 30,000 people annually in the
United States and injures another 100,000, the federal government
reported. About 13 children are killed each day by guns, a rate 12
times higher than the other 25 industrialized countries combined,
the government added.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement followed a series of recent school and workplace
shootings, including one that left a 6-year-old Michigan
first-grader dead, allegedly at the hands of a fellow pupil. Three
men are under indictment in the Feb. 29 shooting of Kayla Rolland,
including the uncle of the 6-year-old boy who police say killed the
girl in a Buell Elementary School classroom near Flint.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and the Democratic minority in Congress have been
pressing federal lawmakers to pass legislation requiring trigger
locks and background checks at gun shows. The Democrats have set a
goal for passing the measure by April 20, the first anniversary of
the day Columbine High School students Dylan Klebold and Eric
Harris shot and killed 12 schoolmates and a teacher before fatally
shooting themselves in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican majority, however, has been resisting the
Democrats' effort, saying current gun-control laws are sufficient
but need to be more effectively enforced.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Smith &AMP; Wesson agreed to limit unregulated
sales of firearms at gun shows by requiring sellers of company
weapons to be authorized Smith &AMP; Wesson gun dealers. Also, no Smith
&AMP; Wesson firearm may be sold at a gun show until the would-be
purchaser passes a federally mandated background check.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, gun shows are exempt from the federal
mandate.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to prevent gun buyers from stockpiling weapons, the
agreement also prevents purchasers of Smith &AMP; Wesson guns from
taking home more than one weapon at the time of purchase. The buyer
will have to wait two weeks before picking up any additional guns.
</P>
<P>
   The company also will have to enter digital images on bullet
casings to make it easier for law enforcement to trace bullets
fired during crimes. Smith &AMP; Wesson dealers also must have store
security plans, and weapons and bullets must be kept locked and
separated.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Smith &AMP; Wesson gun store employees must complete
annual safety training and pass an exam.
</P>
<P>
   The accord also calls for Smith &AMP; Wesson to place a ``hidden''
second serial number on its guns to thwart criminals who erase
visible serial numbers in an effort to prevent the weapons from
being traced.
</P>
<P>
   The company also agreed to fund a public service campaign to
inform people about the risk of guns in the house and proper home
storage.
</P>
<P>
   A special five-member commission will oversee the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, who oversees the bureau,
praised the accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result of this breakthrough agreement, fewer parents will
have to bury their children,'' Summers said.

   In walking this fine line, Gore faces a big test over the
Clinton administration's trade agreement with China because other
administration officials and Gore's business allies are pressuring
him to lobby for it, even as unions mount a feverish campaign to
defeat it.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is also aware that there is broad support for the trade
agreement among farmers and people in high-technology industries,
as well as among political independents, whose votes could be
critical in November.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Gore has done little to promote the trade pact,
prompting complaints from some business leaders that he is too
close to labor. Aides to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the
presumptive Republican nominee, are also attacking Gore, saying he
is beholden to labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton, to his credit, is leading a bipartisan
fight on free trade, and especially on bringing China into the
World Trade Organization,'' said Ari Fleischer, spokesman for the
Bush campaign. ``But Al Gore has shown no leadership whatsoever in
helping the Republicans and the president advance the cause of free
trade.''
</P>
<P>
   After unions provided many of the ground troops that Gore needed
to win in the primaries, the vice president now confronts a
challenge similar to that faced by other recent Democratic
nominees: While being somewhat indebted to labor, they also had to
rebuff Republican charges during the general election that they
were controlled by the nation's union leaders.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1984 campaign, Vice President Walter Mondale, the
Democratic nominee, was hurt badly by President Reagan's criticisms
that he was toadying to labor.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's advisers insist that he is not beholden to organized
labor, though they note that he shares many of labor's views on
issues ranging from protecting Social Security to improving
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion that he is in their pocket is absurd,'' said Elaine
Kamarck, a senior Gore adviser. ``On the biggest issue of the day
for labor, he doesn't agree with them, and, of course, that is
trade. To try to make the Mondale accusation about Al Gore is just
ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Many union leaders acknowledge that they have clear expectations
from Gore if he is elected president, though Gore's aides and labor
leaders insist that he did not make any promises in exchange for
the AFL-CIO's endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders say that they expect that Gore will, if elected,
pursue many policies supported by labor, like opposing school
vouchers and opposing the privatization of Social Security. But the
Gore camp said that Gore backed those policies not because of
labor's support, but because he believed in them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had a regular dialogue with the vice president on a
wide range of issues, on issues that are our priorities,'' said
John J. Sweeney, president of the federation. ``That's a major
reason why we endorsed him.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Gore has walked a tightrope, trying to please
his labor allies without upsetting other supporters. At last
month's AFL-CIO executive council meeting in New Orleans, in an
evident effort to solidify labor support, he said that he would
negotiate strong labor protections in future trade accords.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement normalizing trade relations with China _ a deal
that paves the way for China to join the World Trade Organization _
contains no such protections, and Republican and business leaders
quickly condemned Gore's remarks, saying that they undermined
support for the agreement. Gore then tried to placate his business
allies, sending a letter to the National Association of
Manufacturers reaffirming his support for the trade deal.
</P>
<P>
   Another example came this week when he said in newspaper
interviews that he would speak out on behalf of the China deal. Yet
on Wednesday he did not say a word about the pact when he addressed
2,000 union members and leaders in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's aides said they recognize that if he lobbies aggressively
for the China deal, he risks alienating union members and reducing
his chances of securing endorsements from two powerful unions that
have so far remained neutral: the Teamsters and the United Auto
Workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he lobbies a lot on this, that will of course make it
difficult to do an endorsement while the debate is going on,'' said
Mike Mathis, the Teamsters' political director. ``Another problem
is if we get our members fired up on this issue, they're not going
to forget it in November.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The New York Times last week, Gore
acknowledged that some unions had not endorsed him ``because of the
fact that I'm in favor of this legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he added, ``Others have endorsed me in spite of our
disagreement on this legislation because I agree with them on 90
percent of the issues. And George Bush disagrees with them on 100
percent of the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO endorsement in October gave Gore an important lift
at a time when Bill Bradley's campaign was picking up momentum. The
Bradley camp acknowledges that union foot soldiers played a key
role in Gore's victory over Bradley in the Iowa caucuses. In New
Hampshire, where Bradley hoped a victory would give him huge
momentum, exit polls showed that labor also contributed
significantly to Gore's triumph.
</P>
<P>
   ``Labor has been incredibly helpful to the vice president,''
said Al From, president of the Democratic Leadership Council. ``He
obviously has to keep their concerns in mind. He also has to show
he's not just running for president of labor, but running for
president of the country.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When Gore gained the AFL-CIO endorsement, he promised union
leaders who had assembled in Los Angeles that if he became
president, he, like Clinton, would veto any anti-labor legislation,
like proposals that would weaken overtime laws. Gore had made that
promise many times before to union leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Rivera, president of 1199, the National Health and Human
Service Employees Union, said, ``In terms of support for Al Gore,
the labor movement played a very dramatic role. I think that Al
Gore owes the labor movement, once he's elected president of the
United States, to maintain the same friendship and relations that
he has had for years with the labor movement and to help us on some
of the key issues we have, like the right to organize.''
</P>
<P>
   As evidence of Gore's deference to labor, Fleischer, the Bush
spokesman, cited the vice president's opposition to school
vouchers, to reforming teacher tenure and to merit pay for teachers
_ all issues on which he sides with teachers union leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember, the teachers union is the biggest soft-money
contributor to the Democratic National Committee,'' Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Greenstein, a Princeton political scientist, said that
Bush's embrace of many conservative policies opposed by labor would
cause unions to campaign enthusiastically for Gore, despite his
support of the China trade deal _ a deal Bush also supports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Bush is making it easy for Gore,'' Greenstein said.
``It seems to me that labor and the other core groups in the
Democratic party will be strongly motivated to rally around Gore,
so I don't think he's going to have to do a lot of groveling or
toadying.''

CLINTON TRIP TO ASIA IS AIMED AT LESSENING TENSION 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also INDIA-CLINTON) 
(lb) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When President Clinton first contemplated visiting
India three years ago, he was eager to open a relationship with the
vastly populated, democratic country that had remained outside the
Western fold during the Cold War. He was also gripped with the
ambition, his aides said, to display the fabric of modern India to
the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   But the fall of two Indian governments and the nuclear tests of
May 1998 conspired against Clinton's timetable.
</P>
<P>
   Now the president is embarking on a five-day, five-city journey
to India and a five-hour stop in Pakistan at a time when tensions
on the subcontinent are high. A confrontation between the two
countries over Kashmir, where their fighters clash on 15,000-foot
mountain tops, is seen as the most likely dispute on earth to spark
a nuclear clash.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the president hopes that with this trip he can somehow
defuse the situation in Kashmir. But he and his aides are
pessimistic about the chances for actual progress.
</P>
<P>
   With this trip, Clinton will also become the first U.S.
president to visit Bangladesh, when he makes a day trip to the
democratic Muslim country that is striving to emerge from deep
poverty.
</P>
<P>
   It may be an overwhelming task for Clinton to balance his desire
to support the India of trade and technology and at the same time
deal with the treacherous rivalry between India and Pakistan and
their nuclear weapons programs. Complicating the situation
considerably is the coming to power of a military government in
Pakistan last October, whose hold on power Clinton is eager not to
endorse but with whom he wants to talk.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is making India the 62nd foreign country he has visited,
a position down the list that some Indians have noted unhappily,
and he arrives almost as a lame-duck president, with little
opportunity to capitalize afterward on diplomatic gains.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, some of his aides, as well as experts on the
subcontinent, fear that the original intention of displaying India
as the economic and strategic power of the region will be
undermined by the increasingly strong-willed attitudes of the
Indian government toward nuclear weapons, Pakistan and Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will face an Indian government whose nuclear doctrine
calls for the development of a ``large strategic Indian capability
sometime in the future,'' said Stephen Cohen of the Brookings
Institution, who was one of a group of experts on South Asia who
met with the president at the White House on Thursday evening to
help him prepare for the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen added that there were prominent voices in New Delhi
calling for further tests, on the grounds that India did not
produce a thermonuclear explosion in May 1998. The government of
Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee was prepared, he said, to pay
the price of Washington's sanctions in order to keep its nuclear
arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   After India's nuclear tests, which were followed by tests by
Pakistan, the Clinton administration initiated a round of talks
aimed at persuading India to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty. Led by Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, the talks
extended to 12 rounds with the Indian foreign minister, Jaswant
Singh, but so far to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech previewing Clinton's trip, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright cautioned that the lack of progress at a time
when Russia and the United States were moving toward deeper cuts in
their arsenals was a major stumbling block for a fuller
relationship with Washington than India might otherwise enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must accept that significant progress in this area is
necessary, before India and the United States can realize fully the
vast potential of our relationship,'' Albright told the Asia
Society here on Tuesday. ``We have not yet found a way to create
sufficient common ground on these issues.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At a discussion at the Carnegie Endowment for International
Peace this week, Gary Samore, a member of the National Security
Council staff who specializes in nonproliferation, said that in his
15 years working on India and Pakistan, ``I don't think the
situation has ever looked any worse.''
</P>
<P>
   The prospects were bleak, Samore said, because neither India nor
Pakistan really understood the instability provoked by the
strategic threat of their nuclear weapons and ``to make matters
worse, both sides are spoiling for a fight'' in Kashmir. Another
conflict over the territory _ Pakistan and India have already
fought three wars there _ carries the ``potential spark for a
nuclear confrontation,'' Samore said.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton met with the group of experts from the region at
the White House on Thursday evening, he seemed intensely interested
in how he could defuse the situation but also worried about the
limited prospects for success, several participants said. The group
included two former ambassadors, Frank Wisner and Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, now the senior Democratic senator from New York.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from overcoming the enormous enmity between the two
countries, Clinton must face the fact that India has insisted that
it will not accept mediation.
</P>
<P>
   And although Pakistan has said it will accept mediation,
Clinton's clout in influencing the behavior of the new military
leader, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, appears limited, his aides say.
</P>
<P>
   In a briefing on Thursday to reporters who will accompany
Clinton, his national security adviser, Sandy Berger, said: ``The
president is not going to South Asia to mediate the dispute between
them. But he will urge them to exercise restraint and resume
dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   One fundamental request that Clinton is likely to put to
Musharraf is for a halt to the Pakistani incursions over the line
of control, the cease-fire line in Kashmir that divides the
territory.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian leadership has said there can be no discussion over
Kashmir until ``concrete steps'' are taken by the Pakistanis to
withdraw. Last July, Clinton successfully persuaded the last
civilian leader of Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif, to take such steps. But
three months later Sharif was overthrown by the general. Given this
history, administration officials said they were skeptical that
Musharraf would do what Sharif had promised.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Albright said in her speech that as a start
Pakistan must pledge to make no further incursions into the
Indian-held part of Kashmir. ``Nations must not attempt to change
borders or zones of occupation through armed force,'' she said.
``Tangible steps must be taken to respect'' the so-called military
line of control that separates the territory.

THE SUN ALSO RISES

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   King Zoser built bigger pyramids. King Tutankhamen draws larger
crowds, and even got a hit '70s pop song by Steve Martin in his
honor.
</P>
<P>
   But when historians and archeologists are asked to consider
which pharaoh made the greatest cultural impact on ancient Egypt,
they often point to a pot-bellied, strangely androgynous-looking
man who revolutionized art and religion some 3,500 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He was Akhenaten, a stylistic and spiritual radical who assumed
Egypt's throne at the height of its imperial power, and during the
course of his 17-year reign flipped a thousand years' worth of
tradition on its head. Before Akhenaten ancient Egypt barely ever
seemed to change at all. After him it was never quite the same.
</P>
<P>
   This startling shift takes centerstage in ``Pharaohs of the Sun:
Akhenaten, Nerfertiti, Tutankhamen,'' the Egyptology exhibition
opening today at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Organized by
the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, ``Pharaohs of the Sun'' utilizes
more than 250 objects, some never seen outside of Cairo before, to
evoke one of the most dramatic periods of transformation in the
whole history of Western art.
</P>
<P>
   Before Akhenaten's rule (1353-1336 B.C.), Egyptian art, like
Egyptian society in general, was conservative and tradition-bound
to the point of being static. Life revolved around the concept of
Ma-at, a continuum of truth and balance, personified as a female
deity.
</P>
<P>
   The pharaohs, claiming godlike authority over their subjects,
directed an orderly world closely tied to the seasonal bounty of
the Nile River. Egypt's many gods were assigned to elaborate
hierarchies that included national gods Atum, Ra and Osiris, as
well as local and personal gods that governed such rites of passage
as childbirth and harvest.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a cycle of life that they tried very hard to
preserve,'' says Nancy Thomas, LACMA deputy director of curatorial
affairs and curator of Ancient and Islamic Art.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, art reinforced and reflected the rigid codes
that governed virtually every aspect of life. For centuries, the
pharaohs were depicted in sculpture and carvings in the same
venerable poses, their muscular physiques as geometric and
idealized as those of a Marvel Comics hero.
</P>
<P>
   But when Akhenaten came to power as Amenhotep IV, succeeding his
father Amenhotep III, a new art took hold of the ancient kingdom.
Amenhotep IV instructed his court craftsmen to render him as a
softer, feminized figure, with a slender torso, elongated head,
swollen hips and a protruding stomach. The effect was so pronounced
that art historians are still debating whether one colossal statue
of Amenhotep IV/Akhenaten actually represents his elegant queen,
Nefertiti.
</P>
<P>
   Generations of scholars have pondered whether this new pharaonic
image had its basis in propaganda, a genetic mutation such as
Marfan syndrome, or simple heredity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there was some basis in the family physiognomy and
that (Amenhotep IV) may have had a long face and slightly elongated
skull, and that he chose to accentuate those features for dramatic
effect,'' says Thomas. ``I think what he was trying to do was
capture the attention and the imagination of the people at that
time that there was a change (occurring).''
</P>
<P>
   As his reign progressed, Amenhotep IV's religious beliefs shook
up the ancient status quo even more profoundly than his artistic
preferences. Bucking the powerful priesthood class, the pharaoh
began to ignore Egypt's vast pantheon of anthropomorphic dieties
and devote himself entirely to Aten, the sun god.
</P>
<P>
   Proclaiming himself to be Aten's only son and intermediary on
earth, he raised giant temples to Aten in the Karnak precinct of
Thebes, the kingdom's religious capital, while neglecting and even
desecrating temples devoted to the popular national god Amen. He
also changed his name from Amenhotep to Akhenaten, meaning ``He who
is effective for Aten.''
</P>
<P>
   As the ideological rupture between the pharaoh and the Amen
priesthood widened, Akhenaten resolved to establish a new religious
capital in a remote, previously unsettled territory midway between
Memphis and Thebes along a wide bay of cliffs, near the present-day
Arab village of Armana, or Tell el-Amarna. With a population
believed to have peaked at 20,000 to 50,000, the new city of
Akhenaten (``Horizon of Aten'') was a dynamic, brilliantly colored
environment with lush formal gardens, spectacular palaces and a
thriving community of artisans. Its temples were open to the sky,
permitting free entry to the divine sun.
</P>
<P>
   Akhenaten also made himself open and visible, making daily
forays through the city to greet his subjects and assert his
authority. While Akhenaten worshipped Aten directly, his people
were compelled to worship Akhenaten.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called Amarna style was characterized by what LACMA's
Thomas terms a general ``turning inward'' of Egyptian society,
dictated by the pharaoh's personal example. Whereas his royal
predecessors were preoccupied with maintaining Egypt's sprawling
empire, stretching from the Sudan to northern Syria, Akhenaten
turned his attention to the domestic sphere.
</P>
<P>
   Many works in the exhibition indicate this new emphasis on daily
life and nature. Among the most significant is a limestone stela,
or relief carving, of Akhenaten and Nefertiti kissing and playing
affectionately with their three children _ an image unimaginable
under previous pharaohs. Under Akhenaten, Egyptian art attained a
new sensuality and ecstatic quality. It is visible in such
exhibition artifacts as a mustard-colored jasper fragment of a
woman's face, its gouged surface somehow enhancing the delicate
beauty of the curved lips and chin.
</P>
<P>
   After Akhenaten's death, a period of turmoil may have followed
until the boy king Tutankhaten (later Tutankhamen) seized the
throne at age 10, probably with the help of the Amen priests. The
old gods were restored and the royal court was moved back to
Memphis and Thebes. Amarna was destroyed and its precious contents
buried and scattered.
</P>
<P>
   But Akhenaten's influence was not so easily dispelled. It
endured thereafter in a certain sculptural fleshiness, a
willingness to depict human beings in their less-than-godlike
humanity that later captivated the Greeks and Romans.
</P>
<P>
   And it persists in the sensual faces on view at LACMA, staring
back across a gulf of three millennia. &QL;

 AETNA PLANS A RECOVERY; HMOs MAY NOT MAKE IT

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe they should call it unmanageable care.
</P>
<P>
   In just four frenetic years, the respected if somewhat stodgy
insurance company once affectionately nicknamed Mother Aetna
transformed itself into a colossal force in a much-criticized
business, health plans. At the end of the rainbow there was
supposed to be a gold mine of profits wrung from managing away the
inefficiencies and excesses of modern medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Aetna found itself the biggest target in an industry
under siege. Its woes raise questions about whether the traditional
HMO approach to paying for health care has a viable future.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, under intense pressure from investors who had sent
the company's stock spinning downward and brought on the
resignation of its chief executive, Richard L. Huber, the company
adopted a new candor about its shortcomings and the powerful
backlash against its specialty, tightly controlled managed care.
</P>
<P>
   Rejecting a takeover bid by WellPoint Health Networks of
California and ING Group, a Dutch financial services company,
Aetna's new chief executive, William H. Donaldson, pointed to
growing demand by customers and patients for ``choice and
empowerment.''
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson, an Aetna board member who spent most of his career on
Wall Street, vowed to improve relations with physicians and
hospitals and ``do a better job of meeting the expectations of
customers and patients.'' To that end, Aetna said it would split
itself into two separate companies, one for managed health care and
one for financial services.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said Aetna's troubles portended the demise of
stringently controlled health maintenance organizations of the type
that Huber bought from U.S. Healthcare in 1996 to begin Aetna's
transformation.
</P>
<P>
   ``HMOs are in a very precarious position,'' said Larry Feinberg,
a partner at Oracle Partners, a New York-based health care hedge
fund. ``The model we all love to hate will become extinct in the
next five years.''
</P>
<P>
   Managed care companies like Aetna have come under heavy attack
in Congress, the states and the courts. Aetna alone is fending off
at least nine class-action challenges to such fundamentals of
managed care as the use of financial incentives for doctors who
keep costs down.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs have also found their efforts to contain costs outfoxed by
drug companies, whose direct-to-consumer advertising stokes demand
for expensive prescription drugs, driving up the health plans' drug
costs. And patients are empowering themselves by clicking on an
estimated 100,000 health care Web sites (who's counting?) offering
everything from solid science to nostrums, and then bombarding
doctors with questions that can stretch office visits and spur more
tests and prescriptions. For these and other reasons, health care
inflation is returning to double-digit territory after several
years of restraint.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, enrollees have been voting with their feet for less
restrictive types of managed care, which are now growing faster
than HMOs. Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New York said
enrollment in its more flexible preferred provider plans rose 16
percent, to 2.6 million in the year ending last January, while
membership in its HMOs fell 10 percent, to 230,000.
</P>
<P>
   The crucial distinction between the two types of plans involves
patient freedom. In a traditional HMO, tests, treatments and access
to specialists are not covered unless authorized by a designated
primary-care physician, a plan administrator or, in many cases,
both. Preferred provider networks have none of those restrictions,
and offer more freedom to choose out-of-network providers for
patients willing to shoulder more of the cost themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts predict a comeback for HMOs if the economy cools
down and taming of the health cost spiral becomes a priority again,
because HMOs are cheaper than other types of plans.
</P>
<P>
   According to Kenneth S. Abramowitz, an analyst at Sanford C.
Bernstein, the annual cost of coverage for a typical family in an
HMO is $7,000; in a network of preferred physicians and hospitals,
$9,000; and in traditional unmanaged health insurance, known as
indemnity plans, $12,000. Those differences are usually mirrored in
the amounts workers contribute from their paychecks toward the cost
of coverage.
</P>
<P>
   But while the economy is strong and labor markets remain tight,
large employers, which still pick up most of the tab for their
employees' care, try to please their staffs by offering a range of
health plans of all types. ``In boom times, an engineer won't put
up with managed care restrictions,'' said Uwe E. Reinhardt, a
health care economist at Princeton, though easily replaceable
workers often have no choice, and young, healthy workers who are
low on the pay scale still sign up for HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Liz Rossman, vice president for benefits at Sears, Roebuck, said
87 percent of Sears employees remained in HMOs even after the
company added a preferred provider network that offered direct
access to more doctors. One discouraging feature of the network
plan for low-income workers is a deductible for hospitalization or
surgery of $300 for single employees and $900 for families.
</P>
<P>
   Employers and health plans are emphasizing choice. Honeywell
offers workers a menu of different health plans, plus access to an
Internet database describing the credentials and health plan
affiliations for nearly every doctor in the country, said Brian
Marcotte, vice president for benefits at the company.
</P>
<P>
   After buying U.S. Healthcare and the health plans run by New
York Life and Prudential Insurance, Aetna became the nation's
largest health insurer, covering 22 million people. This includes
7.8 million in commercial HMOs, 6.2 million in point of service
plans _ essentially, HMOs that also offer access to out-of-network
doctors _ and 4 million in preferred provider networks.
</P>
<P>
   There are also 700,000 members in its Medicare HMOs and several
million in the dwindling group that still takes part in unmanaged
indemnity or fee-for-service plans.
</P>
<P>
   Like its national competitors, Cigna Corp. and UnitedHealth
Group, Aetna can meet the widespread demand for choices. But when
it bought U.S. Healthcare for a high price of $2,500 a member, it
acquired a hard-driving culture that transformed many doctors into
adversaries in lawsuits and in lobbying battles in state
legislatures and in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors were especially incensed by a take-it-or-leave-it rule
that required them to treat low-paying Aetna HMO members or give up
Aetna members in the more lucrative preferred provider networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many of America's patients and physicians are already at
the mercy of powerful health insurance giants who offer only
`take-it-or-leave-it' contract provisions,'' said Dr. Thomas R.
Reardon, president of the American Medical Association, in a
statement after the WellPoint offer was announced early this month.
He said the association was concerned that merging insurance
companies would have ``too much leverage in their dealings with
patients and physicians.''
</P>
<P>
   Without naming the medical association, Aetna's Donaldson told
Wall Street analysts last week that the critical ``reactions of
many groups around the world'' were on Aetna's list of reasons for
rejecting WellPoint _ along with antitrust and market share
problems, WellPoint's smaller size, and the ``tentative nature'' of
the offer, which was conditioned on giving WellPoint a chance to
delve into Aetna's books.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for Aetna, if it is to regain the confidence of
investors and secure an independent future, is to discover a way to
hold down costs and run its health plans economically without
incurring so much wrath from doctors and patients alike _ if such a
way exists.

<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Burlington Northern Santa Fe and Canadian
National Railways must wait 15 months before they can apply to
merge, federal regulators said on Friday in a decision that
jeapardizes the linkup of the two major rail systems.
</P>
<P>
   The Surface Transportation Board's announcement came after
competitors, shippers, and elected officials lined up to oppose the
$6 billion combination, which would create a system extending from
the Atlantic Ocean in Canada to the U.S. and Canadian west coasts.
</P>
<P>
   When the railroads file their application, the U.S. Surface
Transportation Board said, the agency might end up raising the bar
for approval of big rail mergers.
</P>
<P>
   The news is of particular interest in North Texas. Burlington
Northern's headquarters and network operations hub are in Fort
Worth, where the company employs 2,500 workers. Union Pacific,
based in Omaha, also has major rail operations in the area and had
opposed the merger. Many major commercial shippers, who suffered
after recent rail mergers resulted in snarled traffic nationwide,
also are wary of more big combinations.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's announcement prompted an angry response from BNSF
Chairman Robert Krebs, who said his company will consider suing to
get the regulatory board to act on the proposed merger, which the
companies announced in mid-December.
</P>
<P>
   ``BNSF will thoroughly review today's decision to determine what
appropriate legal action we can take,'' Krebs said. He described
the moratorium as ``unheard of,'' in the railroad industry.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, however, responded favorably to the news.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market, which had reacted negatively to the merger
announcement, looked favorably on the latest news. The decision was
announced an hour before the New York Stock Exchange closed, and
BNSF shares traded late in the day at $22.32, up $1.32 per share.
</P>
<P>
   Since the announcement of the merger on Dec. 17, BNSF stock had
declined from $26 per share to less than $20 earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   The decision of BNSF and CN to merge prompted other railroads to
warn that they would consider giant mergers.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst James Valentine of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter told
Bloomberg News that ``the merger genie is out of the bottle.'' But
he said the board's decision effectively delays further mergers by
at least three years.
</P>
<P>
   In the decision, chairwoman Linda Morgan noted that rail stocks
had declined, ``taking a particularly sharp turn downward
immediately after the BNSF/CN merger proposal was announced.''
</P>
<P>
   Rail merger applications were once leisurely affairs, often
stretching over decades. The 1980 deregulation of the industry put
new time constraints _ as little as 12 months _ on applications.
The merger of Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Pacific Corp. was
accomplished in 15 months after it was announced in mid-1994.
</P>
<P>
   After the BNSF-Canadian National merger was proposed, opponents
pounced on the industry's Achilles heel, the service foulups that
have accompanied the two most recent mergers involving Union
Pacific and Southern Pacific railroads in the western United States
and the consolidation of Conrail by CSX and Norfolk Southern in the
east.
</P>
<P>
   The Union Pacific-Southern Pacific merger problems hit Texas
particularly hard in late 1997 and most of 1998. Chemical shippers
and utilities complained about delayed service, and the Federal
Railroad Administration temporarily assumed oversight of UP
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Shippers also complained that the reduction in the number of
major Class One carriers in the United States _ to four today, from
more than two dozen 25 years ago _ threatens competition and makes
customers vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Krebs had tried to counter objections by noting that the
BN-Santa Fe merger went relatively smoothly, and that the merged
company has rolled up record profits since.
</P>
<P>
   But Morgan said in the board's decision that ``the overwhelming
testimony at our hearing (held earlier this month in Washington,
D.C.) indicated that the shipping public has still not recovered
from those disruptions.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement with ominous overtones for future merger
applications, Morgan added that ``our existing merger policy
guidelines were adopted in 1980. The goals of that merger policy
have largely been achieved. It does not appear that there are
significant public interest benefits to be realized from further
downsizing or rationalizing of rail route systems.''
</P>
<P>
   The board's decision blocked BNSF and Canadian from filing later
this month for approval of their merger. The railroads planned to
ask for a decision on the merger within one year, and talked of its
completion by August 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the two carriers will be unable to even apply for
permission to merge until mid-June next year. A decision on the
application would take at least a year. Meanwhile, the board said
yesterday that it will write new guidelines for mergers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board seems to realize that most of the benefits of
rationalization have been realized,'' said Diane Duff, executive
director of the Alliance for Rail Competition, a network of
corporations and trade groups.
</P>
<P>
   Chemical shippers, whose members along the Texas Gulf coast were
particularly victimized by service fiascos after the Union
Pacific-Southern Pacific merger of 1997, also stressed the need for
more competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is another avenue for us to talk about changing the
system to make it work for customers,'' said Mike Heimowitz,
spokesman for the Chemical Manufacturers Association.
</P>
<P>
   BNSF's railroad rivals quickly lined up against the merger with
an unanimity that Krebs said surprised him.
</P>
<P>
   Union Pacific Railroad, which competes directly against BNSF in
the western half of the U.S., said the board's decision ``is in the
best interest of the railroad industry.''
</P>
<P>
   CSX Chairman John Snow said the decision ``is a recognition of
the fact that the proposed BNSF/CN merger is not in the public
interest at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Snow, whose railroad operates in the eastern half of the United
States, said ``a longer pause (between mergers) would have been
preferable.''
</P>
<P>
   The BNSF-CN merger would move the BNSF headquarters to Montreal
from Fort Worth. CN Chairman Paul Tellier would become chief
executive of the new company, and Krebs would take the title of
``nonexecutive chairman.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month Krebs said he would ease out of executive
responsibility with the railroad and ``go relax.''

OSCAR STATUETTES DISAPPEAR ON THE ROAD TO HOLLYWOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ill., Ohio)   (SUBS to add graf, bgng `Getting into the...', with quotes from
news conference; Subs penultimate graf for clarification.)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Police are being asked to keep an eye out for dozens
of missing bald, shiny men standing about 13 inches high and
weighing 8 pounds each, with strangely erect posture, vaguely
Cycladic features and a tendency to make motion picture
professionals gush, weep and suddenly remember their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Crystal had better have a pretty good alibi.
</P>
<P>
   Just two weeks after the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and
Sciences was forced to resend 4,200 Oscar ballots because the first
batch had been mislaid by the Postal Service, the academy had to
announce Friday morning that somebody had stolen the entire
shipment of 55 gold-plated statuettes that were to be used in this
year's ceremonies on March 26 at the Shrine Auditorium in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are, as you might expect, keeping a sharp eye out for
them,'' said Bruce Davis, the academy's executive director, at a
news conference Friday morning at the organization's Beverly Hills
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   There is no need to worry, Davis said. The academy has 20 Oscar
statuettes on hand and a new shipment of 35 is being prepared for
delivery next Monday by R.S. Owens, the Chicago-based manufacturing
firm that makes the awards. Academy officials were trying to laugh
off the theft, a little ruefully. Davis called it ``an interesting
but relatively minor glitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Here, as near as academy officials can determine, is the
sequence of events. Nine unmarked boxes containing 55 statues,
which were not inscribed with the names of the Oscar winners, left
the Owens facility on March 3 in the custody of Roadway Express, a
70-year-old transport company that has carried the statues in the
past. Most of the boxes held six statues. On March 8, they arrived
at the Roadway facility in Bell, Calif., an industrial suburb a few
miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles, where they were placed on
a loading dock.
</P>
<P>
   On March 10, Scott Siegel, Owens' president, said he received a
call from Roadway that the cartons could not be found. He alerted
academy officials, who on that day were having the annual gala
luncheon for the year's Oscar nominees at the Beverly Hilton Hotel.
For two days, Davis said, Roadway checked to determine whether the
boxes had been somehow rerouted, but it came to the conclusion that
they had been stolen, probably from the loading dock area, by a
person or persons unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect they were quite surprised to discover what they
had,'' Davis said. ``I think it's going to be fairly hard to fence
an Oscar.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Since the deadline for voting on the Oscars is not until March
23 _ and no one but the academy's accountants will know the names
of the winners until Oscar night _ all of the stolen statues are
unengraved. The total cost of the shipment was around $18,000,
Davis said, and the academy expected Roadway to pay for any losses
and costs incurred from the theft
</P>
<P>
   ``Roadway Express apparently has a somewhat casual attitude
toward security in their facility,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   John Hyre, a spokesman at Roadway's corporate headquarters in
Akron, Ohio, said the company would have no comment, and referred
all calls to the academy.
</P>
<P>
   At the Roadway facility in Bell, a seemingly secure compound
surrounded by a fence topped with razor-wire and a guard who can
monitor anyone approaching, a reporter was not allowed to enter or
question employees. The few workers who strayed outside declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said that Roadway was offering a $50,000 reward for
information leading to the arrest and conviction of the thieves.
</P>
<P>
   Police from Los Angeles and Bell have formed a joint team to
investigate the theft, and the FBI has become involved, since the
shipment involved interstate commerce, and has sent one of its art
experts to advise in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're going to solve this, but at the moment we do not
have them in hand,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   The new shipment of Oscar statues will be shipped from Chicago
by United Airlines Cargo and will be accompanied by security guards
every step of the way, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Getting into the whimsical spirit of Friday's news conference,
reporters began asking whether the academy had searched Jim
Carrey's house (the actor had been expected to get an Oscar
nomination last year and this year but didn't) or had asked
Crystal, the host of this year's ceremonies, not to joke about the
theft on the air. ``All we did was tell Billy not to go to Bell,''
Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the exact number of eventual Oscar winners is not known
until the envelopes are opened on Oscar night, there are always
plenty of the statuettes on hand. Davis said he was confident that
would also be the case this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a three-way tie in the visual effects category,
we'll be in trouble,'' he said. ``In fact, I think everyone should
watch the entire Oscar show to see if we have enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, the academy used to simply ship the Oscars. But
two years ago it decided to try to wring some publicity out of the
event, staging a photo opportunity showing armed guards escorting
the Oscars from the Owens facility in Chicago and across the
country to Los Angeles. But the academy had been criticized for
that, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People said it was an old-fashioned publicity stunt and we
could just ship them overland,'' Davis said. ``But apparently, you
can't.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Long considered an opponent of significant new
gun control and a faithful friend of the National Rifle
Association, Gov. George W. Bush seems to be taking small steps
away from the powerful organization and signaling a greater
receptiveness to additional restrictions on firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Several times over the last few days, Bush expressed support for
two measures _ the mandatory sale of trigger locks with new
handguns and the implementation of ``smart gun'' technology _ that
the gun organization has frequently criticized.
</P>
<P>
   Even more striking, Bush openly criticized the NRA's executive
director, Wayne La Pierre, for his recent assertions that President
Clinton, rather than vigorously prosecuting the laws, tolerated a
certain level of gun violence to keep his public crusade for gun
control on the front burner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the NRA was right to characterize the president
the way they did,'' Bush said in an interview at the governor's
mansion here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, at a news conference in Springfield, Ill., Bush
reiterated his disapproval of La Pierre's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a way to debate the issue without casting aspersions
on the president like this,'' Bush said. ``I think they've gone too
far with that statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was trying to distance himself from the NRA, Bush
said, ``There are going to be times when we agree and times when we
disagree.'' Neither a spokesman for the NRA nor a lobbyist for the
group returned repeated telephone messages Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, made his
remarks as he began a general election campaign in which his
principal challenge may be winning support in the political center
and a principal obstacle to that could be a reputation as an
opponent of gun control.
</P>
<P>
   It is an issue that has become especially popular with moderate
swing voters like suburban women. It is also an issue that many
political strategists believe will hold greater sway in this
election than ever before, given the spate of gun violence and
school shootings over the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore has already made it clear that he will
challenge Bush on gun control and make an issue of the governor's
record on guns in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Bush signed legislation permitting people with proper
training and certification to carry concealed guns. In 1999, Bush
signed a law forbidding Texas cities and counties to directly sue
gun manufacturers to recover the costs of gun-related mayhem on the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush has also supported laws and other efforts in Texas to
toughen criminal prosecution of people who illegally use firearms
and to hold parents criminally responsible if their guns wind up in
the hands of their children.
</P>
<P>
   Since Bush began his presidential campaign last June, he has
stated support for certain gun-control measures that he did not
expressly advocate in the past.
</P>
<P>
   In late August, for example, Bush endorsed raising the legal age
for gun ownership to 21 from 18 and banning the import of
high-capacity ammunition clips. Repeatedly over the last two weeks,
Bush has said that he would sign legislation requiring mandatory
safety locks on handguns if it reached his desk, even though he
still expressed reservations about the efficacy of such a law.
</P>
<P>
   On many previous occasions, Bush had stressed support only for
the voluntary sale of such devices.
</P>
<P>
   In the Wednesday interview, he said he also supported a recent
proposal by Gov. George Pataki of New York that a kind of ballistic
fingerprint of each gun be made by firing it before it was sold.
The record would help trace the guns used in crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciate Pataki's ideas,'' Bush said, referring also to
the New York governor's promotion of a ban on assault rifles, which
Bush has long supported.
</P>
<P>
   Several gun-control advocates said there had been a clear, if
incremental, evolution in Bush's stance on gun control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the reality of being in a national campaign, with his
record on guns, is starting to sink in,'' said Joe Sudbay,
political director of Handgun Control, a Washington advocacy group.
``He has been a very staunch ally of the NRA, and that may work in
Texas, and that may have worked in Republican primaries, but that
doesn't work with the vast majority of American people.''
</P>
<P>
   But advocates said that it is unclear in some instances exactly
where Bush stands. For example, while Bush has heralded the
imminent arrival of ``smart guns,'' or firearms that would
recognize an owner's handprint and be usable only by that person,
he has not specified what sorts of laws he would support to
encourage the sale and use of those weapons.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Buh's support for mandatory background checks on buyers at gun
shows includes the condition, backed by the NRA, that those checks
be conducted and completed instantly. Most Democrats in Congress
say a 72-hour interval is necessary, and that difference was one of
the major sticking points when Congress debated gun control last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Gore supports the 72 hours as well as mandatory licensing of new
handgun owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush is sitting with the short straw on this issue,'' said
Peter Hart, a Democratic pollster, noting that Bush's gubernatorial
record in Texas includes the 1995 concealed-weapons law. ``It's a
question of how much he can minimize the damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Kellyanne Fitzpatrick, a Republican pollster, said the situation
is not clear. She said that the voters most likely to put gun
control at the top of their list are the conservatives who do not
want it, not the moderates and liberals who do.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzpatrick added that Bush has to be cautious about seeming to
bend with the political winds. ``If Bush changes his position on
guns,'' she said, ``you open yourself up to charges of hypocrisy,
softening. You don't want to do that.''

NEW BOEING PANEL AIMED AT SHOWING RESPECT FOR TECH EMPLOYEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL NYHAN  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Boeing Co. and its engineering union tackled one
of the thorniest demands of its striking engineers _ showing
greater respect for technical employees _ by creating a new joint
``Leadership Council'' under the proposed contract agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But it's unclear what the panel will actually accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing and the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in
Aerospace agreed to create the Leadership Council to address
everything from healthcare matters to quality issues. Boeing
Chairman Phil Condit and Paul Almeida, president of the union's
parent, the International Federation of Professional and Technical
Engineers, will co-chair the panel.
</P>
<P>
   The council is an attempt to address two key demands of striking
employees: a greater partnership with the company and a clearer
definition of their future roles at the company.
</P>
<P>
   But, the idea of a joint union-executive panel isn't unique to
Boeing's latest contract offer. The provision has popped up in
other labor contracts and produced mixed results, according to Kate
Bronfenbrenner, director of labor education and research at Cornell
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joint councils, and the values and the power of (a) union
council really depends on what is done with it,'' Bronfenbrenner
said. ``You have to watch what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing executives say the council could play a key role in
building greater cooperation between the company's technical
community and management.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to commit, very specifically, some of my time and
energy to a working-together task force that will allow us to sit
down and discuss what are the issues, how did they occur, how do we
take this company forward,'' Condit said in a news conference
addressing the broader contract agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The aerospace giant already is working with its most powerful
union, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace
Workers, on several joint efforts. For example, the union says it
has already been able to preserve jobs within the company that had
been earmarked for subcontractors.
</P>
<P>
   Still, leaders of the union admit the effectiveness of the
council, which will meet every quarter, is an open question.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be worth an awful lot to the union and the company or
it could be worth nothing,'' said Craig Buckham, president of the
engineering union, the second largest union at Boeing.

 &HT;    Police continue search for suspect in officer's fatal shooting
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Hundreds of police officers and FBI agents continued
to search Friday evening for a former Black Panther turned
neighborhood leader wanted in the killing of a Fulton County
sheriff's deputy.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they believe Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin, formerly known
as H. Rap Brown, is being harbored by someone who admires him for
his efforts to rid the southwest Atlanta enclave known as the West
End of drugs and prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will leave no stone unturned until we find this man,'' said
Capt. David Chadd, chief spokesman for the Fulton County Sheriff's
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell urged anyone with information about
Al-Amin's whereabouts to come forward. He warned that harboring a
fugitive in such a serious case is illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Chadd said a 100-officer team searching West End for Al-Amin
early Friday morning was scaled back only after police determined
he was no longer within a four-block radius.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta homicide investigators and uniformed officers from the
precinct that covers that section of the city remained in the
neighborhood, however. That force was quadrupled after Deputy
Richard Kinchen died at Grady Memorial Hospital on Friday afternoon
of gunshot wounds.
</P>
<P>
   An all points bulletin was issued before dawn advising that
Al-Amin could be driving a black, four-door Mercedes-Benz with
tinted windows and license plate 246MBG or a green Toyota
Four-Runner with Alabama plates 45AV431.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI issued a federal fugitive warrant for Al-Amin's arrest,
said FBI spokeswoman Celeste Armstead.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time in 41 years that a Fulton County
sheriff's deputy had been killed by gunfire in the line of duty.
</P>
<P>
   Aldranon English, the deputy who survived the attack, identified
Al-Amin as the shooter after Atlanta homicide investigators showed
him several pictures from a line-up as he lay in his hospital bed
Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours after identifying Al-Amin, English learned his
friend and partner had died.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are heartbroken,'' said a solemn Jacqueline Barrett, Fulton
County sheriff. ``The entire department is taking this very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta and Fulton sheriff's officials said Al-Amin used a .223
caliber assault rifle to attack Kinchen and English. The weapon is
similar to M-16 and AR-15 rifles. The bullets are about three
inches long and about half an inch in diameter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only purpose to use a weapon like the one he used, is to
kill,'' Chadd said.
</P>
<P>
   Kinchen, a nine-year veteran who leaves behind his wife and two
children, died after several attempts to revive his heart failed,
Chadd said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deputy's demise was due to the horrendous trauma he
suffered from the attack with the assault weapon,'' Chadd said.
``His heart stopped several times and he could not be revived.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a shame he had to die in such a heinous fashion,
especially since the deputies were only trying to serve him with a
warrant that was so minor.''
</P>
<P>
   Kinchen and English were attempting to serve a warrant on
Al-Amin late Thursday evening for Cobb County Police. The warrant,
issued Jan. 28 after Al-Amin failed to appear in Cobb County court,
was for driving without proof of insurance and impersonating a
police officer. Thursday night, Atlanta police and Fulton County
sheriff's officials had said Al-Amin was wanted for aggravated
assault.
</P>
<P>
   Though Kinchen and English both wore protective vests, the gear
was no match for the powerful bullets that struck the deputies,
said Dr. Jeff Salomone, the surgeon for the Atlanta Police
Department. Salomone, associate professor of surgery at Emory
School of Medicine, said the slugs went under and around the vests.
</P>
<P>
   ``A vest offers no protection against a high velocity bullet,''
the surgeon said Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett said another surgeon at Grady told her the injuries
sustained by the deputies _ especially Kinchen's _ ``looked like
those seen in Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta police Detective Joseph Masterson Jr. said Al-Amin was
one of several suspects in 20 unsolved homicides in the West End
neighborhood. But Al-Amin was never charged after Deputy Chief C.B.
Jackson and other police commanders concluded they did not have
enough evidence against him or others.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin, 56, moved to the West End area in 1976 after he was
released from prison on a robbery conviction.
</P>
<P>
   He converted to the Muslim faith while in prison and changed his
name to Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin. He runs a grocery store about 100
feet from Al-Amin's mosque, which is housed in a large blue framed
building.
</P>
<P>
   The Muslim community, which has helped revitalize West End,
showed support for Al-Amin on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Mosque member Nadim Ali, a spokesman for the Community Mosque of
Atlanta, read a prepared statement Friday afternoon. Ali refused to
answer questions from the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``We the members of the Community Mosque of Atlanta would like
to state that the legal principal that a person is innocent until
proven guilty is also a concept that is consistent with the Islamic
belief. We ask you to avoid passing judgement until all the facts
are in and not use the media to accuse, try and convict Imam Jamil
Abdullah Al-Amin.
</P>
<P>
   He is a respected leader in the Islamic community and his works
are well documented, not only in Atlanta, but throughout the
Islamic world.''
</P>
<P>
   Local defense attorney Bruce Harvey, who once represented
Al-Amin, was surprised to hear the allegations against his former
client. In 1995, Harvey represented Al-Amin when he was charged
with weapons violations and aggravated assault on allegations he
shot a man in the leg as he walked through West End Park. The
charges were dismissed. The attorney said Al-Amin showed up for his
court appearances in that case.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd put down the shotgun and picked up the Koran,'' Harvey
said. ``He's turned away from being a revolutionary and a radical
leader to being a spiritual leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why he would respond to these kinds of charges out of Cobb
County in that fashion would be unfathomable to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Journal-Constitution staff writers Joshua Good, Ernie
Suggs and Bill Rankin contributed to this report.

 &HT;    `We needed that': Gordon rolls to Darlington pole
 &HT;    By Rick Minter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DARLINGTON, S.C. _ Jeff Gordon took a big step in his trek back
to the top of NASCAR's Winston Cup Series by winning the pole for
Sunday's Mall.com 400.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon was last driver on the track and turned a lap at 172.662
mph to bump Kevin Lepage to the outside pole. Gordon got cheers
instead of boos from the Darlington crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was definitely the high point of the 2000 season,'' said
Gordon. ``We needed that.''
</P>
<P>
   The three-time Winston Cup champion opened the season with a new
crew chief, Robbie Loomis, and several new crew members.
</P>
<P>
   After four races, Gordon's best finish is ninth _ at Atlanta
Motor Speedway last week _ and he ranks 17th in points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've run bad and we've been needing to run better,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon said winning the pole, his third in 15 Winston Cup races
at Darlington, is a confidence builder for his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the changes that have gone on, this team has done a
great job,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's team owner, Rick Hendrick, said he was pleased with the
qualifying run and said people sometimes want too much from his
driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people expect Jeff Gordon to come out every week and sit
on the pole and lead every lap,'' Hendrick said. ``Nobody is going
to do that in this sport. There are too many good teams and good
drivers.''
</P>
<P>
   Five of Gordon's 49 career victories have come at Darlington, a
track advertised as ``too tough to tame.'' Gordon has never won
more than four at any other track on the circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Lepage said he and owner Jack Roush figured all along that
Gordon would be fastest.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm tickled pink,'' said Lepage, who started the season
without a sponsor, but now has one in FamilyClick.com. ``It's
disappointing that we didn't get the pole, but our team has been
strong.''
</P>
<P>
   No make of car appeared to have an aerodynamic advantage; the
top 10 consisted of three Chevrolets, three Pontiacs and four
Fords.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Earnhardt, who beat Bobby Labonte by less than two feet to
win the Cracker Barrel 500, will start fourth Sunday in a car that
he describes as ``real drivable.''
</P>
<P>
   Four rookies earned starting spots, led by 10th place-finisher
Dale Earnhardt Jr., who has qualified in the top 10 for every
points race this season.

FOR SECOND TIME, LIFE MAGAZINE WILL END REGULAR PUBLICATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (subs for rewriting and additional information; new byline; story
grows by about 300 words)  
(bl) 
 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At Time Inc., it's deja vu all over again. After at
least two years of speculation within the company, Time Inc.
announced Friday that it would cease regular publication of Life
magazine with the May issue _ the second time it has closed the
magazine since it was introduced in 1936.
</P>
<P>
   Long a staple in American households of a certain era along with
other general-interest publications like Look magazine and The
Saturday Evening Post, Life became the illustrated chronicle of the
World War II period, and as a weekly magazine, offered
news-oriented photojournalism to the Vietnam War era. Partly in
reaction to the images available on television news, Time Inc.
discontinued Life in 1972, and reintroduced it as a monthly title
in 1978. Life magazine did not become profitable until 1986,
according to Time Inc. executives.
</P>
<P>
   Don Logan, the chief executive of Time Inc., said the market had
simply become too competitive for the survival of a
general-interest magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Circulation economics are changing for the whole industry,''
he said. ``It is tough for general-interest magazines which don't
have a fairly endemic advertising base to draw from over the long
term.''
</P>
<P>
   Advertising pages were down over all, to 665 total pages in 1999
from 730 in 1998, a drop of 8.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Logan said that the magazine's newsstand sales and circulation
had dropped to 1.5 million from 1.8 million in 1991, according to
the Audit Bureau of Circulations. And he said that the magazine's
subscriptions had dwindled as a result of legal proceedings against
American Family Publishers and Publishers Clearing House, the
so-called stamp-sheet houses that had once been a major source of
subscriptions.
</P>
<P>
   Time Inc., a unit of Time Warner Inc., said Life magazine would
publish special issues.
</P>
<P>
   According to Time Inc. executives, the decision to close the
magazine after more than a decade of profitability was made because
Life _ the magazine itself, not its ancillary products like books
and videos _ was operating at a loss.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Other Time Inc. executives said that the magazine's managing
editor, Isolde Motley, a former editor of Martha Stewart Living,
had compounded the problems on the business side by taking
editorial risks that failed. Motley hired an art director who
boldly redesigned parts of the magazine, alienating longtime
readers unaccustomed to stark design. And Motley's choice of covers
performed poorly at the newsstand, especially in the last six
months; the magazine, which in 1996 sold between 250,000 to and
530,000 copies on the newsstand each month, according to a report
filed with the Audit Bureau of Circulations, has sold far fewer on
newsstands in the last year, even dipping perilously close to the
100,000 mark at one point, said one executive.
</P>
<P>
   Motley had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   Logan said that Friday was ``a sad, sad day'' at Time Inc. ``The
name of our building is Time-Life,'' he said. ``We have an entire
division called Time-Life. There have been generations of people
who have worked and spent their entire lives and careers making
this a great magazine. And I feel like I personally failed in
finding a way to keep Life strong.''

ALBRIGHT OFFERS NEW OPENNESS WITH IRAN AS U.S. EASES SOME
SANCTIONS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Cautiously embracing Iran's move toward democracy,
the Clinton administration eased sanctions against Iranian rugs and
pistachio nuts Friday and signaled a willingness to normalize
relations with the Islamic republic.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging a history of U.S. interference in Iran's internal
politics, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright called for renewing
diplomatic and cultural ties that were shredded by Iran's 1979
revolution and the 444-day hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call on Iran to join in writing a new chapter in our shared
history,'' Albright said in a speech to the private
American-Iranian Council in Washington. ``Let us be open about our
differences and strive to overcome them. Let us acknowledge our
common interests and strive to advance them.''
</P>
<P>
   Using the start of the Iranian new year to signal a shift in
U.S. policy toward the oil-rich nation, Albright pledged to seek a
settlement of disputed financial claims between the countries. ``We
have concluded the time is ripe to broaden our perspective,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Albright urged Iran's moderate government to help
protect oil reserves and ease tensions in the Persian Gulf region.
``Iran lives in a dangerous neighborhood,'' Albright said. ``We
welcome efforts to make it less dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   While lifting the U.S. ban on importing Persian carpets, caviar,
nuts and fruit, the administration left in place its prohibition
against U.S. companies' involvement in Iran's oil industry. Before
those restrictions are eased, Albright said, Iran must end
development of nuclear weapons and its support of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Albright stopped short of apologizing for U.S. involvement in
Iran's internal affairs, but she acknowledged that Washington had
been ``regrettably shortsighted'' in supporting Baghdad in the
1980s Iran-Iraq war.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, she lamented the CIA's role in toppling the popular
leftist government of Mohammed Mossadegh in 1953, a coup that put
the U.S.-backed Shah, Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, into power.
</P>
<P>
   The Shah was driven from Iran in 1979 as the Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini took power and Iranian militants took 52 Americans
hostage.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's landmark speech, the easing of some trade
restrictions and the pledge to resolve long-standing U.S.-Iranian
financial disputes, drew a positive, yet cautious, response from
the Tehran government.
</P>
<P>
   ``These steps, important and refreshing as they may be, are
insufficient to make a quick and drastic change in the state of
affairs between the two countries,'' said Iranian Ambassador Hadi
Nejad-Hosseinian.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Tehran's perception, one of the problems with the offer of
dialogue is that the U.S. has made it in an insolent and
domineering spirit and not in a real and practical spirit of mutual
respect and equality,'' Nejad-Hosseinian said.
</P>
<P>
   The stage was set for thawing U.S.-Iranian relations by
conciliatory remarks over the past two years by Iranian President
Mohammed Khatami and the victory last month of moderates over
Islamic hard-liners in Iran's parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Iran has begun reaching out to Europe trying to
negotiate lucrative oil deals that, under a prohibition renewed
earlier this week by President Clinton, U.S. companies are barred
from signing.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, the Reagan and Bush administrations also tried to
cultivate moderates in Iran. The efforts failed, even after the
Reagan administration secretly sold weapons to Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no illusions that the United States and Iran will be
able to overcome decades of estrangement overnight,'' Albright
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't build a mature relationship on carpets and grain
alone, but the direction of our relations is more important than
the pace,'' she said. ``The United States is willing either to
proceed patiently on a step-by-step basis or to move very rapidly
if Iran indicates a desire and commitment to do so.``
</P>
<P>
   Iran remains on the State Department's list as a sponsor of
terrorism, along with Cuba, Syria and North Korea. While the United
States continues an unyielding boycott against Cuba, the Clinton
administration is courting Syrian President Hafez Assad and
counseling North Korea on what steps to take to get removed from
the list.
</P>
<P>
   Any restoration of ties between the United States and Iran would
require Congress to change tough sanctions laws, and at least a
dozen lawmakers criticized the administration's move.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., accused the administration of being
unprincipled and inconsistent. ``Principled foreign policy stands
up to terrorism,'' Mack said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., called the administration effort
premature, saying Tehran should compensate U.S. victims of Iranian
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Calif., and 10 other House Democrats wrote
Clinton condemning what they characterized as ``unilateral
concessions.''

   TOKYO _ The jackhammers start their work at 10 p.m., and in this
case, their rat-a-tat-tat brings a machine gun to mind. For the
trench they are digging, which will be home to a state-of-the-art
fiber optic cable transmitting data and voices around the globe,
lies on the front lines of the battle for the heart and soul of the
Japanese economy.
</P>
<P>
   Operating the jackhammers are Japanese construction workers
under contract to KVH Telecom, a fledgling telecommunications
company financed by a unit of FMR's Fidelity Investments. They are
laying a cable that KVH promises will provide better quality,
higher speed and cheaper service than anything Japan has ever seen.
And in doing so, they are creating a piece of the infrastructure
upon which a new Japan will rise after a decade of economic
decline.
</P>
<P>
   Dictating how the trench will be dug _ and in many ways,
discouraging the digging _ are Japanese regulators. They are only
the most recent in a line of officials who have single-mindedly
promoted the interests of Japanese business _ particularly those of
the mighty Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, by many measures Japan's
most formidable company and long its telephone monopoly. Their
rules, which add months to every project, have made Japan the most
expensive telecommunications market in the industrialized world.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, American trade negotiators will meet their Japanese
counterparts here in what may be the last in a long series of
skirmishes over Japan's regulation of the telecommunications market
before the United States takes its case to the World Trade
Organization. Other areas like energy, medical equipment,
pharmaceuticals and housing will also be under discussion, but the
bulk of the talks will be devoted to telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   Competitors and Washington contend that NTT has considerable
advantages beyond having been the only game in town for decades.
Government regulation, they say, favors NTT in the way that prices
are set, in limiting access to rights of way and in severely
circumscribing how various types of telecommunications carriers can
do business.
</P>
<P>
   The fight, however, is much more than a trade dispute. ``This is
not a battle between the United States, foreigners and Japanese,
small companies and large ones,'' said Harumasa Sato, a professor
of economics at Konan University in Kobe and a member of the
government's Telecommunication Council, an advisory board of
academics and experts. ``This is a battle between monopoly and
competition, old Japan and new Japan, the past and the future.''
</P>
<P>
   While similar fights are taking place throughout the Japanese
economy these days, perhaps none is so pivotal. After all, it is
the development and deployment of telecommunications systems, with
their delicate glass fibers and light-speed switches, that is
knitting the global economy into a seamless whole and playing a
bigger and bigger role in the prosperity of individual economies.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese insist they are intent on becoming a critical link
in the network and are working as fast as is practical to
deregulate their market. The Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications refused to make any of its officials available
for an interview, saying they were too busy.
</P>
<P>
   And it is, in fact, getting easier to compete here; NTT
officials point to the presence of KVH and many other competitors
as proof of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot understand why foreign competitors are saying NTT
gets preferential treatment,'' said Kanji Koide, a senior vice
president at NTT ``The reason they are here is that the Japanese
market is a level playing field.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is a general backlash against deregulation in Japan,
as evidence of the economy's growing openness sinks into the
popular psyche. Seeing a packed Starbucks shop on seemingly every
corner in Tokyo _ often across the street from a struggling
Japanese competitor _ raises fears among many that Japan is losing
its identity.
</P>
<P>
   So there are signs of foot-dragging, notably in the
telecommunications sector. In 1998, then Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto promised President Clinton that Japan would adopt a
method of calculating interconnection fees _ what NTT charges other
carriers to hook into its local network _ that would make Japan
competitive with other major markets around the globe by this
April. Yet now the government says it cannot live up to Hashimoto's
pledge, because dropping fees so far so fast would be
``devastating'' to NTT.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, practical impediments to competition here have not
been dismantled, adding immensely to the costs of any company
trying to build a telecommunications system that challenges NTT on
its home turf.
</P>
<P>
   Take KVH's trench. Construction costs average around $2,000 a
meter, roughly five times what they would be in Europe and 10 to 12
times higher than in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Why? The trench must be opened, dug and closed each night. All
the soil that is dug out of the trench must be hauled away, and new
dirt hauled in to replace it. Each night. The pit must be 55 inches
deep, compared with 31 inches in Europe; the greater depth means
steel plates must be used to reinforce the trench.
</P>
<P>
   The Ministry of Construction, which imposes these rules, says
they are necessary because Japan is earthquake prone and densely
populated and its cities ancient.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot, though, is that by the time KVH completes the first
66 miles of its network this month, construction will have
accounted for some 80 percent of its costs. ``It sometimes feels
like we're in the construction business instead of the telecom
business,'' said Akira Tada, KVH's director of corporate planning.
</P>
<P>
   Further, though KVH's goal is to give customers service that
bypasses NTT, it cannot provide such services without itself doing
business with NTT; the phone company, together with local power
companies, owns the conduits that feed into buildings here.
</P>
<P>
   So roughly 70 percent of the internal ducts that KVH will use
must be leased from NTT at an average cost of $70 a meter. In
building a phone system, ``speed is very important, and if we use
their ducts, we get speed,'' Tada said. ``We have to pay for
speed.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At the end of one year, KVH has completed less than 20 percent
of its network, far less than it expected. It has taken MCI
WorldCom three years and dozens of bruising battles with regulators
and building owners to wire two buildings. After trying to compete
with NTT for more than a decade, the Tokyo Telecommunications
Network, or TT Net, has captured only 0.8 percent of the nationwide
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to do business here, but still the situation is much
better than it was three years ago,'' said Mirei Kuroda, an
executive at MCI WorldCom who recalls being summoned to the
ministry at 11 one night when MCI was applying for its license.
``But the ministry is still not supportive.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all this, businesses are pressing hard for alternatives,
and in doing so are forcing NTT to respond. KVH, MCI WorldCom,
Japan Telecom and others are laying loops of fiber optic cable all
over Tokyo and Osaka, hooking up to buildings owned by major real
estate companies like Mori Building and Mitsui Fudosan.
</P>
<P>
   The buildings those developers own and manage were previously
served only by NTT, but times _ and tenants _ have changed. Foreign
financial service and law firms, proliferating thanks to
deregulation in the financial markets here, are demanding
high-speed, high-quality, fault-free telecommunications services at
a competitive cost.
</P>
<P>
   Mori Building is on the verge of offering its tenants
long-distance service using MCI WorldCom's lines; over the longer
term, it plans to give them a menu of carriers to choose from.
</P>
<P>
   Hiroo Mori, a director of Mori Building, figures the cost of a
long-distance call will drop by as much as 75 percent. ``We think
this will enhance our reputation and make us more appealing to
tenants,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But as Koide of NTT notes, only business customers _ the most
lucrative market for any upstart phone company, whether in Japan,
the United States or elsewhere _ will benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are only planning to serve customers who use a lot of
international service,'' he said. ``We have to provide service to
everyone here, even when we don't make a profit.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Japanese consumer has figured hardly at all in the
dreams of MCI WorldCom, KVH and the like, largely because the cost
of reaching her is so high. NTT is at both ends of 99 percent of
local calls, because it controls the critical wires into Japanese
homes. That means every time someone using MCI's network picks up
the phone and calls someone else here, MCI pays NTT an
interconnection fee that amounts to somewhere around 40 percent of
the revenue from the call.
</P>
<P>
   Those fees are the core of the fight between the United States
Trade Representative's office and Japanese regulators. Tokyo has
proposed cutting them by 22.5 percent over four years; Washington
wants a 41 percent reduction right away. Neither side is budging.
</P>
<P>
   To understand how interconnection fees affect carriers, take a
look at TT Net, to date the only company attempting to compete with
NTT in providing local phone service.
</P>
<P>
   Started in 1986 by Tokyo Electric Power in the wake of NTT's
privatization, it faces few of the challenges that foreign carriers
do, because it can use the conduits, ducts and rights of way owned
by its parent. For the first decade of its existence, it served
business customers and other telecommunications carriers that used
its system end to end, capturing almost one-third of the demand for
high-speed digital transmission in its service area.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1998, TT Net began offering telephone services to
households in Tokyo and eight surrounding prefectures, using a
high-speed optical fiber network laid alongside the electric
company's cables and distribution lines. It priced its service at 9
yen for three minutes, 1 yen lower than NTT's rate, and came up
with some catchy advertising. By the end of last May, it had
attracted more than two million customers.
</P>
<P>
   But to complete local phone calls, TT Net had to connect to
NTT's network _ and its profitability plummeted. Net income fell
from 2.5 billion yen in 1997 to 300 million yen in 1998, then
tumbled to 100 million yen in the fiscal year that ended last
March.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost of interconnection is a real and harsh one,'' said
Hiroyuki Tsukamoto, deputy general manager of TT Net's corporate
planning department. ``It is the center of our problems.'' TT Net,
of course, knew from the start that interconnection fees were high.
But it started the service believing that the government planned to
cut them this year.
</P>
<P>
   Koide contends, though, that TT Net's problems are the result of
a flawed business strategy and an excessive reliance on NTT's
sites. ``Charging 9 yen is uneconomical,'' he said. ``We charge 10
yen and can hardly make money.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, lowering interconnection fees will be hard on NTT,
which has been trying to find its footing since being forced by the
government last year to spin off its two most promising businesses
and carve its remaining operations into three parts.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese government estimates that its own proposal would
slice $4 billion out of the revenues of NTT's two local phone
companies, one of which is already losing money. Any further
reduction, it says, would force NTT to either charge its retail
customers higher rates _ which would be all but impossible,
politically _ or absorb the pain itself, since the law prohibits it
from simply eliminating unprofitable service.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the one hand, we must provide service to remote regional
areas at our own cost, and on the other hand, we are exposed to
harsh competition in the more lucrative urban areas,'' Koide said.
``We feel there's a contradiction in that system.''
</P>
<P>
   But Koide and the government are ignoring the experience of the
United States and other countries where interconnection fees have
been reduced. Competition has forced prices lower, and regulators
have set up mechanisms to ensure that deregulation neither reduced
service in unprofitable areas nor hampered the ability of local
phone companies to make money.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Plus, the United States and others have raised questions about
the numbers used in the model that Tokyo relied on in determining
the impact on NTT of cutting interconnection fees.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on who is right, the extra cost to consumers could be
as little as 56 cents a month, or a more unpalatable $3.15 monthly.
If the costs were absorbed wholly by NTT, they could be just $462
million annually _ or as much as $2.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   While would-be competitors bicker over the costs of traditional
fixed-line phone service, Japanese consumers have been voting with
their pocketbooks, switching in droves to cellular phones. The cost
of wireless phones has dropped 78 percent over the last 15 years;
fixed-line phone rates have risen 13 percent in the same time.
</P>
<P>
   The irony, of course, is that the biggest beneficiary of the
switch to cellular has been NTT itself. The company has a 67
percent stake in Japan's largest mobile phone carrier, NTT Mobile
Telecommunications, or NTT DoCoMo, one of the two companies that
NTT spun off as part of its breakup last year.
</P>
<P>
   Demand has been huge for DoCoMo's i-mode phones, which provide
Internet access for about $2.83 a month. That is 96 percent less
than NTT charges for Internet service over fixed phone lines, a
differential that helps explain why only 12 percent of the Japanese
population has such service, compared with one-third or more of
Americans, for example.
</P>
<P>
   So in spite of the woes of its local phone subsidiaries, NTT is
a rich company. The value of its stake in DoCoMo alone is roughly
24.1 trillion yen, or $227.6 billion, and it also holds the
majority of NTT Data, the data transmission company that it spun
off with DoCoMo last year.
</P>
<P>
   If NTT were to sell just 20 percent of its DoCoMo stake _ which
would still leave it in control of the mobile phone operator _ it
would pocket some 2.5 trillion yen, or $23.6 billion, after taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Sato, the homegrown critic, likes to daydream about ways the
company could use that windfall to promote competition. ``NTT could
adopt the U.S. proposal immediately using this money,'' Sato said,
referring to the call for a sharp cut in interconnection fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could even afford to create a special incentive program to
encourage early retirement, which would help it to streamline, cut
costs and become more competitive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His argument is simplistic _ liquidating a position of that size
would be tricky _ but it now looks like the ruling party may study
a similar proposal. And Sato has a point: Far from emasculating NTT
by creating a market value for its component parts, the government
gave the company a fat piggy bank it could use to numb the pain of
fundamentally reorienting its business.
</P>
<P>
   NTT is not thinking that way. Rather, it is resentful that it
was forced to sell even small parts of its prized subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that we could have done much better with DoCoMo
and Data if we had full control of them,'' Koide said. ``But NTT
had no choice in the matter.''
</P>
<P>
   For all its foot-dragging, NTT can move at lightening speed to
cut costs when it is threatened. In the last two months, several
companies have announced plans to provide access to the Internet
using a technology called ADSL that ensures higher speed and better
quality than the system NTT offers over so-called ISDN lines.
</P>
<P>
   Within days of the first announcements, NTT said it would lower
the price of Internet access. In some parts of Tokyo, it will drop
its fixed-rate Internet access charge to 2,900 yen, or $27.36, a
month from 8,000 yen, or $75.47. NTT had previously resisted
widespread demands for lower Internet rates, saying they would be
unprofitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we consider unfair is that if NTT can afford to lower
rates that fast in that business, why can't they reduce
interconnection fees?'' TT Net's Tsukamoto said.
</P>
<P>
   Competitors believe NTT will similarly slash prices for phone
service by as much as 50 or 60 percent _ if and when they start to
pose a serious challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the more consumers flock to NTT's cheaper ISDN
service, the harder it will be for the new, higher-speed technology
to make inroads here.
</P>
<P>
   NTT is also starting to introduce the new technology, but given
its investment in ISDN, it cannot afford to have it become too
popular too quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another bottleneck the Japanese economy must pass through
to get into the new world,'' Sato said.

BRUINS SEEKING REVENGE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS - The memories of Maryland's 16-point victory last
year are vivid and painful, but the lessons are few.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are speculating that it will be the same as
last year, but we're a totally different team,'' Bruins guard Earl
Watson said. ``We're much more well-rounded, and we have more
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Puerto Rico Classic in Nov. '98, the Bruins were neither
well-rounded nor experienced. Baron Davis was out with a knee
injury, they had no established scorers, and it was the third
career game for freshmen Dan Gadzuric, Jerome Moiso, JaRon Rush,
Ray Young and Matt Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins simply weren't ready for the No. 5 Terps and
high-flying guard Steve Francis, whose alley-oop dunks seemed to
come from the sky.
</P>
<P>
   After the 70-54 loss, UCLA coach Steve Lavin roasted his players
for failing to compete - the highest of athletic crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They beat us, and they rubbed it in,'' UCLA forward Rico Hines
said. ``You could tell by their looks.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen months later, the No. 6 seeded Bruins (20-11) are
talking revenge. They are more equipped to handle the Francis-less
Terps this afternoon in a second-round matchup in the Metrodome.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team is very mature,'' Watson said. ``A sign of that is
no one was too up or too down (before the Ball State game). It
seemed like everyone was acting like seniors. Nothing fazes us. The
tournament environment has not affected us.''
</P>
<P>
   Smells like '98: Two years ago, the No. 6 seeded Bruins played
No. 3 Michigan in Atlanta in the second round. The seed are the
same today. What about the outcome?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the name recognition of Maryland is the same today as
Michigan was then,'' UCLA assistant Michael Holton said. ``Everyone
expected they would win, and it's the same with Maryland.''
</P>
<P>
   Of slow starts and fast finishes: Freshman Jason Kapono was
scoreless in the first half against Ball State but had 17 points in
the second. It was the third time during the seven-game winning
streak that Kapono has scored at least 15 points in the second
half.
</P>
<P>
   How? He doesn't stop shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't come out and try to force things,'' he said. ``I have
to stay patient and use my teammates. But I'm a shooter. A shooter
has a mindset: if you're missing, you keep shooting; if you're hot,
you definitely keep shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   Old friends: Hines faced three Maryland players - forward
Terence Morris, guard Juan Dixon and center Lonny Baxter - during
his high school days at St. John's-Prospect Hall (Md.).
</P>
<P>
   ``Our coach (Stu Vetter) was always trying to recruit Terence,
but he wasn't interested,'' Hines said. ``I'm happy things have
worked out for him. He's cool, he works really hard, and he never
talks a lot of junk. He's just solid.''
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: Watson had six turnovers Thursday, his highest
total since the South Florida game Dec. 23.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins were favored by eight points against Ball State. Dan
Gadzuric's dunk with 0.4 seconds left made the final score 65-57.
</P>
<P>
   Watch for senior Sean Farnham to start again today. The Bruins
are 15-1 with him in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA has won 20 games for the 12th consecutive season.
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Series: UCLA leads 4-2, but Maryland won last year's meeting in
the Puerto Rico Classic 70-54.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA (20-11) update: Bruins have won seven consecutive games,
their longest streak since winning 12 straight in 1997. During the
current streak, they're shooting 42.6 percent from 3-point range.
Coach Steve Lavin, 6-3 in the NCAA Tournament, is seeking his third
Sweet 16 in four years. Bruins made 8 of 18 free throws against
Ball State and are shooting 58.3 percent from the line this season.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland (25-9) update: Terps beat Notre Dame, Illinois,
Kentucky and Duke this season and finished second in the ACC
(behind Duke). They have won 12 of their last 15 games, including a
74-59 victory over Iona in the first round Thursday. Their top
scorers are guard Juan Dixon (18.1 ppg), forward Terence Morris
(15.9 ppg) and center Lonny Baxter (15.4 ppg). They shoot 68.8
percent from the foul line. Opponents are shooting 39.5 percent
from the field.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   UCLA-MARYLAND MATCHUPS
</P>
<P>
   Backcourt: Maryland freshman Steve Blake has performed well in
place of departed star Steve Francis. Blake, 6-3, is creative, a
good shooter and outplayed Duke's Jason Williams. Off guard Juan
Dixon, 6-3, is one of the nation's top gunners (36.6 percent from
3-point range) and a first-team ll-ACC pick. Moves well without the
ball.
</P>
<P>
   Bruins point guard Earl Watson must play with more control than
he did against Ball State (six turnovers), but that won't be easy
against Maryland's tenacious defense. Billy Knight started
Thursday, but watch for JaRon Rush early and often. Edge: Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Frontcourt: Maryland junior Terence Morris hasn't played like
the first-team All-American many expected, but he's pretty good
(15.7 ppg). His size, 6-9, and quickness make him a difficult
matchup for the Bruins. Center Lonny Baxter (15.5 ppg, 8.7 rpg) is
a first-team ll-ACC pick and will give Dan Gadzuric all he can
handle. Power forward Tahj Holden is a complementary player.
</P>
<P>
   Bruins would be thrilled with another double-double from
Gadzuric. But they need first-half production from Jason Kapono,
who was scoreless for 24 minutes against Ball State, and more
physical play from Jerome Moiso, who was tentative Thursday and
made just 5 of 14 shots. Edge: Even.
</P>
<P>
   Bench: Maryland used a seven-man rotation in its first-round
victory. Guard Drew Nicholas and center Mike Mardesich are solid
players, but neither will turn a game. Forward Danny Miller (8.6
ppg) has started 33 games but didn't play Thursday (sprained ankle)
and is questionable today.
</P>
<P>
   Rush continues to shoot well from 3-point range and had 14
points in 27 minutes against Ball State. Forward Matt Barnes
sparked the second-half surge with deft passing. Rico Hines, Ray
Young and Ryan Bailey will play as needed. Sean Farnham might
start, but he'll be replaced early by Gadzuric. Edge: UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Intangibles: Bruins have won seven straight and are playing with
supreme confidence, much like the '97 team that reached the Elite
Eight. Terps didn't look like a No.3 seed against Iona, but they
have lost just three games since the Super Bowl: at Temple, at
Virginia (overtime) and Duke in the ACC finals. Not bad. Edge:
Even.
</P>
<P>
   Coaching: Maryland's combustible Gary Williams is approaching
his annual tournament fold. Despite good talent, he's never taken
Terps past the Sweet 16. UCLA's staff, like the players, has found
its groove. However, coach Steve Lavin must correct Thursday's
sloppiness for the Bruins to advance. Edge: Slight to UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Outcome: Another good matchup for the Bruins in that Maryland is
an up-tempo team. Bottom line: UCLA has more weapons. As long as
the staff does its job, that's the difference. With each game,
these Bruins look more and more like the Elite Eight-bound 1997
team. Edge: UCLA by six.

 &HT;    Unusual home games for Braves' Venezuelan natives
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers

<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ So much for meaningless exhibitions. Games
the Braves will play against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in Venezuela
today and Sunday may mean nothing in the standings, but will mean
everything in the stands.
</P>
<P>
   The 25,000 fans packed into University Stadium will be
celebrating the healing of their country and their hero.
</P>
<P>
   Andres Galarraga will play a baseball game in his native
Venezuela having recovering from lymphoma, and first in the past
seven years. He, Ozzie Guillen and Eddie Perez _ all Venezuelans _
will be playing for a crowd that has seen devastation in the deadly
December mudslides that killed thousands of people.
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball couldn't have seen this one coming. But
their efforts to reach out to the Latin American community that has
pumped so much talent into baseball _ giving Venezuela its first
taste of major league baseball in more than 25 years _ couldn't
have come at a better time.
</P>
<P>
   ``My country is one of the most important oil producers in the
world,'' said Alfredo Villasmil, assistant sports editor of the
Ultimas Noticias, one of seven major newspapers in Caracas. ``It's
potentially one of the richest countries, but it's one of the
poorest countries. Now we are in the most horrible catastrophe my
country has suffered.''
</P>
<P>
   Enter Galarraga, whom Perez said is revered in Venezuela like
Michael Jordan is in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``He cannot walk down the street,'' Perez said. ``Everybody
wants to talk to him, everybody wants to touch him.''
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga grew up in Caracas, the capital, and played for the
most popular team in the Venezuelan winter leagues. He's the
all-time leading home run hitter among Venezuelans who have played
in the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   He came back from a miserable 1992 season to become the first
Venezuelan to win a major league batting title in 1993 with the
Rockies. He did it during terrible economic conditions in
Venezuela, when inflation had nearly doubled.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the face of bad news, he was good news,'' Villasmil said.
``Galarraga with his home runs made us smile. He has gathered all
of us. High class, low class, middle class.''
</P>
<P>
   Villasmil tells a story from 1990 when Galarraga had just
finished playing a winter ball game in Caracas. He was driving in
his Jeep Cherokee when a drunk man stumbled toward his car. He
muttered the words ``picture here.'' Galarraga stopped his he car,
got out, put his arm around the man and broke into one of his
patented smiles for a picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Andres Galarraga,'' Villasmil said. ``He's not a
legend anymore, he's a myth.''
</P>
<P>
   Guillen for one, can't wait to see the fans' reaction to
Galarraga. Galarraga said he was nervous, but in a good way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be pretty special, not only for me but for the group,''
Galarraga said. ``I talked to my brother, my mother, everybody
can't wait to see it. For me (it means) a little more after the
cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga, Perez, Guillen and Venezuelan Braves minor leaguer
Fernando Lunar will help deliver 5,000 pounds of supplies _medical
supplies, food, clothing, and bottled water _ that the Braves are
bringing with them to those left homeless in La Guaira, the worst
hit section of the Venezuelan coast. The Devil Rays are making
similar efforts, and Major League Baseball and the players'
association are chipping in $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   For Guillen, it will be familiar ground. He was among the most
active major league players to help those in need, donating money
from his pocket, using his boat to deliver goods to people, and
bringing children who lost their parents in the flooding into an
orphanage that his foundation runs.
</P>
<P>
   He's hoping to have some of those children join the team on the
field for introductions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might be the only guy who knows how people feel,'' Guillen
said. ``I know what they went through, how much they appreciate
having two teams going here. ... You will see a lot of happy
faces.''
</P>
<P>
   Tickets for the game sold out in two hours when they went on
sale last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my best friends called me (Wednesday night); he had
lost four tickets in the subway,'' Guillen said. ``He almost
committed suicide.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Smith &AMP; Wesson, the nation's oldest and largest
manufacturer of handguns, agreed Friday to accept a wide array of
restrictions on the way it makes, sells and distributes hundreds of
thousands of handguns each year in exchange for ending some
lawsuits that had threatened to bankrupt it.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement represented a major splintering in the powerful
alliance of gunmakers and owners that has thwarted tough gun laws
in Washington and state capitals for years. And it opened a new
avenue for regulating the firearms industry without action from
Congress, where partisan gridlock has stalled even modest
gun-control legislation in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, which was immediately attacked by other
manufacturers Smith &AMP; Wesson will place a second, hidden set of
serial numbers in all its new weapons to make it harder for
criminals to scratch away those identifying marks. The company
promises to sell with each new handgun a small lock that prevents
the trigger from being pulled, something Smith &AMP; Wesson was already
doing. And the agreement requires, within three years, ``smart-gun
technology'' that will allow each of its new handguns to be fired
only by authorized users.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also establishes a ``code of conduct'' for Smith &AMP;
Wesson's authorized dealers and distributors that would prohibit
them _ under threat of losing their franchises _ from selling guns
at gun shows unless the buyers have passed background checks. That
issue is the major sticking point on legislation now stalled in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   And in a provision intended to discourage illegal gun
trafficking, people who buy more than one gun from a Smith &AMP; Wesson
dealer will be allowed to take home just one firearm on the day of
the sale, and will have to return 14 days later to claim the rest.
</P>
<P>
   But the broader impact of the agreement will depend heavily on
whether other major manufacturers follow Smith &AMP; Wesson, which
produces roughly one-tenth of the 2.5 million handguns sold
nationwide each year. Friday, the president of the largest trade
association for gunmakers issued a statement fiercely denouncing
one of his most influential members for breaking ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are confident that no other major manufacturers will desert
this coordinated effort in favor of their own individual deal,''
said Robert Delfay of the National Shooting Sports Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some gun-control advocates raised sharp questions
about the significance of the pact, noting that Smith &AMP; Wesson is
already shipping trigger locks with its hand guns and is already
well on its way to developing smart-gun technology. And they
asserted that the agreement, which exempts weapons sold to
law-enforcement agencies or the military, would be next to
impossible to enforce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than having a Smith &AMP; Wesson person posted in every gun
dealership in America, I don't know how they do it,'' said Kristen
Rand, senior council at the Violence Policy Center in Washington,
which advocates strict gun-control legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, which was negotiated with the help of the Clinton
administration, settled litigation by 15 cities that had sought to
collect damages from Smith &AMP; Wesson for gun violence. In addition,
the administration and the attorney generals of New York state and
Connecticut signed the deal, agreeing not to bring suits against
the company. The agreement does not end litigation by the cities
against other gunmakers.
</P>
<P>
   But 15 other cities and counties that had filed similar suits
had not signed onto the agreement by the end of the day. And while
several of those were expected to join the agreement soon, several
more _ including Chicago, whose mayor, Richard M. Daley, is a
staunch ally of Clinton _ were expected to pursue their suits
against Smith &AMP; Wesson and other manufacturers because the
agreement did not include monetary damages to compensate cities for
the law-enforcement and health-care costs associated with gun
violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``These companies are in the business of making money,'' said
Jennifer Hoyle, a spokeswoman for the Chicago city attorney's
office, whose suit seeks $433 million in damages from the gun
industry. ``Asking for serious financial damages sends a serious
message to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits against the gun industry were patterned after those
brought by cities and states against the tobacco industry. But,
unlike the tobacco industry, which had deep financial pockets and
which was dominated by a handful of big publicly-traded companies,
the gun industry is small and fragmented. There are dozens of small
privately-held gunmakers and the entire industry's revenues total
just around $1.5 billion, making it difficult for plaintiffs to
seek large financial settlements. Already, the threat of litigation
has caused one leading gunmaker, Colt's Manufacturing Co., to stop
making guns for retail sale.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference at the White House, Clinton hailed the
agreement as ``The very first time a gun manufacturer has committed
to fundamentally change the way guns are designed, distributed and
marketed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It says that gunmakers can _ and will _ share in the
responsibility to keep their products out of the wrong hands,''
Clinton said. ``And it says that gunmakers can _ and will _ make
their guns much safer without infringing on anyone's rights.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rand of the Violence Policy Center said that the agreement
contained loopholes that would allow Smith &AMP; Wesson to skirt the
smart-gun technology requirement by marketing its handguns as
collector's items.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very disturbing to us that a gun manufacturer gets credit
for doing what they are already doing and basically obeying the
law,'' Rand said. ``To settle these lawsuits that have put a lot of
pressure on the industry and that had the potential of leading to
real regulations, it was a tremendous step backward.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   David Kairys, a professor of constitutional law at Temple
University who is a consultant for many of the litigants, said he
was disappointed that the agreement did not require Smith &AMP; Wesson
to turn over internal industry documents that might have shed light
on the gun industry's more avaricious marketing techniques.
</P>
<P>
   But Kairys said the agreement was important because it
represented a major crack in a once monolithic industry position
that gun manufacturers had no responsibility for the violence
caused by guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I view it as generally positive, because this represents a
break with the past'' Kairys said. ``Smith &AMP; Wesson is the biggest
manufacturer and they are making some changes. They are at least
recognizing that what they do in marketing and distribution have an
effect on crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said they thought that the
Smith &AMP; Wesson deal would have a domino affect on the industry,
just as the decision by the Liggett Group, a cigarette maker, to
settle a class-action lawsuit in 1996 pressured other tobacco
companies to reach settlements.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, which came together in just the past two days,
was announced by Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and Housing
Secretary Andrew Cuomo, whose departments helped in the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The cities and counties that signed the agreement included New
Orleans, which brought the first suit, St. Louis, Bridgeport,
Conn., Newark, N.J., Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami-Dade County,
Atlanta and Detroit. The communities that refused to join the
agreement include, in addition to Chicago, Camden County, N.J., and
Wayne County, Mich.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   During Friday's news conference, Cuomo and the other officials
went out of their way to praise Smith &AMP; Wesson's chief executive,
Ed Schulz, for signing the agreement in the face of intense
opposition from other gunmakers. Smith &AMP; Wesson has faced boycotts
from gun-owners groups in the past for voluntarily accepting gun
restrictions, and Cuomo said there were concerns that the company
would face similar repercussions this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``To boycott a company for responsible corporate citizenship and
a prudent business judgment to end a litigation risk would be
absurd,'' he said. ``I also believe there will be a flip side,
which is, educated consumers will say this is a responsible company
worth dealing dealing with.''
</P>
<P>
   One possible method of rewarding Smith &AMP; Wesson was raised by
New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, who has begun urging
governors and big-city majors to buy guns solely from companies
that accept the code of conduct outlined in Friday's agreement.
</P>
<P>
   For the past week, President Clinton has been embroiled in a
vicious battle of words with Wayne LaPierre, the executive vice
president for the National Rifle Association. Clinton has hammered
the group for blocking gun-control legislation, while LaPierre has
accused the president of responsibility for the death of a college
basketball coach who was killed with an illegally acquired gun.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Cuomo suggested that the heated oratory had helped
create a climate that made it easier to prod Smith &AMP; Wesson into an
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you put the tragedies that we have seen in recent weeks
together with the gridlock in Washington and then the NRA's
hyperbole and rhetoric, the only positive outcome was going to be
through negotiations,'' Cuomo said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the NRA said the group would have no comment
Friday on the agreement.

 &HT;    Former Atlanta minister at center of House flap
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Rev. Charles Wright is at the center of an
unprecedented political feud over his appointment to become House
chaplain.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute has nothing to do with prayer and everything to do
with politics.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert's selection of Wright over a
Catholic priest who had more votes on a bipartisan selection
committee has unleashed a torrent of criticism of the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   There was been only one Catholic chaplain in the 211-year
history of the House, and none in modern times.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic Republican lawmakers and Democrats want to know why the
Rev. Timothy O'Brien _ a Catholic priest and professor at Marquette
University who had the most support on the bipartisan panel _ was
passed over in favor of someone who finished lower on the finalist
list.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute over the House chaplain continues amid other charges
of anti-Catholicism in the Republican Party. George W. Bush drew
criticism last month for speaking at Bob Jones University, a
conservative Protestant college in South Carolina known for its
hostility toward the Catholic Church. Bush later apologized for not
criticizing the anti-Catholic policy during his visit.
</P>
<P>
   Those two episodes are now testing the ties between the
Republican Party's Catholic and evangelical Christian branches.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the Democrats are exploiting the situation for all
that it's worth.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the Republicans are charging that the Democrats are
unfairly portraying the GOP as anti-Catholic in an attempt to win
back Catholic votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a desperate Democratic Party that is dividing people
based on religion,'' said Ralph Reed, former head of the Christian
Coalition and now a political consultant at Atlanta-based Century
Strategies.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party has more Catholics than it has ever had,
Reed said. To say that the GOP is anti-Catholic is disingenuous at
best.
</P>
<P>
   But the controversy has practically paralyzed House Republican
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert has indefinitely postponed the House vote to confirm
Wright out of concern that it would split his own caucus. Such a
split would surely help Democrats in the upcoming fall elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speaker has set up a bipartisan process and he wants
bipartisan results,'' said John Feehery, spokesperson for Hastert.
``This is what happens when you try to do good deeds in the House
of Representatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.), a member of the selection
committee, said the GOP has only the GOP to blame for the
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The issue erupted only after Hastert and Majority Leader Dick
Armey (R-Texas) ignored the panel's recommendation, Waxman said.
Until that point, the committee had worked in an unusually
bipartisan fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican leadership has a big problem with the chaplain
issue and it's all their own making,'' Waxman said. ``They chose
the guy who barely made the list. That's no one else's fault but
their own.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Wright and O'Brien declined to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   The vote tallies from the committee show that Wright had almost
no support among the nine Democrats on the selection panel. By
comparison, O'Brien had a majority of Democrats and Republicans
favoring his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert and Armey have both defended their choice, saying when
they interviewed the final three candidates they were unaware of
the vote tallies. They say they simply selected the person who
would do the best job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes the truth is the truth,'' Feehery said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats and Republicans say they find that a little hard
to believe.
</P>
<P>
   Even the conservative Catholic League for Religious and Civil
Rights smells a ``fix.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's painfully apparent that the House leadership has made a
gigantic mess over this,'' said Patrick Scully, director of
communications for the league's 350,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an odor of anti-Catholicism here and there is
speculation that Wright was chosen to placate the evangelical
Christian groups in Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Scully said the Republican leadership was told that O'Brien had
the most support on the selection panel. ``For the speaker and the
majority leader to maintain they didn't know is dishonest,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.), a Methodist who attended Georgetown
University Law School, a Catholic institution, said this boils down
to the Democrats blowing the issue up for political gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never in the history of the House has one party chosen to make
the chaplain a partisan issue,'' Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert went out of his way to involve the Democrats in the
selection process, Barr said. ``I'm not sure how much lower
(Democrats) could sink.''
</P>
<P>
   But not all Republicans see it in the same light. Republicans
from Catholic-heavy districts are concerned about how the
controversy will play out at home.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent meeting between Hastert and about 35 House
Republican Catholics, the issue was ``huge,'' said Rep. Greg Ganske
(R-Iowa), who attended.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this isn't handled right, it could prove the difference in
marginal districts,'' Ganske said.
</P>
<P>
   Ganske believes Wright should withdraw from the process. He said
the post should become a rotating job filled with people from all
faiths.
</P>
<P>
   Ganske does not think Hastert and Armey are anti-Catholic. He
thinks they merely ``selected the same old, same old,'' namely a
Protestant.

COMPUTER EXPERTS FLOCK TO PRODUCT MADE FOR RANK AMATEURS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)  (mk) 
 By AMY HARMON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since it was founded just over a year ago, a Texas company
called Netpliance has spent millions of dollars to reach its target
market: nontechnical folks who want a simple, inexpensive device to
connect them to the Internet without a full-fledged personal
computer.
</P>
<P>
   So it came as a not necessarily welcome surprise this week when
an insatiable demand for its product emerged from the technical
folks. For an extra $100 in parts, an electronics engineer in Las
Vegas figured out how to tweak the $99 terminal, designed solely to
serve as an Internet appliance, so that it works like a fancy PC.
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday, he shared his discovery on a Web site called
Slashdot, a gathering spot for computer engineers whose masthead
reads ``News for Nerds.'' Within a few hours, tinkerers across the
country were trooping into Circuit City outlets _ the only retail
chain selling Netpliance's device, the I-Opener _and jamming the
company's toll-free telephone line.
</P>
<P>
   The unanticipated demand might sound like good news for the
company. But under its razors-and-razorblades business model, it
loses money on each machine it sells. Profits are expected to come
from the $21.95 it charges customers each month to connect to its
Internet service _ a service the hobbyists are not interested in.
</P>
<P>
   And with the device in short supply _ many Circuit City outlets
say they are sold out _ unmodified I-openers are now being resold
on the eBay auction site, with bids exceeding $250. ``This is the
one you can hack!'' one seller wrote. ``Get it before they fix
it!!''
</P>
<P>
   The attention was not of the sort Netpliance was looking for
this week as it prepared an initial public offering. Its stock,
priced at $18, began trading Friday and closed at $22.0625.
</P>
<P>
   Kent Savage, Netpliance's chief executive officer, said the
company was not worried, although it is following the activities of
its new fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We welcome the interest of the technical community,'' Savage
said. ``If this becomes a problem, we will do what we need to stop
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The $99 introductory price is scheduled to rise to $199 after
Father's Day, but even that will not approach the cost of
production, estimated by analysts at $300 to $400.
</P>
<P>
   In a testament to the Internet's capacity to quickly establish a
collective wisdom, the Web has been flooded in recent days with
tips and diagrams illustrating the cheap but technically delicate
operation that turns the I-opener into a computer that can run word
processing programs and play digital music files.
</P>
<P>
   Netpliance's unlikely new customer base even came up with a
nickname for the sleek device: ``I-opened-it.''
</P>
<P>
   Netpliance officials said its Internet service had attracted
14,000 subscribers since it started shipping the product in
November. The amateur modification army estimates that those in
their ranks have placed up to 3,000 orders in one week, based on
the postings in their clogged chat rooms and e-mail lists.
</P>
<P>
   Aimed at computer novices, the Netpliance service, which has
been well received by industry reviewers, includes features like a
button to order pizza online and a light that glows like an
answering machine when a subscriber gets an e-mail message. The
machine requires no time to ``boot up'' _ users simply turn it on
and off like a television.
</P>
<P>
   But the computer jockeys lining up to buy the I-opener have no
interest in all that. And those who have bought it through Circuit
City have not been obliged to sign up for the monthly Internet
service. For those ordering directly, Netpliance this week started
billing the first month's access along with the purchase of the
machine, but consumers are free to cancel after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people buy the boxes for the subsidized cost without buying
the service, that's tough on their business model,'' said Bryan Ma,
an analyst at IDC Research. ``But opening up the box and
hard-wiring cables requires expertise that most consumers are not
going to have.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Segler, the 36-year-old Las Vegas engineer who started it
all, has rooms full of computers, videogames and other gadgets that
he has opened up and modified over the years. He bought his
I-opener when he chanced to spot it last month during a visit to
Circuit City, where he was purchasing a digital video disk player.
</P>
<P>
   Within two hours of bringing the machine home, he said, he had
attached an extra hard drive he had lying around with a cable that
he modified to fit into the device's motherboard. He set up a Web
site to describe how he did it, and began selling the cables for
$35. So far, he reports about 200 orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest part,'' he said, ``was opening it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it seems there is little danger that average consumers
will be willing or able to wield screwdrivers and solder cables to
fashion a cheap computer, the implications of the modified I-opener
have attracted widespread interest.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Carvin, who heads the efforts of the Benton Foundation to
address inequity in computer access, e-mailed an article on the
subject from the Wired News site to the organization's ``digital
divide'' mailing list.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a device that opens up new possibilities for people who
can't afford computers but have the skills as tinkerers,'' he said.
``It's clearly not a solution for everyone, but I can see it being
used by clubs and schools for science projects to make computers
available for children who can't afford one at home. I know a lot
of students who would love to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who have experimented with the modified device say it is
equivalent to a 150-megahertz Pentium machine _ far less powerful
than most PCs shipping today, but with its modem and LCD screen,
still a bargain. Most of the technicians fiddling with I-openers
are less interested in saving money, though, than in the thrill of
transforming a machine designed for one purpose into something
entirely different.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Tetzlaff, 24, of Parma, Ohio, for instance, intends to use
his in the console of his 1979 Ford Bronco as a combination global
positioning system interface and digital music player. He had spent
over $400 in the last month building his own prototype of such a
device.
</P>
<P>
   ``At $99, even if you mess up the unit, it's worth it just for
getting into it and trying to modify it and adapt it to your
purpose,'' said Tetzlaff, whose mailing list for the community of
modifiers has grown to 600 members, including several from Sweden,
in a week. ``Really the bang-for-the-buck ratio is way too good to
pass up.''

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, March 18:
</P>
<P>
   The White House responded smartly Friday to the recent election
of a moderate Iranian parliament by lifting some economic sanctions
and hinting that more might follow. Tehran must make the next move
by dropping its resistance to direct government-to-government talks
with Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. actions, outlined by Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, end a ban on the import of Iranian food and handicrafts,
accelerate talks on resolving competing financial claims going back
to the 1979 Iranian revolution and ease licensing rules for
cultural and academic exchanges. Food and handicraft exports like
caviar, pistachio nuts and carpets bring in far less revenue than
oil exports, which remain barred. But Albright implied that other
steps could come if Iran responds positively, including
reconsideration of a prohibition on U.S. investment in Iran's oil
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The reform coalition around President Mohammad Khatami has an
ambitious domestic agenda that includes working out a reallocation
of power with conservative clerical authorities, reviving Iran's
economy and restoring rule of law. Until now, the reformers have
been skittish about taking on sensitive foreign policy issues like
mending ties with Washington. But Albright's proposals demonstrate
the domestic advantages to be gained from less strained relations
with the United States. Food and handicraft exports to America can
generate millions of jobs, helping the reformers reduce Iran's
dangerously high unemployment rate. A successful conclusion to the
claims talks could also free assets needed for development.
</P>
<P>
   As Albright noted, conservative clerical leaders still exercise
great power. There can be no normal ties, and probably no lifting
of oil sanctions, until the clerically controlled Revolutionary
Guards and intelligence agencies sever their ties with terrorism
and the military abandons its efforts to develop nuclear weapons.
Albright also drew a proper link between human rights issues and
future improvements in relations with Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has now offered a gesture of friendship, including a
frank acknowledgment of past U.S. policy mistakes toward Iran. With
his strengthened political hand at home, Khatami should do his part
to ease an estrangement that serves neither America's interests nor
Iran's.

GUN MAKER'S DECISION ON SAFETY GETS MIXED REACTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (With GUNS-SMITH) 
(lb) 
 By LESLIE WAYNE and FOX BUTTERFIELD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Smith &AMP; Wesson's decision to adopt gun-safety measures in order
to settle lawsuits brought by state and federal agencies has set
off criticism within the gun industry and a debate among
handgun-control advocates.
</P>
<P>
   To many other gun manufacturers, the decision by the United
States' largest gun maker was seen as a betrayal that would only
alienate customers and could make Smith &AMP; Wesson an industry
outcast.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, gun-control advocates were mixed in their
views. Some said that the agreement, which ends litigation against
the company brought by the federal government and at least 11
cities, was an important first step toward ending gun violence.
Others said the agreement was filled with loopholes that Smith &AMP;
Wesson could easily exploit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that a fair number of Smith &AMP; Wesson customers will no
longer want to purchase their products because of this agreement,
and they will lose market share,'' said Jeff Reh, general counsel
at Beretta USA Corp., a gun maker based in Accokeek, Md. ``A lot of
gun owners will see this agreement as a betrayal of their Second
Amendment rights and a capitulation to the Clinton administration
gun-control agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many in the industry, as well as some of the cities
that brought suit against Smith &AMP; Wesson and that were not part of
the agreement, were taken by surprise. Lawsuits have been brought
against a number of gun manufacturers by 28 cities and counties to
hold them responsible for the damage done by their products and to
improve gun safety. Discussions between the two sides to resolve
the lawsuits have been under way since late last year.
</P>
<P>
   Among those sharply critical of the settlement was the National
Shooting Sports Foundation, the gun-industry trade group. In a
statement, the foundation said: ``The decision by foreign-owned
handgun manufacturer Smith &AMP; Wesson to forge an agreement with the
most anti-gun administration in our nation's history has violated a
trust with their customers and with the entire firearms industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundation also said Smith &AMP; Wesson had taken ``initiatives
that have been discussed in confidential industry talks and run off
and cut their own deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert T. Delfay, chief executive of the foundation, said he
believed that no other gun manufacturer would follow Smith &AMP;
Wesson's lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smart gun companies have said that making a deal with a
half-dozen cities won't save my hide one bit,'' Delfay said in an
interview. ``And it could even exacerbate the situation. So that's
why I don't believe you will see other companies signing on or
striking other independent deals.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that even if gun makers like Smith &AMP; Wesson settled
some lawsuits, ``hundreds more could come down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why the industry is interested in a unified national
solution,'' he said, ``not a piecemeal solution, like this is.''
</P>
<P>
   Gun-control advocates had mixed views on the agreement's impact.
Stephen P. Teret, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun
Policy and Research, said that ``for the first time the gun
industry has admitted it has the capacity to do much better in the
design and distribution of guns'' and that in doing so, ``it
undercuts the industry argument traditionally used in litigation,
which has always been that these things are impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   But Teret said it was unclear whether other manufacturers would
follow. ``Some manufacturers will be scrambling to get in on the
deal,'' he said. ``Others, because of the macho culture of the
industry, will try to tough it out, and they will suffer severe
punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Kristen Rand, director of federal policy at the Violence Policy
Center, a gun-control advocacy group, predicted that Smith &AMP; Wesson
would suffer for this agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a firestorm in the industry in which every other
manufacturer will treat Smith &AMP; Wesson as a pariah,'' Rand said.
``In the gun culture, Clinton equals Satan and they will see that
Smith has just made a deal with Satan.''
</P>
<P>
   Other gun-control advocates were less harsh. Garen Wintemute,
director of the Violence Prevention Center at the University of
California at Davis, said the agreement had important provisions
about the distributions of guns.
</P>
<P>
   Among them are provisions that prevent Smith &AMP; Wesson from
releasing guns for sale before background checks on potential
buyers are completed, and requirements that Smith &AMP; Wesson
employees have additional training and that new record-keeping data
be made available to law-enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This falls short of what needs to be done to adequately
regulate the industry,'' Wintemute said, ``but it's a good first
step.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There have been years when Mayor Rudolph Giuliani had
the political stage of the St. Patrick's Day parade in New York
City virtually to himself. Not Friday. For the first time, Giuliani
had to share Fifth Avenue with the woman who has inserted herself
into his political life, Hillary Rodham Clinton _ but who was booed
more than cheered as she strode up the center of Manhattan in a
mid-March snowstorm.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clinton waved happily to the crowds and announced shortly
before the bagpipes started that ``it is just a great pleasure to
be here as a New Yorker.''
</P>
<P>
   To which the mayor almost immediately retorted: `Oh my goodness!
That's interesting. That's interesting! I hope she knows the way. I
hope she doesn't get lost on one of the side streets.''
</P>
<P>
   The St. Patrick's Day parade has always been a must stop for
candidates on New York's political circuit, but Friday it turned
into the Rudy and Hillary show as the two contenders for the U.S.
Senate marched in separate contingents on a raw day that turned the
knees of bare-legged majorettes bright red. They also held dueling
news conferences on Fifth Avenue, one block and 15 minutes apart,
and sat several pews apart in St. Patrick's Cathedral at the same
Mass, without the ailing Cardinal John O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal's absence dampened the parade _ ``I felt terrible
about the cardinal not being there,'' the mayor said _ as did
weather that reduced the crowd in kilts, Irish knit sweaters and
green hair to only one or two deep as the procession reached 86th
Street, the end of the route. But the stalwarts were there, among
them Mary Clifford, a 59-year-old statistical analyst at IBM, who
has been standing on the same corner of Fifth Avenue and 86th
Street on St. Patrick's Day for the last 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I used to watch the parade downtown near 59th Street,
there were too many drunks, so I came up here and I've been
standing here ever since,'' said Clifford, of Little Falls, N.J.
``Every year it's special because being Irish is more than green
beer and green bagels; it's this parade. The parade is a
manifestation of our pride in our heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the two Senate candidates provided a new focus this year,
even though they never got close to each other. But they did speak
through sound bites relayed by reporters in the moving scrimmages
following them up Fifth Avenue. ``Maybe I can show her the way to
Chappaqua,'' Giuliani cracked.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's press contingent was bigger than the mayor's, but so
were her jeers. Many came from freezing watchers who shouted out
for her to ``Go home!'' even though a number were themselves not
from New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go back to Arkansas!'' yelled Patrick Bermingham, a cemetery
groundskeeper from North Arlington, N.J., as Clinton clambered into
her waiting black van at the end of the parade route at 86th Street
and Madison Avenue. Outside the Plaza Hotel, a small group of gay
protesters shouted ``Shame! Shame!'' as Clinton passed, angry at
her participation in a parade that bars an organization of gay and
lesbian Irish-Americans from marching under their own banner.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, dressed in a black raincoat and a sea-green scarf at
her neck, smiled cheerfully back as supporters marching with her
yelled out ``We love Hillary!'' to drown out the jeers.
</P>
<P>
   One of those with the first lady was former Mayor Edward I.
Koch, who pronounced the Irish ``a lovely, gracious and supportive
people,'' said that the boos ``test her mettle'' and called
Giuliani ``bush league'' and ``a doofus'' for making fun of the
first lady's ability to navigate New York's streets. Others in
Clinton's entourage included a large group of Secret Service agents
_ more than the usual _ who constantly looked up at the spectators
watching from the buildings lining one of New York's busiest
streets.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of Irish-Americans and Irish fans clearly belonged to
the mayor, although many of them were also from out of town. ``Oh
my God!'' said a thrilled Amy Converse, a 27-year-old Montessori
teacher from West Palm Beach, Fla., who was standing at 47th Street
and Fifth Avenue when the mayor ran over to greet people on the
sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love what he's done for the city,'' Converse added. ``It's
my first time here, and I feel very safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, dressed in a green vest, green tie and green baseball
cap, began marching near the start of the parade around 11 a.m.
with a contingent of New York City Police officers, whom he
vigorously defended after another police shooting of an unarmed
black man in Manhattan early Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``You really have to give the police a break,'' the mayor said
to reporters at his news briefing on Fifth Avenue at 44th Street,
before the parade. ``These are men and women that are out there
protecting us.'' He added, ``Let's give them at least the benefit
that most of you usually give common criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who spoke minutes later at her own news conference on
Fifth Avenue at 43rd Street, was more measured. ``I would think all
of us are concerned about another police shooting, and we'll wait
to see the investigation and results of that investigation,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton defended her participation in a parade that excludes the
gay organization. ``When you're in public life, you have to balance
a lot of different values, and today we're marching on behalf of
Irish-Americans and in favor of the peace process,'' she said. But
she also said that ``I would hope that this parade would become
inclusive'' and ``I will certainly speak out for that.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton finished marching, she went back to the White
House for a reception with Irish leaders, including Prime Minister
Bertie Ahern and Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn Fein, who were
in Washington for Northern Ireland peace settlement talks. When
Giuliani finished marching, he remarched the route, as he usually
does, three more times, with contingents from the Fire Department,
the sanitation workers and his alma mater, Manhattan College.

'98 SWISSAIR CRASH INQUIRY SEES COCKPIT MAP LIGHT AS SPARK SOURCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Canadian investigators looking into the deadly
crash of Swissair 111 in 1998 say a pilot's map light, built into
the cockpit ceiling, may be a source of ignition in that model
airplane.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing responded by urging airlines flying that model to make
frequent checks until the light can be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration is considering whether to
make that procedure mandatory. Boeing also told the airlines to
install fire-resistant tape to protect insulation.
</P>
<P>
   The point is moot for Canadian regulators because there are no
planes of that model, the MD-11, registered in that country. They
found the problem by inspecting MD-11s outside Canada that were
being stripped down for maintenance. The MD-11s were made by
McDonnell Douglas, which Boeing has acquired.
</P>
<P>
   But Canadian officials say they are still far from determining
the cause of the crash, which killed 129 people off Nova Scotia.
``We haven't ruled out anything, yet,'' Jim Harris, a spokesman for
Canada's Transportation Safety Board said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   He said following the discovery of the problem, investigators in
a military base began sorting through boxes of fractured debris to
see if they could find the map light from the plane that crashed.
</P>
<P>
   In the months since the crash, the Transportation Safety Board's
most important recommendation has been to reduce the amount of
material on board that can fuel a fire, by replacing the
insulation. It has also called for looking into another potential
cause of fire, wiring near the main cabin door, which it said could
be damaged and provide a spark.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the crash, the crew reported smoke in the
cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   Examinations of about a dozen MD-11s still in service have found
various problems with the lights, including heat damage of the
adjacent insulation. The Transportation Safety Board has
recommended replacing the insulation, and some of the damage from
map lights was found by airlines doing that work.
</P>
<P>
   The lights use halogen bulbs, which operate at hotter
temperatures than standard incandescents.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Boeing, Laurie Gunter, said that the lights
are used on other planes and elsewhere on the MD-11, but that the
damage has only been observed in the captain's and first officer's
map lights.

U.S. MAKES OVERTURE TO IRAN, LIFTING BAN ON SOME IMPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to expand and rewrite throughout, e.g, Tehran reaction,

 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright ended a
narrow slice of America's economic sanctions against Iran on
Friday, and declared a commitment to take extensive steps toward
ending two decades of hostility ``if Iran indicates a desire and
commitment to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Her comments describing a map for normalizing economic ties came
in a speech on Friday that Clinton administration officials
described as their most explicit overture to the moderates who
triumphed in Iran's parliamentary elections last month.
</P>
<P>
   Without specifying them, Albright held out the prospect of
ending such sanctions as the bans on American investment in Iran's
oil industry and the blocking of large loans to Tehran by the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   But she made no mention of a resumption of full diplomatic
relations.
</P>
<P>
   In Tehran, the Iranian government issued a muted but moderately
positive response.
</P>
<P>
   Albright also acknowledged _ without apologizing _ a variety of
American errors in past dealings with Iran, including Washington's
support of the 1953 coup that restored Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi
to power, and of Iraq during its war with Iran in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Albright made clear that forces in Iran that she
said support terrorism and try to obtain nuclear weapons technology
would have to loosen their hold on the security apparatus before
there would be a deeper removal of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions ended on Friday are chiefly symbolic, and aimed at
small businesses. The United States will end restrictions on
Iranian-made carpets _ a law that was widely flouted anyway _ and
reduce prohibitive tariffs on pistachios and caviar. Those areas
were chosen, Albright said, ``to show the millions of Iranian
craftsmen, farmers and fishermen who work in these industries, and
the Iranian people as a whole, that the United States bears them no
ill will.''
</P>
<P>
   But she acknowledged that it would take more than pistachio
diplomacy to remove what President Mohammad Khatami _ whose
moderation she praised at some length _ calls the ``wall of
mistrust.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To date, the political developments in Iran have not caused
its military to cease its determined effort to acquire the
technology, materials and assistance needed to develop nuclear
weapons,'' she said. Nor have the intelligence services chosen ``to
get out of the terrorism business,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until these policies change,'' she continued, ``fully normal
ties between our governments will not be possible and our principal
sanctions will remain.''
</P>
<P>
   Under American law, for instance, Washington cannot support
loans for Iran through the IMF or the World Bank until Iran is
removed from the State Department's terrorism list.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's speech received mixed reviews in Congress, just as
small overtures toward Cuba and North Korea have in recent months.
Sen. Connie Mack of Florida, a Republican, called the
administration's move ``unprincipled'' and said ``American victims
of terrorism deserve justice, not pistachios and caviar.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Pat Roberts, a Republican who represents the farm state
of Kansas, said: ``A failed U.S. sanctions policy has forced Iran
to purchase a substantial amount of commodities from our
competitors.'' He urged a far greater removal of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department took some unusual steps to amplify its
message in Iran. It faxed advance copies of Albright's speech to
the pro-reform newspapers that have blossomed in Tehran, to enable
them to print the text in their Saturday issues.
</P>
<P>
   The Iranian government was also briefed in advance, and
afterward the Foreign Ministry spokesman, Hamid Reza Asefi, said:
``We welcome the ability to export Iranian foodstuff and carpets
and see it as positive,'' according to a report from the country's
official news agency, IRNA.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Washington, however, Hadi Nejad Hosseinian, Iran's
representative to the United Nations, said that while his country
would find a way to reciprocate for Albright's gesture, ``these
steps, as important as they may be, are insufficient'' to bring
about official talks between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has periodically made modest moves to reach
out to moderates in Iran, but Khatami has been locked in a struggle
with hardliners who appear to control the security apparatus, and
the gestures have not borne fruit.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Albright's effort to convey a new openness to Iran, without
offering many concrete concessions, came after what senior
officials said was a long debate in the State Department and the
National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone recognized that there had been a massive change in
the internal dynamics in Iran,'' one official said, ``but good as
the changes have been internally, they have not affected those with
the levers of power on the issues of greatest importance to us _
terrorism and weapons of mass destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Another element of that debate, officials said, centered on how
Albright should word her description of America's troubled
encounters with Iran throughout the Cold War. She chose, in the
end, to acknowledge the facts and hint at American wrongdoing or
errors of judgment, but to neither apologize nor explain.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1953, the United States played a significant role in
orchestrating the overthrow of Iran's popular prime minister,
Mohammad Mossadegh,'' she told the audience, touching briefly and
lightly on what almost everyone in her audience of
Iranian-Americans knew as Operation Ajax, the Central Intelligence
Agency's first major success in overthrowing a foreign government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Eisenhower administration believed its actions were
justified for strategic reasons,'' she continued. ``But the coup
was clearly a setback for Iran's political development. And it is
easy to see now why many Iranians continue to resent this
intervention by America in their internal affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the overthrow, the Mossadegh government had acted to
legalize the Iranian Communist Party, and had also nationalized the
Anglo-Iranian Oil Co.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to go ahead with the coup was made by Allen Dulles,
the first head of the postwar CIA, and his brother, John Foster
Dulles, the secretary of state at the time. And it was executed
chiefly by Kermit Roosevelt, a grandson of Theodore Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   While Friday's reference to those events fell far short of an
apology, it appears to be the closest to one any senior American
official has publicly offered.
</P>
<P>
   Albright also briefly acknowledged that the shah, installed
after the coup, ``brutally repressed political dissent.'' And she
added, with a reference to the president of Iraq, that ``aspects of
U.S. policy toward Iraq during its conflict with Iran appear now to
have been regrettably shortsighted, especially in light of our
subsequent experiences with Saddam Hussein.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Among those in the audience Friday was Robert C. McFarlane, the
national security adviser under President Reagan, who made a secret
trip to Iran in 1986 bearing a key-shaped cake and a Bible in a
failed effort to get Iran to use its influence to win the release
of hostages held in Lebanon by Iranian-backed Shiites.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better late than never,'' McFarlane said of Friday's
initiative. ``This is not an administration known for
risk-taking.'' He said he assumed that Iran must have made ``some
private assurances'' to the United States about cutting off support
for terrorist groups.
</P>
<P>
   Among the issues left deliberately vague in the speech was how
to handle financial disputes between the countries that date back
to the taking of American hostages in Tehran in 1979. At the time,
Iranian assets in the United States were frozen.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, a tribunal set up at The Hague has resolved a number
of disputes. But others remain, such as the issue of reimbursing
Iran for American military equipment that was never delivered, and
the disposition of diplomatic properties in the United States. Iran
puts the value of what it terms ``frozen assets'' _ the United
States does not use that phrase _ at upwards of $10 billion, while

AOL TO BUY OUT BERTELSMANN IN THEIR JOINT VENTURES IN EUROPE,
AUSTRALIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ America Online Inc. will purchase Bertelsmann AG's 50
percent stake in their joint ventures AOL Europe and AOL Australia
for more than $8 billion, the companies said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Such a move had been expected ever since AOL reached a deal to
acquire Time Warner Inc. in January for $165 billion. The deal
would put the combined companies in direct competition with
Bertelsmann, a leading global media conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
   Bertelsmann will continue a relationship with AOL through a
four-year agreement that makes the German media company a preferred
content provider for AOL.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said they were not surprised by the Bertelsmann sale
because the AOL-Time Warner deal had put the German company in an
awkward position. After the merger was announced in January, Thomas
Middelhoff, chairman of Bertelsmann, stepped down from the board of
AOL, saying ``you can't have a competitor sitting on the board.''
</P>
<P>
   However, in a conference call with reporters, Stephen M. Case,
chief executive of AOL, said the Time Warner merger was not the
reason for Friday's deal. ``The discussions happened well before we
had serious discussions with Time Warner,'' he said. Case also said
the rationale for buying out Bertelsmann's stake in the joint
ventures was simply strategic. ``Guiding people on the Internet is
our core business. We really need maximum flexibility to do this
around the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For Bertelsmann, a closely held company controlled by the family
of Reinhard Mohn, the sale will provide a cash infusion that it can
use to expand its other Internet holdings.

 Doughnuts Are on Dessert Menus All Over the Place  &HT;     By Sylvia Rubin 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
The last time Joyce Thomas ate a doughnut was four years ago. On
Thursday night at Gordon's House of Fine Eats in San Francisco, she
had another.
<P>
   ``Doughnuts are something you eat by yourself and you don't
admit it to anyone,'' said Thomas, who was celebrating her birthday
at the restaurant. ``It's pretty gutsy to put them on a dessert
menu. I think it's fabulous.''
</P>
<P>
   Out of the strip malls and into some of the finest dining
establishments in the country, the lowly doughnut has evolved into
the coolest dessert around.
</P>
<P>
   Hot, yeasty doughnuts dusted in cinnamon and sugar have been
served at the exalted French Laundry in Yountville since opening
day four years ago _ so don't even think about calling them trendy,
said chef Thomas Keller. ``I hate that word.''
</P>
<P>
   Too late. The treats are on dessert menus all over the place,
including Le Cirque 2000 in New York, don't you know, and at least
a half-dozen upscale restaurants in the Bay Area. Last Thursday,
Peter Jennings and his crew were at Spago in Palo Alto to cover the
stylishness of it all.
</P>
<P>
   The trend may have had its start in the early '90s after Keller,
considered one of the best chefs in the country, created a
cinnamon-sugar doughnut dessert for a prestigious James Beard
dinner. But credit ultimately must go to the Krispy Kreme doughnut
chain. On the rebound from enormous debt, the Winston-Salem, N.C.
company opened a shop in downtown Manhattan in 1996 that quickly
became a shrine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great thing about Krispy Kremes,'' Keller said, ``is that
when they are warm, it's like eating cream. That richness in your
mouth. The pure richness.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, stop. ``They melt in your mouth. I can eat two or three in a
heartbeat.'' More about arteries later.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've worked hard all day, it's nice to sit down with
something that reminds you of your mom and when life was easier,''
said pastry chef Anna Niederholzer of Gordon's, who created a
heaping plate of six doughnut varieties ($9). The Black Cat in San
Francisco serves ping pong ball-sized doughnut holes covered in
powdered sugar with a hint of orange ($6).
</P>
<P>
   At Gordon's the other night, Monica Cardanini-Callahan, there
with her mother, Linda, pulled apart the sticky and sugary
Pennsylvania funnel cake and licked her fingers. ``You can call
them doughnuts, but these are not doughnuts,'' Cardanini-Callahan
said. ``They're not Winchell's, that's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hands-on eating,'' said Kelly Slaven, who was at Gordon's
with three friends. ``We've all been so health conscious lately.
We're done with healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Go ahead, eat a couple. A month. That's nutritionist Carol
Potter's recommendation, a woman who apparently rarely takes leave
of her senses. ``Pay attention to good nutrition, but you don't
need to be vehement about it,'' said Potter, the director of
nutritional services at the University of California at San
Francisco. ``Lighten up. Enjoy life a little.''
</P>
<P>
   Every culture has its version of fried dough, said Jacques
Torres, the pastry chef at Le Cirque 2000 in New York. His version
is based on the Italian bombolini. ``I sent another pastry chef to
Italy to take a look at how they are made, and now we make them
here the way they are made in Italy.'' His fried brioche doughnuts
are filled with a bit of raspberry or apricot jelly and served with
whipped pastry cream and kirsch ($10). They are served piping hot,
with a drizzle of zabaglione. Torres put them on the menu four
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Spago's doughnuts, available as a special dessert item for a
little over a year, are also made of fried brioche and filled with
white chocolate mascarpone, rolled in vanilla sugar and served with
strawberries sauteed in Grand Marnier with candied orange ice cream
on the side ($8.50).
</P>
<P>
   ``They're fun and whimsical,'' said Spago's pastry chef
Christine Law.

 _ SF CHRON  
 Krispy Kreme Plant Opening in Bay Area  &HT;     By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Bobbling along in a lake of hot oil, a platoon of half-cooked
doughnuts makes the rounds of the Krispy Kreme doughnut machine.
<P>
   Each day, in rows of six, hundreds of thousands of doughnuts
spend exactly two minutes in the fryer, then undergo a dousing of
liquid sugar glaze.
</P>
<P>
   The result: 1.5-ounce rings of oil, sugar and flour that have
appeared in more than 80 movies and television shows, from Rosie
O'Donnell to ``Primary Colors,'' and attracted a cult following
hundreds of miles from their Southern roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the best little glazed doughnuts I've ever had in my
life,'' said San Francisco resident Venetia Washington. ``Whenever
I visit my family in Alabama, I take an extra trunk to bring back
Krispy Kremes.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting next week, Washington will be able to get her fix
closer to home. The Bay Area's first Krispy Kreme shop opens
Tuesday in the Union Landing Shopping Center, across from an
Albertson's supermarket. Mountain View and Sacramento locations are
slated to open this summer, and the company is scouting for sites
in San Francisco, the East Bay and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   While not every doughnut lover warms up to Krispy Kremes, dozens
of fans are expected to be in line at 5 a.m. to get the first Hot
Original Glazed rings out of the Union City fryer.
</P>
<P>
   Existing Bay Area doughnut shops, meanwhile, are wondering
exactly how much of a bite Krispy Kreme will take out of the local
doughnut, er, pie.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just a small family business,'' said Rashpal Dhillon,
manager of Dee's Bakery &AMP; Doughnut, an 11-year-old shop located
about a mile from the Krispy Kreme.
</P>
<P>
   Dee's can't afford the staff to operate its fryer all day and
serve doughnuts warm, Dhillon said. ``Time will tell'' what will
happen when the Krispy Kreme opens, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Krispy Kreme Doughnuts Inc., founded in Winston-Salem, N.C., in
the 1930s, sells a hefty dollop of nostalgia with its pastries.
</P>
<P>
   Black-and-white photographs of early Krispy Kreme shops decorate
each store. Orange neon signs reading ``Hot Doughnuts Now'' glow
from the windows, and the company loves to tout the ``secret
recipe'' behind its signature Hot Original Glazed rings that Krispy
Kreme founder Vernon Rudolph bought from a French chef in New
Orleans in 1933.
</P>
<P>
   But Krispy Kreme is no mom-and-pop shop. The 144-store chain,
which generated revenues of $220 million in 1999, expects to net
$52 million in an initial public offering next month, which will
help grease its wheels of growth.
</P>
<P>
   Krispy Kreme (ticker: KREM) is still in its ``infancy,''
according to papers filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. Its goals are ambitious: It hopes to become ``the
recognized leader in every market we enter.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the dough from the IPO will be invested in franchise
joint ventures like the one launching in the Bay Area, which
eventually is expected to open about 25 stores.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Krispy Kreme's advantages, restaurant experts don't
expect the chain to dunk the competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not a doughnut shop, they're a cult,'' said Ron Paul,
a consultant with Technomic Inc., a Chicago firm.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the chain's customers drive miles specifically for
Krispy Kremes. To maintain an aura of specialness, the company
keeps a 10-mile cushion between stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they're going to upset the competitive balance
in new markets,'' said Paul. ``They're still such a small player in
the scheme of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington, a customer service representative for the Internal
Revenue Service, is a good example of the Krispy-Kreme-or-nothing
customer. ``I don't eat doughnuts now because there are no good
doughnuts around here,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   While most doughnuts are cakey and thick, Krispy Kreme's
yeast-raised rings ``are light and small, almost like a stick of
butter melting in your mouth,'' said Washington.
</P>
<P>
   (According to the Chronicle mail scale, a Krispy Kreme glazed
ring's 1.5 ounces compares to 2.4 ounces for its counterpart from a
Union City Yum Yum Doughnut. Each Hot Original Glazed contains 170
calories and 10 grams of fat, Krispy Kreme says.)
</P>
<P>
   Washington plans to trek from San Francisco to Union City once
or twice a week for Krispy Kremes. ``That's just a hop, skip and a
jump on the San Mateo Bridge, not far at all to travel for
something good,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Allison Wallach, doughnut category manager for industry-leader
Dunkin' Donuts, said Krispy Kreme's entry into new markets ``has
helped our business. Because of the PR they put behind a new store
opening, it brings awareness to doughnuts in general.''
</P>
<P>
   The 3,600 Dunkin' Donuts stores have a whopping 77 percent _ and
growing _ market share in the United States, .S.,  &LR; according to
Technomic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't heard of one instance where somebody's closed''
because of a Krispy Kreme moving in, said Brad Bruckman, Krispy
Kreme's Northern California franchisee. ``We'd rather increase the
segment and get people eating more doughnuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales at doughnut specialty stores are rising fast _ 8.5 percent
annually, according to market researcher NPD Group. That should
leave plenty of room for new stores. Krispy Kreme, which operates
in 27 states, accounted for a tiny 3.7 percent of doughnut shop
sales in 1998, according to Technomic.
</P>
<P>
   While Krispy Kreme expands, its growth plans are relatively
modest. The company plans 22 new stores nationwide this year, and
another 100 or so over the next three years, according to the SEC
filing.
</P>
<P>
   That would bring Krispy Kreme's total to 260, the approximate
current size of Orange County's Winchell's Donut Houses.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its long heritage, Krispy Kreme is a company in
transition, and it has suffered from recent missteps.
</P>
<P>
   The doughnut-maker posted a net loss of $3 million in 1998 due
to restructuring costs and the closure of several experimental
``double drive-through'' locations. It has earmarked $30 million
from its IPO to pay off debt.
</P>
<P>
   While Krispy Kreme's sales are growing fast _ revenues rose 22
percent in 1999 _ its margins remain thin. Last year's earnings of
$6 million yielded a shallow net margin of just 2.7 percent of
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Until the mid-1990s, Krispy Kreme stores were more like
wholesale bakeries than sit-down restaurants. In fact, most Krispy
Kreme stores sell doughnuts to grocery stores and other retailers,
something the Northern California stores plan to do eventually.
</P>
<P>
   New stores are designed as ``doughnut theaters'' where customers
can watch their crullers being made.
</P>
<P>
   That means stores like the one in Union City remain unproven,
noted Neil Stern, a restaurant consultant with McMillan/Doolittle.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is certainly some uncertainty'' about the company's
future, Stern said.
</P>
<P>
   A Krispy Kreme spokeswoman declined comment, citing legal
restrictions related to the impending IPO.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Stern says Krispy Kreme's prospects look good. Its daily
sales per store are about $54,000, which is about 50 percent more
than a McDonald's and many multiples higher than the average
doughnut shop, said Stern. ``That's huge, that's unbelievable,
that's an amazing amount of doughnuts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If Krispy Kreme can maintain similar volumes as it expands,
``they should see net margins of 6 to 8 percent, which would make
them the best in the fast-food industry,'' Stern said.
</P>
<P>
   The Union City store will be open 24 hours a day, seven days a
week, and will pump out an extraordinary 650,000 doughnuts daily,
said Bruckman. About 60 percent will be glazed rings while the
remainder will be divided among 14 other varieties.
</P>
<P>
   A Mountain View store is slated to open in July and a Sacramento
location in August.
</P>
<P>
   Bruckman, who is a minority investor in the local franchise
while Krispy Kreme is the majority partner, has been scouting for
sites in San Francisco. But restrictions on drive-through windows
have made it difficult, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The only likely area is in the southern part of the city where
Highway 101 connects with Interstate 280 and Bayshore Boulevard, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not everyone is excited about Krispy Kreme's Bay Area
debut.
</P>
<P>
   Yountville resident Dan Goldberg, a fan of cakey doughnuts and
editor of a food newsletter, described Hot Original Glazed rings as
``a lot of grease with very little substance. It's not a serious
doughnut experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The current issue of Gourmet magazine is no more generous,
referring to ``incomprehensibly overpraised'' Krispy Kreme
doughnuts as ``greasy sinkers. ... cloying and dwarfish, leaden not
long after being cooked, and about as interesting as a brick of
sucrose.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some Krispy Kreme fans see a downside. ``I recently lost
over 100 pounds, so maybe I can only eat two at a time,'' said
Washington. She used to eat six per trip.

SAN FRANCISCO _ I applaud Mayor Willie Brown's decision to head up

like the idea of the shopping mall between 'em.

   &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; THE NEW  &LR; airport runways will come in handy when we have to fly in

HP LOOKING TO OFFER EASIER E-COMMERCE  &HT;     BY HENRY NORR
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Hewlett-Packard is promising to make it as easy for businesses to
get the technology required for Internet commerce as it is to get
electricity for their offices.
<P>
   Under a new program called ``Infrastructure-on-Tap,'' which the
Palo Alto company will announce next week, HP seeks to play the
role of power plant, owning and managing all the underlying
technology that customers need to realize their e-ambitions.
Instead of having to develop the skills and spend the money
normally needed to build an e-business infrastructure, customers
will simply pay HP a monthly fee for all the necessary facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Countless ``Web hosting'' services already provide sites where
companies can set up electronic storefronts. But HP said its new
program will be different in several ways:
</P>
<P>
   Customers won't need any technical knowledge, such as how much
computing power, data storage and network bandwidth they'll need, &LR; 
to start up or expand their online operations. They'll simply tell
HP how much business they expect and HP will guarantee to support
it. If traffic to the site increases, HP can allocate the
additional resources required.
</P>
<P>
   Customers won't have to pay up front or make long-term
commitments for the servers, hard drives and other equipment their
sites require. HP will simply charge a monthly fee based on the
number of ``hits'' on the customer's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Infrastructure-on-Tap'' customers will be responsible for
providing the application software that actually runs their online
business, but HP will provide all necessary back-end services,
servers, security and network management.
</P>
<P>
   In its initial form, the program is not designed for mom-and-pop
retailers who want to start selling online, but rather at companies
setting up ``business-to-business hubs'' that link large
organizations to its suppliers or bring together multiple buyers
and sellers. The Gartner Group estimates that between 300 and 600
such hubs already exist, and the number is increasing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   The market for outsourcing of information technology projects is
expected to be worth $160 billion by 2003, and HP projects that the
``Internet utility computing'' model it is pioneering could attract
10 percent of that business.

CREATURES OF THE NIGHT: SAN FRANCISCO EMERGENCY CENTER CARES FOR 
 TRAUMATIZED PETS  
 BY DAVID LAZARUS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
The snake arrived shortly before midnight.
<P>
   Christiann Moreno and Alexander Karasik cradled their 5-foot boa
constrictor in a blanket. They leaned against each other in the
otherwise empty waiting room at San Francisco's All Animals
Emergency Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   All Animals is one of just two ERs for pets in the city _ a
place where lives are saved, and sometimes lost, as most people
sleep. It is a place where doctors and technicians routinely handle
crises large and small.
</P>
<P>
   Moreno and Karasik had driven all the way from Pacifica. They
said nothing. The snake was hardly moving.
</P>
<P>
   In a nearby examining room, Dr. Joe Graff inspected a pit-bull
puppy that had arrived a little while earlier. The puppy's owner,
Jewell Kidd, explained that its sister had died the day before in
her Bayview yard, and now this one was vomiting and losing weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be parvo virus,'' Graff said as he inspected the
puppy's sharp teeth. ``No history of seizures, I take it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not like a human seizure,'' Kidd replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a few options,'' Graff said. ``The best would be to
hospitalize her for the night, put her on antibiotics and fluids.
Or you could take her home as an outpatient and we can see.''
</P>
<P>
   Kidd wasn't sure. ``Will it be like $400 or $500?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't be that much,'' Graff answered. ``But it can add
up.''
</P>
<P>
   In the back room, an assistant told Graff that Kidd in fact had
no money. She had promised to pay for any treatment a few days
later.
</P>
<P>
   Graff thought about that for a moment. ``Do the tests,'' he
decided. ``That's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   All Animals was established nearly 30 years ago as one of the
country's first off-hours, emergencies-only pet hospitals. It was
the brainchild of 18 San Francisco and Daly City vets who decided
that a shared facility was needed to handle ``patients'' late at
night and on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Profit wasn't the motivation,'' said Norman Freid, a vet who
helped launch All Animals and now sits on the hospital's steering
committee. ``At the time, we weren't even sure there would be
enough work to keep it solvent.''
</P>
<P>
   That soon changed. All Animals, located in the Inner Sunset on
Ninth Avenue near Irving Street, now sees about 6,000 patients a
year between 6 p.m. and 8 a.m. on weeknights and throughout
weekends.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital charges $49 for an initial emergency exam, with
treatment costing extra. The typical bill runs between $150 and
$200.
</P>
<P>
   Graff, 45, has been chief vet at the hospital for the past 12
years. His dark hair is starting to gray, and he has the intense
look in his eyes that comes with keeping weird hours. Graff
typically pulls three 14-hour shifts a week at All Animals.
</P>
<P>
   He dresses in surgical scrubs and freely admits that the
adrenaline rush is one of the attractions of specializing in
emergency medicine. That his patients for the most part are covered
with fur and feathers is beside the point.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Graff enjoys dealing with people almost as much as
he likes dealing with animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the people who come in here are anxious and tense,''
he said during a break in the action one night this week. ``I talk
to them and keep them calm. I think I can be of help.''
</P>
<P>
   On this night, All Animals had opened for business, as it does
most nights, by receiving referrals from daytime vets _ patients
that require further care or observation.
</P>
<P>
   In the large cages along the walls were a yellow Labrador puppy
receiving fluids through an IV drip to counter vomiting and
diarrhea. There was a dog with a lacerated foot, a poodle that had
just received an insulin shot for diabetes and a cat that had
undergone exploratory surgery for cancer.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the patients minded their own business,
napping intermittently and keeping a wary eye on the activities of
the ER staff. Occasionally, they would be visited by Expo, one of
two portly cats that call the hospital home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spare parts,'' joked Crissy Wentz, a technician _ vet-speak
for nurse _ at All Animals. Actually, that's not far off the mark.
Wentz said many pet hospitals keep cats on hand as blood donors.
Expo and its chum, Thomas, have come through in a pinch a number of
times.
</P>
<P>
   As with any ER, the staff members at All Animals have plenty of
war stories to share. Graff tells of the time a woman with a New
Age bent hung a crystal around her ailing dog's neck before leaving
the pooch for a full weekend of care. She insisted that it would
help.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing finally fell off and broke,'' Graff recalled. ``The
dog passed away a few minutes later.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the other stories are too graphic to be retold _ tales
of abuse or acts of astonishing cruelty and stupidity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to document,'' Graff said of abused animals. ``But
when we suspect it, we call animal control.''
</P>
<P>
   Most nights, there's a stop-and-start rhythm to the hospital,
with slow periods punctuated by sudden arrivals. The staff members
talk of how the strange hours play havoc on their lives _ and yet
how working in the ER compensates with other rewards.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times,'' Graff said, ``when you can give medication
to an animal that's near death, and then it's thriving again. When
that happens ...''
</P>
<P>
   His words trailed off momentarily, as if interrupted by a
particular memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' Graff continued, ``it feels great.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Smith, another technician at the hospital, left law school
to pursue veterinary medicine. She has no regrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be a lawyer because I wanted to help,'' she said.
``I wanted to do something that makes a difference. But the more
schooling you have, the more you see that lawyers create
conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith glanced around at the animals in the cages. ``This is more
about conflict resolution,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It certainly isn't about the money. A tech might pull down only
about $30,000 a year despite all the long hours and assorted
hazards. An emergency vet, on the other hand, can see annual
salaries in the six-figure range.
</P>
<P>
   Around 8 p.m., a massive Great Pyrenees was brought in. Its
owner said the dog wouldn't stop panting and shaking. Wentz drew
blood for tests as Smith held the huge hound in a bear hug.
</P>
<P>
   The tests ended up negative and Graff concluded that the dog
probably just had a fright.
</P>
<P>
   About an hour later, a diabetic cat arrived. It wasn't
responding well to insulin, and Graff recommended that it stay the
night for observation.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the German shepherd with a nasty case of diarrhea
and the Lhasa apso that had eaten chicken bones. Another dog needed
stitches above its eye. An unusually lethargic box turtle was
X-rayed and diagnosed with pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   The only other ER for animals in San Francisco is Pets Unlimited
on Fillmore Street. But Pets Unlimited is more a general-purpose
veterinary hospital that happens to stay open around the clock.
</P>
<P>
   Freid, the All Animals founder, turns decidedly surly when the
subject of his crosstown rival comes up. Pets Unlimited, he said,
began as a charity shelter for unwanted animals and then moved into
the veterinary-care business.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're unfair competition,'' Freid said. ``They don't pay a
penny in taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   This is basically true. As a nonprofit organization, Pets
Unlimited is exempt from corporate taxes _ even though it charges
pet owners almost the same rates as All Animals for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Mason, medical director of Pets Unlimited, acknowledged
that such disparities are ``a conflict'' between commercial and
nonprofit endeavors. ``But it's something that's allowed,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He defended Pets Unlimited's tax-free status by pointing out
that ``if there's a profit at All Animals, it goes into the owners'
pockets. Any income we make goes back into the facility.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, it's kind of hard to be angry at a place that
treats nearly 30,000 sick and injured animals every year, including
a number of charity cases. Fair competitor or otherwise, at least
Pets Unlimited joins All Animals in fighting the good fight.
</P>
<P>
   Graff showed that he wasn't above bending the rules when he
treated the pit-bull puppy for free. After sending the little dog
home as an outpatient, he returned to the examining room and called
in the snake.
</P>
<P>
   Moreno and Karasik released the large, mottled reptile from its
blanket. The boa had deep cuts up and down its body, and the bone
was visible at the tip of its ragged tail.
</P>
<P>
   Moreno explained that she had placed a rat in the snake's pen as
its regular meal and had then gone away for a week. However, the
snake did not eat the rat. The rat was slowly eating the snake
instead.
</P>
<P>
   Graff nodded as he inspected the creature's injuries. ``We see
this kind of thing with some frequency,'' he said calmly. ``It's
unpredictable.''
</P>
<P>
   The best he could do, Graff continued, would be to give the
snake some antibiotics and clean its wounds. He would provide
Moreno and Karasik with the phone numbers of some specialists they
could contact the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   In the back room, Wentz reluctantly held the boa on an examining
table as Graff bathed the snake's skin with Betadyne, a
disinfectant.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is pretty bad,'' Wentz said. ``They don't fight off
infection well, these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   While Graff was clearly displeased with how the snake had
received its injuries, he said he was reluctant to criticize its
owners. ``If I say something to them, maybe next time it gets hurt
they won't bring their snake in,'' he observed.
</P>
<P>
   Graff privately gave the boa only about a 30 percent chance of
recovering.
</P>
<P>
   Around 1 a.m., Moreno and Karasik returned, and Graff handed
back their pet, bundled safely inside a pillowcase.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she'll be OK,'' Moreno said hopefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think so, too,'' Karasik agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Graff wished them well as they carried their friend into the
night.

PHONE SERVICE RULES ARE FINE, STATE PUC SAYS 
 &HT;     BY TODD WALLACK
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Consumer advocates blasted the California Public Utilities
Commission for unanimously voting down a proposal yesterday to
update customer service rules covering Pacific Bell and other local
phone companies.
<P>
   Critics complained that the current rules, drafted in 1983,
before the advent of automated answering systems and other
technology, are woefully out of date.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell, for instance, is required to answer 80 percent of its
calls within 20 seconds. But the phone company isn't penalized if
it routes calls to a busy signal or forces callers to weave their
way through several layers of computerized menus before reaching a
live person.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sends a message that (Pac Bell) can get rate increase after
rate increase, while customer service quality goes down,'' said
Regina Costa of The Utility Reform Network.
</P>
<P>
   Natalie Billingsley, who works for the PUC's Office of Ratepayer
Advocates, called the vote ``very disappointing. ... It leaves
customers with nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Costa and Billingsley also said the current rules don't
always require Pac Bell and other local phone companies to repair
or install new phone lines in a reasonable period of time.
</P>
<P>
   But Lester Wong, an aide to Commission President Richard Bilas,
said new rules are not needed because Pac Bell is drawing fewer
complaints and facing growing competition from rivals, particularly
in the business and high-speed Internet markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want more regulation, we want more competition,''
said Wong.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Commissioner Henry Duque said he thought the
commission could better improve the current rules as part of a new
Telecommunications Consumer Bill of Rights, which would cover all
phone companies, including wireless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are on a much stronger path as far as consumers are
concerned,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell also complained that the latest proposal didn't make
sense because it applied only to Pac Bell, GTE and other local
phone companies that historically had monopolies.
</P>
<P>
   It's unfair, said spokesman John Britton, ``to single out
companies like Pac Bell and GTE and say you cannot use technology
(like automated answering systems) to become more efficient.''

 A MODERN WOMAN'S COMPLICATED PROBLEMS 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brand-new bright and shiny Golf Digest Woman magazine solves
what it calls the ``mystery'' of why 58 percent of female golfers
find bad weather ``distracting and discouraging, compared with only
28 of the men?'' The answer: ``Men don't have to worry about their
hair!''
</P>
<P>
   Another result of the survey: ``Married men prefer to play with
almost anybody else but their wives.''
</P>
<P>
   P.S. Brand-new bright and shiny Real Simple magazine, which is
brimming with precise instructions to help ``simplify every aspect
of your life,'' suggests that once a month ``you empty the contents
of your medicine cabinet _ every last pumice stone and zucchini
mask _ into the sink. Use ... all-purpose cleaner to spritz the
shelves and walls of the cabinet. Then, as you replace the
toiletries, dust them.'' There now, doesn't that sound simple?
</P>
<P>
   P.P.S. Us magazine asked  &UR; Julia Roberts &LR; , ``If you had to have
sex with one girl, who would it be with?''  &UR; Hillary Clinton &LR; , said
Roberts, `` 'cause I don't think she's getting her fair share.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; GEORGETTE'S POST-MARITAL COMPLAINT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Robert Mosbacher &LR;  has cut off the $32,064-a-month alimony he
was paying to his former wife, Georgette, and now she's filed suit
to get it reinstated.
</P>
<P>
   According to the New York Post, the former Commerce secretary
stopped payments because his ex-wife gave an interview in the New
York Observer saying that when he told her he wanted a divorce,
``it was the first time in my life I had known betrayal. ... I feel
like I've been permanently harmed.'' This, he told the Houston
Chronicle, was a violation of their divorce settlement, which had
specified that they wouldn't disparage one another.
</P>
<P>
   Georgette's suit claims she was cut off because Robert didn't
like her support of John McCain, a charge he denies.

</P>
<P>
   A cat-loving consumer who recently received a Kitty Tease Deluxe
toy for her birthday found a notice inside signed by its
``inventor/owner.''
</P>
<P>
   He is shutting down the operation but will try to fill as many
orders as possible. The reason for the shutdown is a series of
financial reversals. ``Though the bank OKs me for an equity loan on
the home that I owned, they required that my wife co-sign the note
which she would not do,'' said the note tucked into the toy's box.
</P>
<P>
   ``She does not consider this a worthy job. My inventory is now
depleted and I do not have the $4,500 necessary to order more stock
even though there sits over $30,000 in useable home equity I can
not touch. The wife and I are now separated and a divorce looks
emanate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lord works in strange ways and maybe this is just a test.
... In any case I wish to thank all of you for having taken a
chance on my cat toy.''

 A MODERN WOMAN'S COMPLICATED PROBLEMS 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brand-new bright and shiny Golf Digest Woman magazine solves
what it calls the ``mystery'' of why 58 percent of female golfers
find bad weather ``distracting and discouraging, compared with only
28 of the men?'' The answer: ``Men don't have to worry about their
hair!''
</P>
<P>
   Another result of the survey: ``Married men prefer to play with
almost anybody else but their wives.''
</P>
<P>
   P.S. Brand-new bright and shiny Real Simple magazine, which is
brimming with precise instructions to help ``simplify every aspect
of your life,'' suggests that once a month ``you empty the contents
of your medicine cabinet _ every last pumice stone and zucchini
mask _ into the sink. Use ... all-purpose cleaner to spritz the
shelves and walls of the cabinet. Then, as you replace the
toiletries, dust them.'' There now, doesn't that sound simple?
</P>
<P>
   P.P.S. Us magazine asked  &UR; Julia Roberts &LR; , ``If you had to have
sex with one girl, who would it be with?''  &UR; Hillary Clinton &LR; , said
Roberts, `` 'cause I don't think she's getting her fair share.''

was paying to his former wife, Georgette, and now she's filed suit
to get it reinstated.
</P>
<P>
   According to the New York Post, the former Commerce secretary
stopped payments because his ex-wife gave an interview in the New
York Observer saying that when he told her he wanted a divorce,
``it was the first time in my life I had known betrayal. ... I feel
like I've been permanently harmed.'' This, he told the Houston
Chronicle, was a violation of their divorce settlement, which had
specified that they wouldn't disparage one another.
</P>

   Georgette's suit claims she was cut off because Robert didn't
like her support of John McCain, a charge he denies.

   He is shutting down the operation but will try to fill as many
orders as possible. The reason for the shutdown is a series of
financial reversals. ``Though the bank OKs me for an equity loan on
the home that I owned, they required that my wife co-sign the note
which she would not do,'' said the note tucked into the toy's box.
</P>
<P>
   ``She does not consider this a worthy job. My inventory is now
depleted and I do not have the $4,500 necessary to order more stock
even though there sits over $30,000 in useable home equity I can
not touch. The wife and I are now separated and a divorce looks
emanate.

BOEING, ENGINEERS AGREE TO END STRIKE PENDING UNION VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Boeing Co., battered by a 5 1/2-week strike by its
engineers union that had delayed jet deliveries and helped send its
stock price tumbling, announced a tentative agreement Friday to end
the action, which was one of the largest white-collar strikes
against a private company in years and was trumpeted by national
labor leaders as a crucial sign of their ability to organize
professional workers.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of things, the engineers, whose sole previous act of
defiance in the 56-year history of their union was a one-day
walkout in 1992, appeared to have scored a remarkable victory for
their efforts, which included manning the picket lines with signs
proclaiming: ``No Nerds, No Birds.''
</P>
<P>
   The three-year contract offers average wage increases of 8
percent to engineers this year and 4.5 percent in the next two
years, as well as cash bonuses of up to $2,500. The company also
agreed to extend health coverage to workers' domestic partners and
withdrew an earlier demand that workers contribute toward their
health-insurance coverage. The offer is still subject to
ratification by the 13,300-member union in a vote Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing management did secure the ability to target part of the
pay increases, with about half of the overall pool for wage
increases to be divided at the company's discretion. Such merit
raises are anathema to many unions, and many engineers on the
picket lines had opposed the idea, saying they did not trust the
company to distribute the raises fairly. Agreement on the issue
appeared to be a rough compromise between that opposition and the
company's opening proposal to exercise nearly complete discretion
over raises.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between the engineers and the company had grown
increasingly bitter in recent days, and Alan Mulally, head of the
company's commercial airplanes unit, said on Monday that some
engineers were ``maliciously attacking our company and deliberately
trying to destroy our reputation'' by telling airlines and
government officials that new airplanes were unsafe for delivery.
But on Friday both sides offered conciliatory words after hammering
out the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us have a greater understanding of what is meant by the
issue of `respect,''' Philip M. Condit, Boeing's chairman and chief
executive, said in announcing the agreement. ``One day I hope we
can all look back on this as a turning point, a time when we more
clearly recognized the importance of listening to and seeking to
understand one another.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Bofferding, executive director of the union, the Society
of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace, said the
agreement would make ``a strong company stronger'' and showed the
company's ``respect for our contributions.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing officials said Friday that they expected the company to
recover quickly from the effects of the walkout, and to meet its
announced goal of delivering 491 commercial jetliners this year. It
had already missed at least 15 of 42 such scheduled deliveries in
February, and problems were only expected to worsen since some of
the striking engineers were needed under federal law to certify new
airplanes as flightworthy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The company also clearly hoped that the news would help bolster
its stock price, even as it announced that it would evaluate the
impact of the strike, the new contract benefits and the overtime
necessary to get back on schedule, and possibly offer revised
earnings estimates later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Boeing, which had hit a 52-week low of $32 on March 10
before climbing back up, rose $1.5625, to close at $37.1875 Friday.
The stock had closed at $41 the day before the strike began on Feb.
9.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers and technical workers represented by the union had
been incensed by Boeing's initial offer, arguing among other things
that it paled in comparison with the relatively generous contract
worked out with the machinists' union late last summer, which
included 10 percent cash signing bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   The company's announcement Friday depicted the pact as a
compromise by both sides. But many analysts, on Wall Street and
elsewhere, clearly saw it as a victory for the union, with Boeing
offering apparent concessions on nearly all major issues on the
table.
</P>
<P>
   Ratification of the deal, while considered likely, is by no
means a sure thing. Some engineers, who had come to picket Friday
near company headquarters before the deal was announced, said they
remained adamantly opposed to any company control over the size of
individual engineer's raises, and thus threatened a ``no'' vote on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But many others seemed jubilant over the pact and said they
would vote for it enthusiastically.
</P>
<P>
   The broader impact on other white-collar workers remains to be
seen, but some experts thought the union's victory would resonate
far beyond the halls of Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The engineers and the technical people took a very big risk,
and they've come out on top,'' said Tom Juravich, director of the
Labor Center at the University of Massachusetts. ``And they seem to
have gained through the strike some newfound respect from the
company.''
</P>
<P>
   Union membership among the roughly 20,000 people in the overall
bargaining unit represented by the union had jumped from about 40
percent before contract negotiations began to nearly 65 percent
now.
</P>
<P>
   And engineers, many of whom were on strike for the first time in
their lives, said the experience had changed their views about
organizing such activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us will ever look at a picket line in quite the same
way again,'' said Bofferding, the union director.

 &HT;    Re-enactment of Branch Davidian fiasco set
 &HT;    By Mark England
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Mount Carmel will spring to life for at least one
more day Sunday. In theory, at least.
</P>
<P>
   The rambling free-form structure that loomed over the prairie
east of Waco won't be rebuilt for the court-ordered test. The
re-enactment has been ordered to determine if government agents
shot at the Branch Davidians on the day of a fire that led to the
deaths of David Koresh and 75 followers.
</P>
<P>
   But at 10:30 a.m., weather permitting, a re-creation staged at
Fort Hood will bring back images forever linked to Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   A Bradley fighting vehicle and a combat engineering vehicle will
rumble over the test site. Armed men in camouflage will roam about.
Debris such as hubcaps, broken glass and insulation will be strewn
on the ground. And two aircraft with Forward-Looking Infrared, or
FLIR, video cameras will fly overhead.
</P>
<P>
   What may or may not be different _ weapons will be fired.
</P>
<P>
   In two hours or so, videotapes will be ready for comparison with
the FLIR videos from April 19, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Caddell, lead attorney in the wrongful-death lawsuit filed
against the government by surviving Davidians, believes the test
will prove the flashes on the original FLIR videos are FBI agents
firing weapons _ creating an atmosphere of fear that he thinks may
have kept many Davidians from fleeing a burning Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these FLIRs can show a lighted cigarette, they sure as hell
can show flashes from a machine gun,'' Caddell said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Michael Bradford of Beaumont, helping defend the
government, said he's hopeful the re-creation will end speculation
about government gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important, if possible, to put that to rest,''
Bradford said. ``It didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bradford also said that things may not be any clearer once
the smoke clears.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that at the end of the day, we're going to have
a test tape that will have to be compared to the FLIR tapes of the
19th,'' Bradford said. ``To some extent, it will be a subjective
comparison by both sides' experts, so it's subject to the potential
for continued debate and dispute. Because several different issues
are going to be covered, the results may be clear on some and in
dispute on others.''
</P>
<P>
   The test Sunday stems from Caddell's breathtaking challenge:
restage the final day. The loser of the contest pays all expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Government attorneys balked, arguing that it was impossible to
recreate the conditions _ from the weather to the soil content _ at
Mount Carmel. The FBI also pointed out that the FLIR camera had
been upgraded in the intervening years. Furthermore, the agency
insisted that any information about it was classified.
</P>
<P>
   However, the FBI offered to stage a private field test for
Special Counsel John Danforth.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth, however, declined and asked U.S. District Judge Walter
Smith Jr. of Waco to order a test with independent experts
analyzing the results. Smith asked Danforth's office to set it up,
with the videos to be studied by a British firm, Vector Data
Systems LTD. Their analysis, however, won't be made public until
after the upcoming civil trial.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, at Danforth's request, barred the media from the test
site, likening it to a crime scene, ``which unquestionably may be
closed to the public and the press in order to preserve the
integrity of the evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Not many crime scenes, however, have 34 people looking over
authorities' shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Smith and Danforth, there will be eight members of
Congress (or congressional staff) present, and representatives from
the FBI, Department of Justice, the Department of Defense and the
Office of Special Counsel. Eight slots are set aside for the
plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   If no rain falls and the temperature doesn't drop below 65
degrees or soar above 85 degrees, the re-creation will start at
10:30 a.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Before the test, military track vehicles will run over the test
site _ which will be equipped with targets, designated shooting
areas, video points and a debris field _ to create ruts similar to
those found at Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   Six men, without weapons, will assume prone positions behind the
Bradley fighting vehicle and the Combat Engineering Vehicle 20
minutes before the test. Between them, they will wear a
fire-resistant Nomex flight suit with camouflage; camouflage
fatigues; a camouflaged rainsuit; and a full sniper suit with face
paint and vegetation adornment.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs argue that there are two explanations for why no
people are seen near the flash points in the Mount Carmel FLIR
videos. Government agents may have worn FLIR-resistant clothing.
And if they were lying down, their body temperature may have been
too close to that of the ground.
</P>
<P>
   A FLIR camera detects the relative temperature of objects and
processes the information to produce a monochromatic image.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford thinks the shooters Sunday will show up in the FLIR
images.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the tapes from the 19th, there are no signs of any people
or weapons around the flashes,'' Bradford said. ``The people in the
test will wear the same type of clothing as the agents wore on the
19th. If we can see them, that will be a clear distinction. It will
establish the flashes are not people shooting weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   Caddell, however, has a different perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get flashes from guns and we don't get flashes from
trash, then what else can the flashes be but gunfire?'' Caddell
said. ``I'm not saying we won't get flashes from the space tent,
but it won't be the precise repetitive flashes seen on April 19th.
The only thing that can duplicate that is gunfire.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the shooters will rise on command, go to the first
shooting position, pick up their weapons and fire five spaced
single shots at a target 10 yards away. The weapons fired will be
an M-16 rifle, a CAR-15 rifle, two 9 mm MP-5 submachine guns (one
suppressed), a Remington automatic shotgun and a Browning 88 9 mm
pistol.
</P>
<P>
   The shooters will then move to the next firing position, crouch
and fire three-shot bursts at a 10-yard target. Those shooting the
pistols and shotgun will fire single shots three times in rapid
succession.
</P>
<P>
   Four shooters (those carrying the M-16, the CAR-15 and the two
MP-5 submachine guns) will move to a forward shooting position.
There they will be joined by shooters with an M60 machine gun and
an MK-19 automatic grenade launcher. The shooters will fire three
12-round bursts of automatic fire at a target 30 yards away. One
shooter will fire the M-203 grenade launcher on the M-16.
</P>
<P>
   The shooters will place their weapons at pre-position locations
and go to the rear of the vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   From inside the Bradley fighting vehicle, a shooter armed with
an M-79 grenade launcher will appear, stand next to the vehicle and
fire two ferret rounds of tear gas, two M-651 rounds and two
flashbang rounds at the farthest target. Recording each stage of
the test will be an FBI Nightstalker airplane and a British Royal
Navy Lynx Mk 8 helicopter equipped with a Sea Owl FLIR camera
identical to the one used by the FBI at Mount Carmel. The
Nightstalker will carry an updated version of the camera. Each
aircraft will do flyovers at 4,000 and 6,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the test starts, there has been controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs received permission to test fire the MK-19
grenade launcher, a weapon the government claims wasn't at Mount
Carmel. However, one of the plaintiffs' experts believes some of
the flashes on the original FLIR videos could only come from an
MK-19, which has a fast rate of fire.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford believes the weapon could skew the test results.
However, he defends the decision to let the government set up a
dome tent covered with aluminum-coated space blankets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be virtually impossible to capture where the debris
was on the 19th or put the aircraft in the position it was then,''
Bradford said. ``We wanted to create something we know is glare to
see if it shows up on camera. If we create glare, then we can see
what it looks like and if it's similar to what shows on the FLIR
(videos) of the 19th.''
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs, however, portray what Caddell dubbed ``Space Blanket
Bingo'' as a government gambit.
</P>
<P>
   ``My suspicion is the government ran tests at Quantico and
determined the tentlike structure was their best chance to show
glint off something other than weapons,'' said Houston attorney
James Brannon, who represents several plaintiffs. ``I think the
government has figured out the weapons are going to show, and
they're trying to spin it. They don't mind it being suspicious.
Suspicious is a win for them. At least they'll have some story.''

NASDAQ ACKNOWLEDGES COMPUTER OVERLOAD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Corrects volume statistics in 6th graf.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Nasdaq exchange, which has seen trading volume balloon as
investors have rushed into technology stocks, experienced computer
problems earlier this month, a Nasdaq official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Although a March 6 computer glitch was not as severe as one that
effectively crippled the exchange and halted trades last November
for about 20 minutes, the recent malfunction has reignited concerns
among traders and investment managers about whether the nation's
hottest exchange can handle an unexpected and unprecedented rise in
volume of the computer stocks that are its primary business.
</P>
<P>
   The March 6 incident was ``like a hang nail,'' the Nasdaq
official said, compared with the November shutdown, which he
characterized as a ``heart attack.''
</P>
<P>
   But traders said it became very difficult to complete trades
during the entire 17-minute March incident, from about 2:55 p.m.
until 3:12, after a Nasdaq price-feeding system stopped working.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stopped receiving prices from Nasdaq, and when you have no
prices, there is no trading,'' said one trader at a large Manhattan
firm who refused to be quoted.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is volume. The number of transactions on Nas-H daq
has exploded, from less than 800 million shares per day, on
average, during 1998 to 1.7 bil- lion shares daily in January and
February of this year. In recent  &UR; &AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP; &LR;  weeks _ as
the Nasdaq index level soared to a record 5,000-plus clos- ing and
then plunged 9 percent _ trading routinely surpassed 2 bil- lion
shares a day.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange, on its Web site, reported another minor system
problem Feb. 18 amid a surge in volume.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq official, who spoke on condition that his name not be
used, said a software problem on March 6 caused one of the
exchange's computer systems to ``get stuck in a loop'' for one
minute and 17 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Although trading was not disrupted, the official said the brief
glitch caused an interrupt in the feed of ``last sale prices'' on
completed transactions for a total of 17 minutes, as technicians
repaired the software problem.
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices could not be fed into the workstations on traders'
desks or into the program that calculates the Nasdaq's index level.
``Rather than disseminate bad information, for a while we
disseminated no information,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Computers that process trades are separate from those that
provide pricing updates in the Nasdaq computer system, which has
layer upon layer of backup computers to ensure uninterrupted
trading. Nasdaq was ``accepting the trade reports, we were locking
in the trade reports,'' he added. ``Everything was functioning.''
</P>
<P>
   But while few investors or traders blame Nasdaq for the volume
crunch, it is no secret on Wall Street that Nasdaq has problems
keeping up with leaps in trading volume in a bull market for
technology stocks that no one had anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing how many trades there are,'' said Michael Ryan,
head of equity trading for State Street Resarch &AMP; Management, a
Boston investment firm. About Nasdaq, he said, ``They're
overloaded.''

STILL A BIG FISH, EVEN IN A BIG POND  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 19) 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   TOKYO _ As Japan's government-owned telephone monopoly until
1985, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone presided over the world's
second-largest phone market unchallenged. The heft it attained in
the process still gives it immense economic and political clout.
</P>
<P>
   Along with its subsidiaries, NTT Mobile Telecommunications and
NTT Data, NTT employs some 224,000 people directly; it keeps
perhaps as many more working in affiliates, joint ventures and
other related companies. Employees at NTT's two local phone service
subsidiaries and its long-distance unit make an average of 10
million yen, or $93,458, a year, one of the highest average
salaries in Japan, and their average age is 43.
</P>
<P>
   NTT's procurement budget _ the number is not disclosed, but can
be safely estimated at well beyond $20 billion a year _ provides
further largesse. That keeps tens of thousands of people employed
at various suppliers _ themselves titans of the Japanese economy
like NEC, Hitachi and Fujitsu. One of NEC's four sales divisions is
devoted exclusively to NTT.
</P>
<P>
   ``All those business and employment relationships mean that even
if we offered a cheaper rate, NTT will get the business,'' said
Ryuichi Kinoshita, a managing director at DDI, a long-distance
carrier, and a former official at the Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications. ``It's unfortunate, but that's Japanese
business practice.''
</P>
<P>
   NTT's political power is expansive, too. Many of Kinoshita's
former colleagues in the ministry now work for NTT, and its
powerful union both raises money for political campaigns and urges
its members to vote for candidates backed by the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
   The company says critics exaggerate its clout. ``No player can
dominate the market that is changing and expanding so rapidly,''
said Kenya Nakatsuka, a spokesman for NTT.
</P>
<P>
   The government is NTT's largest shareholder, owning a 59.1
percent stake now worth 13.7 trillion yen, or roughly $130.3
billion. ``We are a very unique company,'' acknowledges Kanji
Koide, a senior vice president. ``Having such a company in a
competitive market is extraordinary and a little odd.''
</P>
<P>
   Regulators and politicians arguably have little incentive to
force more competition on NTT, particularly now, with a tough
parliamentary election looming and NTT looking a bit like the
Titanic in the wake of a government-imposed overhaul last fall.
</P>
<P>
   NTT was forced to spin off its crown jewels, the mobile phone
and data units; break its bread-and-butter local service into two
pieces and create a separate unit for a long-distance service it
intended to start.
</P>
<P>
   Except in the lucrative Tokyo market, NTT's local services are
bleeding red ink. And its plans for building a long-distance
service were shattered when Britain's Cable and Wireless succeeded
in acquiring International Digital, a struggling long-distance
carrier with loose ties to NTT.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, many analysts regard these problems _ which NTT has
been highlighting in advance of the discussion on interconnection
fees _ as little more than bumps in the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an incentive right now for NTT not to appear to be
doing too well, because they are currently in these negotiations,''
said Kate Lye, a telecommunications analyst at Warburg Dillon Read
in Tokyo. ``In fact, the fundamentals are strong. We're certainly
looking for earnings growth on a group basis this year.''

PEREZ GETS REPRIEVE; HERSHISER SHARP
</HEADLINE>
 GRAPHICS AT BOTTOM)-LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. -- The battle for the fifth spot in the
Dodgers' rotation was supposed to become more clear Friday.
Instead, it remained murky.
</P>
<P>
   Lefty Carlos Perez showed the type of improvement manager Davey
Johnson wanted to see. Then, Orel Hershiser showed how to be
masterfully dominant.
</P>
<P>
   And it means Perez gets a reprieve -- for now. Perez still has a
chance to win a spot in the rotation and bump Hershiser to the
bullpen, but he' ll have to do it with roles reversed. When they
pitch Wednesday against Montreal, Hershiser will start and Perez
while relieves.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we both succeed, he'll be in the rotation,'' Hershiser
said. ``If I falter, he'll be in the rotation. If we both pitch
poorly, they'll toss it up. If we both pitch well and he's in the
rotation, that's fine. It makes us a deeper team.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez allowed three runs (two earned) in four innings. His
velocity was in the 87 to 89 mph in his first three innings, but it
dropped to 84 to 89 in the fourth inning, when he allowed all three
runs. He walked a batter and struck out five, used his change-up
effectively and mixed in a bunch of split-finger fastballs.
</P>
<P>
   But his second time through the order was different, even before
shortstop Kevin Elster booted a ball to allow the final run to
score. Perez's pitches were higher in the zone and balls were hit
harder, including a long homer by Ray Lankford.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can show more than that,'' said Perez, whose ERA dropped
from 14.40 to 10.00. ``It was only for four innings. What I really
want to show is when the season starts. I have to keep saying,
`It's spring training.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Just wait until April comes. I can't wait. I'm hungry. I want
to see some numbers out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez's outing was better than the eight earned runs in five
innings he allowed in his first two spring outings, but it's not
enough to declare Perez the fifth starter. In fact, he remains in
consideration only because he's guaranteed $12.5 million over the
next two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mechanics (Friday) were so much better for me,'' Johnson said.
``A big improvement on what he did the other day. I can tell from
the way the hitter reacted. He wasn't pulling the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hershiser allowed three hits and struck out six in
four innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was as sharp as I've seen him at times,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield's scare: Dodgers left fielder Gary Sheffield figures
to miss the next few days with a left pinkie injury, but it
could've been much worse. Sheffield suffered a cut on the finger
while diving into third on an attempted stolen base. His finger was
sliced by the cleat of Craig Paquette. It required one stitch to
close and his availability is day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm done running forever,'' Sheffield said jokingly. ``Never
stealing another base.''
</P>
<P>
   Beltre saga continues: Dodgers managing partner and CEO Bob Daly
was supposed to give Scott Boras, Beltre's agent, the club's final
offer. Instead, the sides agreed to keep talking. There remains
hope on both sides a decision can be made Monday or Tuesday on
whether to sign Beltre to a three-year deal or go through the
arbitration process. Beltre's seeking free agency for because he
was signed at age 15.
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: Nicole Menz, assistant state attorney of Indian
River County, said Perez would be charged with driving under the
influence of alcohol. ``I will be filing a charge. It will be done
first thing Monday morning,'' Menz said. ...Catcher Todd Hundley
returned after missing five games with back spasms. ...Third
baseman Adrian Beltre was scratched from today's trip to play
Detroit in Lakeland. It's the third straight game he'll miss with a
sore wrist.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers weekly box
</P>
<P>
   Best storyline: The battle for the fifth spot in the rotation
between Orel Hershiser and Carlos Perez. Hershiser is the clear
leader, but organization wants Perez involved.
</P>
<P>
   Best sub-plot: Perez' off-field problems continued when he was
arrested for suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol
late Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Progress was made with: Strengthening the bullpen. Righty Mike
Fetters threw a perfect inning in his first appearance, giving the
Dodgers more depth.
</P>
<P>
   Progress wasn't made with: The Adrian Beltre situation. Both
sides want it done, but they can't agree on a three-year deal. And
the closer it gets to the season, the more tenuous the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Spring surprise: That rookie right-hander Eric Gagne hasn't come
in pitched well. HE has a 15.58 ERA in three appearances.
</P>
<P>
   The week ahead: Kevin Elster could challenge Alex Cora for the
starting shortstop job. Cora's played better lately, but if Dodgers
need more offense Elster could fight his way in.

LACKING BUYER, IRIDIUM IS SET TO SHUT DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Unable to find new investors willing to step in after
Motorola Inc. and other founding partners declined to bail it out,
Iridium LLC moved Friday to shut off the innovative portable phone
and messaging service it designed to reach the remotest regions of
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Iridium told Judge Arthur Gonzalez of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court
in the Southern District of New York that it wanted to end
commercial service to its remaining customers by Saturday and start
the tricky process of destroying its constellation of 74 satellites
as early as next week. Lawyers for Iridium, which is based in
Washington, said it would take up to $50 million and the rest of
this year to program the destruction of the network of satellites
Iridium spent billions to create. Some of the satellites might take
up to two years to re-enter the atmosphere and burn up.
</P>
<P>
   Once heralded as a symbol of Motorola's far-sightedness and a
dramatic step forward in the globalization process, Iridium ended
up as a financial fiasco highlighting many of the various ways
businesses can go astray as they struggle to convert new technology
into popular products. More than $5 billion was invested.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that's left is the litigation,'' said Armand Musey, an
analyst at Banc of America Securities in New York, referring to
shareholder lawsuits already filed and other actions anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   That is a bit of an overstatement for now. Some of the
independent companies providing the ground gateways for the system
intend to continue to make emergency connections for a period of
time, including Iridium North America, which serves the entire
Western Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't guarantee that every call will work but it should be
there for several weeks for humanitarian needs,'' said Jim Walz,
president and chief executive of Iridium North America, which is
owned by Motorola, Sprint and Bell Canada. Meanwhile, Walz's
company, vendors it works with and others are working to help
customers migrate to other communications services.
</P>
<P>
   Iridium has said in recent weeks that it has 55,000 customers
but analysts said that far fewer than that would be affected.
Thousands of the customers have little use for Iridium but signed
up last fall to have a backup to conventional phone networks in the
event of Year 2000 computer breakdowns. Others have already begun
converting to other services.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have just had it with the uncertainty,'' said
Michael Smith, a Washington area representative for Stratos Global
Corp. who was working Friday with a major oil company he declined
to identify to switch links to its employees in Africa from Iridium
to Inmarsat, a British-based satellite system that has a
laptop-sized receiver for remote telephone users. Stratos and
others are offering trade-in credits for Iridium handsets, which
were made by Motorola and Kyocera of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Iridium was first envisioned by Motorola engineers in Phoenix in
the mid-1980s as demand for cellular phones began to rise. The
proposal to use a ring of 66 low-orbit satellites to create
``anyone, anywhere, anytime'' telecommunications was turned down by
the engineers' superiors but when senior managers visited from
Motorola's headquarters in Schaumburg, Ill., the engineers got a
chance to take their vision straight to the top. They won the
support of Robert Galvin, then the chairman and chief executive.
The story became part of Motorola lore and was often cited in the
years that followed as a symbol of the company's openness to bold
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   But the Iridium that finally emerged was hobbled by clunky
phones, difficulty in maintaining clear connections in many
circumstances and high costs. Iridium LLC, the partnership Motorola
set up to run the satellite system, carried a huge debt load.
</P>
<P>
   The complex arrangements between Iridium LLC, the gateway
companies like Iridium North America and major investors, including
some foreign governments, made every strategic decision nearly as
complex as Mideast peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Iridium lost money steadily from the day it handled its first
calls in September 1998 and it never came close to attracting the
millions of subscribers it needed to fulfill its creators' visions.
Shares in Iridium LLC that were sold to public investors peaked at
$70 in the spring of 1998, long before the first call was made.
They closed at 65.625 cents on Friday after the news that Iridium
would shut down. Motorola and the other investors that built the
system sank more than $5 billion into it, mostly to design, build
and launch the 66 satellites and the 8 backups that also are in
orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Iridium filed for bankruptcy protections last August in an
effort to reorganize its operations and debts but a complete
shutdown became inevitable, according to industry analysts, two
weeks ago when Craig O. McCaw, the billionaire cellular phone
pioneer, said that his investment group had dropped its plan to try
to acquire Iridium.
</P>
<P>
   Iridium is not alone in its problems. ICO Global Communications,
a second satellite phone network, filed for bankruptcy protection
shortly after Iridium. McCaw bought ICO and is trying to meld it
and Teledesic, a third ambitious satellite plan scheduled to begin
service in 2004, into ``an Internet of the sky.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of Iridium's major investors have already written off their
losses. Kyocera said yesterday that it would record a 10 billion
yen ($93.7 million) Iridium write-down in the current quarter.
Motorola set aside more than $2.5 billion last year and said Friday
that Iridium's demise would have no further impact on its earnings.
Motorola's shares fell $2.25, to $149.50, in trading on the Big
Board.

THE AD CAMPAIGN: BUSH ON EDUCATION
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Ky., Ill., Iowa, Mo.)  (rk) 
 By DAVID ROSENBAUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Bush campaign began running this 60-second commercial Friday
in parts of Kentucky, Illinois, Iowa and Missouri
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER: Maverick Media
</P>
<P>
   ON THE SCREEN: Clips of students of different ages, mostly in
classrooms or on playgrounds, with Bush in some shots.
</P>
<P>
   VOICE-OVER: Is the status quo in America's schools good enough?
</P>
<P>
   Under Al Gore and Bill Clinton, national reading scores
stagnated. America's high school students place almost dead last in
international math tests. The achievement gap between poor and
nonpoor students remains wide. Gore and Clinton had eight years,
but they've failed.
</P>
<P>
   As president, George W. Bush will challenge the status quo with
a crusade to improve education. He'll fight for reforms hailed as
the most fundamental in a generation, demand high standards and
accountability for students and teachers, restore local control of
schools, increase funding but change the system so successful
schools are rewarded and failing ones must improve.
</P>
<P>
   He'll turn Head Start into a reading program and close the
achievement gap that hurts those on the edges of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   His goal? Teach every child to read because there are no
second-rate children, no second-rate dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush: a fresh start for education.
</P>
<P>
   ACCURACY: Reading scores are generally measured by the National
Assessment of Educational Progress, a test given to American
students in the fourth, eight and 12th grades. The latest results,
released last July, showed that the average scores of fourth and
12th graders, which had fallen from 1992 to 1994, rose in 1998
approximately to where they were in 1992. Scores for eighth graders
were higher in 1998 than they were in 1992 or 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The gauge of math scores is the Third International Mathematics
and Science Study. The latest results showed that American fourth
graders were near the top internationally, eighth graders were
below average and 12th graders were near the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   The statement about the wide gap between poor students and
others is incontrovertible.
</P>
<P>
   SCORECARD: Scores in reading and math are little different from
what they were when Republicans were in the White House. But it is
safe to say that no one is satisfied with them.
</P>
<P>
   Tests show that students in Texas have improved in reading since
Bush became governor. His central campaign proposal is to require
all students to sit for annual tests administered by their states.
Schools would be held responsible for student performance. Students
in schools that consistently did poorly would be given a check, or
voucher, by the federal government that they could use to attend a
private school.

CLINTON'S TRIP TO INDIA IS SEEN AS MAINLY SYMBOLIC

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Like a family preparing for a sumptuous
wedding that will unite two great ancestral lines, India has been
dressing itself up for its first visit from a U.S. president in
over two decades _ a visit in which the world's largest democracy
and its most powerful one will again try to build an alliance that
has eluded them for a half-century.
</P>
<P>
   With President Clinton touching down here on Sunday evening,
workmen were out in force on Saturday. There were battalions of
malis _ or gardeners _ planting frowsy-headed yellow dahlias along
the route he will drive. Sweepers with spiky brooms were ridding
lawns of leaves and teams of men were pushing wheelbarrows of
steaming tar to spread in potholes.
</P>
<P>
   But if the relationship between India and the United States is
to progress, it will require more of the genuine love that builds a
good marriage than the decoration and repair undertaken before a
wedding party.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton _ cast as an Indian bridegroom on the cover of a news
magazine here in a full-length golden jacket and curly-toed
slippers _ recently decided to make the trip despite the failure of
intensive U.S. efforts to persuade India to sign the nuclear test
ban treaty or to cap their nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   But with his tenure as president running out, Clinton's timing,
again, has not proved lucky, as relations between India and its
longtime rival and neighbor, Pakistan, have continued to
deteriorate sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's decision to pay the briefest of visits to the United
States' old ally, Pakistan _ despite the explicit opposition of the
Indian prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, and his request that
the Americans instead put Pakistan on a list of terrorist states _
has tempered any euphoria here about the president's far longer,
five-day visit to India.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. diplomats, businessmen and policy analysts have been trying
to convince India, the subcontinent's economic power, that the
president's visit is fundamentally about building a broader, deeper
relationship _ one that will encompass cooperative efforts in
trade, science and technology, the environment and health, among
others.
</P>
<P>
   And the Indians, who do not like being treated as though their
country is no more important than far smaller Pakistan, seem
encouraged by a speech that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
gave last week, and its not-so-veiled criticisms of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   While declaring India's decision to conduct nuclear tests ``a
historic mistake,'' she also said that Pakistan should take steps
to ``address the effects of terror on Pakistan's neighbors, notably
India.'' The United States has asked Pakistan to ban a
Pakistan-based Islamic fundamentalist group that the Americans have
categorized as terrorist _ and whose members are waging a holy war
against India in the disputed territory of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians in India applauded the remarks meant for Pakistan in
which Albright also said the so-called Line of Control that divides
Kashmir into Indian- and Pakistani-held portions must be respected.
India holds Pakistan responsible for organizing an incursion into
Indian territory last summer that led to a vicious confrontation
between these two nuclear-armed nations.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian foreign minister, Jaswant Singh, referred with
satisfaction on Thursday to Albright's ``reaffirmation of the
validity of the Line of Control.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Wisner, who was the U.S. ambassador to India from 1994 to
1997, said Albright's speech was an indication of the United
States' willingness to talk turkey to the Pakistanis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having watched us be careful and nuanced over the years, that
was not careful and nuanced; that was blunt,'' he said. ``If this
speech does not make clear the explicit difference in the American
view of India and Pakistan, I don't know what else you need. A
four-and-a-half day visit to India and a four-and-a-half hour visit
to Pakistan?''

   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The estrangement between India and the United States _ two
great, multicultural democracies that would seem to have so much in
common _ stretches back to the 1950s and the height of the Cold
War. India, the proud new nation finally freed of colonial
domination, chose the path of nonalignment, while Pakistan, its
smaller, insecure neighbor, sought to ally with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, the Americans grew cozy with Pakistan's
military dictators, funneling billions of dollars in military aid
that sometimes wound up turned against India. By the early 1970s,
India had drawn closer to the Soviet Union. When the Soviets
invaded Afghanistan in 1979, India refused to condemn the
aggression, while Pakistan was a key player in U.S. support for the
Islamic mujahedeen battling the Soviet army.
</P>
<P>
   With the crumbling of the Soviet Union and India's decision in
1991 to begin loosening barriers to trade and investment, the
conditions that had kept socialist India and capitalist America
apart were profoundly changed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, old habits of mistrust die hard. India, craving
recognition as a global power, often finds what it sees as U.S.
arrogance hard to take. In the eyes of many Indians, the U.S.
opposition to the nuclear tests seemed the height of hypocrisy,
coming from a nation that still has thousands of nuclear warheads.
</P>
<P>
   The former Indian foreign secretary, J.N. Dixit, has described
the Indo-American relationship with the Hindi word ``panga,'' which
roughly translates as prickly, petulant, confrontational.
</P>
<P>
   K. Subrahmanyam, who recently headed a committee that looked
into army intelligence failures for the Indian government, offered
a perfect illustration of panga in his contentious reaction to
Clinton's tour of India.
</P>
<P>
   ``This visit is purely symbolic of the fact that two years after
the nuclear tests, India has done nothing to comply with the
stentorian demands of the nuclear hegemonists and still the U.S.
president is coming to visit,'' Subrahmanyam declared in his own
stentorian tones. ``In spite of all the rhetoric, the United States
accepts reality.''
</P>
<P>
   A stream of Americans from Washington institutions have come
through Delhi in recent weeks and many of them have been advising
the president to brave the thorny task of talking with the Indians
for the sake of the rose _ better relations with a country that is
the second-most populous in the world, with an economy growing at a
rate that has averaged over 6 percent since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Few expect any developments of earth-shaking importance from the
visit. India has already declared that the test ban treaty and its
relations with Pakistan are not open for negotiation. Still, given
the history, the symbolism of the visit itself may have content.
</P>
<P>
   Like the rituals of a wedding, the ceremonies of a state visit
could lay the foundations for a new understanding _ at least that
is what diplomats on both sides hope.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd I. Rudolph, an old India hand and a political scientist at
the University of Chicago, said that after over 20 years of neglect
_ the last visit of a U.S. president was that of Jimmy Carter in
1978 _ the Americans need to finally go and pay their respects.
``You sometimes have to have a cup of tea before people will trust
you,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After a few false starts, the real work began in
1997. On weekend nights, usually around midnight, Gilbert D.
Fletcher would ascend to his art studio in the attic of his home in
the Bronx. The studio would be dark, but for a spotlight on a blank
canvas.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher would sit in a director's chair before the canvas. He
would reach for a book, perhaps a James Baldwin, or an Alice
Walker, or a Langston Hughes, but always a black writer. And then
he would read, patiently, waiting for a word or a phrase or an
image to strike the fire within.
</P>
<P>
   When it happened, he would begin. With his brush, he would work
his oil paints as fast as he could, faster and faster, past the
point of exhaustion, until his canvas was full. This is how, over
the span of four intense months, Gilbert Fletcher finished the
portraits of 20 great black writers, from Ralph Ellison to Maya
Angelou to August Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, those portraits _ vividly colored, richly symbolic
_ were put on display in the grand lobby of the Central Library in
Brooklyn. Fletcher, 51, a professional art designer whose nostalgic
paintings of his New Orleans childhood sell for thousands of
dollars, titled his series ``Painted Voices: An Artist's Journey
Into the World of Black Writers.''
</P>
<P>
   The series, on display until April 15, is part of the library's
participation in the fifth National Black Writers Conference, which
runs from March 30 to April 2 at Medgar Evers College in Brooklyn.
It is also part of the Brooklyn Public Library's effort to bring
art and sculpture to its branches to stimulate interest in reading.
The thinking is that someone who sees, say, Fletcher's ghostly
rendering of Ralph Ellison might then feel compelled to pick up
``Invisible Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, right beside Fletcher's portraits, the library has set
up display cases where people can pick from books by these authors.
In connection with the writers conference, the library has bought
1,500 new books by black writers, 100 audio books and dozens of
videos related to the writers. Valerie J. Geiss, a spokeswoman for
the library, called the purchase ``a substantial expansion'' of the
library's African-American collection.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher, who will give an artist's talk at 2 p.m. Saturday in
the third-floor trustees room of the Central Library, deliberately
packed his portraits with words and symbols drawn from the lives of
the writers. In an interview, Fletcher said, ``I wanted to share my
experience, through my paintings, about what I had learned about
these writers.''
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher said he had painted Baldwin with a shimmering martini
glass etched on the front of his pink shirt ``because I know he
loved to drink.'' He painted flaming basketballs zooming like
surreal comets past a scowling John Edgar Wideman to symbolize
Wideman's focus on inner-city conflagrations. Bodies of drowned
slaves float across the chest of Robert Hayden because of his
writings about the trans-Atlantic ``middle passage'' of the early
slave trade.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher knows these details because in addition to collecting
all 311 books written by his 20 authors, he has assembled hundreds
of articles, essays and reviews about them, as well as archive
photographs. ``I wanted to get inside of them, to get to know
them,'' Fletcher said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was a difficult, sometimes frustrating endeavor, he
said. He would try one approach to a portrait, then another, and
then another. He still believes that his Sterling Brown portrait is
too stiff and gray, nor is he fully satisfied with his Ishmael
Reed. The turning point, he said, came one night when he came
across a Langston Hughes poem, ``The Negro Speaks of Rivers.''
These are the words he found:
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known rivers ancient as the world and older than the flow
of human blood in human veins.''
</P>
<P>
   It was then, he said, that he found the singular image that
connected each of his subjects. ``The river is a metaphor of pain,
sorrow,'' he wrote in an essay about his portraits. ``It turns and
flows into a river of black consciousness. It becomes joy, hope,
spirit and identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a river of song, of culture, of community, with a
strength that resists oppression and destructive stereotypes. The
river is folklore, jazz, blues and gospel. It is Mother Africa,
Harlem, Watts, Birmingham, Mississippi and the Middle Passage. From
our ancestors, the river flows through our veins.''
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, Fletcher said, the portraits are not for
sale. He intends first to spend several years showing them in
galleries and exhibitions, although he has turned them into
greeting cards and posters. He also intends to add to the series,
which he acknowledges is far from complete. Where's Terry McMillan,
or Stanley Crouch, or Walter Mosley?
</P>
<P>
   And so Fletcher continues his attic sojourns, waiting for the
magic to spring from the writers' words to his brush. ``It is a
celebration,'' he said. ``You look at these writers, what they have
done. This is total dedication, and total commitment, and
incredible courage.''

 &HT;    Georgia school votes down state flag
 &HT;    By Jennifer Brett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROSWELL, Ga. _ The day he surrendered at Appomattox, Confederate
Gen. Robert E. Lee shined his boots, put on his finest uniform and
accepted defeat with grace. Soldiers on both sides were relieved to
be heading home at last.
</P>
<P>
   Friday brought a different kind of relief to Centennial High
School in Roswell after principal Leonard Box announced the
school's students, faculty, PTA executive board and local school
advisory committee all voted to no longer fly the Georgia state
flag.
</P>
<P>
   The school will fly the U.S. flag only.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of debate and flagpole rallies by students who
disagree on the issue, students on both sides now say they are glad
to finally have the controversy behind them. Just one Fulton County
school, Roswell High School, now flies the Georgia state flag.
</P>
<P>
   Some Centennial students who voted to not fly the flag said they
hope their school can now come together.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no problem with the flag,'' said freshman Jaclynn
Bridges, 14. ``Keep it up, keep it down, whatever. Just don't show
any hate.''
</P>
<P>
   Tevia Holliday, also a 14-year-old freshman, was pleased with
the vote, but said the matter had not impassioned her.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the flag was up, it didn't really bother me,'' she said.
``It's just a flag.''
</P>
<P>
   Freshman Kim Zanone, 15, voted to keep the flag up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our state flag and it's our history,'' she said as she
surveyed the line of television trucks parked near her school.
``This whole thing's been blown out of proportion. I voted yes but
I'm glad it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Box said the school's state flag is now in the possession of the
school's Junior ROTC, which is responsible for hoisting the U.S.
flag each day. He said it would be ``set up in a respectful place
for use on appropriate occasions,'' but isn't yet sure exactly what
role, if any, the flag will play at Centennial.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a week of democratic action here at Centennial
High School,'' Box told students over the school's intercom.
``There has been freedom of expression throughout this issue. It is
time for us all to accept the decision. It is time for us to come
together.''

THOMAS FEREBEE, 81, WHO DROPPED FIRST ATOMIC BOMB 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Fla.)  (lb) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Col. Thomas W. Ferebee, the bombardier who dropped the atomic
bomb on the Japanese city of Hiroshima in World War II, died on
Thursday at his home in Windermere, Fla. He was 81.
</P>
<P>
   At 8:15:17 a.m. on Aug. 6, 1945, Ferebee, then a 26-year-old
major, pushed a lever in his B-29 Superfortress bomber, the Enola
Gay, making sure an automatic system he had activated seconds
earlier had functioned. He watched as a single 9,000-pound bomb
turned nose-down and fell toward its target, Aioi Bridge, which he
had selected from aerial photographs.
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``Bomb away!'' and 43 seconds later, when the bomb had
fallen from 31,000 feet to 1,890 feet above the target, the sky
erupted in dazzling light, and the earth soon seemed to seethe like
boiling liquid. The bomber veered away from the swirling explosion
in a steep, 150-degree turn.
</P>
<P>
   At least 80,000 Japanese were killed instantly or would
eventually die as a result of radiation from the explosion. And the
atomic age was born.
</P>
<P>
   The bombardier napped on the way back to the air base in the
Mariana Islands, just as he had on the flight to the target. He had
been asleep two hours earlier when the pilot, Col. Paul W. Tibbets,
who had named the Enola Gay after his mother, first told the crew
they were carrying an atomic bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Upon returning to the base, the two officers and the 10 other
members of the crew were greeted by numerous generals and admirals,
and immediately presented with military decorations. Three days
later, a second nuclear bomb was dropped on Nagasaki, Japan, and,
five days after that, the Japanese government surrendered, ending
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   With the passage of years, the crew that had been hailed as
heroes and national saviors became the subject of a complex debate,
as moral and political questions were increasingly raised about the
use of the bomb. They included whether an invasion of Japan really
would have cost a million American lives, as feared, and whether
Japan would have surrendered if the atomic bombs had not been
dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Adding fuel to the debate were reports in the 1950s and '60s
that a pilot named Claude Eatherly, who had flown a B-29 to scout
weather conditions over Hiroshima in advance of the Enola Gay
mission, felt remorse about the use of the bomb.
</P>
<P>
   The persistent fierceness of the debate was evident in 1995,
when the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum in
Washington pulled back from exhibiting the Enola Gay in conjunction
with a World War II exhibition; the plans were scrapped in favor of
a more neutral exposition.
</P>
<P>
   Ferebee, who retired from the Air Force in 1970, always argued
that the Hiroshima bomb was necessary. ``I'm convinced that the
bombing saved many lives by ending the war,'' he told Newsweek
magazine in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   In speeches, interviews and comments at autograph-signing
sessions that he attended in recent years, Ferebee never shifted
from this position. But he began warning against the dangers of
nuclear destruction, and used his own experience as a lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we should look back and remember what just one bomb did,
or two bombs,'' he told The Charlotte Observer in 1995, the 50th
anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima. ``Then I think we should
realize that this can't happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Wilson Ferebee, the third of 11 children, was born in
1918 and grew up on a farm outside Mocksville, a town in central
North Carolina about 20 miles southwest of Winston-Salem.
</P>
<P>
   He attended Lees-McRae College in Banner Elk, N.C., where he won
letters in track, basketball and football. A knee injury while he
was playing football kept him out of the infantry in World War II,
so he joined the Army Air Forces. After two years of flying school
he was assigned as a bombardier.
</P>
<P>
   Max Morgan Witts and Gordon Thomas, in their book ``Enola Gay''
(Stein &AMP; Day, 1966), described Ferebee as ``rakishly elegant.'' He
was 5 feet 11 inches tall, sported a mustache that made him seem
older than his 26 years, and was a crack poker player.
</P>
<P>
   He and a friend from flight school, Theodore van Kirk, a
navigator, were assigned to the same bomber crew in England.
Tibbets, then a captain, was the pilot. They flew together on the
first U.S. bombing mission over Europe; successfully attacked the
German-held oil fields of Ploesti, Romania; and led the first
bombing runs over North Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, they were selected by Tibbets for the secret project
to drop what they were told would be a devastating bomb on Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Tibbets, by then a colonel, called Ferebee ``the best bombardier
who ever looked through the eyepiece of a Norden bombsight.''
</P>
<P>
   As head of the 509th Composite Group, Tibbets, who eventually
retired as a brigadier general, commanded 1,800 men who practiced
B-29 runs under extraordinary secrecy in a variety of places. A
problem emerged during bombing practice at the Salton Sea testing
range in Southern California: Ferebee kept missing his target.
</P>
<P>
   The reason was that at the critical moment when the bomb was
released, Ferebee lifted himself off the seat to bring his eyes to
the sight. But the greater height needed to drop the atomic bomb
without also blowing up the plane meant the chance of error was
magnified.
</P>
<P>
   Tibbets' solution was to fit a padded headrest to the bombsight.
Ferebee's head was forced into exactly the same position each time.
From then on he bombed with accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1945, the 509th Composite Group were sent for
additional training to Tinian, a small island in the Marianas
captured from Japan in 1944. The men were not told that it would be
the embarkation point for their historic mission.
</P>
<P>
   But after Japan ignored an unconditional surrender demand issued
by the Allies in July 1945, the United States made plans for a
strike on Hiroshima, a city of about 300,000 people. It was chosen
as a target because it served as the headquarters for Japan's 2nd
Army, which was planning the defense of southern Japan from the
impending U.S. invasion.
</P>
<P>
   After World War II, Ferebee served as deputy wing commander for
maintenance of several B-47 Stratojet commands. He was triple-rated
as a bombardier, a navigator, and radar operator, and he served on
B-52s in the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   Ferebee's decorations include the Silver Star, the Legion of
Merit, two Distinguished Flying Crosses, the Bronze Star and the
Air Medal with 13 oak-leaf clusters.
</P>

   ATTENTION GRAPHICS EDITORS -- WEATHER CHANGE ADVISORY:
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times News Service is planning an expanded weather
package, with a planned starting date of Monday, March 20, to be
transmitted Sunday, March 19. The package, consisting of a weather
map as a graphics file and a text file to accompany the map, is
available to graphics clients of the News Service.
</P>
<P>
   The new map grows to 4 columns in width (52 picas), from 3, and
is 6 inches deep; the old was 4 inches deep. This new size permits
the insertion of cloud cover information, previously a separate
map, and the addition of many new cities.
</P>
<P>
   The map is available both in color and in black and white.
Because the map is much more detailed, we have devised an entirely
new palette of colors to make it easier to read the added
information.
</P>
<P>
   A sample of the new map is available at Wieck, Newscom,
Presslink and AP's GraphicsNet.
</P>
<P>
   Some papers using the old map may need extra time to make the
transition to a 4-column format. We will, for a limited time,
produce a 3-col version of the new map, but with only some of the
new map's additional cities.

</P>
<P>
   SPENDING IS UP, AND THE ADS ARE MORE AGGRESSIVE
</P>
<P>
   Outside interest groups have spent or have committed to spend
more than $114 million on issue advertising for this year's
elections, an unusually heavy pace, and about 40 percent of it was
for attack ads, according to a study by the Annenberg Public Policy
Center of the University of Pennsylvania. ``What we are seeing is
more issue ads that attack and more of them earlier in the
campaign,'' said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the center.
The study found that at least 60 groups had broadcast issue ads,
with health care _ particularly the patients' bill of rights _ the
primary issue. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE SENATE
</P>
<P>
   RUNOFF FOR TEXAS DEMOCRATS
</P>
<P>
   In the Democratic primary in Texas for the U.S. Senate, the top
vote-getters _ Gene Kelly, a perennial candidate, and Charles
Gandy, a former state legislator _ will face each other in a runoff
April 11. Don Clark, a computer systems analyst who was third, has
endorsed Gandy. The winner will be considered a long shot against
Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, the Republican incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   THE HOUSE
</P>
<P>
   BRAWL BREWING IN TEXAS
</P>
<P>
   The usually placid 7th Congressional District, once held by
former President George Bush when he was a member of the House in
the 1960s, is likely to see an ugly political brawl in the coming
month. With Rep. Bill Archer, the Republican who is the chairman of
the Ways and Means Committee, vacating the seat after 30 years,
state Rep. John Culberson and Peter Wareing, a businessman, are
competing in a Republican runoff April 11 that pits money against
organization. Culberson finished first in the Republican primary by
relying on grass-roots organizers but little advertising. Wareing
spent nearly $1.7 million, mostly on radio and television spots,
and finished second. Because the west Houston district is heavily
Republican, the winner will be considered a strong favorite in
November.
</P>
<P>
   COURT RULING IN NORTH CAROLINA
</P>
<P>
   Because of a ruling Thursday by the U.S. Supreme Court, North
Carolina's congressional primaries can proceed on schedule on May
2. The ruling blocked a lower court order that required the state
to redraw the 12th Congressional District before holding elections.
Last week, a three-judge panel threw the state's primary calendar
into turmoil when it ruled 2 to 1 that the district, meandering
from Charlotte to Greensboro, was an unconstitutional racial
gerrymander. The new ruling allowed elections to proceed while the
state appealed the case. Lawmakers were scheduled to redraw the
state's districts based on 2000 census data next year.
</P>
<P>
   ILLINOIS CAMPAIGN FINANCE, PART 1
</P>
<P>
   In a Republican race in the north suburbs of Chicago, 10
candidates are running in next Tuesday's primary to replace Rep.
John Porter, a Republican who is retiring. Shawn Donnelley, an heir
to a wealthy printing family, has spent nearly $2 million of her
own money. Andrew Hochberg, a businessman, has spent about $1
million. In all, some $5 million was being spent on the Republican
race. The Democrats were expected to nominate Lauren Beth Gash, a
state representative.
</P>
<P>
   OTHER STATE RACES
</P>
<P>
   ILLINOIS CAMPAIGN FINANCE, PART 2
</P>
<P>
   In a race for a seat on the Illinois Supreme Court, two
Republican candidates in next Tuesday's primary have spent more
than $1 million apiece, while a third has been mailing fliers that
bitterly criticize his foes. Bonnie Wheaton, a Circuit Court judge
in DuPage County, has drawn on family wealth to spend more than $1
million, while S. Louis Rathje, who was appointed to the state
Supreme Court a year ago, has spent a similar amount. The third
candidate, Bob Thomas, an appellate court judge who was once a
kicker for the Chicago Bears, has mailed out fliers attacking the
experience and credibility of the other candidates. The pay for a
post on the state Supreme Court, which might redraw congressional
boundaries in Illinois next year, is $147,000 a year. The sole
Democratic candidate for the court is Larry Drury, a trial lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   NORTH CAROLINA RACE TURNS NASTY
</P>
<P>
   The race for the Republican nomination for governor in the North
Carolina primary, scheduled for May 2, has taken on a rough edge.
In a television advertisement being seen statewide, one Republican
hopeful, Richard Vinroot, a former Charlotte mayor, hammered a
rival, state Rep. N. Leo Daughtry: ``Leo Daughtry bragging about
cutting taxes _ that's like Bill Clinton bragging about honesty.''
Daughtry labeled the spot a gutterball attack and predicted it
would backfire. Daughtry contended that Vinroot had a record as
mayor of siding with liberal Democrats to raise taxes. Bill Cobey,
the state chairman of the Republican Party, called on both
candidates to forgo further sniping and personal attacks. &QL;

MISSING DOG FROM TEXAS COULD BE IN VALLEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Miniature schnauzer Bo for more than 14 years led a good life with
the Ealey family of suburban Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   The Ealeys hoped to see their little dog, now in failing health
with only months to live, through his final days.
</P>
<P>
   But last month, Bo disappeared. And now Sharon Ealey believes a
crew of television cable workers installing lines in their
neighborhood snatched the dog and transported him to _ of all
places _ Tempe. The story of the Ealeys and their dog shows just
how far a family will go to retrieve a lost pet.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Bo turned up missing Feb. 18 while the Ealeys were away from
home and children chasing a ball into their yard accidently let the
dog out. Ealey had no idea where the salt-and-pep per schnauzer had
gone until she received an anonymous phone call Feb. 29. She traced
it to a pay phone in an industrial area around Wash ington Street
and Price Road in northern Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   A nervous man told Ealey that his cable crew had taken the dog
and brought it to Arizona. Saying he feared losing his job, the man
refused to reveal his name or the name of his company but promised
to send Bo back to Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would call back in 15 minutes. Ealey never heard from
him again.
</P>
<P>
   Why someone would want to steal Bo is unclear. He is nearly
blind, deaf and suffers from back problems that cause his hind legs
to drag. He is on medication for a skin condition that has now gone
untreated for eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Ealey believes the motive may have been sheer meanness.
She considers Bo special in a way that many people wouldn't
understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's such a super little dog. He deserves the right and the
dignity to die at home with people who love him,'' she said from
her home in Mesquite, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Ealey fears the dog will die if he is not returned soon _ no
questions asked. She and husband Jim have sent fliers to a friend
in Scottsdale, corporate pilot Ted Morton. He plans to post them in
the area where Bo is believed to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody knows something. . . . There's no reason for these
people not to return that dog,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no request for ransom.
</P>
<P>
   Though in poor health, Bo is still a lively and handsome
purebred dog, Ealey said. He would not have appeared feeble to his
captors.
</P>
<P>
   Ealey contacted a Dallas representa tive of AT&AMP;T Cable Services,
who she said confirmed that three cable crews had been installing
lines in her area Feb. 18. However, AT&AMP;T spokeswoman Angel Biasatti
said her company employs only local cable crews and has found no
evidence to confirm Ealey's allegations.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ealey has had the schnauzer since he was six weeks old and
daughter Janelle was 14. He slept at Janelle's side until she went
off to college at Texas Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Now 28, Janelle has a 17-month-old daughter whose first word was
``Bo'' and can't understand where Grand ma's dog has gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has absolutely torn us up,'' Ealey said, her voice
breaking. ``Bo has so much heart. He deserves to be home. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``So many people are afraid of reprisals. Little do they know I
don't care. I just want the little fellow back.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone with information about Bo can call Morton after 6 p.m. at
(480) 991-7765 or Ealey at (972) 226-4885. &QL;

SCHMID MUST SIT OUT GALAXY OPENER
</HEADLINE>
 AT BOTTOM)-LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA _ Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid will be forced to watch
tonight's Major League Soccer season opener against Colorado from
the Rose Bowl press box after league officials Friday denied his
appeal of a one-game suspension.
</P>
<P>
   The match starts at 7:30 p.m. Tickets remain available at the
stadium office.
</P>
<P>
   The league suspended Schmid and fined him $1,000 after he
criticized the referees and dared MLS to fine him following the
Galaxy's loss to D.C. United in November's MLS Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Schmid complained about the lack of fouls in the Galaxy's 2-0
loss to United, particularly the non-call when United's Roy
Lassiter shoved Robin Fraser to the turf, resulting in Fraser
suffering a broken collarbone. Schmid also was upset when no foul
was called when Cobi Jones was taken down in the penalty area.
</P>
<P>
   Schmid earlier paid the fine, but he had appealed the
suspension.
</P>
<P>
   ``The suspension is consistent with past instances concerning
verbal abuse of the referees,'' Joe Machnik, vice president of MLS
game operations, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Schmid said he felt the suspension should have been overturned.
</P>
<P>
   ``My point on the appeal is that it was something last season so
why start off the new season with a cloud over us?'' Schmid
explained. ``We're trying to look optimistically at a new season.
I've learned my lesson and I'll be quiet in the future with the
referees.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant coach Ralph Perez will assume control of the team
tonight as the Galaxy tries to erase the bad memories of the United
loss.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado enters the match in miserable shape. The Rapids were
swept by the Galaxy in the first round of last season's MLS
playoffs and bring an MLS-record 679-minute scoreless streak.
</P>
<P>
   The Rapids acquired Adin Brown, Jason Moore and Henry Zambrano
in the off-season, but at least nine of their 20 players are
injured.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy will probably be without Fraser, a four-time MLS
All-Star. He is nursing a groin injury.
</P>
<P>
   Schmid said he will likely start Ezra Hendrickson and Joey
Franchino as the outside backs, with Greg Vanney and Paul Caligiuri
at central defense.
</P>
<P>
   Midfield playmaker Mauricio Cienfuegos enters in terrific shape.
He'll be joined by Danny Pena, Simon Elliott and Roy Myers.
</P>
<P>
   Up front, Clint Mathis will play alongside Jones. Newcomer Sasha
Victorine from UCLA is expected to get plenty of playing time as a
substitute in an attacking midfield role.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he'll have a view from high above, Schmid said
season openers are tough to gauge.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always an uncertainty because nobody's quite sure what
the other team has, so you're guessing a little bit about your
opponents,'' said Schmid. ``Everybody's not sure what stage they're
at physically, mentally and so forth.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Schmid isn't worried about Cienfuegos.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be with the team from the beginning helps, especially for
me because I need to read people,'' said Cienfuegos, who was a
training camp holdout last season. ``Last year I didn't produce my
usual output. Hopefully I can get off to a good start and get eight
to 10 goals this season and my usual assists.''
</P>
<P>
   With Mexican striker Carlos Hermosillo finishing his career in
Mexico and without a replacement from the league Schmid's biggest
concern is scoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see us score goals on a consistent basis,'' said
Schmid. ``Goals change the complexity of the game, it makes
everything else sort of fit into place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping Cobi can have the type of year he had in 1998 (19
goals, 13 assists) and have the great finishing he's had with the
(U.S.) National team recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also need Clint to get 10 to 15 goals and we need five to
10 goals from Roy.''

   GALAXY UPDATE: Team officials expect a crowd of 15,000 to 20,000

win the Western Division, despite the lack of a top quality foreign
striker. Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid, who will serve a one-game
suspension for his comments about the officiating in November's MLS
Cup, said league officials are close to signing a striker from
Mexico. However, deals for Luis Hernandez, Jose Manuel Abundis and
Franicisco Palencia have apparently fallen through.
</P>
<P>
   RAPIDS UPDATE: After a great start in 1999, Colorado finished
the season with a 679-minute scoreless streak, which included
back-to-back shutout losses to the Galaxy in the first round of the
playoffs. Colorado's biggest acquisition in the off-season was
midfielder Henry Zambrano, but injuries in the preseason will make
the first month tough for the Rapids.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Outside a Gap store near Rockefeller Center late last
week, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals kicked off its
new multimillion dollar campaign against leather. Flanked by a few
dozen protesters, Chrissie Hynde, the lead singer of the
Pretenders, in black microfiber boots and a cowboy hat, held up a
sign deploring the chain's use of leather from Indian cows.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, two teen-agers from Westchester County, just outside New
York, were battling out the question that has been bugging fashion
insiders in recent weeks: Can the animal rights group make leather,
of all things, unfashionable?
</P>
<P>
   ``I totally believe that leather is totally disgusting,'' said
Sarah Stearns, 16, who became a vegetarian on New Year's Eve. She
was dressed in a vintage peasant blouse and jeans. ``I think it's
barbaric. It makes me want to throw up.''
</P>
<P>
   Her sister, Hannah, 15, shuddered beneath her oversize black
leather jacket. She was wearing imitation Fendi pony skin slides
and fingering a butter-colored suede shirt on the rack. ``You,''
she said, glancing at Sarah venomously, ``make me want to throw
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Their mother, Melanie Stearns, a social worker, smiled
painfully. ``Great,'' she said, her voice weary. ``We need a whole
new source of fights in the house. After all, the girls don't have
any fur to argue about. But I'm standing here thinking about shoes.
And belts. And how much I don't want to hear it.''
</P>
<P>
   It may seem surprising that the animal rights group is trying to
make leather the new fur now, considering the setbacks it has
suffered this last season. Dozens of designers returned to fur, and
overall fur sales rose 10 percent this winter. One might think the
group would go after more modest game. Instead, activists are
girding for what they call ``The Big One.'' They are convinced they
can coax and sloganize leather into a state of political
incorrectness.
</P>
<P>
   But that seems unlikely. Leather hasn't been as popular since
the Paleolithic period. Not only do most people consider it
synonymous with high-quality footwear, but this spring stores are
bulging with leather and exotic skins. Once seen as a winter
fabric, leather is now even being made into thin pastel suedes for
summer, washable white leather shirts and whisper-light calfskin
tankinis. Kidskin capris, Pucci slacks in pink and blue and python
sling-back shoes are best sellers at Jeffrey, the latest downtown
temple of style.
</P>
<P>
   Commune, a new restaurant in the Flatiron district, is set to
open in April with a 28-foot all-leather bar. And the April cover
of Harper's Bazaar will show the model Gisele, navel bared, in a
white Armani leather jacket. The magazine has never before put
leather on the cover so late in the year. ``Before, leather was
only seen as a sort of tough fabric, communicating only coolness
and fierceness,'' said Bazaar's editor in chief, Kate Betts. ``Now
it means everything.'' The Leather Apparel Association, a trade
group, said that leather sales have nearly tripled this decade, to
$2.7 billion last year from about $900 million in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   But there are some signs of a dissenting faction bubbling within
the core of the fashion world. People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals, or PETA, says it hopes that Stella McCartney, the Chloe
designer, will become an icon of leather-free chic. There is
widespread belief that McCartney _ the daughter of Paul and the
late Linda McCartney, staunch animal rights campaigners, and
herself a supporter of the group _ was offered the job as Gucci's
top designer but turned it down because of her aversion to working
with leather and fur. The idea that a young hot designer could
declare leather inessential to fashion sent a chill down Seventh
Avenue. ``Stella is our hero,'' said Dan Mathews, a spokesman for
PETA.
</P>
<P>
   To zero in on the mass market, the animal rights group is
targeting the Gap in spite of the fact that the chain is not the
country's biggest leather retailer and gets only 10 percent of its
leather from India. The Gap offers a public relations opportunity.
Some months ago, the company, unfamiliar with Hynde's longtime
public support of animal rights, wrote the singer a letter, seeking
permission to use one of her songs in a commercial for its
``Everyone in Leather'' campaign. PETA orchestrated a media blitz,
releasing the letter just as it began its first nationwide round of
protests.
</P>
<P>
   Why single out Indian imports when China has also been
criticized roundly in the international press for its treatment of
cows and sells more than 10 times the amount of leather to
manufacturers in the United States? Because in many parts of India,
cows are sacred. Making martyrs of Indian religious symbols is
meant to appeal to those who embrace such fashionable spiritual
concerns as yoga, Free Tibet and Cabala.
</P>
<P>
   Even the spiritually stylish may balk at surrendering their
skins. Unlike fur, leather is a byproduct of meat. Many people
sympathetic to the plight of furry little chinchillas seem to draw
the line at cows and sheep, whose flesh is also put to use. ``I
have raised money for PETA, and I don't wear fur,'' said Marie
Carr, a shoe designer from Seattle who was in Manhattan last week
on a scouting trip. ``But I'm sorry: I'm not a vegetarian, and I
just don't have a problem wearing leather. I'm comfortable with
that line.''
</P>
<P>
   That distinction has been echoed lately by several models,
including Trish Goff and Audrey Marnay, who have told designers
that they will wear only the fur or skin of animals that are eaten.
Mathews said he got fed up with fickle models and designers during
the anti-fur campaign of PETA. Bruised by the defections of former
supporters like Naomi Campbell and Donna Karan, the animal rights
group is cultivating new Hollywood friends like Drew Barrymore and
Pamela Anderson Lee.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who once wore plenty of leather herself and has been in an
on-again, off-again marriage with Tommy Lee, the leather-loving
member of Motley Crue, narrates the group's new video about the
abuse of Indian cows.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, whether leather can be rendered unfashionable may
depend less on moral arm-twisting or celebrity cheerleading than on
technology. There are more leather alternatives available now than
ever before. Gone is the cheap vinyl, plastic-looking pleather and
stifling rubber of the 1970s and 80s. Huge advances in fabric
technology have produced new artificial materials that are almost
indistinguishable from real animal skin and are somewhat cheaper.
Other cellulose-based products, which are in fact a little more
expensive than leather, even breathe like natural fibers,
manufacturers claim.
</P>
<P>
   Some young, urban companies _ often bellwethers for wider trends
_ are churning out fake-leather goods to meet popular demand. In
January, Dr. Martens, the London-based company whose hulking black
leather lace-up boots came to define the punk movement, began to
make a nonleather ``vegetarian'' version of its two most popular
models. Made of Lorica, a cellulose-based fiber from Spain, they
are 15 percent more expensive than leather Dr. Martens, retailing
for about $135. Now available in only 50 stores and on some Web
sites, the shoes are set to get wider distribution as soon as Dr.
Martens can meet demand. The shoes are sold out until June.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Thome, a Dr. Martens spokesman, said that for years the
company had been getting an escalating number of requests for
nonleather Dr. Martens, but until recently, there was no material
sufficiently comfortable and enough like leather to use. He said he
saw no conflict in a company's built on the nihilistic anti-hippie
ethos of punk now making a so-called vegetarian shoe. Most Dr.
Martens employees, including Thome, are 30 or younger, and he said
the company prefers to think of the new shoes as ``yet another way
we're rooted in alternative culture.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he believes that ``the anti-P.C. thing is very two years
ago,'' adding, ``Social consciousness is set for a comeback as soon
as the stock market tanks.''
</P>
<P>
   The rap impresario and clothing designer Russell Simmons, whose
Phat Farm apparel is among the most sought-after by boys in the
'hood and in the 'burbs, said he is also producing two new ``PETA
friendly'' lines. No Animal Phat Farm, a collection of ``extremely
expensive,'' real-looking fake furs for his women's line, will be
introduced this fall. Skins, a men's line of jackets and suits made
from cottons and vinyls but treated to look like leather, will soon
be shipped to stores. The crown jewel of that collection will be a
vinyl suit with Phat Farm logos. The inspiration, Simmons said, was
``my childhood obsession with Louis.''
</P>
<P>
   Not Armstrong. Vuitton.
</P>
<P>
   But Simmons, whose interest in producing nonanimal product lines
came from his recent conversion to veganism, the strict sort of
vegetarianism (no dairy, no wool clothing, no fish) espoused by
PETA, acknowledges that it will be tough to wean urban youths from
their love of leather. Even his own business plan points up the
essentially quixotic nature of the anti-leather quest. Much of the
Phat Farm line is made of leather and will continue to be. Despite
his own bias, the sales are too robust to pass up ``just yet,'' he
said, adding that he is committed eventually to abandon it.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Simmons' own life, leather is a hard habit to break. ``I
admit I'm wearing leather shoes,'' he said in a phone interview.
``And sometimes at a party I may even go for a shrimp. I'm not
perfect, but I'm striving to be, like we say in yoga. Basically,
life is aspirational. I think you can still be against leather
while you are wearing it.''

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 19)  
 (af)  
 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Three years ago, Fruit of the Loom was trading at $44
a share, and nobody was questioning William F. Farley.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there had been smirks years before, when the hunky chief
executive donned underwear to star in a television commercial, and
raised eyebrows about a man who once touted himself as White House
material. But investors cared more about a company that ranked No.
14 in the Fairchild 100 survey of the world's most recognizable
fashion brands. And analysts cheered a new marketing slogan,
``Everybody Loves Fruit.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Fruit of the Loom wallowing in Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection and the company's shares down to $1.31 on Friday, nobody
loves Fruit. And all fingers are pointing at Farley.
</P>
<P>
   A growing band of critics say there were signs everywhere that
Farley, a veteran of the hugely leveraged takeovers of the 1980s,
had been steering the company toward disaster for years.
</P>
<P>
   They point, now, to a 1998 class-action lawsuit that charged
Farley and other executives with insider trading; to $103 million
in personal loans guaranteed for Farley by the company; to bloated
pay packages and rich deals with Farley's private company; to
simple mismanagement of underwear sewing plants.
</P>
<P>
   Yet much of this had been disclosed in Fruit of the Loom's
regulatory filings, and none of it stopped bankers from lending
Farley tens of millions of dollars to solidify his control of the
company. Or Wall Street analysts from enthusiastically recommending
the stock to investors. Or respected investment banks from
underwriting hundreds of millions of dollars in bonds, even as the
company was coming unglued.
</P>
<P>
   After years of inaction, and some would say complicity, the
board of directors finally ousted Farley last Aug. 30. Four months
later, the company filed for bankruptcy protection. By then,
investors were out billions. On Friday, Fruit of the Loom said it
lost $576 million in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The financial world's failure to call a halt to the high jinks
appears to be one more example of Wall Street's capacity to be
blinded by charm _ and by stories it wants to believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look back and say I should have never done it,'' said Donald
Yacktman of Yacktman Asset Management, a big shareholder. ``It was
a big brand name, and it's hard to believe a company with this kind
of market share could get killed like this.''
</P>
<P>
   But it did. Today the fate of Fruit of the Loom is being played
out in two locales _ a Delaware bankruptcy court, and at the
company's operational headquarters in Bowling Green, Ky., where a
former executive has been called out of retirement to pick up the
pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Fruit of the Loom, a brand name first used by a Warwick, R.I.,
textile mill in 1856, has asked the bankruptcy court for permission
to begin liquidating Farley's assets. The company wants to use the
proceeds to pay down a $65 million personal loan it guaranteed for
Farley last year, and became liable for when he stopped making
payments himself.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview a few weeks ago, his first since he was removed
as chief executive, Farley, 57, defended his tenure and insisted
his conduct was beyond reproach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a day goes by when I don't think about it,'' he said
wistfully, ``the questions of what could have been done, could we
have escaped this ugly situation.''
</P>
<P>
   But people are forgetting, he said, that he was the visionary
who acquired Fruit of the Loom in a leveraged buyout in 1985 and
built its sales to $2 billion. Blaming directors and managers for
foiling his plans, he is threatening legal action, too, saying the
company owes him about $100 million in severance and pension
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Only one outside director of the company responded to telephone
calls about the board's oversight of Fruit of the Loom, and of
Farley. ``It's a besmirch on my long history of integrity and
honesty,'' said Henry A. Johnson, a director since 1988 and the
retired chief executive of Spiegel Inc., the catalog retailer.
``But I'll have to live with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the fall, Bill Farley was living the high life.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, Forbes magazine listed him as one of the richest
Americans. He had a ski house near Aspen, Colo., a home in
Kennebunkport, Maine., and a lavish apartment on Lake Shore Drive
in Chicago, where he played host to President Clinton at a 1998
Democratic fund-raiser. He dated the 1989 Miss America (he was one
of the judges who picked her) before meeting Shelley McArthur, a
Chicago model and singer who is now his fourth wife.
</P>
<P>
   Farley grew up in Pawtucket, R.I., the football playing son of a
postal worker, and said once, ``I want to create companies in my
own image.'' He pursued that vision at Fruit of the Loom. Obsessed
with fitness, he installed athletic facilities at company plants.
Cigarette machines were banned, and meetings often began with
Farley leading his managers in aerobics.
</P>
<P>
   He was charming and energetic, a deal maker _ ``Dale Carnegie
personified,'' said one former colleague. But much of his wealth
was tied to the stock of Fruit of the Loom. And things began to
unravel there in 1997, when the company, which also owns the BVD
brand, was facing stiff competition from apparel makers like Hanes,
a division of the Sara Lee Corp.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Farley's top executives were busy selling Wall
Street on a massive revamping effort that would reduce costs by
moving sewing operations offshore. To demonstrate management's
confidence in the company's long-term prospects, Fruit repurchased
$173 million worth of its own stock.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts rallied behind Fruit of the Loom, helping
bolster the shares to nearly an all-time high in the spring of
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Just then, however, top executives began unloading huge blocks
of their own holdings, some 1.4 million shares worth $46 million.
And Farely did the bulk of the insider selling. He cashed in $39
million, most of it in April, May and June.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The timing was prescient. In early July, Farley and other
executives told analysts that something had gone terribly wrong and
that profits would not meet expectations. Second-quarter profits
tumbled, and by year's end there were losses of nearly $400
million.
</P>
<P>
   The ensuing stock sell-off prompted the class-action suit by
shareholders. Their lawyers argued that in early 1997, the top
executives misled investors by painting a deceivingly rosy picture
of the company's prospects, even as they dumped their own shares.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed in federal court in Kentucky, also asserts that
executives won those shares as bonuses by fraudulently bolstering
the company's performance in 1996, flooding retailers with
inventory and booking sales before customers paid. That gimmick
artificially inflated earnings late in the year, the suit says,
allowing top executives to qualify for stock options.
</P>
<P>
   The company is fighting the suit. Farley says ``the case is
absolutely without merit.''
</P>
<P>
   The company made a modest recovery in early 1998; jobs were
slashed and Fruit of the Loom announced that it would create a
parent company in the Cayman Islands to greatly reduce its tax
costs. Soon, though, the chief financial officer and the chief
operating officer resigned, and over the next year, there were
constant foul-ups as the shift to offshore production careened out
of control.
</P>
<P>
   Ethan Schwartz, an analyst at Credit Research and Trading LLC,
an independent research firm in Greenwich, Conn., said that in the
middle of last year, he called some of Fruit of the Loom's
suppliers to ask about its operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 300 to 500 spinning machines were inefficient,'' he
said. ``I talked to knitters who said they talked to Fruit and were
given contradictory information about what to make and what color
to use.''
</P>
<P>
   Already heavily leveraged, with more than $1 billion in
long-term debt, the company's bloated expenses caused cash-flow
problems. By the middle of last year, its debt rating had plummeted
into junk bond territory, and the stock price sank below $5 a
share.
</P>
<P>
   Several executives blame Farley for the missteps; the deal
maker, they say, was not much of a manager. In an interview, Farley
conceded that the restructuring was botched, but says his
executives and board should have gone along with his plan to move
production offshore three years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   And these were certainly tough times in the basic apparel
business. Low-cost producers like Gildan Activewear, a Canadian
company that went public in 1998, were gaining market share, while
others, like the Starter Corp., were driven out of business.
</P>
<P>
   By last summer, even Farley's hand-picked board was fed up. At a
meeting in Chicago, the board fired Farley, though he still
controlled about 30 percent of the company's voting stock. Dennis
S. Bookshester, a long-time board member, was named acting chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, John J. Ray, the company's general counsel,
said there was no mystery in the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the operating results speak for themselves,'' he said.
``They were abysmal.''
</P>
<P>
   It was only logical to blame Farley: he ran Fruit of the Loom
like an emperor, according to interviews with more than a dozen
former company executives. Besides selecting the board, he used
company money to buy art for corporate offices and his home, gave
Fruit's money to his favorite charities, even controlled a portion
of the pension fund investments, picking the stocks himself.
</P>
<P>
   He was among the nation's highest paid chief executives,
according to Graef Crystal, the compensation expert, who has called
Farley a ``perennial compensation abuser.'' Farley earned over $40
million from 1996 to 1998, even though Fruit lost $103 million over
those years.
</P>
<P>
   Any criticism of his pay, Farley says, is purely subjective.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are free to think whatever they want to think about its
adequacy,'' he said. ``I think my compensation was fair and
obviously the board did.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in 1994, the company guaranteed three personal loans
totaling $103 million for Farley. He acknowledges using some of the
money for personal purchases and investments. Some of it, former
executives said, went to expand his Chicago apartment.
</P>
<P>
   A $26 million loan in 1998 allowed Farley to buy back securities
owned by Leon D. Black, formerly one of his bankers at Drexel
Burnham Lambert. He is now a partner at the Apollo Management
investment firm in New York.
</P>
<P>
   That debt was convertible into shares of Farley Inc., Foley's
private holding company, which went into bankruptcy protection in
1991 with Fruit of the Loom voting stock in its portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing that Black might gain control of Farley Inc., and thus
the Fruit of the Loom shares, and block the Cayman Islands move,
Farley said the board asked him to take out the loan to reacquire
Black's shares.
</P>
<P>
   Ray, the company's general counsel, disputes that account.
</P>
<P>
   The $65 million loan that the board guaranteed a year ago was
intended in part to refinance the two earlier loans, according to
the company.
</P>
<P>
   Farley is unapologetic about the loans, which he says are
standard perks in corporate America. ``Go look it up,'' he says.
``It's not unusual for a corporation to loan a senior executive
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial specialists disagree. ``This is most unusual,'' says
Donald Sullivan, a retired compensation expert who worked for many
years for the Towers Perrin management consulting firm in New York.
``Private companies making loans is another matter, but public
companies _ not very often.''
</P>
<P>
   Farley's private companies also billed more than $100 million to
Fruit of the Loom for management and investment banking fees
between 1985 and 1996, according to company filings.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement, which began when Fruit of the Loom was a
private company, was canceled in 1996, after complaints from
institutional investors and several board members, according to
former executives. Farley called the issue ``ancient history,''
saying the fees were charged ``at cost.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Investors remained skeptical. Last September, the Council of
Institutional Investors, which represents large pension funds,
criticized Fruit of the Loom's corporate governance practices.
Among other things, the group objected to the Cayman Islands move,
because it resulted in big tax bills for investors but a nontaxable
provision for Farley's preferred shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not exactly a shareholder democracy in action,'' said Peg
O'Hara, a spokeswoman at the council in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, the fall of Fruit of the Loom seems almost
preordained. But few recognized the alarm bells.
</P>
<P>
   Though the company's finances began deteriorating in 1997, Wall
Street analysts never turned against the company. There were no
``sell'' signals, no reports that questioned management or the
company's long-term prospects. In fact, when Fruit's stock
collapsed in the early part of 1999, analysts viewed it as a buying
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day on Bloomberg it said, `Here's Fruit of the Loom at
six times earnings,' and people said: `Six times earnings? How do I
get some of that?' And soon, there were no earnings,'' said Matthew
Hershberg, an analyst at Standard &AMP; Poor's.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say they saw the problems but were persuaded that
better times were ahead. ``It was always possible to come up with a
scenario where the numbers made sense,'' said John Pickler, an
analyst at Prudential Securities. Farley was, after all, a master
salesman. ``I've seen Bill turn around a group of investors who
were skeptical going into a meeting,'' Pickler said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, corporate bankers were propping up the company. In
1997, Bank of America led a syndicate that financed the company
with a $660 million revolving loan. Fruit of the Loom drew that
loan down to nearly zero during 1999.
</P>
<P>
   There was a $660 million revolving loan that the company was
drawing down in 1999. And five months before the Chapter 11 filing,
in March 1999, Bank of America and Credit Suisse First Boston led
the sale of a $250 million public debt offering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was amazed they were able to do that $250 million placement,
because if you read the financials, the cash flow was already
deteriorating,'' said Debra Downie, an analyst at Miller Tabak
Roberts Securities, a bond dealer in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Several bankers said privately that due-diligence efforts failed
to turn up troubling signs that would have stopped the deals. The
banks, they say, did not mislead investors in the bond offering,
which was clearly described as ``high yield.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the bonds were sold, Fruit of the Loom announced a
$9 million loss for the first quarter of 1999, and the price of the
bonds collapsed on the open market. They are now trading for
pennies on the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Why didn't bankers speak up? Hershberg at Standard &AMP; Poor's
laughed. ``The fact is, Fruit of the Loom was a golden goose of the
banking business,'' he said. ``How many bankers are going to say:
`I forecast a long-term bankruptcy?'''
</P>
<P>
   The company, operating on $650 million in new emergency
financing from Bank of America, is trying to rid itself of less
productive units. It has liquidated its Pro Player sports apparel
division; its name is expected to come down from the Miami
Dolphins' football stadium. Last week, pink slips went out to 280
employees at its Frankfort, Ky., plant, which is being closed.
</P>
<P>
   Besides tangling with Farley over his loan guarantees and
severance, the company is also pursuing other claims against him,
including the possibility that he used company resources for a
Czech MIG fighter plane he owned and stored at a Fruit hanger in
Bowling Green, according to lawyers familiar with the case.
</P>
<P>
   Fruit of the Loom has hired Christie's to appraise some of the
art that Farley bought for the company, including four pieces by
Frank Stella and a Roy Lichtenstein print.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are hoping a white knight will ride in to rescue the
Fruit of the Loom brand. Women's Wear Daily has reported that
Wal-Mart may be interested. Aris Industries, which owns the Members
Only trademark, has also held talks with Fruit of the Loom,
according to executives close to the discussions. Wal-Mart and Aris
declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   John B. Holland, who has come out of retirement to assume his
old post as chief operating officer, says things are looking up at
Fruit of the Loom. ``We're trying to manage the areas where there
can be real cost improvements,'' he said. Demand is solid, he says,
but profit projections are hard.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Farley is spending many of his days in half-deserted
offices high above Chicago, on the 50th floor of the Sears Tower.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent afternoon, one side of his old suite was filled with
boxes ready to be shipped to Fruit of the Loom, which was
officially headquartered in these rooms.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the suite is Farley Inc., his old holding
company, which has few holdings but large pension liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   He also has trimmed back his personal holdings. His yacht,
``L'Acquisition,'' was sold a few years ago. More recently, he sold
Hammersmith Farms, the 50-acre Rhode Island estate where Jacqueline
Bouvier grew up.
</P>
<P>
   He isn't facing personal bankruptcy, Farley said, but called his
situation ``ugly as sin.'' His huge holdings in Fruit of the Loom,
which he borrowed against over and over, are nearly worthless now.
</P>
<P>
   Yet on this day, he is tanned and dapper, wearing a Versace
suit. The optimism has not worn thin: he's still committed to Fruit
of the Loom, where he remains a director, to his wife and their
5-year-old son, Liam. And he's resilient. ``What I do every day is
I get up and I say, `Suck it up,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a reflective moment, he concedes that the whole leverage game
was wrong, that it was too complicated. Stock is a much more
straightforward currency, he says. Investments in biotechnology,
telecommunications, media and Internet companies are already in his
plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can start your own e-commerce company and sell it at
infinity,'' he exults, pacing a conference room next to his office.
``I'm saying the deals I'm going to do now are going to be all
equity, no debt. Or virtually no debt.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a promise, he says.

   The Ernest Hemingway Collection of home furnishings broke new
ground when it was introduced last May. It was the first in memory
to be named for a literary figure. Sales were so hot that Brian
Carroll of Furniture Today, a trade publication, called it one of
the most successful new lines in industry history. Since then,
consumers have frequently stopped in to Ethan Allen stores to ask
about the line.
</P>
<P>
   The only trouble is, it is made by Thomasville Furniture, not
Ethan Allen.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Adams, Thomasville's senior vice president for marketing,
can laugh about the confusion because sales are so strong: $100
million retail in the first year, twice the industry benchmark for
a big success and by far the best ever for Thomasville.
</P>
<P>
   He said the mix up might be attributable to Ethan Allen far
outspending Thomasville's $25 million annual advertising budget and
the fact that Ethan Allen is better known to consumers. Ethan Allen
declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Licensing is hot in home furnishings, but the licensed names are
usually those of designers like Alexander Julian. Hemingway was far
from an obvious choice: ``Let's face it, the guy's got some
baggage,'' Carroll said. ``But the romance of it took off.''
</P>
<P>
   So is an F. Scott Fitgerald line far behind? Marla A. Metzner,
president of Fashion Licensing of America, the New York agency that
works with both authors' estates, said she was already working on
it.

   That BMW was able to find someone willing to take Rover off its
hands surprised many in the auto industry. But few captured its
motivation quite as succinctly as Car, the British auto magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Its March issue, printed weeks before a deal was in sight,
observed: ``It's a scary thought, but if BMW had paid each of
Rover's employees 30,000 pounds to stay at home last year, the
company would have lost less money.''
</P>
<P>
   The magazine also said BMW had an offer from Volkswagen to swap
Rover for equity stakes in Seat, Audi and Skoda, but no cash.

GOOD TIMES PROVE BRIEF FOR AN IRISH FACTORY TOWN  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 19) 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: This is a sidebar to FRUIT-OF-THE-LOOM)  
 (af)  
 By BRIAN LAVERY

<P>
   MILFORD, Ireland _ The old Fruit of the Loom plant here is a
short walk from the center of town, just past an elementary school,
on a winding country road lined with stone walls and tumbling
yellow gorse bushes.
</P>
<P>
   Employees used to joke about how the factory windows overlooked
the white and black crosses of the local cemetery. Now the
symbolism is too rich to mention without a bitter grin.
</P>
<P>
   The plant is one of four Fruit of the Loom sites that closed
last year in County Donegal. More than half of the company's
roughly 2,000 Irish employees have lost their jobs in the turmoil
that has accompanied its Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its remote location in the north of Ireland and its
proximity to sectarian violence, Donegal has seldom enjoyed
prosperous times. But Fruit of the Loom's arrival in 1987 seemed a
godsend.
</P>
<P>
   ``People saw a light at the end of the tunnel,'' said Bridie
Burns, who worked for 12 years at the principal location, in the
town of Buncrana. ``There was nothing else there.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the locals' role as a tiny cog in the global economy has
hit home. ``The rag trade is a risky business,'' said Jim Sheridan,
a county councilor in Buncrana. ``People came to terms with the
fact that a multinational has a certain life span.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything started on the right foot, as Fruit of the Loom
acquired W.P. McCarter &AMP; Co., a textile manufacturer. John
McCarter, who with his brother Willy had taken over the company
from their uncle, described the combination as ``a very willing and
good match'' _ a partnership to jump-start the local economy.
</P>
<P>
   By maintaining impeccable labor relations and a commitment to
local communities, Fruit of the Loom tied itself to the region. It
sponsored soccer teams and St. Patrick's Day parades.
</P>
<P>
   McCarter and his brother were ousted from the company six years
later in an episode that Burns compared to ``a death in the
family.'' But workers and union officials attribute the company's
woes to vague management issues like poor communication and a
failure to motivate workers, not on William F. Farley and his
executive team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't criticize Farley, because he came from America and
put this here, and we got 12 good years out of it,'' said Nuala
Lynch, a union steward at the plant in Malin Head.
</P>
<P>
   Only sewing plants have been closed _ leaving behind industrial
operations like dyeing and spinning. Nearly all who lost their jobs
are women. Now living on generous severance packages, most families
have yet to feel the economic impact. But they are anxious about
the future.
</P>
<P>
   When she was laid off in January, Eithne Fullerton, 60, had
spent 28 years working for the McCarter Co. and Fruit of the Loom,
earning a little over $300 a week. Her 27-year-old son, Patrick,
who has worked at the Buncrana plant since he was 14, sometimes
brings home more than $375 a week, but he is moving out soon to get
married. Her husband hasn't worked in 18 years, after two hip
replacements.
</P>
<P>
   With unemployment in Donegal at 22 percent _ compared with a
national average of less than 5 percent _ emigration again
threatens to depopulate the region. The Irish government, which
owns the closed plants, is busily courting new employers and hopes
to retrain residents to work in tourism and information
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, some of the laid-off workers, aware that Irish
cities are thriving, say Dublin's efforts are too little, too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that the government have forgotten about this part of
the world,'' said Lynch, 47, now working part time as a substitute
clerk in the post office in Malin. ``They promised us the sun, the
moon, and the stars, and we haven't seen any one of them.''

BOOTSTRAPPING ACQUISITIONS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 19)

<P>
   In 1976, William F. Farley took over his first company, buying
the Anaheim Citrus Corp. for $1.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Just $25,000 was his own money; the rest was borrowed. In 1985,
he vaulted into the pantheon of corporate raiders when, backed by
Drexel Burnham Lambert, he bought Northwest Industries Inc., the
Chicago-based conglomerate that owned Fruit of the Loom.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, again with backing from Drexel, he undertook a
$3 billion hostile takeover of West Point-Pepperell Inc., the
textile maker in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Farley won control of the company, but the deal ended in
disaster after the collapse of the junk bond market in the early
1990s. Both West Point-Pepperell and Farley's holding company,
Farley Inc., were forced into Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was that his only setback. Condec, a defense contractor he
controlled, sought bankruptcy protection in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   And the Acme Boot Co., which Fruit of the Loom sold to Farley in
1987, suffered huge losses in the late 1990s, before Farley sold it
off.

ANGELS WILL BE CAREFUL WITH ORTIZ
</HEADLINE>
 AT BOTTOM)-LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX, Ariz. -- Pitcher Ramon Ortiz (slight tear of labrum in
right shoulder) and Jarrod Washburn (strained oblique muscle in
right side) played catch with each other for seven minutes Friday
morning as manager Mike Scioscia, pitching coach Bud Black and
trainer Ned Bergert watched.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good today, my arm feels very good, it'll be OK,''
Ortiz said. ``I work too hard every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Ortiz's optimism, the Angels say they will be cautious
with him. He'll throw off the mound either Monday or Tuesday, then
evaluate from there. If all is well, he could pitch in a game by
next weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that is predicated on Ortiz telling the truth about
how his shoulder feels. Scioscia said he isn't worried about Ortiz
not being honest.
</P>
<P>
   ``(If there is pain) there is going to be warning signs,''
Scioscia said. ``If it's bothering him, he's not going to be able
to mask it and say he feels good when he doesn't. If we find out
he's feeling symptoms again we'll have to take another look at
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Washburn's rehab will take much longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a little more long term that we hoped,'' Scioscia said.
``When it is (that he'll be OK) we don't know. The key is
patience.''
</P>
<P>
   Having patience is tough for Washburn, who had been looking
forward to competing for a spot in the starting rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate being hurt,'' Washburn said. ``It's not easy for me to
deal with. I can't win a spot if I'm hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels expect Washburn to be out until May.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Todd Greene played long toss with Scioscia Friday,
taking a step forward after too many steps backwards regarding his
twice-surgically repaired right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Greene is trying convince the Angels to keep three catchers,
because that's the only way he'll make the team. If the Angels
decide on a different third catcher or simply go with two (Bengie
Molina and Matt Walbeck), Greene's career with the Angels probably
would be finished.
</P>
<P>
   Greene is out of options and could request free agency instead
of accepting a trip to the minors.
</P>
<P>
   Greene doesn't have much time to prove to the club that he's
healthy enough to catch. He's started only two games behind the
plate this spring. In one of them he went five innings but was so
sore the next day he hasn't caught again since.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be able to see what he can do behind the plate,''
Scioscia said. ``And we're not at that point yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Dickson started and went 4 1/3 innings in the Angels' 8-3
loss to the Milwaukee Brewers Friday at Maryvale Baseball Park. For
Dickson, who is trying to show the club he's regained his command
after shoulder surgery, the results were mixed.
</P>
<P>
   Dickson threw three scoreless innings, then gave up two runs in
the fourth and two more in the fifth, coming out with one out in
the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   With only two starts to go before the end of camp, Dickson is
likely to start the season at extended spring or in triple-A.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue he needs to pay a lot of attention to is keeping the
ball down as he gets further into the game,'' Scioscia said.
</P>
<P>
   Another off-season shoulder surgery recipient -- Troy Percival
-- gave up back-to-back home runs to Geoff Jenkins and Lyle Mouton
in his one inning of work Friday. Pervical was clocked at 95 mph on
one pitch, but the ones hit out were closer to 89-90 mph.
</P>
<P>
   More shoulder surgery: Outfielder Jeff DaVanon (left) and Mike
Colangelo (right) both had surgery Friday to repair torn labrums.
... The Angels released infielders Archi Cianfrocco and Carlos
Garcia on Friday.

   TOKYO _ Tucked amid the instant noodles, pantyhose and canned
drinks at the local Lawson, Japan's second-largest convenience
store chain, customers now find a computer terminal that gives them
access to a system called Loppi. With a few stabs at the keyboard,
they can order concert tickets, make train and plane reservations
and pay at the cash register on the way out.
</P>
<P>
   Need a book? Seven-Eleven Japan, the country's largest
convenience store operator, lets a customer hop online to
eShopping! Books, a site owned by Softbank, Seven-Eleven, Yahoo!
Japan and Tohan, Japan's leading book distributor. A day or so
later, on the way home from work perhaps, the customer picks up the
selection and pays for it at the local Seven-Eleven.
</P>
<P>
   Seven-Eleven _ with the Seven spelled out, unlike its American
counterpart _ can also help with elderly parents. Just order a meal
online and the company will deliver it.
</P>
<P>
   With no further room to expand physically in this densely packed
country and with competition intensifying as new stores cannibalize
old, the neighborhood convenience store, or ``conbini,'' is betting
on the new economy in Japan, moving to embrace technology. Long
accustomed to adding some 50 new products to its merchandise mix
every week on average, the conbini is fast grabbing hunks of
cyberspace to expand its limited shelf space.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, deregulation that has been unfolding since the
mid-1990s is allowing Japanese convenience stores to encroach on
territory long out of their reach, like beauty and health aids and
banking.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last year, the convenience store has become an
indispensable part of the mosaic that is electronic commerce,''
said Kenyu Adachi, director of the distribution industry division
of the Ministry of Trade and Industry. ``Without the convenience
store, e-commerce in Japan would have more trouble taking off.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Adachi and his ministry express a more tempered
enthusiasm for e-tailing in Japan than do investors, who have, at
least initially, bid up the stocks of any Japanese company remotely
associated with the Internet and information technology to
astonishing levels.
</P>
<P>
   A study last year by the ministry and Andersen Consulting
concluded that while e-commerce in Japan would one day enjoy the
same market share it has in the United States, Japan's less
developed information technology infrastructure and its still
significant regulatory hurdles would mean a much slower rollout.
</P>
<P>
   But the big convenience store chains, which have the lion's
share of the market, are adding new ``virtual'' services and
connections at such a clip that analysts complain they cannot keep
track of it all. Almost simultaneously, the major chains have begun
introducing Internet strategies, raising questions about the
profitability of such ventures.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Convenience stores have a special place in Japanese society,
where tiny homes with space for only miniature refrigerators and
minimal storage make frequent shopping a necessity. Because of its
size, averaging about 100 square meters, the convenience store
escaped the reach of Japanese regulators and thus can be far
nimbler and more responsive to customer whims and fancies than its
larger brethren.
</P>
<P>
   At Seven-Eleven, inventory is controlled by some of the most
sophisticated inventory management and technology. Plus, unlike
other stores, most conbini are open round the clock.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 33,000 convenience stores throughout the
country and traffic in them is high: Some 900 people a day visit
the average Seven-Eleven store, while two other large chains,
FamilyMart and the Circle K Japan unit of UNY Corp., have about 700
customers a day. (Lawson, part of the Japanese retailer Daiei Inc.,
does not make its numbers available.) Makoto Usui, director and
general manager of information systems at Seven-Eleven, said the
average customer visits a Seven-Eleven store once every other day.
</P>
<P>
   The bonds are deep. When Hidetoshi Nakata, the Japanese soccer
star who plays for Rome, was asked an interview what he most missed
about home, he answered, ``Conbini.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Convenience stories' ubiquity and popularity make them
attractive partners to the many virtually unknown e-commerce
companies out there, whose biggest expense is likely to be
marketing. ``They have a huge advantage over the typical Internet
start-up,'' said Mike Allen, a retail analyst at ING Barings in
Tokyo. ``The biggest cost that has prevented dot-com companies from
making money is promotion, and convenience stores have almost no
promotional costs because customers flock to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The conbini have helped Japanese e-commerce pioneers like
Softbank Corp. and Rakuten Ichiba, an online bazaar, leap two major
hurdles: payment and delivery. Japanese consumers are more
reluctant than their American counterparts to send their credit
card account numbers out into cyberspace. And the product orders
can piggyback onto the stores' existing distribution system.
</P>
<P>
   The conbini also give consumers access to a computer terminal.
Though computers have been selling at a blistering pace here of
late, penetration is still lower than in the United States and
Internet access charges are still high in comparison with those in
other parts of the world. And though conbini customers cannot yet
surf the entire World Wide Web, they soon will be able to.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does a convenience store have that makes it attractive to
us and our customers?'' said Yasuhiro Suzuki, president and chief
executive of e-Shopping Information Corp., the Softbank unit that
manages e-commerce ventures. ``In a word, convenience.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Operations like Suzuki's would, in turn, appear to solve a major
problem for Japanese convenience stores: the lack of space. The
only way they have kept sales moving forward is by opening more
stores; in general, sales in stores open at least one year are
falling. But there are few practical locations left.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The backdrop of expanding our business to include e-commerce
is the need to expand our current offering of goods and services
and increase our ability to meet the needs of customers without
expanding our space,'' said Usui of Seven-Eleven.
</P>
<P>
   Whether e-commerce will help the convenience stores become more
profitable is unclear. Take the introduction of so-called energy
drinks. Previously sold only in drugstores, convenience stores
started selling the vitamin- and herb-laced drinks last spring,
when deregulation opened the market to them.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the addition of beer and sake to the merchandise mix
five years ago, the introduction of energy drinks has not
significantly increased the stores' overall revenues. While sales
of the new product have met projections, they merely replaced those
of the other items that previously occupied the selling space.
</P>
<P>
   Though those constraints do not exist in cyberspace, there, too,
profitability may be a problem. E-Shopping! Books, the joint
venture, was billed as a baby Amazon.com, but sales so far are
minuscule: as of the end of January, each Seven-Eleven store was
selling four books every 10 days on average.
</P>
<P>
   Suzuki said that represented a quadrupling in volume since the
service started in November, and added, ``The progress we've seen
in the business has been better than expected.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was confident the business would turn profitable, in
part because its cost structure may be lower than Amazon.com's.
E-Shopping! Books does not shoulder the costs of warehousing
merchandise, since it can use Tohan's and Seven-Eleven's
warehouses, and it pays for the books only after they have been
sold. The business will also share the e-shopping! name,
administrative functions and technological infrastructure with
Softbank's online toy and car parts businesses, as well as others
introduced in the future, cutting marketing and administrative
costs.

   ``A newcomer to the business would have a tough time finding
temporary warehousing for delivery to customers, but convenience
stores can act as the final pick-up point quite easily because of
their infrastructure,'' said Ken Sakamura, a professor at Tokyo
University. ``They already have warehouses.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But while such teamwork lowers costs, it also means that
profits, should they materialize, have to be divided.
</P>
<P>
   The same sort of division of the spoils has so far, in an
experimental stage, proved unprofitable for the conbini. Although
polls show that consumers here have long wished for automated
teller machines in convenience stores, they have not used the
A.T.M.'s enough in the few months they have been available to make
it worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   The machines allow customers to do everything from arrange money
transfers to make deposits and withdrawals and even obtain small
consumer loans. Allen at ING Barings said 100 transactions a day
were needed to make store-based ATMs profitable. In test cases by
various convenience store chains, which have placed ATMs in their
bigger stores, transactions are running at 10 to 50 a day, a level
that generates a loss for the stores after they pay their banking
partner and their technology and software providers.
</P>
<P>
   To help overcome this barrier to profitability, Ito-Yokado Co.,
which controls Seven-Eleven, plans to apply for a banking license.
</P>
<P>
   The most promising area of new business for the convenience
stores is likely to be online services like ticketing and
reservations. Such services are popular _ and go quickly _ because
people typically know exactly what they are looking for, said
Hideki Tanaka, an e-commerce analyst at the Fujitsu Research
Institute. ``But I question whether the typical convenience store
customer is going to take 10 or 20 extra minutes to stand at a
computer terminal in the store browsing for goods they want to
buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering that the most popular use of Loppi, Lawson's online
system, is looking up one's horoscope, that is a question well
worth contemplating.

<HEADLINE>
RELIGION: REFLECTING ON A PAPAL APOLOGY IN VIEW OF AN ABIDING
TENSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PETER STEINFELS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Certain images stand out in the long stretches of papal history:
Henry IV of Germany barefoot in the snow begging pardon from Pope
Gregory VII at Canossa in 1077. Pope Urban II preaching at Clermont
in France and opening the era of crusades in 1095. A reluctant Pius
VII pressed to officiate in 1804 as Napoleon crowned himself
emperor of the French in the Cathedral of Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   Five decades ago, before the genial John XXIII and the
globe-trotting John Paul II, those were formative images in the
Roman Catholic memory, telling a story of medieval triumph and
modern frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Will the image of Pope John Paul II praying before a
15th-century crucifix in St. Peter's Basilica and asking
forgiveness for the sins of the church over two millennia _ an
image so contradictory to those earlier conjunctions of papacy and
political power _ earn a similar place in Catholicism's history?
</P>
<P>
   Roman Catholic leaders hope so. But they are up against a
culture that tosses such moments into a media blender and reduces
them to a mixture of spectacle and politics.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the immediate response to the papal confession was not
at all hostile, just utterly predictable. It was almost
choreographed, the way presidential debates and election nights
have become, with the commentators chattering and the spinmeisters
quick to nudge the event into their particular agendas, from
condemning Pope Pius XII to promoting abortion rights, gay rights
and the ordination of women.
</P>
<P>
   Was anyone really to blame for this? It is just the way the
system works, and wouldn't it be irresponsible to fail to get a
word in while the opportunity was there? The church, too, had to
have its spokesmen and spinmeisters at the ready.
</P>
<P>
   Yet one longed for an interval of reflection, a time to let the
deed simply be itself before it was digested and explained and
criticized and enlisted in various causes. Perhaps the pope's act
might have even inspired other institutions to re-examine their own
historical consciences rather than congratulate themselves on their
own essential correctness.
</P>
<P>
   There was no question that the pope was breaking new ground. In
a lengthy treatise, ``Memory and Reconciliation: the Church and the
Faults of the Past,'' the Vatican's International Theological
Commission could find few precedents for the papal apology, even in
Scripture.
</P>
<P>
   One senses more than a little nervousness in that treatise,
especially on a point that also ran through much of the public
reaction: the pope expressed contrition for sins Christians had
committed in the church's name without ascribing sin to the church
itself. To critics, this was a bit of an evasion. To the Vatican
theologians, it was crucial. Perhaps it merely reveals the need for
new language in thinking about the church.
</P>
<P>
   From New Testament times, Christians have recognized sinfulness
in their ranks, even among their leaders. The idea that there had
been ``bad popes,'' for example, was long ago commonplace among
Catholic schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   But Christians have also believed that the church is more than a
purely human institution useful for individual religious purposes;
it is somehow a body infused with the very spirit of God, a
corporate extension of Christ on earth. The struggle to reconcile
the sinfulness of Christians with the holiness of the church has
produced a good many of Christianity's theological divisions.
</P>
<P>
   If a committee of Nobel Prize winners set out to apologize for
the sins of science, they would face a similar difficulty, although
on a more mundane level.
</P>
<P>
   They might examine the destructive power of military
technologies based on scientific knowledge. They might consider how
scientific theories bolstered racism and imperialism, how social
Darwinism contributed to Nazism, how popular notions of scientific
laws were used to justify Marxist dictatorship. They would have to
go beyond the craven or self-aggrandizing acts of individual
scientists. But they would almost certainly want to distinguish
between the scientific quest itself and specific distortions of it.
</P>
<P>
   At what point would that distinction become a way of relieving
science from the obligation to detect similar distortions in its
contemporary practice? That is the problem today for the Catholic
Church, and other religious groups like it. Though the bonds
linking members of the scientific community appear almost religious
at times, the church believes that those linking Christians are of
a far tighter sort that can properly be called mystical. This
magnifies the church's concern for the sins of its members
throughout history but can also distract it from exposing some
important sources of that sinfulness.
</P>
<P>
   The International Theological Commission's document, for
example, tends to describe the church only in terms of that
mystical dimension, on the one hand, or of individual members, on
the other. It leaves out the intermediate level of institutions and
practices that the social and political sciences have explored over
the last three centuries: the art, the lore, the customs, the
texts, the hymns, the preaching themes and catechism answers, the
structures of authority and decision making. These are no longer
exactly deeds, good or bad, they are the extensions of deeds in
time, or what the commission's study calls, very weakly,
``influences.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, a group of French bishops issued their own
``Declaration of Repentance,'' known as the Drancy Statement after
the train station from which Jews had been deported to
concentration camps. In it, they found much stronger language for
such institutionalized evils, referring, in connection with
anti-Semitism, to ``an underlying basic religious culture which
shaped and deformed peoples' attitudes.''
</P>
<P>
   For Catholics and other Christians, the tension between
affirming the holiness of the church as Christ's body on earth and
confessing the sinfulness of individual Christians may never be
fully resolved. But the French bishops' language of ``basic
religious culture'' captures a reality that the International
Theological Commission's treatise misses. Catholics thinkers might
take note when they pursue the significance of Pope John Paul II's
unprecedented act.

Bagpipers, majorettes and the two candidates for a United States

LAKERS MAY LEARN FROM LATEST SETBACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. - Now that the Lakers' incredible 19-game
winning streak is over, the focus again moves from consistency to
resiliency.
</P>
<P>
   When their 16-game streak ended in January, the loss spun the
Lakers into a 3-6 slide. Did they learn enough from that experience
to avoid a repeat?
</P>
<P>
   ``Tune in. Tune in, you'll see,'' said Rick Fox. ``I think we've
made strides from that point in our season. That's why they play
the games. Because nothing is given or guaranteed. The Washington
(Wizards), a team that struggled all year, can beat you. And
there's other teams out there that if you give the same effort,
they'll beat you too.''
</P>
<P>
   The mood after the Lakers arrived in Michigan, just hours after
Thursday night's streak-busting loss at Washington, was generally
upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell you the truth, the focus of winning a championship has
kind of overshadowed any focus in here on the streaks, the two
streaks,'' Fox said. ``We really didn't talk about it. I don't mean
to disappoint anybody, we were aware of it, but it wasn't a focal
point for us every time we stepped on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, you'd like to finish the season undefeated. That would
have gotten us the ultimate streak. But I think we were well aware
that there was going to be a point where we had to learn another
lesson the hard way.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Phil Jackson doesn't see anything to be gleaned from how
the Lakers responded, or failed to, when the 16-game streak ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, you just have to play,'' he said. ``I don't think there's
anything that remotely resembles it. This is a road trip and a trip
that very obviously (includes) all qualified teams, playoff teams
that we play from here on out.''
</P>
<P>
   The five-game, eight-day trips wraps up with back-to-back games
in New York and Miami on Sunday and Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Ouch report: Shaquille O'Neal continues to play through the
discomfort of a sore right hamstring, with little opportunity for
rest, but Jackson said he's not concerned about it long-term.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's moving pretty well. I think he knows where to take a
little less energy in the game and what to use as an offensive
thrust in the game,'' Jackson said. He called the nature of the
injury ``something that could ebb as time goes on, but it shouldn't
be recurring.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Jackson is weighing whether to put Ron Harper on the
injured list to give resuscitate him for the postseason. Harper's
minutes and production are down lately.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something I've done in the past with Ron, if he feels
that it's necessary to do that,'' Jackson said of putting him on
IL. ``We'll discuss that.''

   (NYT3) UNDATED -- March 17, 2000 -- CIA-PROPAGANDA-B&AMP;W -- Many
people remember reading George Orwell's ``Animal Farm'' in high
school or college, with its chilling finale in which the farm
animals looked back and forth at the tyrannical pigs and the human
farmers but found it ``impossible to say which was which.'' That
ending was altered in the 1955 animated version, which removed the
humans, leaving only the nasty pigs. Another example of Hollywood
butchering great literature? Yes, but in this case the film's

A SEASON BEGINS, WITH CHANGES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
A remodeled and restructured Major League Soccer will start its
fifth season Saturday with four games, but a number of the league's
international players will not be on display until next weekend.
</P>
<P>
   After operating with two conferences for four years, the league
has divided its 12 teams into three divisions, a development that
should inject some excitement into what had become a predictable
regular season, with teams like D.C. United and Chicago regularly
qualifying for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Under Don Garber, who replaced Doug Logan last summer as
commissioner, the league has taken drastic steps to play soccer the
way it is elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fans in America follow soccer the way it is played across the
globe,'' he said. ``Our core audience has spoken, and we
listened.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no longer shootouts, which means there will be tie
games if no team scores in a 10-minute sudden-death overtime.
Another major change is that the clock will run from zero upward
instead of from 45:00 down, and the referee will keep the official
time on the field, with injury time added.
</P>
<P>
   The new division alignment is intriguing because five wild-card
teams will join the division winners in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The MetroStars, who had the league's worst record (7-25) last
season and missed the playoffs, have undergone the most drastic
renovation. Their biggest acquisition is Lothar Matthaus of
Germany. They will open the season March 26 in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The MetroStars are in the Eastern Division with D.C. United,
Miami and New England. The Central Division has Chicago, Columbus,
Dallas and Tampa Bay; Colorado, Kansas City, Los Angeles and San
Jose make up the Western Division.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago will open the season Saturday afternoon in Dallas. The
three other games will be played Saturday night, with Colorado at
Los Angeles, Columbus at Tampa Bay and New England at Miami.  &QL;

THE SAN FRANCISCO EXAMINER IS SOLD BY HEARST TO A LOCAL NEWSPAPER
OWNER 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER and EVELYN NIEVES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hearst Corp. sold the San Francisco Examiner Friday, the
newspaper that set William Randolph Hearst on his swashbuckling
publishing career, to the owner of a local newspaper. The new
owner, Ted Fang, vowed that the Examiner would be reincarnated as a
morning paper and would continue its two-fisted competition with
the San Francisco Chronicle, which Hearst bought in August.
</P>
<P>
   Against the odds, the deal keeps San Francisco in the thin ranks
of cities with two competing dailies.
</P>
<P>
   In a single, unexpected stroke, the deal also achieves the
disparate objectives of the haphazard group of politicians,
regulators and businessmen who were tossed into a debate by the
mixmaster of San Francisco politics.
</P>
<P>
   It catapults Fang, who is 37 and a member of a well-connected
family with a strong political base in San Francisco's Chinatown,
into prominence as one of a tiny group of Asian-Americans in top
daily newspaper jobs.
</P>
<P>
   It also represents a success for the city's mayor, Willie Brown,
who had made it his business to make it difficult for Hearst _
whose reporters had long dogged the city's contract dealings _ to
quietly close the Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   And, assuming that the deal closes after the stated four-month
transition period, it means that Hearst can focus its money and
energies on expanding the reach and breadth of the San Francisco
Chronicle, the city's dominant daily. The deal also ensures that
Hearst can make plans without worrying about the existing joint
operating agreement between the Examiner and the Chronicle, which
expires when the deal is completed.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle, the largest newspaper in Northern California,
faces tough competition to the south and east from The San Jose
Mercury-News and The Contra Costa County Times, both owned by
Knight Ridder. More than half the 465,000 copies of the Chronicle
circulated every day go to suburban areas peppered with the newly
minted millionaires of Silicon Valley's new economy.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Friday Fang said, ``San Francisco has
once again proved itself as the city that knows how _ the first
city in recent history that has saved a second newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I would say this is a unique ending for the most
unique city in America.''
</P>
<P>
   The financial terms of the deal were not immediately disclosed.
According to one Hearst executive, Fang's new company, ExIn LLC, is
buying the Examiner's name and circulation list, some delivery
trucks and news racks. It is also assuming some current Examiner
liabilities, according to a release issued by the two companies.
</P>
<P>
   The companies, which committed to a four-month transition period
during which Hearst will continue to handle basic management
functions and advertising sales at the Examiner, also noted that
Hearst would make ``a significant financial commitment to the
continued publication of the Examiner.'' There was no further
elaboration.
</P>
<P>
   That subsidy, whose amount and duration was not disclosed,
appears to be the price that Hearst, the privately held New
York-based media company, was willing to pay to achieve its
objective _ publishing the dominant local newspaper in one of the
nation's wealthiest and best-educated markets _ without running
afoul of federal antitrust regulators.
</P>
<P>
   The sale was handled by the New York investment firm, Veronis &AMP;
Suhler.

<P>
   One individual with knowledge of the deal said that no
traditional newspaper companies had been among the final three
bidders for the Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   Fang said that the deal did not include any presses or real
estate, which Hearst had recently offered along with the Examiner's
name and circulation list. The sweetened offer to prospective
buyers of the afternoon newspaper, whose circulation of 107,129 is
mostly based in the city, came as Hearst came under close scrutiny
by the Justice Department's antitrust lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   It also faced a private civil lawsuit, on similar antitrust
grounds, by Clinton Reilly, a former mayoral candidate who had his
ankle broken several years ago in a tussle with the Examiner's
executive editor, Phil Bronstein.
</P>
<P>
   Bronstein, who has directed some bare-knuckled coverage of the
mayor's dealings with city contracts, has antagonized a number of
Brown's allies, apparently including Fang. Bronstein is
consistently mocked as ``Mr. Sharon Stone'' _ a reference to his
marriage to the well-known actress _ in the pages of Fang's current
newspaper, the thrice-weekly, free San Francisco Independent.
</P>
<P>
   Bronstein is one of a group of Chronicle and Examiner editors
from which Hearst executives will select the leadership of the
joined newsrooms. They include the Chronicle's editor, Matt Wilson,
a longtime editor with a scholarly mien; Jerry Roberts, the
Chronicle's managing editor, credited with increasing the
newspaper's aggressiveness and thoughtfulness in recent years; and
Sharon Rosenhause, the managing editor of the Examiner, who has
been a brusque champion of covering the city's mosaic of minorities
and its gay community.
</P>
<P>
   The newsrooms of the Chronicle and the Examiner, which share the
third floor of their building, are physically divided as if by a
gulf by a large composing room used by both newspapers and
psychically divided by their longstanding, fierce competition. They
came together for the first time in memory Friday as a prospective
team: Hearst had guaranteed jobs to all Examiner employees who
didn't want to work for Fang, and apparently, none did.
</P>
<P>
   Both staffs _ the Chronicle's newsroom numbers about 315, the
Examiner's about 200 _ gathered by the Examiner's city desk to hear
the terms of the sale. Reporters and editors at both papers then
spent the afternoon expressing relief that jobs were guaranteed but
were wistful at the impending death of the Examiner they knew.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists with the Examiner, which has a messier newsroom and
the reputation for quirkier, more enterprising stories, said they
were saddened that the newspaper's name and its logo _ an eagle _
would adorn an unknown, unproven new entity.
</P>
<P>
   Keay Davidson, a science writer at the Examiner for 14 years,
said: ``It was always a feisty, eccentric, off-beat newspaper. I
think that it's one of the few last outposts of idiosyncrasy in
American journalism and I doubt it will be that anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   No staff members at the Examiner said they would be willing to
work for the new Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   Bronstein, the executive editor of the Examiner dismissed rumors
that, as the ranking editor of the Hearst newspaper, he had the
inside track. ``I don't know what I'll be doing yet,'' he said.
``I'm glad that there's finally some resolution. People seem
pleased that they have the opportunity to work for the morning
newspaper. I think everyone is enthused about working for a great
newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Chronicle, Ken Connor, an assistant city editor, said
that his staff hoped the Chronicle's management remained in place.
``We have people who we trust and respect,'' he said. ``I think the
feeling now is that people don't know what's going to happen.
There's going to be some overlap. We only need one television
writer, for example.''
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainty was intensified in recent months when a
collection of political odd bedfellows _ including the mayor and
Reilly _ the conservative, non-union newspaper of Fang and the
loudly radical alternative newsweekly, The Bay Guardian, all made
it clear that San Francisco wouldn't become a one-newspaper town
without a fight.
</P>
<P>
   That the fight should end with Fang's ownership of the Examiner
represented an exquisite, if belated, justice for the Chinese
populations reviled in the pages of the newspaper a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas C. Leonard, the associate dean of the Graduate School of
Journalism at the University of California at Berkeley, said
Friday: ``The exquisite piece of irony here is that both the
Chronicle and the Examiner got their start playing into the strong
anti-Asian period in California in the 1880s. I think that to find
more than a century later that the key to their business plans is
an enterprising Chinese family _ that's a real story about
America.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle and the Examiner had been business partners since
1965, when the joint operating agreement was established, combining
the advertising and circulation departments of the newspapers. At
the time, the Examiner, then a morning newspaper, agreed to publish
in the afternoon. On Sunday, the newspapers publish a joint edition
which sells 578,541 copies, according to the Sept. 30, 1999,
figures of the Audit Bureau of Circulations.
</P>
<P>
   Fang, the son of a Chinese journalist who left the country after
the communist takeover, said Friday that he would not shut down The
Independent to publish the Examiner, and he would not pull punches
in either publication. ``My family and my newspapers have never
been one to shy away from taking positions on issues we feel are
important to San Francisco,'' he said. ``That policy will
continue,'' though the news operation would remain independent of
the paper's editorial pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Examiner will not be the Independent,'' he added.
``Rather, the Examiner will offer a new voice alongside that of the
Chronicle and the Independent.''

 &HT;    Florida student avoids jail in plot to kill
 &HT;    By John Pacenti
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Shoulders slumped and eyes downcast,
Derik Lehman held his mother's hand in the back of the courtroom
until his name was called.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the bulky teen-ager _ reportedly tormented by his peers
because of his weight _ lumbered forward and, in a voice barely
above a whisper, told a judge why he planned meticulously to kill
dozens of his classmates, why he wished to re-create the massacre
of Columbine High at his own school in Royal Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very angry,'' Lehman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At who?'' asked Circuit Judge Howard Berman.
</P>
<P>
   ``At everyone,'' the 17-year-old responded as his parents,
Christine and John Lehman, looked on.
</P>
<P>
   It was a prelude to Lehman pleading guilty ``in his own best
interest'' Friday to solicitation to shoot into a building in
exchange for five years of probation packed with special
conditions. If he successfully completes probation, he will have no
criminal record. If not, he could face up to five years in prison
for the third-degree felony.
</P>
<P>
   The dozen conditions imposed on Lehman include six months of
house arrest, mandatory psychological counseling, court-imposed
expulsion from Royal Palm Beach High School, no access to the
Internet and a curfew until his 19th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said he wanted the teen monitored by GPS, a satellite
tracking system, while he's on house arrest ``because I want to
make sure we know where he is at all times.''
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of a nationwide epidemic of school shootings like
Columbine's in Colorado last year, Lehman's attorney said she felt
it would have been impossible to seat an impartial jury for
Lehman's trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a troubled young man and this is a cry for help,''
attorney Michelle Suskauer said. ``He never intended to hurt
anyone. They were just words.''
</P>
<P>
   The teen-ager, a junior, was charged as an adult after several
of his friends said he approached them in early February for
weapons and help in carrying out a siege of the school. He has been
ordered to stay away from those friends as well.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman eventually turned over his diary _ titled with the German
phrase meaning ``No Mercy'' _ in which he praised Adolf Hitler and
the suicidal gunmen responsible for the 12 student deaths at
Columbine.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Palm Beach teen-ager also possessed a detailed map of
the school building with notes in the margins, such as:
``Objective: Destroy every human in the way. Purpose: for cleansing
and for the sheer hell of it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a factor of many things that built up and I exploded in
this wrong way,'' he told the judge Friday, adding he wished that
he had reacted ``in a more peaceful way, not (with) such a violent
attitude toward people.''
</P>
<P>
   NO `WELCOME BACK' BY SCHOOLS
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors decided to charge Lehman as an adult because it was
the only way to keep him on probation for five years, Assistant
State Attorney Al Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a thin line between thinking about a crime, fantasizing
about a crime and committing a crime,'' he said. ``If there is a
silver lining here, it is that the other students came forward. The
students who came forward were the real heroes of this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehman's praise of Hitler led prosecutors to demand as part of
his probation that he attend a Holocaust education program. His
parents have already been trying to find such a class, Suskauer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's sentence leaves open the door that Lehman could attend
another Palm Beach County school, possibly an alternative one, if
invited.
</P>
<P>
   Don't count on it, said Jake Sello, associate superintendent of
the school district. ``I don't think you'd have a school that would
say you're welcome to come here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   MOM: `I CAN'T TAKE THIS'
</P>
<P>
   The district has begun the process to expel the boy from all of
its schools, Sello said. The expulsion, which must be voted on by
the school board, would bar Lehman from school from the day of the
vote through the end of that school year and up to one more school
year.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman might be a candidate for a proposed program monitored by
the sheriff's office in which expelled students would take classes,
possibly at the jail, Sello said.
</P>
<P>
   Suskauer said the Lehmans simply want to get their only child
the help he needs so he can move on to college and eventually a
productive life. She said the ordeal has put the close-knit family
through a tremendous strain.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Lehman was very protective of her son as he left
court, screaming at television cameras to leave him alone. ``I
can't take this anymore,'' she told her husband, John, as they
entered the elevators to leave.
</P>

OFFICER'S FATAL SHOT WAS FIRED BY ACCIDENT, LAWYER SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With sidebars, NY-POLICE-TRAINING and NY-POLICE-PROSECUTOR) 
(bl) 
 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An unarmed man slain by a backup undercover narcotics
detective outside a bar on Manhattan's West Side flew into a rage,
punched an officer, ignored shouts of ``Police!'' and was shot when
he grabbed the detective's gun and it discharged once into his
chest, a lawyer for the officer said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer for Detective Anthony Vasquez said that the victim,
Patrick M. Dorismond, 26, a security guard for a Midtown business
association, had grown belligerent after being asked by another
undercover detective if he had any marijuana to sell, and had
suddenly escalated the quarrel into violence after all three
officers in the confrontation tried to back off.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gun accidentally discharged as a result of Dorismond
lunging for the gun and grabbing for the gun,'' the lawyer, Philip
Karasyk, said in an interview. ``If that hadn't happened, the gun
wouldn't have discharged. He made contact with the gun. The guy is
grabbing the gun and the gun goes off.''
</P>
<P>
   The bullet, recovered in an autopsy, entered Dorismond's chest
just below the left collarbone, slashed through the aorta, the
heart's main artery, and perforated the right lung.
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond fell on the sidewalk outside the Wakamba Cocktail
Lounge on Eighth Avenue near 37th Street shortly after 12:30 a.m.
Thursday, and was pronounced dead at St. Clare's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Karasyk's version of the shooting was contradicted in important
respects by other witnesses, who said Dorismond did not know his
accosters were officers and was not the aggressor. The lawyer's
account came as Dorismond's grieving Brooklyn family lashed out at
the police for what it called his needless death, and accused the
authorities of demonizing the victim by exaggerating his minor
criminal record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody killed my son!'' Marie Dorismond, a Haitian
immigrant, wailed at a news conference outside her East Flatbush
apartment building. ``My son is not a criminal. He has two
children.'' And, referring to a criminal record cited by Police
Commissioner Howard Safir and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, she demanded,
``What is this lie?''
</P>
<P>
   At her side, the Rev. Al Sharpton called for a federal
investigation of Dorismond's killing, the third of an unarmed man
by plainclothes officers in New York in the last 13 months, and
said he would meet Monday with Loretta E. Lynch, the U.S. attorney
in Brooklyn, whose office has been investigating alleged patterns
of police brutality in the city for many months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to bypass the local prosecutor like we did in the
Louima case,'' Sharpton said, referring to Abner Louima, the
Haitian immigrant tortured by officers who were eventually
convicted in federal court. ``We can't trust the local
prosecutors,'' he added. ``I can't see how an unarmed man rejecting
a drug deal ended up dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton, warning of anti-police demonstrations like those he
helped organize in the killings of Amadou Diallo last year and
Malcolm Ferguson, a drug suspect, two weeks ago in the Bronx, said
the Dorismond family would be represented by Johnnie Cochran.
</P>
<P>
   While the case was roiled with anger over accusations by the
victim's family that the killing was an overreaction by the police,
there were no indications that race had played a role, as was
alleged in the death of Diallo, the black immigrant killed by four
white officers . Dorismond was black and the three officers
involved in the confrontation with him are Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   As the city faced new questions over a killing and what critics
have called overly aggressive police tactics, Giuliani, a staunch
defender of the police in case after case, seemed exasperated
before the St. Patrick's Day Parade on Friday as reporters raised
questions about Dorismond's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really have to give the police a break, don't you?'' he
said. ``These are the men and women that are out there protecting
us.'' He noted that the case was under investigation, urged the
public to withhold judgment until the facts were in and said,
``Let's give them at least the benefit that most of you usually
give common criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who defended Vasquez as a ``distinguished undercover
officer'' who had ``put his life on the line in the middle of the
night to protect the safety and security of this city,'' went on to
highlight Dorismond's criminal record. ``He's been arrested for
robbery, attempted robbery and possession of a gun,'' the mayor
said.
</P>
<P>
   A check by other public officials Friday. however, suggested a
different picture, involving relatively minor charges, such as
disorderly conduct and simple assault.

BOEING WILL NEED TIME TO HEAL AFTER STRIKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ One of largest white-collar strikes in U.S. history
left scars on The Boeing Co. that will not soon fade away.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts don't expect any shakeup of top management
because of the strike, but they agreed with striking engineers that
it will take time to heal the wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Far more than Boeing's production system was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Some engineers and technical workers on strike said Friday that
resentment toward top management will linger long after they return
to work, assuming the proposed contract is approved.
</P>
<P>
   They also expressed anger and ill-will toward some colleagues
who crossed picket lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something that will still be lingering by the end of
the year,'' said Christopher Matthews, a technical designer.
</P>
<P>
   Of the eight other people he worked with, Matthews said, six
went back to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be hard to work with them,'' he said. ``But it will be
doubly hard because no one will want to associate with my group
because of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Byron Callan, an analyst with Merrill Lynch who closely follows
Boeing, said the strike could have been far more damaging to Boeing
had it continued for several more weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boeing dodged a bullet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Had the strike continued for five or six more weeks, he said,
there likely would have been calls for a management shakeup by
concerned shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   But Callan doesn't see that happening now.
</P>
<P>
   What happens over the next couple of weeks will be crucial if
Boeing is to put the strike behind it and get on with the business
of building airplanes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will have to do a little hand holding,'' he said of the
company. ``I would hope they can get things going again. They were
showing good momentum in 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   But he noted that while he and other analysts looked at Boeing's
financial results and saw improvement, it's now clear that not
everyone in the company had gotten on the Boeing bandwagon and was
enjoying the ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see the numbers but we don't see the people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The most lasting benefit of the strike, he said, may be that the
engineers finally got Boeing's attention.
</P>
<P>
   Or as a senior engineer on Boeing's 777 program put it Friday:
``We are not the center of the universe, but this strike showed we
drive parts of the company.''
</P>
<P>
   The engineer, a veteran of 22 years with Boeing who asked not to
be quoted by name, has been with the 777 program from the
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started the program Phil and Alan ran the show,'' he
said, referring to Boeing Chairman Phil Condit and Alan Mulally,
head of the company's commercial airplane operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a family attitude back then. It felt like we were
all part of a family.''
</P>
<P>
   That has changed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Upper management today seems to be profit driven,'' he said,
reflecting a view shared by many other striking engineers.
</P>
<P>
   ``To run this company, they need the employees,'' he said. `They
have to look past the profits. ... They seem to have forgotten what
it's like to be a family.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Matthews, the engineer said he will find it difficult to
work alongside some colleagues who crossed the picket line for
reasons other than economic hardship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know who went back,'' he said. ``Some went back to work
the next day. They talked loud and didn't do anything. There were a
couple guys in my work group who said they were for the strike but
then they went back to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be animosity.''

BANNED IN CALIFORNIA: THIS SEASON'S SNAKESKIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, March 19. With LEATHER-PROTEST.)  
(mk)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In New York, animal rights campaigners are protesting the use of
leather and skins as inhumane. In Beverly Hills, Calif., shopping
rights militants are outraged for a different reason: They can't
find a pair of those sexy python pumps anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Gucci, Barneys nor Chanel stock the popular snakeskin in
their Los Angeles stores. In California, the sale of python skin or
parts has been outlawed since 1970, around the same time the
federal Endangered Species Act of 1973 was being discussed and
formulated. Importing or shipping the species or products made from
it into the state for commercial purposes is illegal. Violators
face a maximum fine of $5,000 or a six-month stay at a county jail.
</P>
<P>
   How to overcome such obstacles to achieving the reptile look has
become the talk of the West Coast's fashion elite. One wardrobe
stylist orders from Gucci in Hawaii, which will mail it to 90210
and neighboring ZIP codes. Other shoppers fly to Las Vegas. It's
legal to bring your own python across state lines, as long as you
don't plan to sell it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can carry or wear your python shoes into California,''
said Jack Edwards, assistant chief of patrol at the Department of
Fish and Game in Sacramento. ``But you can't bring in a purse made
of mountain lion,'' he added. ``That's illegal.'' (That animal has
a special protective status.)
</P>
<P>
   Some stores appear to be unaware of these statutes. At the
Beverly Hills Fendi _ the designer of the coveted python baguette _
a member of the sales staff directed this reporter to the store's
Bal Harbor, Fla., boutique, which she said would mail the $1,695
purse to the customer's private Los Angeles address. When told that
shipping snakeskin into California is illegal, a Fendi saleswoman
in Bal Harbor said with a lilting Italian accent: ``No? Maybe I
have heard something about this? Really? I should check on that.''
</P>
<P>
   California is the only state with a ban on all types of python,
though only Indian python is now on the endangered species list.
Edwards seemed unaware of the current fashion crisis the state's
regulations had caused.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't heard anything about python being popular,'' he
said. ``Right now, we're seeing a lot of illegal activities with
abalone and bear parts.''
</P>
<P>
   Abalone is a snaillike delicacy that fetches $100 per pound on
the black market. Bear gall bladders are believed to have the same
effect as Viagra and sell for $2,000 to $4,000. Gucci's hip-hugging
python pants could have a similar effect for only $3,650.

FLORIDA SURVIVES BUTLER, 69-68, AT BUZZER

<TEXT>
<P>
   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. _ The first major upset of this year's NCAA
men's basketball tournament was within grasp.
</P>
<P>
   Unsung Butler had used poise, discipline and fierce defense to
seize control, and with 8.1 seconds remaining in overtime, sent one
of its top free-throw shooters to the line to add to a one-point
lead.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than come away with the victory, the free throws _
and with it, the game _ went awry for 12th-seeded Butler. Instead,
Mike Miller's decisive drive down the lane as time expired lifted
fifth-seeded Florida to a 69-68 victory in opening-round action in
the East Regional.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just penetrated and floated one up over the top of somebody,
and it happened to go in,'' said Miller, who led his team with 16
points and 13 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Officials reviewed videotape to be sure the shot went in before
time expired.
</P>
<P>
   The victory by Florida (25-7) ended a streak in which one
12th-seeded team had recorded a first-round upset every year since
1989.
</P>
<P>
   The Gators will face Illinois, a 68-58 winner over Pennsylvania,
here at Joel Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Florida forced the overtime by rallying from seven points down
in the final 4:01 of regulation.
</P>
<P>
   The Gators' Udonis Haslem hit two free throws with 15.2 seconds
left to tie the score at 60-60.
</P>
<P>
   Florida then survived a missed 3-pointer by Butler's LaVall
Jordan to reach overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs, champions of the Midwestern Collegiate Conference,
had a 68-65 advantage with 30.5 seconds left in overtime on a
3-pointer by guard Andrew Graves, the last of his game-high 20
points.
</P>
<P>
   Florida answered with a layup by Kenyan Weaks with 10 seconds
remaining and quickly fouled Jordan, an 83.3 percent free-throw
shooter.
</P>
<P>
   But the junior guard, still grieving the death earlier this week
of the great-aunt who raised him, missed both foul shots with 8.1
seconds to go.
</P>
<P>
   That set the stage for the last, frantic possession.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Dupay got the ball to the frontcourt and shoveled a pass to
Miller near the 3-point arc.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-8-inch forward drove the lane and launched the
winning shot as he fell to the court and the buzzer sounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``You tend to think that when you're up three or four with 20
seconds to go that this game you're going to win, you're going to
advance,'' said Butler's Graves. ``It starts creeping in. And then
when all of a sudden the carpet gets pulled out from underneath of
you, it's like the end of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite missing 11 of its first 15 shots, Butler stayed close
and took its first lead, 21-19, on two free throws by Rylan Hainje,
a freshman forward, with 4:55 remaining in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Butler had won 15 straight entering the game.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois 68, Penn 58
</P>
<P>
   In the opening game, No. 13 Pennsylvania rallied from early foul
trouble and a 15-point deficit in the first half, but the Quakers
faded down the stretch against fourth-seeded Illinois (22-9).
</P>
<P>
   After Penn took a 6-2 lead, Illinois took control, gradually
building its lead to 27-12 with 7:57 left in the half on a 3-point
play by forward Marcus Griffin, who contributed 10 points off the
bench in the period. Griffin, a 6-foot-9-inch junior, finished with
16 points for Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Equally daunting for Penn, Michael Jordan, the Ivy League player
of the year, picked up three fouls within a span of 39 seconds,
limiting his time and effectiveness.

EL-AMIN INJURED AS UCONN ELIMINATES UTAH STATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ Connecticut savored a tangible size advantage
over Utah State in its first-round tournament game Friday, but that
was not all. The Huskies were quicker, better rebounders, craftier
shooters and, certainly, more tournament-tested.
</P>
<P>
   Little wonder that, except for a hiccup or two, the Huskies won
their first game in the South Regional of the NCAA tournament,
75-67, before 11,061 fans at the Birmingham-Jefferson Civic Center.
Connecticut easily took a first step toward defending its national
title, but its next one could be more wobbly.
</P>
<P>
   That is because it might advance without its commandeering point
guard, Khalid El-Amin, who injured his right ankle late in the
game, left, returned to play on it for a few moments and then left
for good. After the game, El-Amin had the ankle on ice and in
thick, brown, elastic bandages that made his right foot look nearly
the size of a basketball.
</P>
<P>
   With Tennessee looming _ it advanced by frustrating
Louisiana-Lafayette, 63-58, in the opening game here Friday _
Connecticut hopes that El-Amin can quickly recover for what should
be a ferocious fling with the Volunteers here on Sunday. Tennessee
is 25-6. Connecticut is 25-9. Power teams from the Southeastern and
Big East Conferences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't get hit, I just tried to reverse pivot and dribble
back out,'' El-Amin said, explaining his injury. ``I heard and felt
something snap and I called a timeout. They called it a high ankle
sprain. It is hurting right now, but hopefully I will be ready
Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   El-Amin was injured with 3 minutes 57 seconds left and with his
team ahead, 65-54. Why did he return? ``It was still sore, but you
know how coach is,'' El-Amin said. ``I just tried to go back in,
and I really wanted to see how bad it was.''
</P>
<P>
   His coach, Jim Calhoun, said his team would prepare two game
plans for Tennessee: one with El-Amin, one without. ``If Khalid
cannot play, the game plan will be different,'' Calhoun said. ``The
plan is going to be predicated on Khalid. We thought he was well
enough to go back in, and you never know about those kind of
injuries unless you play on them. We just beat a team that was
small and quick, and now in Tennessee we have to face a team that
is big and physical. We did some good things today at the start of
the game. Utah State, regardless of who it was playing, had been
able to create tempo. Today, we did that. We played the kind of
game we're capable of on defense and we had a couple of veterans
who know how to defend and lead us at the end. Tournament
experience helps.''
</P>
<P>
   The senior forward Kevin Freeman (13 points) made 6 of 8 shots
and grabbed eight rebounds. His put-back basket _ a leap in the
lane and a twisting, flying rebound and dunk off guard Tony
Robertson's missed shot _ put Connecticut ahead by 11 points with
5:26 left. The senior center Jake Voskuhl made 4 of 5 shots and
finished with eight points.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Edmund Saunders complemented both with nine points and
eight rebounds in the best bench play of the game. El-Amin scored
14 and so did guard Albert Mouring in a game-high 38 minutes
played.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut made 10 steals, forced 15 turnovers and won in
rebounds (37-22) and in floor shooting (48.3 percent to 45.5
percent). Forward Troy Rolle led Utah State with 18 points, but
like most of the Aggies he nearly always had a hand in his face or
a grinding bump on his hip when attempting to shoot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had mini-runs but we couldn't pull even or get ahead,''
said coach Stew Morrill of Utah State.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut sped to a 31-16 lead en route to a 39-29 lead at
halftime. Utah State (28-6) rallied to trail by only 39-37 in the
opening minutes of the second half, but Connecticut quickly
increased the lead again.

BROTHER, HOOPS HELPED MARYLAND'S DIXON SURVIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS - Long before the basketball court was Maryland
guard Juan Dixon's stage, it was his salvation.
</P>
<P>
   However unstable things were at home, Dixon and his older
brother Phil knew the asphalt court a few blocks away was there,
beckoning them.
</P>
<P>
   It was their retreat from a world no child should stumble into
upon returning home from school. A den of heroin and infected
needles and, when Juan Dixon was a sophomore in high school, of
death.
</P>
<P>
   Juanita and Phil Dixon Sr. were drug addicts who succumbed to
AIDS within a year of each other, leaving their eldest child Phil
Jr. to finish rearing his siblings Juan, now 21, Nichole, 18, and
Jermaine, 12, in their native Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   The sad truth was, Phil Jr., 26, had been pulling parental duty
for years before that. He was the one who turned Juan into a
stylish dresser and a bit of a neat freak.
</P>
<P>
   He was the one who taught Juan how to play sports, who showed
him how to drive.
</P>
<P>
   He was the one who, when he walked in the door from school to
find his parents home but oblivious to their surroundings, would
grab a basketball, pull Juan outside and race him to the court
where they'd shoot baskets for hours.
</P>
<P>
   If UCLA thinks it's going to throw anything at Dixon today that
he can't handle, the Bruins better think again. After all that he
has seen, nothing fazes Dixon. He leads Maryland, the Bruins' NCAA
Tournament second-round opponent, in scoring and steals, is second
in assists and third in rebounds despite the fact he's skinnier
than the basket's stanchion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't let little things bother him, like mistakes or
coach (Gary Williams) yelling at him,'' said teammate Matt Hahn.
``He's one of the toughest people around.''
</P>
<P>
   Dixon had no choice. He learned early in life that you either
cope or crumble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always tried to shield Juan,'' Phil Jr., a rookie policeman,
said by phone from Baltimore Friday. ``I always tried to keep him
from seeing different things that were going on. Sports was our
escape. When there were problems at home, we could always go to the
court.''
</P>
<P>
   Phil was a pretty fair player. He started at point guard at
Shenandoah University in West Virginia and was named a Division III
All-America his senior year, after breaking Shenandoah's all-time
scoring and assists record.
</P>
<P>
   Though huge in the eyes of his siblings, Phil Jr., at 5-foot-9,
was short in the minds of big-time basketball scouts. Juan has his
brother's heart and a lot more height. He is a resplendent
6-foot-3. No less an authority than Mike Krzyzewski proclaimed the
sophomore shooting guard the best player on the floor in the
Terrapins' 98-87 upset of Duke last month at Cameron Indoor
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Krzyzewski wasn't saying anything that people who saw
Dixon's 31-point performance couldn't themselves have ascertained.
It came after Dixon made the game-winning shot against Illinois,
another NCAA Tournament first-round survivor, and stole the ball
and a victory from North Carolina State.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon is one of the most heartwarming stories of this basketball
season. He is a success, but he just as easily could have wound up
another depressing statistic.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after Dixon's star turn at Duke, a 6-year-old boy in
Flint, Mich., shot and killed a classmate. The boy's situation
wasn't unlike Dixon's at that age: Both parents were drug addicts
and the father had been in and out of jail.
</P>
<P>
   The difference? Juan - named after his mother - had an older
brother around to teach him right from wrong and an extended family
that quickly stepped in whenever Juanita and Phil Sr. were strung
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we don't mind that our story gets told,'' Phil Jr.
said. ``Maybe it can help some little kids somewhere who are in a
similar situation. Hopefully it can be an inspiration to them. They
can see that if their parents get high and are doing things they
shouldn't be doing, it doesn't mean they have to follow in their
footsteps.''
</P>
<P>
   When the doors to the Maryland locker room opened Friday,
reporters beat a path to Dixon's cubicle. Most had questions about
the Terrapins' game today against the Bruins, but one wondered if
he'd mind talking about his parents.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon shrugged. His expression darkened. It was as though a
cloud was passing over his face. But his tone remained warm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough situation for us, losing our parents that
way,'' he said. ``We had to mature a lot earlier than most kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Like any loved one of an addict, Dixon wonders if he could have
done something to help his mother kick what amounts to a disease.
It's misplaced guilt, but it hurts all the same. Phil Jr. said
their mother and father weren't bad parents, just sick ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a day went by when they didn't let us know how much they
loved us,'' he said. ``They were very affectionate and they never
abandoned us.''
</P>
<P>
   His parents' hugs is the memory Juan is trying to hold onto. But
sometimes it's hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``He talks about it every once in a while,'' said Hahn, a senior
reserve guard. ``A lot of guys, we can't relate to what he's gone
through. So we just listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Hahn is a coach's son. His father Bill has been an assistant at
Maryland for the past 11 seasons. Matt has been clay in his dad's
hands. Without those fingers shaping and molding him, the younger
Hahn can't imagine what form his life would have taken.
</P>
<P>
   Hahn had no idea Dixon's family life had been so grim until last
year when the story first surfaced in print. ``I don't think too
many people on the team knew his story up until then,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   No surprise there. Dixon's demeanor belies the demons he has
seen.
</P>
<P>
   He is always smiling and the glint he gives off cannot be
ascribed solely to his mouthful of braces. His teammates say he is
fun to be around, mainly because he acts like whichever day it is
is his best day yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what makes him even more of an amazing person,'' Hahn
said. ``Someone who's gone through what he has could be mad at the
world. He could become a very bitter person. But he isn't at all.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because Dixon sees himself as a survivor, not a victim.
His brother was his lifeline. And so was basketball. They both have
carried him to a very safe place.

PEPPERDINE IGNORED IN KNIGHT'S SHADOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VINCENT BONSIGNORE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. - Pepperdine might be the most obscure team
playing in the East Regional. The fact that the Waves played
Indiana, one of the giants of college basketball, on Friday night
in the first round just seemed to illustrate that point even more.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Buffalo News described Pepperdine as ``a virtually
anonymous regional program that every once in awhile receives an
(NCAA) invitation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Waves' lack of national recognition was never more evident
then their Thursday media session, which followed Indiana's.
</P>
<P>
   When Hoosiers coach Bob Knight addressed the press, 200
reporters were present. However, when Pepperdine coach Jan van
Breda Kolff spoke a few minutes later, only about 20 stuck around
to listen.
</P>
<P>
   Van Breda Kolff, who stood in the hallway near the media room as
Knight held court, couldn't help but notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where'd everybody go?'' van Breda Kolff asked as he sat down.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy hitters: One writer Knight likely avoided was John
Feinstein, author of the controversial ``A Season on the Brink: A
Year with Bob Knight and the Indiana Hoosiers.'' Knight was upset
with the book because Feinstein did not omit Knight's foul
language.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein is working on a book about the Patriot League. That
brings him to Buffalo with Lafayette University, which fell on
Friday to Temple.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I did the book on Army-Navy, I was struck by the kids and
their lack of feeling of entitlement that you usually find with
college athletes,'' Feinstein said. ``I was at Layfayette the day
of the New Hampshire primary and the kids in the locker room were
saying `Wow, did you really think McCain was going to beat Bush by
that much?' If I was in an ACC locker room they wouldn't care about
McCain or Bush unless they could shoot the 3.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no truth to the rumor that Bush can take his man off the
dribble, but is an average outside shooter, at best.
</P>
<P>
   Surf's not up, dude: When Pepperdine left California on
Wednesday, it was sunny and warm. But it's still winter in most of
America, and the Waves found that out Thursday when more than four
inches of snow fell on Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a mild winter in these parts, so even residents of
Western New York were surprised at the snowfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to adjust and deal with it,'' said Pepperdine
forward Tommie Prince, who must have forgotten for a second that
basketball is played indoors.
</P>
<P>
   Late start: Knight was not happy with the scheduled 10:20 p.m.
EST tipoff Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any college basketball game should start after 9
p.m.,'' Knight said.

GANG WAR FEARS BEHIND LOCKDOWN AT TEXAS PRISONS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Prison officials acknowledged Friday that a rare
order to keep more than 120,000 inmates locked in their cells
indefinitely was issued in an effort to keep two of the largest and
most violent prison gangs from waging war inside the system.
</P>
<P>
   In a memo to members of the Texas Board of Criminal Justice,
Wayne Scott, executive director of the Texas Department of Criminal
Justice, said he ordered the unusual lockdown because, ``We
anticipate retaliation by (one gang) upon (the other).''
</P>
<P>
   The lockdown was ordered Thursday following the gang-related
stabbing death of an inmate at the Coffield Unit near Palestine,
but in their public statements, prison officials downplayed concern
over gang violence erupting.
</P>
<P>
   Scott's memo was released Friday to the Houston Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Due to this most recent homicide and the potential for a
violent retaliatory response by the (one gang), I have imposed a
lockdown of all secure TDCJ facilities effective immediately,''
Scott wrote in the memo. ``This lockdown will allow unit staff and
STG (security threat group) staff to monitor closely the
communications of known and suspected STG members and will allow
for a thorough and complete search for weapons at all of our
facilities. It is important to remember that suspected STG members
are housed in facilities around the state and are found in all
custody levels.''
</P>
<P>
   The TDCJ refers to gangs as security threat groups.
</P>
<P>
   Prison spokesman Glen Castlebury declined to say which prison
gangs were involved and the copy of the memo he released had the
names deleted.
</P>
<P>
   However, a veteran correctional officer at the Coffield Unit
identified the gangs as the Texas Syndicate and Hermanos de
Pistoleros Latinos (Brotherhood of Latin Gunmen). The officer, who
was on duty when the stabbing occurred, asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   A prison gang expert estimated that as of last July, the
Pistoleros Latinos had a confirmed membership of about 380 plus
another 360 suspected members, while the Texas Syndicate had an
estimated 840 confirmed members and 1,490 suspected members.
</P>
<P>
   Castlebury said he did not know what specific intelligence
reports gang experts had that prompted them to warn wardens
throH &UR; UQ the system that the murder of Roland Rios, 41, of Corpus
Christi on Thursday was more likely to provoke gang warfare than
other inmate stabbings in recent years. The earlier stabbing
incidents did not prompt a system-wide lockdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was the gauging of the intelligence'' that made the
difference in this incident, he said. ``You're going to get
stabbings where gang members agree the (guy) deserved killing, and
then you're going to get stabbings'' that prompt retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   He added it would ``not be wrong to assume'' that intelligence
officers saw something different in Rios' slaying. But he also
dismissed claims that a full-scale gang warfare was about to erupt.
</P>
<P>
   And he stood by prison administrators' earlier statements that a
system-wide lockdown had been in the planning stages for about two
weeks and was merely moved up after Rios was murdered.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities identified Rios' killer as 26-year-old Antonio Lara,
who is serving a 15-year sentence for attempted murder, robbery and
aggravated assault with a deadly weapon in Webb County.
</P>
<P>
   Rios, who was serving 10 years for aggravated robbery and injury
to a child convictions out of Nueces County, apparently was a
member of the Texas Syndicate.
</P>
<P>
   The Coffield correctional officer, however, predicted, ``This is
going to be a blood bath. The Texas Syndicate is not going to stand
by and see one of theirs killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are going to retaliate,'' he added. ``TDCJ is
trying to stop a blood bath under the pretense of conducting a
shakedown.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the shakedown had turned up only one weapon _ a 9
1/2-inch steel shank a prisoner had fashioned from a flat piece of
metal _ as of Friday.
</P>
<P>
   While system-wide lockdowns are rare, partial lockdowns at
individual units are not. For example, prison records indicate that
last month alone, 25 of the state's 112 prison units had at least
some portions of their facilities in lockdown status. Among those
was the Coffield Unit, where felons in some wings had been locked
in their cells since Feb. 17 because of gang disturbances.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, of those 25 units 19 still had some inmates restricted
to their cells, and wardens at 11 of the facilities cited gang
activity or racial tension as the reason for the lockdowns.

WHILE MLS CHANGES, BURN MAINTAINS A SOLID FOUNDATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BLANE BACHELOR 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Saturday's kickoff of the 2000 season brings a mini-makeover for
Major League Soccer.
</P>
<P>
   A new commissioner. Coaching changes. A revised format and a
shortened schedule. An influx of international players.
</P>
<P>
   But at least one team is keeping an early focus on what's
staying the same. The Dallas Burn has six players from its original
roster, the most of any team in the league, in hopes of finally
cracking into the MLS title game. The path to that goal begins
Saturday with the Burn's 3:30 p.m. season opener against the
Chicago Fire at the Cotton Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Such thinking is necessary, Burn coach Dave Dir says, because he
is depending on as many as 10 players who have been with the team
for two seasons or less.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the most difficult part of change,'' said Dir, the
league's only coach with his original team. ``We have a certain way
we expect things here, and when you have a lot of new players,
sometimes they don't bring that to practice. Things have to be
learned from the veterans, and that's part of the reason that
veterans are so critical to the makeup of teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Kreis, Ted Eck, Brian Haynes, Brandon Pollard, Richard
Farrer and Mark Santel remain from the original Burn squad. Dir
said leadership will be their most important role as the Burn comes
off its best season in franchise history _ a 19-13 overall record
and a trip to the Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us are really vocal leaders,'' said Kreis, the league
most valuable player and scoring champion last season. ``We're just
guys that like to lay it down on the field and hopefully other
players can take the example from that. I think players respect
that more than us harping about what Dallas Burn soccer is all
about.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to MVP Kries, the Burn also has Matt Jordan, who was
selected as one of three finalists for the league goalkeeper of the
year. Jordan finished with a team-record 1.08 goals-against average
with 11 shutouts.
</P>
<P>
   Two more young players _ Aleksey Korol and Bobby Rhine _ should
have plenty of opportunities to contribute at forward.
</P>
<P>
   Rhine scored two goals in his first MLS start last season and
played well off the bench, setting a team record with five goals
for a rookie. Dir has liked what he has seen so far from
first-round draft pick Korol. The Burn will need the young duo's
offense, particularly with Graziani and Kreis likely to miss
several games this season for U.S. national team duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``When myself and all the rookies last year saw how intense all
the training sessions were,'' Rhine said, ``we know now we have the
responsibility to contain that in matches and show guys that are in
their first year that they're responsible for that foundation as
well. Put together, everyone can learn.'' nn

<P>
   Hearst Corp. sold the San Francisco Examiner Friday, the
newspaper that set William Randolph Hearst on his swashbuckling
publishing career, to the owner of a local newspaper. The new
owner, Ted Fang, vowed that the Examiner would be reincarnated as a
morning paper and would continue its two-fisted competition with
the San Francisco Chronicle, which Hearst bought in August.
</P>
<P>
   Against the odds, the deal keeps San Francisco in the thin ranks
of cities with two competing dailies.
</P>
<P>
   In a single, unexpected stroke, the deal also achieves the
disparate objectives of the haphazard group of politicians,
regulators and businessmen who were tossed into a debate by the
mixmaster of San Francisco politics.
</P>
<P>
   It catapults Fang, who is 37 and a member of a well-connected
family with a strong political base in San Francisco's Chinatown,
into prominence as one of a tiny group of Asian-Americans in top
daily newspaper jobs.
</P>
<P>
   It also represents a success for the city's mayor, Willie Brown,
who had made it his business to make it difficult for Hearst _
whose reporters had long dogged the city's contract dealings _ to
quietly close the Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   And Hearst can now focus its money and energies on expanding the
reach and breadth of the San Francisco Chronicle, the city's
dominant daily. The deal also ensures that Hearst can make plans
without worrying about the existing joint operating agreement
between the Examiner and the Chronicle, which expires when the deal
is completed.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle, the largest newspaper in Northern California,
faces tough competition to the south and east from The San Jose
Mercury-News and The Contra Costa County Times, both owned by
Knight Ridder. More than half the 465,000 copies of the Chronicle
circulated every day go to suburban areas peppered with the newly
minted millionaires of Silicon Valley's new economy.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Friday Fang said, ``San Francisco has
once again proved itself as the city that knows how _ the first
city in recent history that has saved a second newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I would say this is a unique ending for the most
unique city in America.''
</P>
<P>
   The financial terms of the deal were not immediately disclosed.
According to one Hearst executive, Fang's new company, ExIn LLC, is
buying the Examiner's name and circulation list, some delivery
trucks and news racks. It is also assuming some current Examiner
liabilities, according to a release issued by the two companies.
</P>
<P>
   The companies, which committed to a four-month transition period
during which Hearst will continue to handle basic management
functions and advertising sales at the Examiner, also noted that
Hearst would make ``a significant financial commitment to the
continued publication of the Examiner.'' There was no further
elaboration.
</P>
<P>
   That subsidy, whose amount and duration was not disclosed,
appears to be the price that Hearst, the privately held New
York-based media company, was willing to pay to achieve its
objective _ publishing the dominant local newspaper in one of the
nation's wealthiest and best-educated markets _ without running
afoul of federal antitrust regulators.
</P>
<P>
   The sale was handled by the New York investment firm, Veronis &AMP;
Suhler.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   One individual with knowledge of the deal said that no
traditional newspaper companies had been among the final three
bidders for the Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   Fang _ whose current newspaper is the thrice-weekly, free San
Francisco Independent _ said that the deal did not include any
presses or real estate, which Hearst had recently offered along
with the Examiner's name and circulation list. The sweetened offer
to prospective buyers of the afternoon newspaper, whose circulation
of 107,129 is mostly based in the city, came as Hearst came under
close scrutiny by the Justice Department's antitrust lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   It also faced a private civil lawsuit, on similar antitrust
grounds, by Clinton Reilly, a former mayoral candidate who had his
ankle broken several years ago in a tussle with the Examiner's
executive editor, Phil Bronstein.
</P>
<P>
   Bronstein is one of a group of Chronicle and Examiner editors
from which Hearst executives will select the leadership of the
joined newsrooms. They include the Chronicle's executive editor,
Matt Wilson, a longtime editor with a scholarly mien; Jerry
Roberts, the Chronicle's managing editor, credited with increasing
the newspaper's aggressiveness and thoughtfulness in recent years;
and Sharon Rosenhause, a managing editor of the Examiner, who has
been a brusque champion of covering the city's mosaic of minorities
and its gay community.
</P>
<P>
   The newsrooms of the Chronicle and the Examiner, which share the
third floor of their building, are physically divided as if by a
gulf by a large composing room used by both newspapers and
psychically divided by their longstanding, fierce competition. They
came together for the first time in memory Friday as a prospective
team: Hearst had guaranteed jobs to all Examiner employees who
didn't want to work for Fang, and apparently, none did.
</P>
<P>
   Both staffs _ the Chronicle's newsroom numbers about 315, the
Examiner's about 200 _ gathered by the Examiner's city desk to hear
the terms of the sale. Reporters and editors at both papers then
spent the afternoon expressing relief that jobs were guaranteed but
were wistful at the impending death of the Examiner they knew.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists with the Examiner, which has a messier newsroom and
the reputation for quirkier, more enterprising stories, said they
were saddened that the newspaper's name and its logo _ an eagle _
would adorn an unknown, unproven new entity.
</P>
<P>
   Keay Davidson, a science writer at the Examiner for 14 years,
said: ``It was always a feisty, eccentric, off-beat newspaper. I
think that it's one of the few last outposts of idiosyncrasy in
American journalism and I doubt it will be that anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   No staff members at the Examiner said they would be willing to
work for the new Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   Bronstein, the executive editor of the Examiner dismissed rumors
that, as the ranking editor of the Hearst newspaper, he had the
inside track. ``I don't know what I'll be doing yet,'' he said.
``I'm glad that there's finally some resolution. People seem
pleased that they have the opportunity to work for the morning
newspaper. I think everyone is enthused about working for a great
newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Chronicle, Ken Connor, an assistant city editor, said
that his staff hoped the Chronicle's management remained in place.
``We have people who we trust and respect,'' he said. ``I think the
feeling now is that people don't know what's going to happen.
There's going to be some overlap. We only need one television
writer, for example.''
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainty was intensified in recent months when a
collection of political odd bedfellows _ including the mayor and
Reilly _ the conservative, non-union newspaper of Fang and the
loudly radical alternative newsweekly, The Bay Guardian, all made
it clear that San Francisco wouldn't become a one-newspaper town
without a fight.
</P>
<P>
   That the fight should end with Fang's ownership of the Examiner
represented an exquisite, if belated, justice for the Chinese
populations reviled in the pages of the newspaper a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas C. Leonard, the associate dean of the Graduate School of
Journalism at the University of California at Berkeley, said
Friday: ``The exquisite piece of irony here is that both the
Chronicle and the Examiner got their start playing into the strong
anti-Asian period in California in the 1880s. I think that to find
more than a century later that the key to their business plans is
an enterprising Chinese family _ that's a real story about
America.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Chronicle and the Examiner had been business partners since
1965, when the joint operating agreement was established, combining
the advertising and circulation departments of the newspapers. At
the time, the Examiner, then a morning newspaper, agreed to publish
in the afternoon. On Sunday, the newspapers publish a joint edition
which sells 578,541 copies, according to the Sept. 30, 1999,
figures of the Audit Bureau of Circulations.
</P>
<P>
   Fang, the son of a Chinese journalist who left the country after
the communist takeover, said Friday that he would not shut down The
Independent to publish the Examiner, and he would not pull punches
in either publication. ``My family and my newspapers have never
been one to shy away from taking positions on issues we feel are
important to San Francisco,'' he said. ``That policy will
continue,'' though the news operation would remain independent of
the paper's editorial pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Examiner will not be the Independent,'' he added.
``Rather, the Examiner will offer a new voice alongside that of the
Chronicle and the Independent.''

<P>
   ATLANTA _ A Muslim cleric formerly known as H. Rap Brown, a
leader of the Black Panthers in the 1960s, was the subject of an
intense citywide manhunt Friday after a Fulton County sheriff's
deputy said the cleric shot him and another deputy near downtown
Atlanta late Thursday. The second deputy died of his injuries
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The cleric, now known as Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin, has lived in
relative peace in Atlanta's West End neighborhood after serving
five years behind bars in New York for attempted armed robbery.
Atlanta Police Chief Beverly Harvard said the deputy selected
Al-Amin's picture from a photo array as the man who fired an
assault rifle at the two deputies at close range. The department is
now seeking him on a murder warrant.
</P>
<P>
   One of the deputies, Ricky Kinchen, 35, lost most of his blood
at the scene and died at Grady Memorial Hospital on Friday
afternoon after undergoing three operations. The other deputy,
Aldranon English, 28, was less seriously wounded and was able to
describe the shooting incident to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   According to Harvard, the deputies, who are black, were
attempting to arrest Al-Amin on a warrant issued by suburban Cobb
County in January after Al-Amin failed to appear in court to answer
charges in connection with a traffic stop last May. Al-Amin had
been accused of driving a stolen Ford Explorer, having improper
insurance documents, and of impersonating a police officer by
flashing a fake badge and claiming he was a police officer in
Whitehall, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   The deputies _ who knew nothing of Al-Amin's background _ were
unable to find him at his house or his nearby grocery store when
they arrived at about 10:30 Wednesday, Harvard said, and were
circling the area when a black Mercedes pulled up near the rear of
the store. The deputies approached the car and asked the driver to
get out, which he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the deputies was concerned that he could not see the
person's hands after he had asked him to get out of the vehicle,''
Harvard said, apparently referring to the gunman's long coat. ``The
deputy then asked him to show his hands, and the person responded
by saying, `Okay, here they are.' And at that point in time, the
two sheriff's deputies were fired upon.'' One of the deputies also
managed to shoot the gunman.
</P>
<P>
   Police investigators later found shell casings from a
.223-caliber semi-automatic assault rifle and a 9-mm handgun. The
rifle's immense power apparently tore through the deputies'
bulletproof vests; one doctor at Grady told the sheriff's
department that the wounds reminded him of those seen in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   English was able to radio for help, but by the time the police
arrived, the gunman and the Mercedes were gone, and the deputies
could not get a license number. Harvard said police also found a
blood trail leading to a vacant house a block and a half away, but
no one was in the house. She said the deputies did not know whether
the bleeding gunman had fled on foot, or driven away, or whether a
second person might have moved the car. Late Friday, the police
said they were also looking for a green Toyota in connection with
the case, but would not explain the car's connection.
</P>
<P>
   Police and sheriff's investigators searched the four-block area
for hours last night with SWAT teams, dogs and helicopters, but the
gunman was not found. Now the search has been extended throughout
the city, she said, including airports and transportation hubs. The
Police Department later said a nationwide all-points bulletin had
been issued for his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, H. Rap Brown's beret, goatee, and direct,
confrontational language made him one of the best-known leaders of
the Black Panther party. The Baton Rouge native had earlier been a
leader of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee,
registering voters in Alabama, but grew disenchanted with civil
disobedience and began advocating violence as justice minister of
the Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be trying to love that honky to death,'' he told a crowd
in Cambridge, Md., in July 1967. ``Shoot him to death. Shoot him to
death, brother, because that's what he is out to do to you.'' A few
hours later, a riot began in the town during which police officers
and black residents exchanged gunfire. Brown was charged with
inciting a riot, and after being freed on bail, was later charged
with carrying a gun across state lines while under indictment. He
went underground and was captured in 1971, after a shootout with
police in a New York City bar in a botched robbery.
</P>
<P>
   He converted to Islam while serving time on the robbery charges
at Rikers Island in New York City, and moved to Atlanta after he
was paroled in 1976. Since then, he has become one of the city's
most prominent Muslim clerics, opening a Sunni mosque known as the
Community Masjid in a ramshackle house across from the shooting
site, and working with neighborhood leaders to help clean up the
impoverished area. His friends and colleagues said they thought he
had renounced violence, and found it hard to imagine that he would
have gunned down two law enforcement officers,
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a principled man, a no-nonsense man with strong beliefs,
but not a violent man,'' said William Abdur-Rahim, imam of the
Masjid Al-Muminun and a member of the city's police Civilian Review
Board who has known Al-Amin for 20 years. ``There are those who
believe he's been pursued for years by entities of law enforcement
who held grievances against him. But we just do not know what could
have happened here.''

SPORTS COLUMN: 2 POINT GUARDS, HAPPY TO BE IN BUFFALO IN MARCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ Time is always running out on the point guard.
He is the one handling the ball with the clock winding down _ or
the game, or the season, or the career.
</P>
<P>
   Time was running out Friday for Shaheen Holloway and Speedy
Claxton, two point guards from Queens, paired in separate
doubleheaders.
</P>
<P>
   Holloway extended his career with a marvelous swerving jaunt
through the Oregon defense for a 72-71 overtime victory for Seton
Hall, which set up Sunday's meeting with Temple. Hours later,
Claxton's superb career at Hofstra ended with an 86-66 mismatch
loss to Oklahoma State.
</P>
<P>
   When the pairings were announced last Sunday, it was immediately
evident that Buffalo was the bracket of the point guards. There was
Pepe Sanchez from that basketball hotbed of Bahia Blanca,
Argentina, leading Temple to a 73-47 victory against Lafayette
Friday with a 15-assist, zero-point tour de force.
</P>
<P>
   There was Doug Gottlieb, from that subway-deprived wasteland of
Orange, Calif., running Oklahoma State's offense against Hofstra.
And there was Michael Lewis from Jasper, Ind. (``I didn't know what
the word `pass' meant''), now the career leader in assists at
Indiana, playing in the nightcap against Pepperdine.
</P>
<P>
   Holloway and Claxton were the obvious bookends, two little guys
who talk fast and move fast, who learned the game in the
playgrounds of Queens, and then went their separate ways to the
suburbs. They come from the borough that produced Bob Cousy of
Andrew Jackson and Al Seiden of Jamaica and Kenny Anderson of
Molloy and a lot of other diminutive artistes.
</P>
<P>
   Claxton's family eventually moved to the suburbs of Hempstead, a
few miles farther out on Long Island, but he commuted to Christ the
King High in Queens, where he was a teammate of Erick Barkley, now
with St. John's.
</P>
<P>
   The other day somebody asked him if he was from the suburbs, and
Claxton blurted: ``I'm from Queens. That's where I learned to
play.''
</P>
<P>
   He shrugged off the whispered offers of transfers to larger
so-called programs and he waited the full complement of four years
before he and Hofstra finally reached the tournament Friday night.
He scored 20 points, most of them when it was much too late.
</P>
<P>
   Holloway was a child prodigy. His uncle Eugene Holloway and his
brother, DeShawn, would escort him to games at St. John's, up on
the glacial hill above his own neighborhood, or take the E train
into the Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the thing about Queens,'' he said. ``You can get
places. It's not like the suburbs.''
</P>
<P>
   People would introduce him to Boo Harvey and other players from
St. John's. One year, David Edwards from Andrew Jackson High played
for Georgetown, before John Thompson grew tired of his flash Queens
mentality. (In those pre-Iverson days, Thompson referred to point
guard individualism as ``doing the boogaloo.'') These players
greeted the little man named Shaheen as a prospect, and then his
family sent him to St. Patrick's in Elizabeth, N.J., to avoid the
pitfalls of playing at home.
</P>
<P>
   In his first three years at Seton Hall, Holloway did not play in
the national tournament, a major hole in his life. Last summer he
took a working vacation at another basketball outpost in
Bloomington, Ind., living with a relative and working out with a
few friends, never laying eyes on the Indiana coach, whom he
admires. Holloway came back in better shape than his own coach,
Tommy Amaker, had ever seen him.
</P>
<P>
   This year Seton Hall won 20 games, was chosen for an at-large
berth, and Holloway came up here bubbling. Other people might gripe
about snow-encrusted Buffalo, but for Holloway this was the town
where he would finally achieve his dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids cheering for me yesterday, that was great,'' he said.
``We watched St. John's on television last night, pulling one out.
It's just great to be part of the NCAA tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday he fell on his wrist late in the first half, iced it
up, and came back. With seconds left in overtime, the ball was in
his hands, and true to his roots, Holloway was going to perform the
boogaloo, take it from end to end, with the full blessing of his
coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I missed three gamers this year,'' Holloway said later. ``I
had a shot like that against St. John's but coughed it up.''
</P>
<P>
   This time he darted around defenders like a man running to catch
the E train. He plunked the ball high off the backboard, whirled to
defend against Oregon's desperate heave and then exulted. He had
reversed the sand in the hourglass, but time is always running out
for point guards. They would have it no other way.

BUSH TV AD ATTACKS GORE, WHO SWIFTLY ANSWERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the first engagement of what may be a long and nasty air war,
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas unveiled a television commercial
Friday that attacked the Clinton administration's education
policies, saying that President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore
had failed in their effort to raise standards and close the
``achievement gap'' between rich and poor.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of the campaign's announcement, Gore's aides said
they would immediately begin running a spot answering the Bush
commercial.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush commercial says, ``Gore and Clinton had eight years,
but they've failed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore spot strikes back with an announcer saying: ``On the
issue of education, America deserves a real debate, not more
negative ads from George W. Bush. Al Gore is ready. Is George W.?''
</P>
<P>
   The 60-second Bush commercial was scheduled to be broadcast
Friday in six small and medium-size media markets in downstate
Illinois, which holds its presidential primaries on Tuesday. Gore's
aides said his advertisement would run with about the same
frequency in the same markets as the Bush spot.
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, said exposure
in the markets would spill over to viewers in three neighboring
states _ Iowa, Kentucky and Missouri _ that are considered to be
both significant and up for grabs in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer acknowledged that the amount and cost of the air time
was relatively small, which suggested to some political analysts
that the real target for the spot's message was the national press
corps, and the wider audience it commands.
</P>
<P>
   The introduction of the advertisement, less than two months into
the primary election season, indicated how swiftly Bush and Gore
were moving to a full-throttle general election campaign. The early
attack and response is in part a function of the lessons learned in
previous contests, when candidacies suffered after the opposition
succeeded early in a campaign in defining a rival in unsympathetic
terms in the minds of many voters.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson Warfield, a Republican consultant who was Bob Dole's
press secretary in the 1996 race, recalled on Friday the juncture
in the presidential contest when Dole began running spots for the
general election.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking much later,'' Warfield said. ``I think we're
talking late summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole did not respond quickly to the early television commercials
run on behalf of Clinton and Gore. The advertisements, for
instance, linked the Republican candidate to the policies of the
increasingly unpopular speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   ``They went up very early with those issue ads that attacked
Dole and Gingrich together,'' Warfield said. ``It defined Dole very
effectively, and painfully, for the general election. They
destroyed our fighters on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign, eager to repel anything resembling a
pre-emptive strike, put together a responding advertisement in a
couple of hours on Friday, said Christopher Lehane, the campaign's
press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's telling and interesting,'' Lehane said, ``that the Bush
campaign with its first commercial of the general election launched
a negative ad. I think there is a bit of an irony here when Texas
is ranked 45th out of 50 in SAT scores.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's spot begins with a series of characterizations about the
ways in which the Clinton administration had ``failed'' on
educational issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under Al Gore and Bill Clinton, national reading scores
stagnated,'' a narrator says. ``America's high school students
place almost dead last in international math tests. The achievement
gap between poor and nonpoor students remains wide.''
</P>
<P>
   It then describes Bush as being committed ``to challenge the
status quo with a crusade to improve education.''
</P>
<P>

KENTUCKY COULD BE VULNERABLE TO SYRACUSE COUP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Kentucky has what Syracuse wants.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats, self-proclaimed team of the century, has one of
college basketball's most sparkling pedigrees. Kentucky has won 85
NCAA Tournament games, more than any program. Kentucky has made 41
NCAA appearances, winning seven titles.
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse is the NCAA Tournament's answer to Avis. The Orangemen
have made it to the Final Four three times, reaching the
championship game twice under coach Jim Boeheim. Syracuse has more
NCAA victories (38) than any team that has never won a title.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fans will love to see Syracuse vs. Kentucky,'' said Orangemen
senior forward Ryan Blackwell. ``They're both well-recognized
schools, they have great traditions both ways.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second round of the Midwest Region on Saturday,
fourth-seeded Syracuse (25-5) faces fifth-seeded Kentucky (23-9)
(KTVT/Channel 11 at noon). In the second game, top-seeded Michigan
State (27-7) takes on depleted Utah (23-8), the No. 8 seed.
</P>
<P>
   Both Syracuse and Kentucky believe that a deep tourney run is
possible. But the Orangemen would dearly love to become this year's
dark horse. Syracuse won its first 19 games and was the nation's
last undefeated team before going 5-5 to close the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're capable of pulling off some wins,'' said
Syracuse senior point guard Jason Hart. ``In the tournament, to win
it all you only need to win six straight. We won 19 straight; we
can get through six.''
</P>
<P>
   The Orangemen, with three senior starters and solid depth, would
appear to have the edge on the Wildcats, who start one senior, a
junior, two sophomores and a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   Hart averages 12.2 points and 6.4 assists per game. Senior
center Etan Thomas averages 14 points, 9.4 rebounds and 3.8 blocked
shots per game. They'll present serious challenges for Kentucky
junior point guard Saul Smith and senior center Jamaal Magloire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our heart has won games for us this year,'' said Magloire, who
averages 13.2 points and 9.1 rebounds per game. ``We've shown a lot
of character all season, and we're going to make a serious run in
this tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Few people would agree with that statement. Kentucky has lost
nine players from its roster since the end of last season. The
latest was starter Desmond Allison, who was suspended before the
NCAA Tournament after being arrested on suspicion of driving under
the influence. The Wildcats have only two scholarship players on
their bench who have seen significant playing time this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``People look at us as Goliath,'' Kentucky coach Tubby Smith
said. ``We think we're more like David.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' Syracuse's Boeheim said with a tired smile, ``if
that's true, they're pretty big Davids.''
</P>
<P>
   Utah relates to the whole David-Goliath analogy. The Utes lost
starting guard Jeremy Killion to a knee injury in their first-round
victory over Saint Louis. Starting center Nate Althoff re-injured
his back and is listed as questionable. That makes Michigan State a
daunting challenge for Utes coach Rick Majerus, who has a 17-8
record in NCAA Tournament games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sitting here with seven scholarship players, one of whom
has a stress fracture (Mike Puzey) in his leg,'' Majerus said. ``I
need to rally the troops, make sure they don't take a woe-is-me
posture. We've got to buck up and play with who we have. We know
what the task is.'' nn

MAN INDICTED IN WEB FRAUD AFTER LOSSES OF $1 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (js) 
 By TINA KELLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Brooklyn man known by his e-mail identities,
``Nestle Quik'' and ``Tha Baker,'' was indicted Friday on charges
of bilking online travel agencies out of at least $1.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Using free, hard-to-trace e-mail addresses, the man, Ashley
Simmons, 29, used stolen credit card numbers to purchase electronic
airline tickets, according to the federal indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Posing as a travel agent, Simmons, who has a history of credit
card fraud, then sold the tickets at a fraction of their value to
people he contacted via e-mail, the indictment says. Either he or
the purchasers would pick up the tickets at airports including La
Guardia and Kennedy International.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking into whether or not other people are involved,''
said Marshall Miller, an assistant U.S. attorney.
</P>
<P>
   The case came to light after the owners of the credit cards
found charges on their bills for unauthorized airline ticket
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Mukesh Chandrani of the Secret Service said the scheme worked in
part because Simmons' e-mail addresses, including
quik55(at)hotmail.com, thabaker(at)hotmail.com and
dabaker(at)gotoworld.com, were not easily traceable to his real
name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the larger lesson is to be wary of businesses using
free e-mail addresses,'' said Chandrani, special agent in charge of
the Secret Service office in New York. ``If you're a legitimate
business, and someone is able to do thousands, or even hundreds of
thousands of dollars in commerce with you, would that person need a
free e-mail address?''
</P>
<P>
   According to federal authorities, Simmons stole from several
Internet travel agencies. One of the victims was Expedia Inc.,
which is mostly owned by Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   After discovering the fraud, Expedia began using software that
made it easier to detect suspicious activity, said Erik Blachford,
Expedia's vice president for marketing. The company also about
doubled its quarterly reserve to $1.1 million to cover such fraud.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of recent frauds like the one in which Simmons is
charged, Expedia announced earlier this month that it needed a
one-time reserve of $4 million to $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Blachford estimated the number of people who received fraudulent
credit card charges in the hundreds, not thousands, and he noted
that the security of the Expedia.com site and the information it
keeps on its customers had not been compromised.
</P>
<P>
   Under the indictment, Simmons was charged with unauthorized
credit card use and trafficking in unauthorized credit cards. If
convicted of both counts, he could be sentenced to 25 years in
prison and fined at least $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear where Simmons had obtained the credit card
numbers, said Bob Weaver, a Secret Service official and head of the
New York Electronic Crimes Task Force, although investigators
suspect he got them on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons, who was convicted in 1996 of illegal use of credit
cards and mail fraud, was arrested on Feb. 18 in Miami as he
boarded a plane with an electronic ticket purchased with a stolen
American Express card number, according to the U.S. attorney's
office. He is in custody in southern Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver said the agencies investigating the scam received a lot
of help from credit card companies and online travel agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``With these types of Internet e-commerce investigations, that's
the trick,'' he said. ``Who did it? Who's the real person? And
where is he?''

In celebration of a really good Guy's birthday (For use by NYTimes
News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Guy Carbonneau blushed. Honestly. He blushed.
</P>
<P>
   He couldn't understand why all the fuss about his birthday
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Guy, it's the whole 40th birthday thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of people turn 40,'' Carbonneau countered.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but not lots of people are 40 and playing in the NHL. In
fact, the Stars center is the only one.
</P>
<P>
   And so, in honor of his 40th birthday, we've assembled 40
reasons to love Guy Carbonneau:
</P>
<P>
   40. ``You think Father Time will catch up to him,'' Stars
assistant general manager Doug Armstrong said. ``But Father Time
never does.''
</P>
<P>
   39. He didn't ask for anything for his birthday. ``I don't need
anything. I have everything I want. Besides, I bought myself new
golf clubs not too long ago.''
</P>
<P>
   38. He has played in 62 of Dallas' 71 games this season. Only
six Stars have played in more.
</P>
<P>
   37. In his 18-year playing career, he has only one regret: ``I
never had a chance to play in an All-Star game.''
</P>
<P>
   36. ``His proper hEnglish,'' Stars winger Mike Keane joked.
``That's H-E-N-G-L-I-S-H.'' Being a French Canadian, Carbonneau
sometimes struggles with his phrasing. Much to the amusement of his
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   35. His funniest speaking gaffe just may have been in last
season's playoffs when he was quoted as saying: ``We got them on
the rope'' about Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   34. By playing at 40, Carbonneau reminds us that anything is
possible if we try. ``I got people who come to me and say, `I am 40
years old or 45 and I have a tough time running a half a mile and
you play in the NHL,'' Carbonneau said.
</P>
<P>
   33. He doesn't just play in the NHL. He averages 15 minutes, 45
seconds a game in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   32. Carbonneau believes in love at first sight. He said he
realized as soon as he met his wife, Line, that he'd met the woman
he was going to marry. ``I think beside the look, she was smart and
fun to be around. To this day, she still is, and I think that's why
we're still so in love.''
</P>
<P>
   31. He told his wife he'd retire after this season, but she
doesn't think he will.
</P>
<P>
   30. He checks the best lines in the NHL night after night.
</P>
<P>
   29. He's able to do it, Stars coach Ken Hitchcock explains,
because of his ``competitive fire. That's a major element that has
given this man an opportunity to play at such a mature age. If you
don't have that fire, you can fall off the map pretty quickly ''
</P>
<P>
   28. By the way, Carbonneau deserves to win both the Selke Trophy
(for the best defensive forward) and Masterson Trophy (awarded
annually to the player who best represents the qualities of
sportsmanship, perseverance and dedication to hockey).
</P>
<P>
   27. Only Stars general manager Bob Gainey has won the Selke more
times (4) than Carbo (3).
</P>
<P>
   26. Because even if you never met him, he makes you feel as
though he's ``Carbo'' to you.
</P>
<P>
   25. His trio of Stanley Cup rings _ 1986, 1993 and 1999 _ which
he calls his best memories in hockey.
</P>
<P>
   24. He has 258 goals and 402 assists in his 18 regular seasons.
</P>
<P>
   23. He has 36 goals and 51 assists in 208 playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   22. He admits to being a shy kid. ``For me to feel accepted or a
part of something, I felt I had to do a little extra,'' Carbonneau
said. ``If you needed somebody, all you had to do was call me and
I'd show up.''
</P>
<P>
   21. Stars forward Brian Skrudland played with Carbonneau in
Montreal and Dallas. ``He's the most dependable guy I ever played
with,'' Skrudland said.
</P>
<P>
   20. He didn't quit after Montreal gave up on him after the
1993-94 season, trading him to St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   19. He didn't quit after St. Louis gave up on him a season
later.
</P>
<P>
   18. He willingly admits his ego took a beating after both. ``I
wanted to prove they were wrong,'' Carbonneau said. ``I think I
thought about that a couple of times during the playoffs where I
thought, `I hope we win this so I can go back to Montreal with the
Stanley Cup and put it under their nose.' ''
</P>
<P>
   17. He did it, too.
</P>
<P>
   16. He admits to thinking ``Who me?'' every time he hears the
Stars crowd chants ``Guuuuuuy.''
</P>
<P>
   15. He's a key cog in the Stars' NHL-leading penalty kill.
</P>
<P>
   14. He may be your father's age, but he still listens to some
pretty cool music. ``He's a Neil Young, Bob Dylan kind of guy,''
said Stars winger Brett Hull, who rides to practice with Carbonneau
on most days. ``He's got a little heavy metal to him, Led Zeppelin.
He's likes to rock 'n' roll.''
</P>
<P>
   13. How many other 39-year-olds party with a heavy-metal band
like Pantera?
</P>
<P>
   12. Wasn't it at just such a party that Lord Stanley's Cup
picked up a ding?
</P>
<P>
   11. He also spent some quiet time with the Cup, taking it to his
father's grave this summer.
</P>
<P>
   10. Carbonneau, just like you and me, has regrets. Mostly, he
regrets that he wasn't closer to his father, Charles-Aime, who died
during the Stanley Cup playoffs last season. ``Yeah,'' Carbonneau
said when asked if he wished he had been closer. ``But I made a
choice when I was 15 to go make a career out of hockey and he was
always behind it.''
</P>
<P>
   9. Oh, yeah, did we mention he left home at 15 to go play
Juniors?
</P>
<P>
   8. He was drafted by the Montreal Canadiens in 1979. Yes, your
math is correct. That was 21 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   7. He proved everybody wrong by making it into the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   6. He's still proving everybody wrong by staying in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   5. ``Every year I go on the ice, I have to prove myself to
somebody,'' Carbonneau said. ``That's the way I play.''
</P>
<P>
   4. Who doesn't remember Carbonneau's goal against the Detroit
Red Wings with 85 seconds remaining in Game 5 in the 1998 Western
Conference Finals that forced overtime and eventually forced a Game
6?
</P>
<P>
   3. His teammates are both effusive and genuine in their praise.
``He's one of the greatest guys I've ever had the pleasure of not
only playing with but being friends with,'' Hull said.
</P>
<P>
   2. Carbonneau credits his wife for his success, not to mention
longevity in hockey. ``I think I really realized that about nine
years ago when she went back to school full time. I didn't have
somebody to cook for me. I had to clean up a little bit. She didn't
come to the games too much because she had to get up early in the
morning. I found that really, really hard and I think that's when I
realized just how unbelievable she is.''
</P>
<P>
   1. And the No. 1 reason we love Guy Carbonneau is ... he's ours.
A lot like Rangers hurler Nolan Ryan, Carbonneau arrived here late
in his career, but he has become a Texan. When he retires, he'll
retire a Star. ``There is no chance of me going anywhere else,''
Carbonneau said.
</P>
<P>
   P.S.: Just in case you needed one more reason to love Guy
Carbonneau, he may just give you another season to love Guy
Carbonneau. He hasn't decided whether to retire after this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that before the injury I knew what I wanted to do.
This injury just kind of put a dent in my decision. I don't know if
I'll retire. I really don't know. ... Even if I tell you `Yes, I do
want to come back and want to play.' In July, when I get up at 7
o'clock and get into my running shoes and I get to the end of my
street and say, `Oh my, I don't feel like doing this anymore.'
Then, I'll know.''
</P>
<P>
   He has two bottles saved in his extensive wine cellar for just
that day. nn

BLUE SPRINGS MAN CHARGED WITH THREATENING PEOPLE ON JETLINER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ERICA WOOD, DONALD BRADLEY  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Relatives and neighbors know Peter Bradley as a family man,
friendly neighbor and hard-working carpenter.
</P>
<P>
   But federal authorities said Friday the Blue Springs man was
responsible for a bizarre incident Thursday night aboard an Alaska
Airlines jet flying over the West Coast. Authorities accused him of
threatening to kill passengers and crew members before breaking
into the cockpit and attacking the crew.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to kill all of you...keep away from me,'' Bradley
reportedly said, simulating the shape of a gun with his hand.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, 39, was tackled by fellow passengers and later charged
in U.S. District Court in San Francisco with assaulting flight crew
members and interfering with their duties. He could face up to 20
years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   He was being held late Friday in a San Francisco jail. Police
had no motive for the attack, which occurred Thursday night on a
flight from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley had traveled to Mexico for a reunion with male members
of his family, said his Kansas City attorney, John P. O'Connor. The
men had taken a similar trip the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who witnesses said muttered threats and shed some of
his clothes during the ordeal, had no history of mental illness,
O'Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   According to O'Connor, Bradley's wife, Laura Bradley, insisted
that her husband's reported activities were totally out of
character.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she got the phone call from the San Francisco hospital,
she thought it was a prank phone call,'' O'Connor said. ``She was
having a hard time believing it. Even after it was reported in the
news, she was having a hard time believing this same man was her
husband.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley had called his wife the day before his flight, O'Connor
said. The couple discussed such things as his trip and flight
times, and there was nothing to indicate anything was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bradley and the couple's 19-year-old son, Travis, flew to
San Francisco on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   One hour into the Alaska Airlines flight Thursday, Peter Bradley
began doing odd things such as standing up after crew members told
him to sit down, said Alaska Airlines spokesman Lou Cancelmi.
</P>
<P>
   Police in Missouri said they had no record of problems with
Bradley other than two traffic violations in 1979. The citations
were not drug- or alcohol-related.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors were surprised by the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd characterize him as a laid-back kind of guy. I never saw
any behavior that would make me think otherwise,'' said neighbor
Earl Andersen.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Bresnahan visited with Bradley on occasion and waved to him
nearly every day. He described Bradley as a ``normal, hard-working
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The person I heard about on the news was not the person I saw
out in the yard,'' Bresnahan said. ``I'm curious to find out what
happened...what would make someone do something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor was talking Friday with prosecutors and a public
defender in San Francisco, trying to get the case moved to federal
court in Kansas City. Usually, if federal prosecutors in both areas
agree, federal cases can be transferred.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor said it would benefit Bradley to be near his family and
any necessary care.

SPORTS COLUMN: BARKLEY LOOKS FOR THE NEW ENEMY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. _ Erick Barkley walked down a long, winding
corridor of the McKale Center Friday afternoon, a corridor nearly
splattered with St. John's tears just hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the highest-seeded teams had barreled through the NCAA
tournament's first round. St. John's had not. Playing a listless,
tentative game, St. John's trailed Northern Arizona by a point with
10.9 seconds to play. Only a leaning shot in the lane by Lavor
Postell and his subsequent free throw had boosted St. John's to a
second-round matchup with Gonzaga Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley had played unevenly. He had attempted 12 shots and made
just two and had hit 3 of 4 free throws. But he had also handed out
six assists, had not turned the ball over and had made three
steals, including one that sealed the victory with 2.6 seconds
left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really think I had a bad game; I just didn't shoot the
ball that well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley wondered why he had come out so flat Thursday night. Had
it been first-game blahs, or was there something more? All Barkley
knew was that for an evening he had lost the sense of mission that
had driven him _ nearly over the edge _ for the last month.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley thought about the rough first game. Maybe it had
something to do with a meeting this week with NCAA enforcement
officials. They had been on Barkley's trail like bloodhounds since
the first part of February, forcing St. John's to suspend him twice
_ once five minutes before a home game at Madison Square Garden.
Back home, there were large back-page photos of Barkley in tears, a
towel over his head as he watched helplessly.
</P>
<P>
   Then, during the Big East tournament, the NCAA intimated that it
was widening the investigation into circumstances surrounding
Barkley's college entrance exam taken while he attended prep school
in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   After the Big East semifinal game eight days ago, Barkley
stunned teammates and coaches by announcing that he would take a
leave of absence. He changed his mind and led St. John's to its
first Big East tournament championship in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   But the emotional wounds from the humiliation and embarrassment
had closed and formed a callus where lighthearted feelings used to
be. The NCAA, in Barkley's mind and in the minds of his teammates,
had become the enemy, the fuel for his ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA became the inspiration that drove Barkley, and
subsequently his team, to victory after victory. St. John's wasn't
just playing Connecticut or Syracuse or Duke or Miami. They were
playing the director of enforcement, his staff of investigators,
the news media who kept it all going.
</P>
<P>
   So this week, when Barkley actually had a cordial meeting with
investigators and they told him that they were mostly satisfied,
that he was mostly clear, that the assault was all but over,
Barkley said he felt an odd sense of relief with a sense of loss.
</P>
<P>
   The emptiness didn't really hit him until Thursday's game with
Northern Arizona. Something was missing in his game, a certain
inner anger. The NCAA was missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I kind of thought about that last night,'' Barkley said.
``After the game I was kind of thinking, `Dag, I probably need the
NCAA to mess with me some more in order for me to play good.'''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley doesn't need the headaches and heartaches of an NCAA
inquiry to make him play better. The pressure took more out of him
than he probably realized; the anger siphoned off the
once-in-a-lifetime joy of simply being here, of reveling in the
glow of a national spotlight and of feeling the natural highs and
lows, in Barkley's case, of being reunited with good friends.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Barkley will face Matt Santangelo, the Gonzaga point
guard who was his teammate last summer on the American team for the
World University Games. They hung out together in Spain. They
played cards well into the night, crushing their opponents by day.
``He's a cool guy,'' Barkley said. ``We talked a lot, not about
basketball but about school, our neighborhoods, where we grew up.''
Santangelo, a senior from Portland, Ore., had good memories as
well. He said he felt for his new, old friend as Barkley endured
the national scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   For Erick Barkley, at least, the NCAA inquiry is part of history
that is rapidly fading to black. He said he no longer needed the
false motivation of us against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being here, being in the tournament alone _ I'll thrive off of
that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the game is enough.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Gonzaga will do.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's not a job with a future, but the future of many
neighborhoods in the United States may be affected by how well the
job is done.
</P>
<P>
   Every 10 years the Census Bureau hires an army of census takers
_ enumerators, in bureau parlance. For the 2000 count, which has
just begun, the bureau needs about a half-million of them.
</P>
<P>
   The job lasts only six weeks or so. It involves knocking on the
doors of strangers _ people who do not return the forms that were
recently sent to every household in the nation _ and asking them
personal questions: their ages, their races, the names of their
children and, in many cases, whether they are married and how much
money they make.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, it pays $18.50 an hour _ not bad for a temp
job. It requires math, reasoning ability and an FBI background
check.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and there's also a quiz.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent morning, two dozen would-be census takers were
hunkered down over the test in a conference room at a Brooklyn
building, answering _ or vainly puzzling over _ the 28 questions,
which were intended to measure their mathematical, reading,
clerical and organizational skills. (Sample question: ``Ms. Jones
can't remember the year of her birth, but she knows she was born in
the month of September. If it is now May 1990, and Jones tells you
she is 78 years old, in what year was she born?'' Answer: 1911.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite the thriving economy and low unemployment, many people
seem eager for the work, either because they need the money or
because they believe it is their civic duty.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, at least two applicants were there because of
population pressures in their own families. Damark Mitchell, 34,
said that he already had a full-time job as a carpenter, but that
he was willing to work nights and weekends knocking on doors. ``I
need extra money,'' he explained. ``I've got three small kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Another applicant, Jerry Schultz, 68, said he had worked as an
actor, a welfare investigator and a market researcher, among many
pursuits, but he was retired now and struggling to meet expenses
from his wife's illness. He added: ``I enjoy meeting people, so it
should be interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   For Jasmine Lozada, 20, the goal was ``saving money for
college.''
</P>
<P>
   Bureau officials say those hired will be assigned as far as
possible to the areas they live in.
</P>
<P>
   Census officials said this week that they had met 90 percent of
their goal of testing 3 million applicants nationwide for the
enumerator jobs. They want a pool of 2.4 million qualified
applicants across the country, five times the number they expect to
hire, because experience indicates that many who are found eligible
will not accept the jobs. Some will have found permanent jobs.
Others will have had second thoughts about knocking on strangers'
doors.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990 census, 35 percent of the New York region's 6.1
million households at the time failed to return the form _ the same
percentage as in the country generally.
</P>
<P>
   In its intensive effort to recruit census takers, the bureau has
announced the job openings in letters and cards mailed to every
residence in the country. Lozada said she learned about the jobs
through television announcements and fliers that the bureau had
posted on lampposts and other highly visible places, giving local
numbers to call or a national number reachable anywhere in the
country: 1-888-325-7733.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Census takers must be at least 17. They need not be citizens,
though they must be in the country legally and permitted to work.
The pay varies across the country, with the range this year _ from
a low of $8.25 an hour in Duncan, Okla., to a high of $18.50 in New
York City _ ``more competitive with local labor rates than 10 years
ago,'' said Clifton Taylor Jr., chief of recruiting. Those assigned
as crew leaders will receive somewhat more.
</P>
<P>
   The census was once handled entirely by door-to-door
enumerators. But since 1970 the bureau has relied on the
questionnaires, followed by visits to those who did not respond to
them. This time the surveys were mailed in recent days to 98
million homes. In the case of an additional 20 million homes,
mostly in rural areas where people pick up their mail at post
offices and other central locations, the forms are being delivered
to the residences.
</P>
<P>
   The forms are due back by April 1. Near the end of April, the
census takers will begin making their rounds. If nobody is home,
they are supposed to return as many as three times, and make up to
three telephone calls, said Peter Sefton, the Census Bureau's chief
of household enumeration. If those efforts fail, he said, ``they
are to try to get the information from a neighbor'' or someone like
an apartment-house manager.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990 census, not all the enumerators were so diligent;
some made up the information instead. In northern New Jersey,
census workers said some supervisors told them to fabricate data
for thousands of households in response to pressure from the
Philadelphia regional office to finish the count. As a result, the
bureau sent new enumerators to 18,000 homes at an additional cost
of several hundred thousand dollars.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Sefton said, the bureau is taking ``proactive steps''
to combat falsification, including checking a random sample of each
census taker's work by sending another enumerator back to the homes
in the sample.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the census say the real accuracy problem is not the
few instances of faked forms, but the undercount. In recent years
there have been politically and racially charged debates and
lawsuits about the accuracy of the census, which is used for
apportioning seats among the states in the House of Representatives
and for redistricting state legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   Those disputes have stemmed from the difficulty of achieving a
full and accurate count because of people who, out of fear,
suspicion or the belief that some of the questions are intrusive,
refuse to return the surveys, or provide false or incomplete
information, or try to avoid the census takers. For this reason,
census takers have a crucial role to play in persuading people to
cooperate.

THE WOODLANDS OPERATORS DENY REPORTS TRACK COULD CLOSE IN AUGUST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Operators of The Woodlands have no plans to close the facility
on Aug. 31 or any other date, track lawyers told the Kansas Racing
and Gaming Commission during a meeting Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no intention to close in August,'' said Dan Denk, a
lawyer for TRAK East, the track's nonprofit group that holds the
state racing license.
</P>
<P>
   During The Woodlands' annual relicensing review Friday at the
Kansas City, Kan., track, commission Chairman Gene Olander asked
officials to explain recent public comments by co-owner Bill Grace
that unless the Kansas Legislature approves a bill paving the way
for legal slot machine gambling, the track would be closed. Grace
was vacationing and not present.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's his opinion,'' said Larry Seckington, a lawyer for
Grace's Mid Continent Racing and Gaming III company. ``Financially
we're getting stronger every week.''
</P>
<P>
   Seckington said the issue of closing has never been formally
discussed by track directors.
</P>
<P>
   Betting has been up since the first of the year by 15 percent on
dog races and 17 percent on horse races broadcast from other
tracks, Woodlands General Manager Allan Meyers said. ``We're not
closed,'' Meyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Meyers said more aggressive marketing and improved food and
beverage offerings under the Grace group's management have
increased attendance by nearly 11 percent this year and spurred a
turnaround in revenues that had declined every year for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Despite an improved balance sheet, Seckington said, ``We're
still at a break-even position. Investors deserve a return on their
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Seckington said he expects a bill to be introduced Monday in the
Kansas Senate that would permit local option voting to allow slot
machines and other electronic gambling devices at state-licensed
tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Draft versions of that legislation call for the state to receive
a 20 percent share of slot revenues for education and other
purposes. The horse and dog racing industries also would receive
shares for larger purses to attract more and better-quality racing
to the state.
</P>
<P>
   The commission Friday also:
</P>
<P>
   - Deregulated the use of cell phones by track patrons. Woodlands
security chief Dave Johnson said the proliferation of cell phones
in recent years had made the rule unenforceable.
</P>
<P>
   .'' ] Johnson said security officials will continue to monitor
cell phone use at the track and enforce other state rules that
prohibit proxy betting and other gambling activities via telephone.
</P>
<P>
   - Authorized the Kansas Gaming Agency to enter arbitration to
resolve a dispute with Harrah's Prairie Band Casino near Topeka
over alcohol service on the gaming floor, which had been
prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   A $7.5 million remodeling of the tribal gambling hall was opened
to the public Friday. It added a brew pub and expanded the gaming
floor by around 250 additional slot machines.
</P>
<P>
   Gaming Agency Executive Director Tracy Diel said the casino
plans to allow alcoholic beverages to be served and consumed in
that area.
</P>
<P>
   An arbitrator now will be asked to interpret language in the
agreement between the state and the Prairie Band of Potawatomi
Tribe and decide whether beverage service must be limited to casino
bar areas only. Harrah's Entertainment Inc. operates the casino for
the tribe.
</P>
<P>
   - Heard plans from Phil Ruffin, the proposed new owner of the
long closed Camptown Racetrack in Frontenac, Kan., to reopen for
year-round simulcast betting and weekends-only live dog racing
starting July 1.
</P>
<P>
   The commission Friday granted conditional approval on Ruffin's
license application. Track officials said simulcast betting could
begin as early as next month.
</P>
<P>
   Ruffin also owns Wichita Greyhound Park and casinos in Las Vegas
and the Bahamas.

AILING O'CONNOR SKIPS ST. PATRICK'S EVENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ While New Yorkers wondered this week whether Cardinal
John O'Connor would appear at the St. Patrick's Day Mass and
parade, his strength surged and ebbed as he struggled through the
limitations of an illness that seemed to take aim at the activities
he loves most.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, for the first time in 16 years, the cardinal was
unable to publicly celebrate Mass for St. Patrick's Day, or to
greet marchers on Fifth Avenue as they filed past the cathedral
that is named for the saint. At the cathedral, where the altar was
bedecked with green carnations, the cardinal's absence was
palpable.
</P>
<P>
   It has grown difficult for him to keep up with the daily dramas
in the city where he has played such a prominent role, said Joseph
Zwilling, a spokesman for the archdiocese. The cardinal's hearing
is weakening along with his strength, and he is having trouble with
his eyesight. An ardent reader who regularly consumed two to three
books a week, he can no longer make out the print in newspapers or
books.
</P>
<P>
   Though he was dressed and received visitors in the sitting room
at his residence, O'Connor was not strong enough to attend Mass in
the cathedral Friday, said Zwilling. ``His sense of humor is there
as always, but he was very weak,'' said the spokesman, who visited
the cardinal during the parade. ``Even if the weather had been
beautiful, he couldn't have made it out.''
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal celebrated Mass privately Friday morning in the
chapel at his residence, which is behind the cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   Until his surgery last summer to remove a brain tumor, which was
followed by radiation therapy, O'Connor was an energetic, outspoken
leader of the New York archdiocese's 2.4 million Roman Catholics.
Beyond the 10 counties his archdiocese covers, the cardinal became
the best-known Catholic cleric in the country next to Pope John
Paul II, and seemed at times to be the unofficial spokesman for the
Vatican in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But as the cardinal's health has weakened, he has grown more
private. While bidding farewell to his fellow bishops in moving
letters during the last six months, the cardinal has avoided
publicly discussing the details of his illness or his prognosis.
</P>
<P>
   At St. Patrick's Cathedral on Friday, worshippers like Ed
Maloney said they missed O'Connor. Maloney, 67, a former New York
City police officer who founded the police bagpipe band in 1960,
has been coming to the St. Patrick's Day Mass for 20 years. On
Friday, he remembered the cardinal's introducing dignitaries in the
pews each St. Patrick's Day.
</P>
<P>
   One or two years ago, the cardinal surprised and delighted
Maloney, who uses a wheelchair, by introducing the retired officer
and his wife. ``I felt like I was the only guy in church,'' Maloney
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, nobody introduced the politicians and luminaries in
the audience. Maloney, for one, said he missed the showmanship of
O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the spark plug that made it move,'' Maloney said.

UNDERCOVER POLICE TRAINING INCLUDES IDENTIFICATION RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   (With NY-POLICE-SHOOTING, NY-POLICE-PROSECUTOR)  
 (bl)  
 By KEVIN FLYNN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Undercover narcotics officers, like the detective who
fatally shot an unarmed security guard Thursday, receive several
weeks of special training to prepare them for the contingencies of
street encounters, including specific instructions on when to drop
their guise and identify themselves as officers, police officials
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of whether plainclothes officers clearly identified
themselves has figured in several recent incidents, including the
shooting of Amadou Diallo. Police critics have questioned whether
officers in civilian clothes have too often been involved in deadly
cases of confusion.
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday's incident, a man who was standing with the security
guard has told investigators that the guard, Patrick Dorismond,
never knew he was scuffling with the police because none of the
three plainclothes officers identified themselves during the
struggle that preceded the shooting. But the officer who fired the
fatal shot, Detective Anthony Vasquez, has said through his lawyer
that he shouted that he was a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   Officers learn the department's policy on when to identify
themselves during the formal training they receive when they accept
an undercover narcotics assignment, Deputy Chief Thomas Fahey said.
</P>
<P>
   Fahey described the policy: ``If during the course of his
activities, an undercover sees someone at risk or in danger of
being killed, naturally he has got to become a police officer. And
if announcing the fact that he is a police officer would improve
the situation or help the situation, we would expect him to do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Vasquez's account of the incident, he identified
himself and began fighting with Dorismond after rushing to the aid
of an undercover colleague who signaled for help when the incident
escalated into a violent argument. The two officers with Vasquez
have acknowledged to Internal Affairs investigators that they did
not identify themselves, law enforcement officials said. But the
officers said they did hear someone else, possibly Vasquez, yell
``Police'' during the scuffle.
</P>
<P>
   But a senior investigator has said that, hours after the
incident, a friend of Dorismond who was with him during the
encounter, Kevin Kaiser, still did not appear to know that it had
been a police officer who fired the fatal shot.
</P>
<P>
   Vasquez has said through his lawyer that his gun discharged
accidentally during a struggle with Dorismond. Unlike patrol
officers, who are usually equipped with pepper spray and a
nightstick to subdue a suspect, most plainclothes officers often
carry only a gun, a tactic that helps them appear inconspicuous but
also means the stakes can rise rapidly during a violent
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Fahey said the rules that governed when an officer may pull his
weapon were taught to all recruits at the Police Academy. ``You are
allowed to draw your gun when you think the gun is necessary to
defend yourself or others,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fahey would not detail the rest of the training undercover
officers received because, he said, the department did not want to
do anything that might expose them to the risk of identification.
</P>
<P>
   But other officers who have received or been involved in the
training described in broad terms the strategies covered in the
three-week course, which is taught at the Brooklyn Army Terminal by
the Special Projects unit of the Narcotics Division in tandem with
senior undercover officers and other law enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   The curriculum includes sessions on how to dress, how to signal
for help, what to do if you are forced to take drugs (it is allowed
if an officer believes his life is in jeopardy), verbal judo and
other street tactics, including a glossary of street terms and
values for drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Casper, the prosecutor in charge of narcotic trial
operations for the Brooklyn district attorney's office, said he
often taught a part of the course that instructed undercover
officers how to prepare for trial and that the police officials who
ran the program were concerned that the training be thorough.
``Whenever I make a suggestion they have been nothing but
supportive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But one narcotics supervisor who has been involved in the
training said the team that tangled with Dorismond did not appear
to have followed one important guideline often cited during
training sessions: if a confrontation appears to be escalating,
move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want the undercovers to get hurt,'' the supervisor
said, ``so in a buy and bust we just tell them to leave if there is
any sign of a confrontation.''

BOEING, STRIKING ENGINEERS REACH TENTATIVE DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL NYHAN  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Boeing Co. and its engineering union struck a
tentative deal yesterday on a new contract for 22,000 employees,
setting the stage for the end to a 39-day strike that has crippled
the region's largest private employer.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative pact, which must still be approved by union
members on Sunday, contains a host of concessions sought by the
engineering union, including greater guaranteed wages, preservation
of health care benefits and a lump-sum bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Both camps are now hoping the agreement will resolve the longest
engineering strike in Boeing history and bring between 15,000 and
18,000 engineers and technical workers back to their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very significant victory for (the Society of
Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace). It is a capstone
to a remarkable event in the ongoing history of labor in Seattle,''
said David Olson, a political science professor at the University
of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides assembled the proposal after a flurry of meetings
with regulators, federal mediators, and finally each other in
Washington, D.C. this week. By early Friday morning, both
negotiating teams unanimously endorsed the contract offer.
</P>
<P>
   But, the dispute isn't over yet. Union members will cast their
votes on the proposal Sunday. They already have rejected two offers
from Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, union leaders praised the latest company offer Friday,
saying it addressed many of their concerns. They also said they
were hopeful union members would eventually endorse the effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got one helluva deal,'' said Tom McCarty, a member of the
union's negoatiating team.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, many rank-and-file members gave the offer a more
moderate reception. Many said they were particularly disspointed
with the company's bonus proposal, which promises $1,000 30 days
after the contract is ratified. Employees would qualify for two
other payments totaling $1,500 if the company reaches two airplane
delivery targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am teetering on the fence like I think many people are. I
don't know how I will vote until I attend the meeting tomorrow
night,'' wrote Ken Johnson, a striking union member wrote in an
e-mail response to questions from the Seattle Post-Intelligencer.
</P>
<P>
   The strike also has created some bitterness among Boeing's
technical workers, who say their salaries lag far behind their
peers in the aerospace community. That sentiment and the walkout is
leading some striking employees to seek work elsewhere, according
to some union members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last few weeks many have looked around at what is
available in the market and found they can do better, in some cases
much better,'' Gerry Buss responded in an e-mail sent to the P-I.
</P>
<P>
   Members will spend Saturday and part of Sunday studying the fine
print and attending union-sponsored meetings designed to explain
the contract.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders expected some members to be critical after they
spent an emotional 38 days on the picket lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (members) wanted us to come and sweep the table clean,''
Stan Sorscher, chairman of the engineering negotiating team. `` It
does takes awhile to settle down.''
</P>
<P>
   The union spent Friday highlighting the company's new
concessions, including a boost in the guaranteed wage increases
that both engineers and technical workers would receive.
</P>
<P>
   Under the contract, a technician is guaranteed a four percent
raise in the first year, and a three percent raise in each of the
next two years. Overall, the company created a pool to finance 5.5
percent in raises in the first year and 4.5. percent increases in
each successive year.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers, on the other hand, would receive a guaranteed three
percent raise every year of the contract. The company set side
another five percent in raises for merit increases, targeted
professions and a special promotion fund.
</P>
<P>
   One of the greatest disappointments for union negotiators was
the company's bonus proposal. They were seeking a simple payment,
similar to the 10-percent bonus members of the International
Association of Machinists received last year.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, they settled for a bonus tied in part to company
performamce and less than the IAM payments, which averaged $4,400.
</P>
<P>
   The union did secure one of its top priorities: preservation of
much of the existing benefit package, including the absence of
co-payments by workers for health care premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has paid a steep price for the longest engineering strike
in its history. It only made three airplane deliveries in March,
and the delays forced airline customers to begin canceling flights
this week.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Boeing has seen its stock price plummet during the
strike, from 44.63 a week before the strike began to 35.63 on
Thursday. Friday, the proposed settlement gave the stock a boost,
as it rose 2.38 to close at 38.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing Wall Street does not like is ambiguity,'' said
Boeing Chairman Phil Condit at a press conference Friday. ``Now
that agreement is there, it begins to make the future a little less
cloudy.''
</P>
<P>
   Condit defended the company's latest offers as fair. He also
admitted the strike represented a major shift in relations between
Boeing managers and the company's second largest union.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that we can look back at this as a turning point, a
time when it was clearly recognized how important it will be to
listen carefully and understand each other,'' Condit said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Boeing executives are turning their attention to the
financial impact of the strike. They are also striving to hit their
original target of delivering 491 airplanes in 2000, assuming union
members endorse their offer. Some financial analysts, however, said
they face a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are obviously behind. Our plan is now that we have our team
back is to do everything we can to meet our committments for the
year,'' said Alan Mulally, the head of Boeing's commercial airplane
division.
</P>
<P>
   While the tentative pact holds the promise of peace at Boeing,
it's also poised to deliver a major victory to organized labor.
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO played a key role in supporting the strike and in
brokering the final deal. The federation's leaders have a lot at
stake, because they have targeted white-collar workers as fertile
ground in a renewed push for new members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their victory is a win for respect and health care and pension
security for all workers,'' AFL-CIO President John Sweeney said in
a statement. ``With the largest strike of private sector
professional workers in history, they proved again the oldest of
lessons: when people join together, they can win.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides praised the work AFL-CIO's Secretary-Treasurer
Richard Trumka in bringing the two sides together.
</P>
<P>
   But, Trumka wasn't alone in applying pressure. Thomas
Buffenbarger, head of the International Association of Machinists,
called Boeing officials personally to stress that the company's
most powerful union stood firmly behind striking engineers and
technicians.
</P>
<P>
   UW's Olson said the region's pronounced labor shortage, the
surprising solidarity of strikers and their key role at Boeing
increased pressure on the aerospace giant.
</P>
<P>
   While labor negotiators from both sides expressed satisfaction
with the final product when they returned from Seattle on Friday,
they said the process was wearing and at times ugly.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a pretty process,'' said SPEEA's Sorscher.

PLANNED PARENTHOOD INVESTIGATING WHETHER DOCUMENTS STOLEN FROM
CLINIC  
</HEADLINE>
 -KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Planned Parenthood is investigating reports that
documents were stolen from its Overland Park clinic, possibly as
part of a national campaign against collection of aborted fetal
tissue for medical research.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. House subcommittee may have used financial documents
stolen from the clinic as evidence at a hearing March 9, Planned
Parenthood lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Two days earlier, Eric Harrah, a former employee of Life
Dynamics Inc., a Texas anti-abortion group, alleged in a sworn
affidavit that patient and physician records, as well as financial
spreadsheets, were taken in January from Comprehensive Health. The
Overland Park clinic is affiliated with Planned Parenthood of
Kansas and Mid-Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   While it is not clear the two allegations concern the same
documents, Roger Evans, a lawyer for Planned Parenthood in New
York, said, ``It's about as serious an allegation as you can
make.''
</P>
<P>
   No complaint has been filed with Overland Park police because it
is not certain how or what records were acquired from the thousands
of patient files, he said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thus far we have not gotten anything to corroborate these
stories that there were crimes,'' he said. '
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to move heaven and earth to see what happened,
but you don't do it overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   In an affidavit sworn out March 7, Harrah alleged that $1,500
was paid to a former clinic employee, who entered the clinic after
hours and took records relating to tissue extraction.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Crutcher, Life Dynamics president, characterized Harrah's
allegations of stolen records as ``nonsense'' on Thursday. ``He's
lying.''
</P>
<P>
   Crutcher said any documents Life Dynamics acquired on abortions
or fetal tissue work came from ``infiltrators'' and
``whistle-blowers in the abortion industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Without mentioning Harrah's charges, Life Dynamics posted a
general denial of ``burglary or any other criminal activity'' on
its Web site Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   According to Harrah's affidavit, he saw the documents, which
included originals with names of patients, employees and doctors as
well as addresses, phone numbers and Social Security numbers. He
also described financial spreadsheets and a training manual.
</P>
<P>
   Harrah alleged that anti-abortion activists might contact
patients in the files to see if they had consented to donate fetal
tissue after the abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Planned Parenthood said all women sign consent forms, all
according to the law. Peter Brownlie, president and chief executive
officer of Planned Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri, said he
has not heard from any clients that they have been contacted about
the fetal tissue issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We place the highest value on patient confidentiality, privacy
and trust and we are going to investigate just as quickly as we
can,'' Brownlie said.
</P>
<P>
   Harrah's affidavit surfaces in the midst of an FBI investigation
into whether fetal tissue extracted at the Overland Park clinic was
improperly marketed by companies that had contracts with Planned
Parenthood.
</P>
<P>
   Fetal tissue is used in research to find cures for diseases from
juvenile diabetes to Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   Two companies, Anatomic Gift and Opening Lines, paid rent to
Comprehensive Health to use its facilities to extract tissue, such
as brain matter or livers. The clinic ended its contracts with the
companies and says the practice is not occurring at this time.
</P>
<P>
   Current federal law prohibits anything but ``reasonable'' fees
to be charged for the collection of organs and their transport to
medical researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-abortion activists contend that companies may be profiting
off the abortion trade. They also argue that women do not have a
clear understanding of the procedures and that some might be
influenced to put off abortions until the fetal tissue is more
developed, a charge Planned Parenthood rejects.
</P>
<P>
   Harrah, who once operated East Coast and Midwest abortion
clinics, was a national spokesman for a woman's right to choose
before switching sides in the debate a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He still opposes abortion, he said in an interview, but believes
that Crutcher's tactics are setting the cause back. ``He has caused
the pro-life movement harm in an election year.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrah said he warned a member of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, which had planned last month to look into fetal tissue,
that some documents being offered had been stolen. The Senate
hearing never materialized.
</P>
<P>
   Harrah said he did not make the same call to the House, where
the Health and Environment subcommittee also planned to hold
hearings. There, some financial records from Comprehensive Health
were entered as evidence, according to James Fitzpatrick, another
Planned Parenthood attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzpatrick wrote a March 9 letter to the House panel's
Republican chairman and the senior Democrat informing them that he
was asked by the subcommittee to authenticate 17 pages of
spreadsheets and other accounting reports.
</P>
<P>
   His letter recounted his question to Republican staff on the
House subcommittee whether the records ``were stolen from our
Planned Parenthood clinic in Overland Park, Kan. The majority staff
answer was in the affirmative.''
</P>
<P>
   Planned Parenthood found the originals of some of the documents
in its files, Fitzpatrick's letter said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican staff spokesman Steve Schmidt, however, denied Friday
that staff knew whether the documents were stolen.
</P>
<P>
   Crutcher's Web site says his group worked with the subcommittee
staff, which he criticized for ultimately mishandling the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We provided them with orders for baby parts, price lists for
baby parts, ...internal abortion industry financial records related
to the sale of baby parts... Then we spent hours and hours going
over each of these documents with them to make certain they
understood their significance.''
</P>
<P>
   Crutcher acknowledges having hired people to work undercover to
gather information about fetal tissue work at the clinic. One of
them, Lawrence Dean Alberty Jr. of Lee's Summit, testified at the
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Alberty, who once worked as a medical technician for the two
companies collecting the tissue, also admitted taking some records
from one of the firms. He is not the person to whom Harrah's
affidavit refers in the alleged January record pilfering.
</P>
<P>
   Miles Jones, a Lee's Summit pathologist who heads a fetal tissue
extraction company, last week wrote the Justice Department, asking
it to investigate Alberty and Life Dynamics for corporate
espionage. Jones, meanwhile, could be cited for contempt by the
House for failing to answer a subpoena to testify before the
subcommittee last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had other infiltrators in there besides Dean Alberty,''
Crutcher said Thursday. ``We got copies just like we did with
Dean.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrah said he went to work for Life Dynamics on Dec. 28 to
explain how abortion clinics operate and market its anti-abortion
materials. Crutcher offered no details about Harrah's departure
from the group last month, other than he was fired.
</P>
<P>
   Harrah, who now lives in New York, said he approached Planned
Parenthood with his allegation of stolen records because of his
concern for the patients. He contacted Evans, senior director of
public policy litigation and law at Planned Parenthood Federation
of America in New York.
</P>
<P>
   At a Feb. 14 meeting, he said, Evans prepared a 17-paragraph
affidavit based on their conversation. Harrah signed it and had it
notarized in New York on March 7. Harrah provided a copy of the
affidavit to The Kansas City Star.
