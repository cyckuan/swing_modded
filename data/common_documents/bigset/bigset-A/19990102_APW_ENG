<P>
	While the West greeted generally sunny skies today, a huge  
winter storm pounded across the eastern half of the country, with 
more that a foot of snow expected in the upper Midwest and freezing 
rain throughout the Ohio River Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	The heaviest snow was forecast for central Missouri to the  
southern Great Lakes. High winds should cause severe blowing and 
drifting, making driving extremely hazardous. 
</P>
<P>
	Highway officials in the region warned motorists to stay off  
roads, and some airlines said cancellations and delays were likely. 
</P>
<P>
	A large area of freezing rain and sleet should strike from  
southeastern Missouri along the Ohio River and into the southern 
Appalachians. Up to an inch of ice could threaten power lines in 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
	South of the ice belt, rain and thunderstorms were likely across  
the Tennessee Valley and the Southeast, with severe thunderstorms 
possible along the Gulf Coast. Some of the storms could produce 
straight-line winds of 70 mph, large hail and isolated tornadoes. 
</P>
<P>
	Clouds and snow should increase in the Northeast as the system  
approaches. Forecasters predicted sleet and freezing rain for some 
areas tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	The western half of the nation, from the northern Plains to the  
West Coast, should have dry conditions with sunny to partly sunny 
skies. 
</P>
<P>
	The highest temperature in the continental United States on  
Friday was 82 degrees in Daggett, Calif. The low was minus-36 at 
International Falls, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
	Highs today were forecast to reach the single digits in the  
northern Plains; the teens and 20s in the northern Rockies and the 
Great Lakes; the 20s and 30s in the Northwest, the Ohio Valley and 
the Carolinas; 40s and 50s in the Tennessee Valley; the 50s and 60s 
in the Southwest and along the Gulf Coast; and the 70s in Florida 
and southern California.

<HEADLINE> Penn St.'s Short To Stay in School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Penn State linebacker Brandon Short had  
plenty of reasons to leave for the NFL -- a 3-year-old daughter, his 
injured grandmother, his brother. 
</P>
<P>
	Short could help all of them with a pro paycheck.  
</P>
<P>
	In the end, different reasons are motivating him to return to  
school -- himself, and his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Initially, when this whole thing started, I thought this was  
going to be the most difficult decision I ever had to make in my 
life,'' Short said in announcing his decision Saturday, a day after 
the Nittany Lions' 26-14 victory over Kentucky in the Outback Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I was choosing between my family, everybody who was  
in financial need, and the school and team that I love. When I took 
a closer look, it wasn't that hard a decision at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Short said he's reached two of his goals -- he'll graduate in May  
and he's positioned himself for the pros -- but this month he 
remembered his other dreams: being an All-American, leading a team 
to a national title, and leaving his name in the Penn State history 
books as one of the greats. 
</P>
<P>
	Since almost all of the players on the two-deep chart are  
returning for 1999, Short feels he can help this team win a 
national title in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I was sitting there watching them playing for a national  
championship and I was playing for the Bills or whatever, I don't 
know if I could rest,'' Short said, ``knowing that I had the 
opportunity to achieve everything that I dreamed of, and I passed 
on it because I was scared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for his family, he said, ``we haven't had very much money all  
my life. One more year of not having anything is not that big a 
deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Short's 3-year-old daughter lives in the same project where he  
grew up, his grandmother is recovering from a hospital stay, and 
his brother in legal trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	He took out an insurance policy, and hopes that his 1999 season  
will put him in a position for a first-round pick that will earn 
him a better NFL contract. 
</P>
<P>
	According to information the Penn State staff gleaned from  
people in the NFL, Short may have been picked late in the first 
round, but he also could have slipped as far as the third round. 
</P>
<P>
	``He could do a lot of things to make himself a better player, a  
better prospect in a year,'' said defensive coordinator Jerry 
Sandusky. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most people felt that he'd be better off coming back,'' coach  
Joe Paterno said. ``But you know, every case is a little different. 
He's assumed a lot of responsibility for a young guy that most 
young people do not have. Obviously, from a selfish standpoint, I'm 
delighted he's coming back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Short will graduate in the fall and plans to enroll in a  
graduate program in logistics. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-3, 246-pound linebacker led Penn State this season  
with 85 tackles, including 15 tackles for losses. He had eight 
tackles in the Outback Bowl.

<HEADLINE> Gun Deaths Still High Among Youths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's murder rate fell in 1997 to a  
level last seen 30 years ago, but young Americans with firearms 
still are killing each other at a relatively high rate, the Justice 
Department reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's murder rate was 6.8 per 100,000 people, or 18,209  
murders, about the same as rates during the late 1960s and the 
lowest since 6.2 per 100,000 in 1967. The 1997 rate was down from 
highs of 10.2 per 100,000 in 1980 and 9.8 in 1991. In 1950 the rate 
was 4.6 per 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our cities are now the safest they have been in a  
generation,'' the White House said in a written statement. ``A 
variety of studies show that crime, and especially homicide, should 
continue to decline into the next year, and that is good news for 
Americans in 1999.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration attributed the declines to a 1994  
crime law strong supported by the president. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department's statistical arm, the Bureau of Justice  
Statistics, released its analysis of FBI crime data for 1997 
showing that while city dwellers remained more likely to be murder 
victims, much of the decline in the murder rate was posted in the 
nation's largest cities. In cities with populations above 1 
million, the murder rate fell from 35.5 per 100,000 in 1991 to 20.3 
per 100,000 in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The sharp increase in killings in the late 1980s and much of the  
subsequent decline are attributable to a rise and fall in gun 
violence involving young people, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, while firearm killings by 25-year-olds and older  
plummeted by roughly half to about 5,000 between 1980 and 1997, gun 
killings by young people 18 to 24 increased from about 5,000 in 
1980 to more than 7,500 in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Other findings:  
</P>
<P>
	--Americans 18-24 were the most likely murder victims in 1997,  
with a rate of 33.2 per 100,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	--Murder rates generally were higher than the average in the  
South and on the West Coast and lower in New England and the Rocky 
Mountain states. 
</P>
<P>
	--Men are most likely to be the killers and the victims. Men were  
more than nine times more likely than women to commit murder, and 
both men and women killers are more likely to target male victims. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Vols' Martin Knows Real Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- His Tennessee teammates and their opponents  
from Florida State, on the cusp of fulfilling boyhood dreams, exude 
a blend of excitement and anxiety while counting the hours to their 
national championship showdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback Tee Martin, who will be in the spotlight during  
Monday night's Fiesta Bowl, is calm -- as always. He knows all about 
adversity, and realizes no football game can approach the pressure 
of life's everyday challenges. 
</P>
<P>
	Having survived a childhood in which he changed addresses 22  
times and in which he saw a dozen friends killed by violence or 
disease, Martin goes through life -- and football games -- with a 
cool detachment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Football is only a sport to me,'' he said. ``If something's  
not really life threatening, I really don't care. I'm calm about 
things, I let them go,'' he said. ``I have a total understanding of 
life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin performs with intensity on the field, but he's not about  
to berate a teammate for dropping a pass or missing a block. And 
don't expect sideline confrontations between Martin and a coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't recall ever losing my temper,'' he said. ``I had a  
fight in seventh or eighth grade. Someone was picking on me, and he 
had to pick on me a lot to get me to fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Volunteers linebacker Al Wilson said he has never talked with  
Martin about growing up, but it's easy to tell exactly what he went 
through. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can tell by each guy's personality what his childhood was  
like,'' Wilson said. ``I've never seen Tee Martin nervous, and I 
think that's one of his biggest attributes. He's always relaxed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His mother was a high school senior when Tamaurice Nigel Martin  
was born. As she moved around in search of a better life, the 
youngster often stayed with his great-grandmother or grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a childhood punctuated by trauma. When he was a high  
school senior, he heard a noise and discovered a friend had been 
shot to death in a case of mistaken identity. Such tragedies kept 
him from developing close friendships. 
</P>
<P>
	``I kind of have an even-keel attitude when it comes to friends.  
You go to class one day and the next day they're not there,'' he 
said. ``It's something I had to struggle with at first, but I have 
a total understanding of who I am and what I have to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He had to draw on every ounce of that understanding, and plenty  
of patience, while throwing just 16 passes during his first two 
seasons at Tennessee as the backup to Peyton Manning. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, the junior has led the top-ranked Vols to a 12-0  
record while throwing for 2,164 yards and 19 touchdowns. He also 
has run for 287 yards and another seven scores. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin has thrown just two interceptions in his last 179  
attempts, and set an NCAA record by completing 24 consecutive 
passes in a two-game span against Alabama and South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	An aspiring writer who dabbles in poetry and keeps a nightly  
journal, Martin credits different family members with teaching him 
about life. 
</P>
<P>
	He learned understanding and trust from the three generations of  
women that raised him. An uncle who is an engineer emphasized 
academics. And his mostly absentee father, a former wide receiver 
at Mississippi Valley State, ``really was the guy that put the 
competitive spirit in my heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And there were plenty of other lessons to be learned on the  
streets of Mobile, Ala., lessons that have helped him keep football 
in perspective. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just don't get butterflies,'' he said. ``I'm just ready to  
play on game day. I know how to adjust my attitude before a game.''

<HEADLINE> 2000 Festivities Get Underway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Now comes the real celebrating. For Christian  
pilgrims, civic boosters and seasoned revelers everywhere, the 
millennium is shaping up to be the longest party in history. 
</P>
<P>
	Festivities in many countries are starting early and going on  
late -- right through to 2001 -- when purists mark the millennium, 
2,000 years after Year One. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Vatican, the Roman Catholic church will lead spiritual  
celebrations to mark 2000. Britain, home of Greenwich Mean Time and 
the world's prime meridian, plans a lavish celebration at the 
Millennium Dome, a futuristic exhibition hall being built over 20 
acres in Greenwich. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitt Island, in New Zealand's remote Chatham Islands, claims it  
will be the first spot of land to see the sun rise on the new 
millennium -- at 4:04 a.m. Jan. 1, 2000 (11:04 a.m. EST Dec. 31, 
1999). Just a shade west, Gisborne, New Zealand, is promoting 
itself as the first city on Earth to catch the first rays of the 
new year. 
</P>
<P>
	The turn of the century is expected to bring as many as 20  
million people to Rome. The Vatican, sensitive to the press of so 
many visitors, has scheduled major pilgrimages throughout the year 
to spread out the crowds. One such event is likely to be in August 
for World Youth Day. 
</P>
<P>
	After a visit to the United States and Mexico this month, and  
barring a possible trip to the Holy Land, Pope John Paul II will 
stick close to home in 2000. He will be giving daily blessings to 
pilgrims flocking to Rome to mark the start of Christianity's third 
millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain's Millennium Commission is organizing the largest  
celebratory construction, a $1.2 billion Millennium Dome and 
exhibition just across the River Thames from the Royal Observatory 
at Greenwich. 
</P>
<P>
	The dome, hailed as visionary by supporters and as a vapid waste  
of money by critics, has a circumference of two-thirds of a mile 
and is 165 feet high. Under the Teflon-coated glass fiber roof will 
be exhibits looking ahead to life in the next 1,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Millennium Commission, largely financed by lottery proceeds,  
also plans to turn London's bridges into stages for party venues on 
the eve of Jan. 1, 2000. Among other things, it has supported 187 
building projects throughout Britain, and it plans to bathe 400 
churches in the glow of floodlights and have chimes ring out from 
100 new sets of church bells. 
</P>
<P>
	Berlin, Germany's new capital, is planning an open-air party  
around the Brandenburg Gate, including a historical theater revue 
with thousands of actors portraying ``important historical 
moments'' on 200 stages. 
</P>
<P>
	The focal point of millennium celebrations in France will be  
Paris' main boulevard, the Champs-Elysees. Trees and gardens also 
are to be planted along the Meridian line dividing the nation in a 
symbolic attempt to show man must live together with the 
environment. And three cities -- Paris, Lyon and Avignon -- will have 
exhibitions on French history, language and beauty. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States is planning a series of events to honor its  
past and imagine the future, including arts projects, education 
campaigns and new goals for numerous national projects -- from 
connecting every classroom and library in America to the Internet 
to preserving treasured documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Other events include special evenings at the White House  
featuring prominent creators and visionaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia and China have no big plans yet. A Russian government  
committee meeting this month will decide on events to mark the 
2,000th anniversary of Christianity. In China, a countdown clock in 
Beijing's Tiananmen Square isn't keyed on the millennium, instead 
it's ticking away time until the Dec. 20, 1999, handover, of the 
Portuguese colony of Macau. 
</P>
<P>
	In Japan, which counts years by the length of an emperor's  
reign, 2000 will be Heisei 12, the 12th year of the reign of 
Akihito -- and few celebrations of the Western millennium are 
planned. 
</P>
<P>
	Israeli religious authorities already have warned against  
celebrations because New Year's Eve at the turn of the millennium 
falls on a Friday night, the Jewish sabbath. 
</P>
<P>
	There has been longstanding tension between hotels and religious  
authorities in Israel over celebrations of the Christian New Year. 
The rabbinate traditionally threatens to withdraw kosher 
certification from hotels that throw New Year's parties. 
</P>
<P>
	In Egypt, French musician Jean-Michael Jarre has been hired to  
compose a new opera to be performed at the pyramids starting at 
sunset Dec. 31, 1999, and lasting until sunrise the following day. 
Egypt also plans to affix a gold-encased capstone on the Great 
Pyramid, making it whole again, if only for the night.

<HEADLINE> Ryan, Brett Await Cooperstown Call </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	On the final day of the 1993 season, before the final game of  
their major league careers, Nolan Ryan and George Brett met at home 
plate to exchange lineup cards and handshakes. 
</P>
<P>
	That afternoon in Texas, the talk already was about their  
futures. As in, it sure would be nice to see baseball's career 
strikeout leader and one of its greatest hitters replay that scene 
at the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd love it if it worked out that way,'' Ryan said at the  
time. ``I don't think there's any doubt George is going to be 
inducted and I hope it works out that way for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No need to worry, Nolan. The call from Cooperstown is certainly  
coming Tuesday when results from one of the most eagerly 
anticipated elections in Hall history are announced. 
</P>
<P>
	In a ballot studded with standout rookie candidates, Ryan and  
Brett figure to be shoo-ins. Robin Yount might also make it, with 
Carlton Fisk and Dale Murphy expected to do well in the voting. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the list of holdover hopefuls is outstanding, led by Tony  
Perez, Jim Rice, Tommy John, Gary Carter and Bruce Sutter. 
</P>
<P>
	Not since the initial election in 1936, when Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb,  
Walter Johnson, Honus Wagner and Christy Mathewson were chosen, 
have three first-timers been picked. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the last time 10-year members of the Baseball Writers'  
Association of America voted in three players at all was 1991 -- Rod 
Carew, Ferguson Jenkins and Gaylord Perry. 
</P>
<P>
	And the last time the BBWAA took four new members was 1955 -- Joe  
DiMaggio, Gabby Hartnett, Dazzy Vance and Ted Lyons. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the BBWAA has been rather stingy in recent elections.  
Its members have selected a total of only five players in the past 
six years, with Don Sutton making it last January. 
</P>
<P>
	That's likely to change as Ryan and Brett should zoom past the  
75 percent required for election and increase the current Hall 
membership of 237. 
</P>
<P>
	Induction ceremonies are set for July 25, with an appropriate  
Hall of Fame exhibition game the following day -- Ryan's Texas 
Rangers vs. Brett's Kansas City Royals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Veterans Committee will meet March 2 in Tampa, Fla., and can  
choose up to four more new members. Bill Mazeroski, Dick Williams 
and Gil Hodges will be among the candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan and Brett already are well-represented at Cooperstown.  
Brett's pine-tar bat is on display at the shrine, as are balls and 
caps from each of Ryan's record seven no-hitters -- by late July, 
their plaques likely will be hanging in the Hall, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan struck out 5,714 in a 27-year career that began after he  
signed with the New York Mets in 1965. He went 324-292 for the 
Mets, California, Houston and Texas, tying him with Sutton for 12th 
in victories. 
</P>
<P>
	When Ryan threw his final pitch at age 46 -- he was forced to  
leave after tearing a ligament in his right elbow in a game two 
weeks before that farewell meeting with Brett -- he held or shared 
more than 50 major league records. 
</P>
<P>
	Up until the final few years of his career, Ryan had his  
critics. They claimed he was too wild (2,795 walks in 5,387 
innings), never won a Cy Young Award and did not win enough -- but 
he finished with a .526 winning percentage, compared to the .503 
mark of his teams. 
</P>
<P>
	By the way, Ryan will wear a Texas Rangers cap on his plaque.  
</P>
<P>
	Brett, a 13-time All-Star, ranks 13th on the career hits list  
with 3,154. The third baseman hit .305 in a 21-year career spent 
entirely with the Royals, and was a .337 lifetime hitter in the 
postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Yount, a three-time All-Star, had 3,142 hits in 20 seasons, all  
with Milwaukee. He won AL MVP awards at shortstop and center field. 
His .285 average, however, may hold him back this time. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett (317 HRs, 1,595 RBIs) and Yount (251 HRs, 1,406 RBIs) both  
got their 3,000th hits in September 1992, plus they share this rare 
distinction: They both are their franchise leader in home runs, 
triples, doubles and singles. In the modern era, only Willie Mays 
(Giants) and Stan Musial (Cardinals) can claim the same honor. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisk holds the AL record for catchers with 24 seasons and hit  
376 home runs. His most famous homer, and one of the most memorable 
ever, won Game 6 of the 1975 World Series at Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy was a two-time NL MVP with Atlanta and hit 398 home runs.  
He was a seven-time All-Star and won five straight Gold Gloves in 
center field. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez, on the ballot for the eighth time, came close to election  
last year when he was picked on 67.9 percent of the ballots. He had 
1,652 RBIs for the Big Red Machine -- every eligible player ahead of 
him is in the Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm proud of my RBIs, because a lot of them helped win games  
for us,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	John (288 wins), Bert Blyleven (287), Jim Kaat (283) and Sutter  
(300 saves) also appear on the 28-man ballot. So do Rice (.298, 382 
HRs, 1,451 RBIs), Carter (11 All-Star teams) and Dwight Evans (385 
HRs, eight Gold Gloves). 
</P>
<P>
	Mickey Lolich, 217-191 and MVP of the 1968 World Series, and  
Minnie Minoso, a .298 career hitter, are on the ballot for the 15th 
and final time.

<HEADLINE> Wilson Leaves Calif. a Mixed Legacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- As his tumultuous eight years as  
governor draw to a close Monday, Pete Wilson leaves a mixed legacy: 
economic and educational rebirth amid social conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson began with a reputation as a moderate Republican as mayor  
of San Diego and in the U.S. Senate. But he may be remembered most 
for the backlash against him by Hispanics who felt that Proposition 
187, his 1994 attempt to curtail state benefits for illegal 
immigrants, was racially motivated. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson has insisted he had fairness, not racism, on his mind  
when he backed Proposition 187. He also said he wanted to end 
racial discrimination -- not perpetuate it -- when he sponsored 
Proposition 209 in 1996 to abolish racial preferences in state 
jobs, contracts and college admissions. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hispanics, a growing political force in California, remain  
alienated by what Democratic Gov.-elect Gray Davis describes as 
Wilson's ``divisive eight-year era of wedge-issue politics.'' And 
overwhelming Democratic victories this past year in California are 
a result. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been an unceasing effort to sell Latino voters a  
false image,'' Wilson said in an interview. ``It is not only unfair 
to me and Republicans, it is grossly unfair to them, because they 
have been ... deceived and misled, persuaded that they are 
surrounded by racists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the 65-year-old Wilson, who briefly sought the Republican  
nomination for president in 1996 and hopes to run again in 2000, 
can't escape all responsibility for that impression. 
</P>
<P>
	In the battle to repeal state preferences, Wilson relished going  
toe-to-toe in the national media against civil rights leader Jesse 
Jackson. And the most lasting image of his political career is a 
grainy black-and-white television commercial in 1994 showing 
illegal immigrants running frantically through a border crossing 
while an announcer warns, ``They keep coming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under Wilson, however, the state regained 800,000 jobs it lost  
in the recession, plus 900,000 more. Today, California's economy is 
stronger, more diverse and thriving despite turmoil in its biggest 
export markets in the Far East. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson also reformed a fraud-plagued workers' compensation  
system to both increase employee benefits and reduce premiums, 
making California companies more competitive with business in other 
states and nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Economic recovery brought higher state tax revenues, which  
Wilson directed into targeted tax cuts to encourage more business 
development and improve the schools. 
</P>
<P>
	He reduced class sizes by one-third for more than 1 million  
children in early elementary grades, increased spending per pupil 
by 32 percent and supported a successful $9.2 billion education 
bond in 1998 -- the largest in the history of any state. 
</P>
<P>
	And no other California governor faced as many serious crises.  
The state was in the grip of its most severe drought in a 
generation when he took the oath of office in 1991. The state also 
suffered billions of dollars in damage from drought, floods, 
mudslides, an earthquake, devastating fires and other natural 
disasters during his term. 
</P>
<P>
	Other crises were manmade: the national recession, exacerbated  
in California by post-Cold War military base closures and cutbacks 
in defense contracts. Wilson faced deficits of $14 billion in his 
first budget and $10 billion in his second. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark DiCamillo, director of the Field Poll, notes that since  
Proposition 187, the Republican share of new registrations among 
California Hispanics has been cut by more than one-third. However, 
he said, Wilson's overall record resonates positively with voters 
as his governorship ends. 
</P>
<P>
	``More people are giving him an excellent or good  
job-performance rating,'' DiCamillo said. ``He is getting some 
credit for the robust nature of the economy and the general 
perception that California is on the right track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson was often overshadowed by Willie Brown, the flamboyant  
Democratic leader of the Legislature during much of his tenure. He 
was also attacked by his own party in 1991 when he raised taxes by 
$7 billion, cut programs by $5 billion and rolled over about $2 
billion in bills to future years. An effigy of Wilson was tarred 
and feathered at a Republican State Convention. 
</P>
<P>
	From that point on, Wilson lined up with the most conservative  
wing of his party on most issues. They parted company only on 
abortion -- he never wavered from his pro-choice views. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson won re-election by a landslide in 1994. But criticism of  
his backing of Proposition 187 persists today. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, it's a sad thing, because I think Pete could have been  
really a terrific, progressive governor. I think we could have done 
a lot of good things,'' says Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, 
a liberal Democrat who has known Wilson since the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think, unfortunately, he will be remembered only for 187 and  
209.''

<HEADLINE> Buckeyes State Case for No. 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- The last time Ohio State beat Michigan and a  
New Year's Day bowl opponent in the same season, the Buckeyes won 
the 1968 national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	In the wake of a 24-14 victory over Texas A&AMP;M in the Sugar Bowl  
on Friday night, there will likely be no national championship. But 
that doesn't mean this victory was any less rewarding. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was not a perfect season, but there's no question it's a  
good, solid season,'' John Cooper said after winning for the third 
time in his 10 bowl games as Ohio State's coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we're going to be any worse than No. 2 in the  
country. And depending on what happens Monday night, we might make 
a strong argument that we're as good as anybody,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Third-ranked Ohio State's slim hopes of winding up with the  
national title were based on winning big over Texas A&AMP;M and then 
watching No. 2 Florida State edge top-ranked Tennessee on Monday 
night in a sloppy Fiesta Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buckeyes (11-1) rocked the Aggies with a 21-7 first quarter,  
but came up short of winning in a landslide when A&AMP;M's defense shut 
out the Buckeyes in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't play a perfect game,'' said wide receiver David  
Boston, who was the game's MVP after catching 11 passes for 105 
yards. ``You're going to make mistakes. You just have to go out 
there and play over your mistakes and learn from them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first time it touched the ball, A&AMP;M startled the Buckeyes.  
Tailback Dante Hall slashed for 34 yards on two carries in a 
59-yard march, including the 9-yard touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ohio State countered with three touchdowns in a span of  
6:35. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Germaine, who completed 21-of-38 passes for 222 yards,  
rifled an 18-yard scoring pass to wide receiver Reggie Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	On the next series, Michael Wiley rushed for 20 yards on the  
first two plays, Germaine hit Boston for 11 yards on two 
completions and then backup tailback Joe Montgomery ran for 29 
yards and scored on a 10-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
	A&AMP;M was forced to punt on its next possession, and Derek Ross  
streaked in around left end and blocked Shane Lechler's kick. The 
ball sat on the A&AMP;M 16 for a tantalizing second before Ohio State 
special teams captain Kevin Griffin scooped it up and ran into the 
end zone. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what hurt us -- too many bad things in the first  
quarter. And it was too much to overcome,'' A&AMP;M safety Rich Coady 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Aggies got as close as 24-14 midway through the third  
quarter on Branndon Stewart's 7-yard scoring pass to Leroy Hodge, 
but then Ohio State's defense took over. On A&AMP;M's final four 
possessions, the Buckeyes forced three punts and linebacker Jerry 
Rudzinski tipped a lateral and recovered it to stop another drive. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buckeyes hadn't beaten Michigan and a bowl opponent since  
1982 and hadn't beaten their biggest rival and won on New Year's 
Day since Rex Kern, John Brockington and Jack Tatum roamed the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State, which gave the Big Ten a 5-0 bowl record for the  
first time ever, was left to plead its case for No. 1 instead of 
proving it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're the best team in the country, but unfortunately  
it's not in our hands right now,'' Germany said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the whole country knows that we earned our way to be  
No. 1,'' Montgomery said. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum, whose team opened the season by  
falling short against Florida State 23-14, said it was difficult to 
eliminate Ohio State from the championship mix. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see a significant amount of difference in Ohio State  
and Florida State,'' Slocum said. ``Ohio State is certainly as good 
as any team we've played this year.''

<HEADLINE> Jags' Rookie RBs Seek Playoff Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- The Jacksonville Jaguars can watch all  
the film they want. Or they can listen to Fred Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
	Because Taylor has seen it in person. He's seen Robert Edwards  
turn Alltel Stadium into his own little playground, making Taylor 
and his entire team look bad. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL's top two rookie running backs meet Sunday when Edwards  
and the Patriots (9-7) visit to face Taylor and the Jaguars (11-5) 
in a wild-card playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
	``His speed is deceptive until you get beside him,'' Taylor  
said. ``That's when you'll know he's fast. And until you try to 
tackle him, that's when you'll know how much power he has.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor saw it all in November 1997 when they were both college  
seniors -- Taylor at Florida and Edwards at Georgia. Edwards ran for 
124 yards and four touchdowns for a 37-17 victory in one of college 
football's best rivalries, played annually in Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was great, I didn't do squat,'' Taylor said.  
</P>
<P>
	Both players have tried to put that game behind them, but  
there's no doubt the history -- as well as the future -- will be on 
their minds when they meet again. 
</P>
<P>
	Both are coming off successful rookie seasons. Taylor finished  
with 1,223 yards rushing and Edwards had 1,115, both proving more 
than worthy of the first-round picks their teams spent. 
</P>
<P>
	But only one will be able to say his rookie year included a  
playoff victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had a lot of people say it's going to be me versus Robert  
Edwards, but it's not,'' said Taylor. ``I mean, if he does 
something spectacular, of course, I want to do something 
spectacular to make the crowd go crazy. But it's not going to get 
into a little grudge match between me and him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Edwards has thrived on bouncing off the pile and spinning  
out of tackles, Taylor has done it with a mix of power and speed 
not everyone recognized on draft day when the Jaguars took him with 
the ninth choice. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards, selected 18th, is one of Taylor's biggest fans and says  
Taylor has a few things he wishes he had. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's 10 pounds heavier than I am, he has quicker feet, much  
quicker,'' Edwards said. ``He's more of a slasher, he has good 
shoulder fakes and great quickness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both backs know there will be even more pressure on them in this  
game, with New England quarterback Drew Bledsoe out because of a 
broken finger and Jacksonville's Mark Brunell expected to play on 
an injured ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the kind of role Edwards might have expected, coming to  
New England after Curtis Martin left for the New York Jets. Taylor, 
on the other hand, was simply looking to blend in. That is, until 
James Stewart was injured in the season's third game. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus started a true rookie rushing race, with Taylor coming out  
on top. It was a result that surprised him and many around the NFL, 
who noticed him on the bench to begin the season and wondered if 
the Jaguars had made a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	``My whole thing was, I was going to try to take it slow, learn  
the system so I wouldn't hesitate and not make mistakes if I got 
the chance,'' Taylor said. ``I had no idea they were going to throw 
me into the fire. When they did, luckily I knew everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards overcame injuries that nagged at him in college and was  
thrust into a big role early. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he didn't record his first 100-yard game until Week 5. He  
had another the following week, but followed with a slump, failing 
to surpass 70 yards for seven straight weeks. A 196-yard 
performance against St. Louis Dec. 13 put him back in range of 
Taylor, and the 1,000-yard mark. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Taylor, Edwards said the humbling moments have been as  
meaningful to him as the successful ones this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have both realized that this is the NFL,'' Edwards said,  
``and we weren't going to have great games every week like we did 
in college.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But both backs know the time for growing pains is over. The  
playoffs have arrived and only one will continue along the winding 
road of a successful rookie season.

<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- On the first shopping day of the new year  
Saturday, Mexicans lamented the lifting of decades-long price 
controls on their most basic food item: the tortilla. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the cornerstone of the Mexican diet, the food of our  
ancestors. If we don't have tortillas, we'll die of hunger,'' said 
Mexico City resident Jaime Gaitan, as he ate one of the corn-flour 
disks at a street stand. 
</P>
<P>
	For decades, the government set an official retail price and  
then used subsidies to compensate producers for money they lost 
selling tortillas. On Jan. 1, price controls were officially 
lifted. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices were expected to rise to 20 cents per pound, but at some  
shops in Mexico City they remained at 15 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	Street vendors said they hadn't heard many complaints yet about  
the lifting of subsidies on the tortilla -- the last product under 
significant government price controls -- but were sure tempers would 
rise along with prices. 
</P>

<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- The Sao Paulo police killed more  
people in the first 11 months of 1998 than all of the previous 
year, according to a report by a civilian review board. 
</P>
<P>
	Between January and November, state police killed 417 people,  
compared with 407 in 1997, said the report written by Benedito 
Domingos Mariano, an ombudsman who reviews complaints against Sao 
Paulo police. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was released Saturday in the O Estado de Sao Paulo  
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	``While it's not a radical increase, it's worrisome,'' James  
Cavallaro, director of the Brazil office of Human Rights Watch, 
told The Associated Press. ``We hope it doesn't represent a return 
to the aberrant practices of the late 1980s and early 1990s.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In that period, Sao Paulo police were involved in nearly  
one-third of all state homicides, reaching a peak of 1,470 in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Those numbers have been decreasing because of fierce lobbying  
from human rights groups, international media attention and the 
creation of the review board. 
</P>
<P>
	Human rights activists have long complained the nation's police  
are encouraged to beat, torture and even execute criminal suspects.

	MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) -- Managua's public market was partially  
destroyed by fire Saturday, just days before Nicaraguans celebrate 
a traditional gift-giving holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say the timing of the fire -- in the early morning  
hours of Saturday -- was fortunate, given that no shoppers were 
present at the normally-crowded market and no serious injuries were 
reported in the three-hour blaze. Across Latin America, people 
celebrate ``Three Kings' Day'' on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Several firefighters were treated for smoke inhalation at the  
scene. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire, which the Managua fire department said was caused by a  
short-circuit, destroyed 34 shops in the market and damaged dozens 
of others.

where 38 such killings were carried out in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Jesus Duarte, 38, was killed by irate residents of San Carlos  
Malaga, about 70 miles southwest of Guatemala City, after he 
allegedly raped a young girl, National Civil Police in the nearby 
city of Mazetenango reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl reportedly identified Duarte as her attacker. The  
village does not have any policemen assigned to it. 
</P>
<P>
	The lynchings have occurred amid a widespread perception that  
Guatemala's criminal justice system in slow and inefficient.

<HEADLINE> Masterpiece Theatre offers Dickens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Just when you think Mobil Masterpiece Theatre  
has dramatized every major English novel, along comes Charles 
Dickens' last completed work, ``Our Mutual Friend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The novel was published in 1865, five years before his death (he  
left behind the unfinished ``The Mystery of Edwin Drood''), and it 
reflects the mature Dickens. The characters bear unmistakably 
Dickensian names -- Bella Wilfer, John Rokesmith, Nicodemus Boffin, 
Jesse Hexam, Fanny Cleaver and one-legged villain Silas Wegg. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our Mutual Friend'' displays how Dickens detested the work  
house, which his family suffered during his youth. But it also has 
a plot heavy with avarice and virtue. The Thames waterfront, and 
massive dust heaps of London refuse, provide a moody setting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I must confess it was a book that I didn't know at all before  
the writer Sandy Welch suggested adapting it,'' BBC producer 
Catherine Wearing said in an interview from London. ``She is 
certainly convinced it's the greatest novel by the greatest writer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Part of the reason for doing 'Our Mutual Friend' was the idea  
of bringing to a mass audience a book that they won't know. 
Therefore it has a kind of excitement about it, unlike 'Pride and 
Prejudice,' which had its own kind of excitement, but everybody 
knows what happens. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was an extraordinary sense when 'Our Mutual Friend' was  
broadcast in England that people were actually sitting on the edge 
of their seats, because they didn't know what was going to happen 
next. You don't usually get that with period drama.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Our Mutual Friend'' occupies six hours on PBS (9-11 p.m.)  
beginning Sunday, Jan. 3, and continuing Monday and Tuesday. The 
main actors -- Anna Friel, Keeley Hawes, Steven Mackintosh, Paul 
McGann -- are among Britain's busiest actors, although they are 
little known in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``David Copperfield,'' ``Great Expectations'' and ``A Tale of  
Two Cities'' have been made and remade in features and TV movies. A 
silent film of ``Our Mutual Friend'' appeared in 1921, and BBC 
produced a television version in 1974 in 12 half-hour episodes. 
</P>
<P>
	The neglect of dramatizations of the novel puzzles producer  
Wearing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the novel is the culmination of Dickens' last work,''  
she observed. ``He's incredibly free in the way he writes it, and 
he's at the pinnacle of his genius, really. He had been threatening 
to write the story for a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Is there a message for today's generation in the story?  
</P>
<P>
	``I think the message is that love is tough, love is hard work,  
and deeply unromantic in the end. What's extraordinary about 
Dickens is that he finds more artistic freedom in portraying people 
as they really are, not as you would like them to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duplicating Victorian England in the late 1990s presented a  
challenge to Miss Wearing and her production staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``The key landscapes,'' she said, ``were the river and the dust  
mountains, which are unexpected, fascinating and rather beautiful, 
from a cinematic point of view.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dealing with TV antennae, automobiles and paved streets made  
filming in London impractical. The Cardiff docks doubled for the 
Thames waterfront, and the dust heaps also were filmed in Wales. 
Amazingly, the six hours cost just $1 million each, which the 
producer says is the going price for period dramas in England. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Dickens would be proud of one result from the BBC  
screening of ``Our Mutual Friend'' in England, said Miss Wearing, 
with a laugh: The book is now on best-seller lists.

<HEADLINE> Florida QB Breaks Leg in Bowl Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Doug Johnson began the Orange Bowl well on his way  
to establishing himself once and for all as Florida's No. 1 
quarterback. He left on crutches, facing uncertainty this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson broke his leg just before halftime of the seventh-ranked  
Gators' 31-10 win Saturday night over No. 18 Syracuse, putting a 
damper on a dominating first half that included two touchdown 
passes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's frustrating. I was hot and ready to go,'' said Johnson,  
the last player to leave the Orange Bowl field after the final gun. 
``I'm disappointed that I got injured, but happy for this team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who had sparked the Gators to a 4-1 record since taking  
over as the starter at midseason, had his ankle bent underneath him 
with 4:18 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
	Marc Pilon hit Johnson after he threw an 18-yard pass to Nafis  
Karim at the Syracuse 7. 
</P>
<P>
	The junior immediately grabbed his ankle and grimaced as Florida  
trainers worked on him. The game was stopped for about five minutes 
until he was wheeled off on a cart. X-rays showed a broken fibula. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was scheduled to undergo surgery Monday, followed by 12  
weeks of rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, coach Steve Spurrier said a good performance  
would allow Johnson to establish himself as the No. 1 quarterback. 
The junior appeared well on his way to doing so, completing his 
first six passes for 139 yards and TD tosses of 51 and 26 yards to 
Travis Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson finished 12-for-17 for 195 yards, staking the Gators to  
a 14-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doug threw the ball beautifully for a while there,'' Spurrier  
said. ``He had some real nice throws on those touchdown balls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jesse Palmer, whose broken collarbone allowed Johnson to regain  
the starting job, came in and threw a 4-yard TD pass to Erron 
Kinney two plays later. Palmer later scored on a 2-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
	``It felt really, really good to go in and help contribute,''  
said Palmer, who hit 10 of 14 passes for 113 yards. ``The whole 
season's been an emotional roller-coaster. I'm glad to end on a 
high note.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson and Palmer began the year alternating plays before  
Palmer was given the job before the LSU game Oct. 10. Palmer was 
hurt in the first half of that game. 
</P>
<P>
	Now it appears the two will battle for the starting job again  
during spring practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been like a soap opera,'' Palmer said. ``We'll just go in  
next spring and see how it works.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The injury may also affect Johnson's baseball future.  
</P>
<P>
	A second-round pick of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays out of high  
school, he spent the summers of 1996 and '97 in the rookie leagues. 
He sat out last summer while recovering from rotator-cuff surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, a third baseman, once ranked as high as the Devil Rays'  
third-best prospect, according to Baseball America magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, he hit .231 with one home run and nine RBIs in 28 games  
at St. Petersburg of the Gulf Coast League. The next year, he hit 
only .201 with four homers and 19 RBIs in 34 games at Princeton 
(W.Va.) of the Appalachian League. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike some two-sport prospects, Johnson won't have to repay any  
of his $400,000 signing bonus if he does not report. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he would decide within the next month whether to play  
another season of minor league ball or spend the summer working on 
his football skills.

<HEADLINE> Report: Panthers, Seifert Near Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- George Seifert and the Carolina Panthers  
have made ``substantial progress'' in negotiations, and he could be 
named their new head coach early next week, according to a 
published report. 
</P>
<P>
	The Charlotte Observer reported Saturday that the former 49ers  
coach is close to an agreement with the Panthers. There appear to 
be no significant road blocks to a multiyear deal that would make 
Seifert one of the highest-paid coaches in the NFL, the newspaper 
said, citing sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Seifert confirmed Friday that he was a candidate, but he  
wouldn't discuss his negotiations with the Panthers. Seifert met 
Tuesday with Carolina owner Jerry Richardson in Charlotte, one day 
after Dom Capers was fired as head coach after four seasons. 
Seifert declined to say whether he had been offered the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't answer that one way or the other,'' Seifert said.  
``What I can say is there are conversations going on. I would 
imagine everyone involved has other options to consider.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Richardson nor his son Mark, the team president, could  
be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Seifert, who won two Super Bowls in eight seasons as San  
Francisco's, was making $1.4 million a year when he last coached in 
1996. Denver's Mike Shanahan and Bill Parcells of the New York Jets 
are the NFL's top-paid coaches, both earning nearly $2.4 million 
per year. 
</P>
<P>
	Carolina team officials decided to target Seifert instead of  
waiting to try to interview Green Bay coach Mike Holmgren after the 
Packers' season ends. 
</P>
<P>
	Seifert wants control over player personnel decisions, but isn't  
insisting on the title of coach-general manager, the Observer 
reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Panthers are working to put together a staff of offensive  
assistant coaches and have interviews scheduled for early next week 
with Tony Wise for the offensive line coaching position, and Bill 
Musgrave as quarterbacks coach. Wise was with Chicago last season 
and Musgrave, the Philadelphia Eagles' quarterbacks coach this 
season, served as a 49ers backup quarterback under Seifert from 
1991-94. 
</P>
<P>
	Three offensive assistants from former coach Capers' staff have  
been retained -- coordinator Gil Haskell, tight ends coach Don 
Breaux and wide receivers coach Richard Williamson.

<HEADLINE> Injuries Worry Jaguars, Patriots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- It's more than just Drew Bledsoe's  
broken finger and Mark Brunell's sprained ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	So much more, that it seems odd that the New England Patriots  
and Jacksonville Jaguars are each still around this time of year, 
getting ready for a wild-card playoff game Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In years to come, Jacksonville's first-ever home playoff game  
might be remembered more for the players who were too hurt to play 
than those who took the field. 
</P>
<P>
	The Patriots (9-7) have two of their best players, linebacker  
Ted Johnson and receiver Terry Glenn, on the injured reserve list. 
In early December, seven starters were out with injuries. The 
capper came this week when Bledsoe was pronounced out with a broken 
finger he sustained in a Nov. 23 game against Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jaguars (11-5) have 13 players, including five defensive  
linemen and opening-day tailback James Stewart, on injured reserve. 
Brunell has missed the past three-plus games with a high ankle 
sprain, although he's expected to return for the playoffs. If he 
can't go, rookie Jonathan Quinn will start again. 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly, both teams are becoming fed up with the injury  
discussion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody cares whether you're hurt, not hurt,'' Jaguars coach  
Tom Coughlin said. ``You just have to do the best you can with the 
people who are on your roster. I don't like the direction of the 
discussion in terms of this playoff game being between two teams 
with a number of injuries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Patriots cornerback Ty Law sounded a similar theme, one that has  
become painfully familiar to both teams this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``First and foremost, the guys like myself who are healthy and  
have been healthy have to take the game to another level,'' Law 
said. ``We're not exactly asking them to go in and catch 10 passes 
or throw for 300 yards. They just have to step in and try to help 
in this game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Zolak will get his third straight start at quarterback for  
the Patriots. Neither of his first two were overly impressive, but 
the surrounding cast looked so much better in a 24-21 victory over 
San Francisco two weeks ago than it did in a 31-10 loss to the New 
York Jets last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 49ers win was quite a team win and it shows you what they  
can do,'' Coughlin said. ``It was the essence of what happens in 
the situation both these teams are in. Sometimes under those 
circumstances, the true essence of `team' comes out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Patriots have a 3-0 advantage in this series, including a  
20-6 victory in the 1996 AFC championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe more crushing to Jacksonville might have been a 26-20  
defeat in December last season. It was a game the Jaguars were 
favored to win, one they needed to take a stranglehold on the AFC 
Central. They ended up going to the playoffs as a road wild-card 
team, in large part to that loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's hope they don't have our number,'' left tackle Tony  
Boselli said. ``Maybe it looks that way. They beat us three times, 
but all were games we could've won. They won and we can't do 
anything about it. We just need to play better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A victory would send the Jaguars to New York for a second-round  
game against the Jets. The Patriots, 8 1/2-point underdogs, would draw 
the Denver Broncos if they win. 
</P>
<P>
	Although it seems doubtful Bledsoe could return before next  
season, the Patriots are using the promise of improving health as a 
motivator for this game. 
</P>
<P>
	They know defensive end Willie McGinest will try to play with a  
nagging leg injury that kept him out of seven games this season. 
Linebacker Todd Collins is questionable with an injured pectoral 
muscle that should only improve with time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a one-game season and we're just looking forward to  
putting on a good performance,'' Law said. ``We know the longer we 
play, the healthier we'll get. If we keep going, we know our game 
will keep getting stronger.''

<HEADLINE> 1999 Computer Glitches Hit Sweden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- For a while, some taxi passengers got  
unexpectedly cheap rides and some motorists had trouble buying gas 
due to computer glitches that accompanied the new year in Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
	Stockholm's largest taxi service recently changed the way it  
calculates fares. But when 1998 became 1999, some of its computers 
didn't adjust properly and passengers were charged normal rates, 
instead of the higher holiday and late-hour fares. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem has been patched and now we'll get to the root of  
the problem,'' Taxi Stockholm managing director Anders Malmqvist 
said in a telephone interview Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Customers of Statoil, Norway's state oil company which operates  
about 600 gas stations in Sweden, couldn't use their credit cards 
Friday because pumps were programmed to accept them only through 
Dec. 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was nothing wrong in the data technology, but rather it  
was we who programmed badly,'' Statoil spokesman Henrik Siden told 
the regional newspaper Oestgoeta Correspondenten. 
</P>
<P>
	The day before, police at Stockholm's Arlanda international  
airport were temporarily unable to issue provisional travel 
documents to four travelers who had misplaced their passports, the 
Swedish news agency TT reported. 
</P>
<P>
	When they attempted to input the date, some computers would not  
accept ``99'' and transmitted in response: ``end of run'' or ``end 
of file.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The year 2000 is expected to bring more computer problems  
because many of the machines recognize each year by its last two 
digits rather than by all four. 
</P>
<P>
	Trouble could begin when computers try to add or subtract dates  
using that two-digit format after the arrival of the year 2000, or 
00. The larger, older mainframe computers still used by government 
and big corporations for many vital functions are particularly 
vulnerable.

 *Muslim girls relocated from Christian foster home    	
</P>
<P>
	LIVONIA, Mich. (AP) -- After more than three months in a  
Christian foster home, three Muslim Iraqi sisters now are in the 
care of a Detroit-area Muslim leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Arab-American religious and community leaders had criticized the  
girls' treatment by their original foster parents, alleging that 
they gave them Christian crosses to wear and took away their 
traditional hijabs, or head scarves. 
</P>
<P>
	The girls, ages 12, 14, and 16, were removed from their parents'  
home in August after state child welfare officials accused their 
parents of physically abusing them. 
</P>
<P>
	The girls now live with Imam Mohammad Ali Elahi, leader of the  
Islamic House of Wisdom in Dearborn Heights, and his wife and three 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	``We give them all the flexibility and freedom they want both  
inside and outside our home,'' Elahi told The Detroit News. ``We 
take care of them better than our own children -- honestly -- because 
we want them to realize they are in a safe and warm atmosphere. We 
want to make them happy and give them a sense of belonging.''

 *Widower, father of four, ordained as priest    	
</P>
<P>
	ST. CLOUD, Minn. (AP) -- Bernie Gruenes, who has four children,  
has become a father again. 
</P>
<P>
	Gruenes, 64, a retired banker and widower, was ordained Dec. 18  
as a Roman Catholic priest. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who know him say he'll do an excellent job.  
</P>
<P>
	``He brings a wealth of life experience with him,'' said the  
Rev. Robert Pierson, rector of the School of Theology at St. John's 
University, where Gruenes has been studying. 
</P>
<P>
	Gruenes has served as deacon at the Church of St. Michael for  
the past 3 1/2 years. Retired for two years, he has known for some 
time that he was destined for the priesthood. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole idea of service was attractive. I just felt there  
was such a need in the church for people to serve,'' said Gruenes, 
whose wife, Cathy, died in 1992. He also lost a son, Bob, in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talked to the bishop and he said, `Give us five good years.'  
</P>
<P>
	``There is a history of ordination for older men,'' said  
Gruenes, who took a vow of celibacy when he became a deacon. ``I 
think more and more widowers are considering it.''

 *Janitor leaves fortune to Ankeny Bible college    	
</P>
<P>
	ANKENY, Iowa (AP) -- Christian Thomsen lived a frugal life as a  
janitor before he died at age 101. 
</P>
<P>
	So many were stunned when he left behind $1.1 million to Faith  
Baptist Bible College and a ``substantial sum'' to his church in 
Ames. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're reaping the benefits of a man who dedicated his life to  
the Lord for 101 years,'' said Craig Hastings, Thomsen's friend and 
executor. ``But our enjoyment of him had nothing to do with his 
money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hastings, who would not disclose the sum left to Campus Baptist  
Church, called Thomsen a dedicated member of the congregation. 
Campus Baptist is among many churches that support the college -- 
that Thomsen never attended. 
</P>
<P>
	He was ``faithful to the Lord,'' he said, ``and on top of that  
he was a millionaire. We just couldn't believe it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomsen, who died Nov. 5, came to Des Moines from Denmark for  
training at a theological seminary; then, for a time, he returned 
to his native country. He never married, never owned a car. 
</P>
<P>
	He returned to Des Moines in 1927 and worked as a janitor for  
Northwestern Bell Telephone Co. well into his 80s. Then he retired 
and moved to Ames.

	CHICAGO (AP) -- Whiteout conditions and massive snow drifts hit  
the Midwest on Saturday, canceling hundreds of airline flights, 
forcing motorists off roads and keeping mail deliverers from their 
appointed rounds. By Saturday night, the storm had dumped 17 inches 
at Chicago's Midway Airport, 11 inches of snow had fallen on 
Coldwater, Mich., and 8 inches on Detroit Metropolitan Airport in 
Romulus. It was 13 inches deep in western Indiana's Parke County,

appears to admit he instigated the bombing of two U.S. embassies in 
Africa, Time magazine reports. The interview, conducted at bin 
Laden's secret Afghanistan encampment on Dec. 22, seems the closest 
the exiled Saudi billionaire has come to admitting a role in the 
deadly attacks. ``Our job is to instigate, and by the grace of God, 
we did that, and certain people responded to this instigation,'' 
bin Laden says in the Jan. 11 issue of Time magazine.

<HEADLINE> Author Claims Bomb Jury Indictment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TULSA, Okla. (AP) -- The author of a book exploring conspiracy  
theories surrounding the Oklahoma City bombing says he is the 
person named in a sealed indictment handed up last week by a grand 
jury. 
</P>
<P>
	David Hoffman said he was indicted for allegedly sending copies  
of his book, ``The Oklahoma City Bombing and The Politics of 
Terror,'' to jurors while the panel was meeting, the Tulsa World 
reported Saturday. Hoffman wouldn't say whether the allegation is 
true. 
</P>
<P>
	``For them to render a decision like this is absolutely  
ludicrous,'' Hoffman said. ``When they talk about jury tampering, 
who has had more influence -- me or the District Attorney's Office 
or the judge?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury's report, issued Wednesday, rejected several  
conspiracy theories that have persisted since the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	Attempts to reach Hoffman by The Associated Press on Saturday  
were unsuccessful. Federal prosecutors have said they will not 
comment on the sealed indictment until the person is arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman, who telephoned the Tulsa newspaper on Friday, said he  
is ``on the road'' and does not plan to surrender to authorities 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he is on a deferred sentence on a stalking charge and is  
concerned that the new indictment could result in a lengthy jail 
stay in Oklahoma County. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I can't work out some reasonable terms with the district  
attorney, I am not surrendering,'' the Oklahoma City resident said. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury complained of one or more people who ``took the  
outrageous step of anonymously contacting one or more of our 
members at their homes,'' and said it was offended by ``improper 
and perhaps illegal attempts to exert influence on the outcome of 
our investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman's book deals with conspiracy theories and allegations  
that the federal government had prior knowledge of the April 19, 
1995, bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building that killed 
168 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Grand jurors said that after hearing 117 witnesses and examining  
thousands of exhibits, ``we can state with assurance that we do not 
believe that the federal government had prior knowledge that this 
horrible terrorist attack was going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury called on District Attorney Bob Macy to carry  
through with his plans to bring state murder charges in the 
bombing. Macy has said he will charge Timothy McVeigh and Terry 
Nichols, who have been convicted on federal charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Former state Rep. Charles Key, who organized the petition drive  
that caused the grand jury to be seated, has said he is not 
satisfied with the results and plans to call for a congressional 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	In a copyrighted story in Saturday's editions, The Daily  
Oklahoman reported that U.S. Rep. James Traficant, D-Ohio, also 
intends to call for a congressional hearing on the bombing.

17 games with a sprained right knee ligament, returned to the 
Vancouver Canucks lineup against the Montreal Canadiens on Saturday 
night.

	Mogilny, a one-time 76-goal scorer, was second among Canucks  
point producers (four goals, 13 assists) when he was injured in a

<HEADLINE> Democrats Put Livestock on Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With pork prices hovering at the lowest in  
decades, and cattle prices also suffering, Senate Democrats hope to 
set in motion this week a process that will bring the ills of the 
nation's livestock industry to the top of Congress' agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., and Sen. Tom Harkin,  
D-Iowa, will co-chair Tuesday a Democratic Forum on the Crisis in 
the American Livestock Industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am hopeful that we can draw attention to this important  
issue, so that members of Congress understand just how deep these 
problems are in agriculture,'' Daschle said. ``We need to act now 
to help producers before it is too late. 
</P>
<P>
	The hearing comes as livestock farmers are taking serious hits  
at the marketplace, particularly hog producers, whose prices had 
dropped last week as low as $7 per hundredweight in some parts of 
the country. Cattle prices, which reached around $80 per 
hundredweight at the first of the year, have hovered in the $60-$70 
range in some parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are in the middle of one of the biggest crises we have ever  
seen in the livestock industry,'' Daschle said. ``Prices have 
literally collapsed, and producers are being devastated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle said he hopes the session, which will include farmers  
and economists, will help lawmakers find ways to return competition 
and profitability to the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	One question Congress will look at is ``What authority does USDA  
have, and are those authorities sufficient enough to assist?'' said 
Michael Dunn, the Agriculture Department's undersecretary for 
marketing and regulatory programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``How many different commodities are we going to go through on  
it? I think that is one of the things they're looking at,'' Dunn 
said. ``If it's pork today, is it going to be beef tomorrow?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Caroline Anderson, government relations director for the  
American Farm Bureau Federation, said nowhere is the livestock 
price crisis more devastating than among hog farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are basically marketing their hogs for a huge loss,''  
Anderson said. She said it costs about $36 per hundredweight to 
produce a hog -- far more than what farmers are getting at the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're talking thousands of dollars lost,'' Anderson said.  
``Even the small-scale hog farmers are losing thousands of dollars 
each week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has taken several steps in recent  
weeks to help pork producers. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has agreed to buy $65 million more of pork,  
bringing government pork purchases since March to $95 million. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman agreed as well  
to defer some loan repayments for hog farmers and formed a task 
force to look at ways to help pork producers. 
</P>
<P>
	Glickman also announced a temporary freeze on Agriculture  
Department lending for new pork production plants to prevent 
exacerbating the industry's oversupply problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle and Harkin said hog prices have lost 72 percent of their  
value this year, and producers are losing about $75 for each animal 
they market. 
</P>
<P>
	``When selling prices don't even come near the cost of  
production, small and medium-sized producers -- even the most 
efficient operators -- are being driven out of business,'' Daschle 
said. ``These low prices are devastating not only our producers but 
also entire rural communities whose economies are based on a strong 
farm economy.''

<HEADLINE> Paltrow Says Family Is Top Priority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Gwyneth Paltrow made her dream come true by  
becoming a movie star. Now her dreams are more mundane. 
</P>
<P>
	``Acting isn't everything to me,'' Paltrow says in the January  
issue of InStyle magazine. ``My family -- that always comes first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paltrow's life has always been elite. The daughter of actress  
Blythe Danner and producer Bruce Paltrow grew up in New York City, 
where she attended an exclusive private school. Once romantically 
linked with Brad Pitt, her boyfriend now is Academy Award-winner 
Ben Affleck. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, despite her privileged background and success in recent  
films like ``Sliding Doors,'' ``A Perfect Murder'' and 
``Shakespeare in Love,'' Paltrow wants more -- like more control 
over her life. 
</P>
<P>
	``You get to a point where you're thinking, Where do I want to  
live, what kind of life do I want?'' she said. ``One day I hope to 
have the power to determine my own destiny.''

impeachment saga in the Senate:

<P>
	``I am still committed to working with people of good faith and  
good will of both parties to do what's best for our country, to 
bring our nation together, to lift our people up, to move us all 
forward together. It's what I've tried to do for six years. It's 
what I intend to do for two more until the last hour of the last 
day of my term.'' -- President Clinton

</P>
<P>
	 *------

going to have to vet with our caucuses.'' -- Senate Minority Leader 
Tom Daschle, D-S.D.

<HEADLINE> Sugar Bowl Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Wayne Morgan, 55, of Stone Mountain, Ga.,  
picked up $100,000 at the Sugar Bowl without lifting a finger. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan, a bank manager, was part of the Nokia halftime show. He  
had the choice of trying to throw a football through a replica of a 
Nokia phone for $1 million or having former Dallas Cowboys 
quarterback Roger Staubach make it for $100,000. Morgan chose the 
Hall of Fame quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	Staubach has been out of the league for a while, but it only  
took a brief warmup for him to show his old style. 
</P>
<P>
	Staubach missed on the first pass, but was given another try and  
it sailed through the opening, scoring the big payday for Morgan. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BEEN THERE, DONE THAT:* Ohio State made its second straight  
appearance in the Sugar Bowl. Last year, the Buckeyes lost to 
Florida State 31-14. Their only other appearance was in 1978 when 
Bear Bryant and Alabama defeated Woody Hayes and the Buckeyes 35-6. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time A&AMP;M played in the Sugar Bowl was on Jan. 1, 1940.  
John Kimbrough's 159 yards rushing and two touchdowns led A&AMP;M to a 
14-13 victory over hometown favorite Tulane. That capped an 11-0 
season and gave the Aggies their first and only Associated Press 
national championship. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *CAREER BOWL RECORDS:* Texas A&AMP;M is now 12-12 in bowl games.  
Ohio State is 14-17. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach R.C. Slocum of Texas A&AMP;M is 2-6; Ohio State's John Cooper  
is 3-7 in bowls. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *OPPOSING STRENGTH:* Ohio State's schedule was ranked No. 42 in  
the nation and A&AMP;M's was ninth toughest. Five of the Buckeyes' 12 
opponents and seven of the Aggies' 13 earned bowl berths. Ohio 
State's opponents had a combined record of 60-52 and A&AMP;M's went 
79-51. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *LOUISIANA BLUES:* Louisiana has not been kind to native son  
R.C. Slocum. The Texas A&AMP;M coach has had some rough homecomings. 
</P>
<P>
	Slocum, a native of Oakdale, La., played college football at  
McNeese State in Lake Charles, La. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only did he lost the Sugar Bowl to Ohio State, Slocum's last  
trip to the Bayou State was more memorable for Southwestern 
Louisiana than for the Aggies. Southwestern stunned A&AMP;M in 1996 
with a 29-22 upset. The defeat ranks among the lowest moments in 
Slocum's 10-year career as the Aggies' coach. 
</P>
<P>
	It was such a big victory for Southwestern, which had never  
previously defeated a ranked team, that the school erected a 
permanent marker commemorating it at their football field. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>

	 *DAY LATE:* Next year's Sugar Bowl, which will decide the  
national championship, will be played on Jan. 4 rather than Jan. 3, 
bowl executive director Paul Hoolahan said Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The official announcement will be made later, but bowl officials  
said the change was made to avoid a conflict with the NFL schedule.

<HEADLINE> Ole Miss' French To Enter NFL Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- All-American tight end Rufus French said  
Saturday that he will bypass his senior season at Mississippi and 
be available for the NFL draft in April. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you come down to it, it is what I wanted to do,'' French  
said by phone as his home in Amory. ``You can't please everybody 
else. You have to please yourself. I had to be a little selfish and 
put myself in front this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	French said he decided on his move after coach Tommy Tuberville  
left for Auburn, although he said he had some second thoughts after 
former Tennessee offensive coordinator David Cutcliffe took over. 
</P>
<P>
	``After coach Tub had left, I was just frustrated and thought,  
`Yeah, I'm gone,'' French said. ``After I talked to coach Cut, it 
made it hard. I respect him as a coach. It made it harder just 
being around him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cutcliffe showed that French would be part of the game plan in  
his first game as coach, a 35-18 victory over Texas Tech in the 
Independence Bowl on New Year's Eve. French had four catches and 
the first rushing attempt of his college career, gaining nine 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rufus has made a decision that he feels is in his best  
interest,'' Cutcliffe said in a statement. ``We will continue to 
support Rufus and wish him well. We also will encourage him to 
return to school and pursue his degree.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Underclassmen have until Jan. 8 to declare eligibility for the  
NFL draft. French, a 6-foot-4, 250-pounder, is likely to be picked 
in the middle rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	French said he has signed with an agent, a move that eliminates  
any chance of him changing his mind and playing another season at 
Ole Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	French will end his college career with 84 receptions, 10 short  
of the Ole Miss school record for a tight end set by Jim Poole from 
1969-71. French had 35 catches for 386 yards and two touchdowns 
this season.

<HEADLINE> Thai Scientists To Clone Elephant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Scientists in Thailand have their  
sights on the ultimate white elephant: They want to clone one that 
belonged to a 19th century king. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists at Mahidol University in Bangkok said the project  
will take 10 years, although Thai scientists have yet to clone 
anything successfully, the Bangkok Post reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The scientists want to use genetic material from a white  
elephant owned by King Rama III, who ruled from 1824-51, because 
they believe it possessed the finest characteristics of a male 
adult elephant. 
</P>
<P>
	The remains of that elephant have been preserved.  
</P>
<P>
	White elephants have lighter-colored skin around their ears,  
eyes, trunks and sometimes other parts of their bodies. Prized for 
their rarity and the belief they bring good luck, all white 
elephants in Thailand are automatically the property of the royal 
family. 
</P>
<P>
	The scientists said they were inspired by reports that Japanese  
scientists were attempting to clone a mammoth, a prehistoric 
elephant-like mammal. 
</P>
<P>
	Elephants are a national symbol in Thailand, but their numbers  
are diminishing because of poaching and loss of habitat. Thailand 
has lost much of its forest cover, and many elephant handlers bring 
their beasts into cities to roam the streets and beg. 
</P>
<P>
	The scientists did not offer any insight into where a resurgent,  
cloned elephant population will live, since the forest cover is 
still being destroyed as development continues.

<HEADLINE> DuPont To Pay $10M in Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- DuPont Co. has agreed to pay $2.5 million apiece  
to each of the state's four law schools in an unusual deal to 
settle charges it withheld evidence during a civil case in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The case involved allegations that the Wilmington, Del.-based  
chemical giant withheld soil samples during a lawsuit brought by a 
group of nurseries, but a federal judge decided DuPont's penalty 
should make a statement about the importance of legal ethics. 
</P>
<P>
	The $11 million -- which includes $1 million to fund an annual  
symposium -- is so each law school can set up a professorial chair 
devoted to professional ethics. The schools are the University of 
Georgia, Emory University, Georgia State University and Mercer 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement was approved by U.S. District Court Judge Hugh  
Lawson in Columbus and announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The case began when DuPont was sued by a group of nurseries who  
alleged its fungicide ruined their crops. During the lawsuit, the 
nurseries accused DuPont of withholding soil samples. The suit was 
settled for $4.25 million during jury deliberations -- less than 1 
percent of what the plaintiffs originally asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the soil tests surfaced during another trial in Hawaii,  
said Columbus lawyer Neal Pope, who represented the original 
plaintiffs. U.S. District Judge J. Robert Elliott, who presided at 
the original trial, ruled that the company should pay $115 million, 
or $15 million if it ran a full page ad in the Wall Street Journal 
admitting it hid the evidence. DuPont had run a similar ad the day 
before denying the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The penalty was overturned on appeal, and the appeals court  
ordered a new judge be put over the case. Lawson had asked the U.S. 
attorney's office to look into potential criminal charges, but 
Thursday's settlement brings that investigation to an end. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we were not satisfied with this particular resolution, we  
would proceed (with the investigation),'' U.S. Attorney Beverly 
Martin said through a spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	DuPont attorney A. Stephens Clay said the company also is glad  
the case is finally over. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a constructive, creative resolution Judge Lawson has  
put together,'' Clay said. ``We're also glad all the charges have 
been dismissed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia State University spokesman Michael Baxter said the  
school has ``a very strong ethical component in our law school, so 
this will be a good fit.'' The other three schools could not be 
reached.

<HEADLINE> Gun Deaths Still High Among Youths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's murder rate fell in 1997 to a  
level last seen 30 years ago, but young Americans with firearms 
still are killing each other at a relatively high rate, the Justice 
Department reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's murder rate was 6.8 per 100,000 people, or 18,209  
murders, about the same as rates during the late 1960s and the 
lowest since 6.2 per 100,000 in 1967. The 1997 rate was down from 
highs of 10.2 per 100,000 in 1980 and 9.8 in 1991. In 1950 the rate 
was 4.6 per 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our cities are now the safest they have been in a  
generation,'' the White House said in a written statement. ``A 
variety of studies show that crime, and especially homicide, should 
continue to decline into the next year, and that is good news for 
Americans in 1999.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration attributed the declines to a 1994  
crime law strong supported by the president. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department's statistical arm, the Bureau of Justice  
Statistics, released its analysis of FBI crime data for 1997 
showing that while city dwellers remained more likely to be murder 
victims, much of the decline in the murder rate was posted in the 
nation's largest cities. In cities with populations above 1 
million, the murder rate fell from 35.5 per 100,000 in 1991 to 20.3 
per 100,000 in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The sharp increase in killings in the late 1980s and much of the  
subsequent decline are attributable to a rise and fall in gun 
violence involving young people, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, while firearm killings by 25-year-olds and older  
plummeted by roughly half to about 5,000 between 1980 and 1997, gun 
killings by young people 18 to 24 increased from about 5,000 in 
1980 to more than 7,500 in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Other findings:  
</P>
<P>
	--Americans 18-24 were the most likely murder victims in 1997,  
with a rate of 33.2 per 100,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	--Murder rates generally were higher than the average in the  
South and on the West Coast and lower in New England and the Rocky 
Mountain states. 
</P>
<P>
	--Men are most likely to be the killers and the victims. Men were  
more than nine times more likely than women to commit murder, and 
both men and women killers are more likely to target male victims.

<HEADLINE> Maryland Looks for Revenge Vs. Duke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) -- A year's time has not erased Terrell  
Stokes' tortured memory of Duke's last visit to Cole Field House. 
</P>
<P>
	Any hope No. 20 Maryland had of defeating the third-ranked Blue  
Devils last Jan. 3 dissipated in the opening minutes, when Duke 
made its first four 3-pointers and built a 61-39 halftime lead en 
route to a 104-72 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland's most lopsided home defeat in 29 seasons stunned a  
sellout crowd and gave the Terrapins something to ponder for 12 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember the loss very well. They came in and embarrassed us  
on our home court,'' said Stokes, the Terrapins' starting point 
guard. ``That one stands out the most. We try to protect our 
homecourt advantage, and they came in and kicked our butts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So when No. 2 Duke faces the fourth-ranked Terrapins Sunday,  
there will be more on the line for Maryland than merely moving up 
in the polls and establishing a pecking order in the Atlantic Coast 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've got the revenge factor and their crowd is going to be  
nuts,'' Duke guard Trajan Langdon said. ``I'm sure they've marked 
us on their calendar. We're expecting them to come in confident and 
ready for us, so it'll be a good test to see how mature we are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is the first time since 1976 that two top-four teams have  
played at Cole Field House. The 14,500-seat arena has been sold out 
for months in anticipation of the biggest college basketball game 
in Maryland in the past two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish I had 100 more tickets,'' Maryland coach Gary Williams  
said. ``It's great to be in this situation because it hasn't always 
been that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years ago, Maryland went 9-20 and lost 13 of 14 ACC games  
under coach Bob Wade. Williams then took on the task of rebuilding 
a program burdened by NCAA sanctions, and with five straight 
appearances in the NCAA tournament, the Terrapins can now consider 
themselves are among the nation's elite. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Maryland (13-1, 1-0) has matched the best start in  
school history and spent the entire season in the Top 5. The 
Terrapins have met every challenge but one, losing on the road to 
Kentucky last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year we were a good team. This year we may be a better  
team,'' Stokes said. 
</P>
<P>
	The addition of junior college transfer Steve Francis has been  
an asset. Francis leads Maryland in seven categories, including 
scoring average (16.9) and field goals made (87), despite trying to 
learn both backcourt positions. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that Maryland is about to get into the heart of its ACC  
schedule, Francis and his teammates are ready to take their game up 
a notch. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that you will see more not only from me, but also from  
my teammates -- especially the veteran guys who know what the ACC is 
and know what the Maryland-Duke game means,'' Francis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski has had his way against the Terrapins  
-- the Blue Devils have won 26 of the past 31 meetings -- but he 
knows this is probably the best Maryland team he has ever faced. 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski also is prepared for a hostile greeting from fans who  
have been waiting a year for revenge. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're playing as talented a starting five as there is in the  
country,'' he said. ``These type of games on the road simulate NCAA 
tournament play, so it will be a challenge to see how we respond to 
that kind of an environment.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Views van Gogh Exhibit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton got up early Saturday to  
catch the National Gallery of Art's popular Vincent van Gogh 
exhibit, which ends this weekend. The 72-painting collection, on 
loan from the Van Gogh Foundation in Amsterdam, is estimated to 
have drawn 450,000 visitors since it opened in early October. 
</P>
<P>
	As scores of tourists waited in the cold for tickets to the  
exhibit's 10 a.m. opening, the presidential motorcade entered the 
gallery through a side entrance. President Clinton saw the exhibit 
with his daughter, Chelsea, who returns to her sophomore year at 
Stanford University this weekend. The Clintons arrived at the 
National Gallery at 8:30 a.m. and stayed for about an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent days, lines to the van Gogh exhibit have stretched six  
blocks and started at 6 a.m. The National Gallery gives out 2,000 
free tickets each day; scalpers and agencies have recently sold 
tickets at up to $125 a piece. The van Gogh exhibit travels next to 
the Los Angeles County Art Museum, where it will go on display Jan. 
17.

	LONDON (AP) -- Now comes the real celebrating. For Christian  
pilgrims, civic boosters and seasoned revelers everywhere, the 
millennium is shaping up to be the longest party in history. 
</P>
<P>
	Festivities in many countries are starting early and going on  
late -- right through to 2001 -- when purists mark the millenium, 
2,000 years after Year One. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Vatican, the Roman Catholic church will lead spiritual  
celebrations to mark 2,000. Britain, home of Greenwich Mean Time 
and the world's prime meridian, plans a lavish celebration at the 
Millenium Dome, a futuristic exhibition hall being built over 20 
acres in Greenwich. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitt Island, in New Zealand's remote Chatham Islands, claims it  
will be the first spot of land to see the sun rise on the new 
millennium -- at 4:04 a.m. Jan. 1, 2000 (11:04 a.m. EST Dec. 31, 
1999). Just a shade west, Gisborne, New Zealand, is promoting 
itself as the first city on Earth to catch the first rays of the 
new year. 
</P>
<P>
	The turn of the century is expected to bring as many as 20  
million people to Rome. The Vatican, sensitive to the press of so 
many visitors, has scheduled major pilgrimages throughout the year 
to spread out the crowds. One such event is likely to be in August 
for World Youth Day. 
</P>
<P>
	After a visit to the United States and Mexico this month, and  
barring a possible trip to the Holy Land, Pope John Paul II will 
stick close to home in 2000. He will be giving daily blessings to 
pilgrims flocking to Rome to mark the start of Christianity's third 
millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain's Millennium Commission is organizing the largest  
celebratory construction, a $1.2 billion Millennium Dome and 
exhibition just across the River Thames from the Royal Observatory 
at Greenwich. 
</P>
<P>
	The dome, hailed as visionary by supporters and as a vapid waste  
of money by critics, has a circumference of two-thirds of a mile 
and is 165 feet high. Under the Teflon-coated glass fiber roof will 
be exhibits looking ahead to life in the next 1,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Millennium Commission, largely financed by lottery proceeds,  
also plans to turn London's bridges into stages for party venues on 
the eve of Jan. 1, 2000. Among other things, it has supported 187 
building projects throughout Britain, and it plans to bathe 400 
churches in the glow of floodlights and have chimes ring out from 
100 new sets of church bells. 
</P>
<P>
	Berlin, Germany's new capital, is planning an open-air party  
around the Brandenburg Gate, including a historical theater revue 
with thousands of actors portraying ``important historical 
moments'' on 200 stages. 
</P>
<P>
	The focal point of millenium celebrations in France will be  
Paris' main boulevard, the Champs-Elysees. Trees and gardens also 
are to be planted along the Meridian line dividing the nation in a 
symbolic attempt to show man must live together with the 
environment. And three cities -- Paris, Lyon and Avignon -- will host 
exhibitions on French history, language and beauty. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States is planning a series of events to honor its  
past and imagine the future, including arts projects, education 
campaigns and new goals for a host of national projects -- from 
connecting every classroom and library in America to the Internet 
to preserving treasured documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Other events include special evenings at the White House  
featuring prominent creators and visonaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia and China have no big plans yet. A Russian government  
committee meeting this month will decide on events to mark the 
2,000th anniversary of Christianity. In China, a countdown clock in 
Beijing's Tiananmen Square isn't keyed on the millenium, instead 
it's ticking away time until the Dec. 20, 1999 handover, of the 
Portuguese colony of Macau. 
</P>
<P>
	In Japan, which counts years by the length of an emperor's  
reign, 2000 will be Hisei 12, the 12th year of the reign of Akihito 
-- and few celebrations of the Western millennium are planned. 
</P>
<P>
	Israeli religious authorities already have warned against  
celebrations because New Year's Eve at the turn of the millennium 
falls on a Friday night, the Jewish sabbath. 
</P>
<P>
	There has been longstanding tension between hotels and religious  
authorities in Israel over celebrations of the Christian New Year. 
The rabbinate traditionally threatens to withdraw kosher 
certification from hotels that throw New Year's parties. 
</P>
<P>
	In Egypt, French musician Jean-Michael Jarre has been hired to  
compose a new opera to be performed at the pyramids starting at 
sunset Dec. 31, 1999, and lasting until sunrise the following day. 
Egypt also plans to affix a gold-encased capstone on the Great 
Pyramid, making it whole again, if only for the night.

<HEADLINE> Little Happening in NBA Lockout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Union director Billy Hunter traveled back from  
Philadelphia on Saturday, and NBA commissioner David Stern is due 
back from Aspen on Sunday to begin one of the most pivotal weeks in 
the league's history. 
</P>
<P>
	The league has set Thursday as the deadline for reaching a new  
collective bargaining agreement that will save the season, yet no 
new negotiating sessions have been scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	The union says it has another offer for the owners, but will not  
present it until the league agrees to a meeting. The league says no 
meeting is necessary since it already has made its final offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no plans to see David,'' Hunter said Saturday. ``When I  
get back I'll decide with my staff what to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stern wants the players to vote on his final offer, but the  
union is resisting despite the pleadings of some players. The 
union's 19-man negotiating committee is the only body authorized to 
present a proposal to the full union membership for a vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The Philadelphia Inquirer reported Saturday that at least 20  
players, including Shaquille O'Neal and Grant Hill, have approached 
former union head and current NBC Sports analyst Isiah Thomas and 
asked him to step into the process if plans for a player vote on 
the owners' offer are not in place by Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Lon Babby, the agent for Hill, said the story was untrue.  
</P>
<P>
	``I talked to Grant today and he said he hasn't spoken to Isiah  
for 6-7 months,'' Babby said. ``If Grant has something to say, 
he'll say it directly to the union.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leonard Armato, the agent for O'Neal, did not immediately return  
a message left at his office Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter has said he would like to call all 430 players and 29  
owners into the same room, possibly to bargain and possibly to 
vote, but it is unclear if the league would do it. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter also gave his side of the story concerning last  
Thursday's breakdown between attorneys Jeffrey Kessler of the union 
and Jeffrey Mishkin of the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jeff was supposed to be meeting with Mishkin, and Mishkin blew  
him off and told him to fax the (offer),'' Hunter said. ``Kessler 
called me and told me that, and I said, `In that case, hold the 
offer until I get there and I'll give it to David one way or 
another when he gets back in town.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Mishkin has offered a different version, saying Kessler told him  
he did not have the offer in its completed form but wanted to meet 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter whose version was to be believed, the miscommunication  
turned into yet another detrimental squabble in a six-month period 
that has been full of them. 
</P>
<P>
	But despite all the rancor, mistrust and hurt feelings, the  
sides have moved closer to each another on the most contentious 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	What follows is a look at each of the main issues and what each  
side has offered. (Figures in parentheses represent numbers from 
the union's upcoming offer, details of which could change. Other 
union numbers are from its previous offer and are not believed to

<HEADLINE> Clinton Turns Back to Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After a 48-hour respite from unpleasant  
questions about his future, President Clinton is back at work, 
making the case for his new budget and deciding how to tackle a 
Social Security rescue plan. 
</P>
<P>
	As senators float trial balloons on whether to take his  
impeachment by the House to a full trial, Clinton also is putting a 
cutting edge on a political weapon that has served him well in the 
past: the annual State of the Union address to Congress and the 
American people. 
</P>
<P>
	Turning first to the budget for the 2000 fiscal year beginning  
next Oct. 1, Clinton planned to use his weekly radio address today 
to draw a broad dollars-and-policy outline of his plans for the 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The president was expected to announced in the speech that he  
will seek a $100 billion increase in defense spending over the next 
six years, The New York Times reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	It would be the first increase in Pentagon spending above  
inflation since 1991, the year of the Persian Gulf War, and would 
respond to calls by military leaders for more resources to cope 
with increased commitments aboard and aging weaponry. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, The Washington Post reported today that Clinton's  
2000 budget will seek a 12 percent, $105 million increase in food 
safety programs, most of it to upgrade Agriculture Department 
inspections at smaller meat and poultry processinhg plants. 
</P>
<P>
	The strategy to immerse the president in issues is intended to  
show him doing his job and standing above congressional squabbling 
over whether he should remain in office. 
</P>
<P>
	During the week, Clinton will preside at White House events  
aimed at showcasing progress on his initiatives on health care and 
crime. On Thursday, he speaks at the Detroit Economic Club on 
challenges to the booming domestic economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The State of the Union address on Jan. 19 will spotlight the  
president's ideas for the two years remaining in his term. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's rousing performance before Congress a year ago is  
credited by many analysts for boosting his popularity in opinion 
polls, enabling him to ride above the revelations of the Monica 
Lewinsky affair, accusations of perjury and even the House vote to 
impeach him. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the accusations and impeachment may mark the president  
indelibly in the history books, they were ignored by the dozens of 
questioners who had the chance to question the president during New 
Year's Eve celebrations on Hilton Head Island, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-day forum, Renaissance Weekend, was familiar ground for  
the president and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. They have 
sampled the event's comraderie and entertaining seminars every year 
since the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking written questions as midnight approached, Clinton said  
the Republicans' aggressive ``Contract With America'' legislative 
agenda may have won the GOP control of the House in 1994, but a 
backlash by the public helped assure his re-election two years 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	After a year under investigation and attack, Clinton said his  
view of partisanship is to ``move away from the politics of 
personal destruction'' and engage in a vigorous debate between the 
political parties on how to secure the lasting future of the Social 
Security system.

<HEADLINE> Major Storm Leaves Many Stranded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- Mark Jensen rang in the New Year at the  
home of friends, and by Saturday he was still there -- snowbound 
except for accompanying them on a hike to a drug store for 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Between not having to work yesterday and the weather, I never  
made it home,'' said Jensen, even though he lives just three miles 
away in downtown Springfield. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't even think about trying to get his car out and taking  
a chance on the roads. ``I've got insurance to pay,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most people huddled at home as the snowstorm rolled across the  
Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	A few braved the snow-choked roads and boarded what few trains  
were running to Chicago's two airports -- and wound up sitting 
because airlines canceled hundreds of flights. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really want to go home,'' said Shirley Keene, who arrived at  
O'Hare International Airport to find that her flight to Washington 
was among the ones that had been called off. Like many others, she 
scrambled for a hotel room with the plan of returning to the 
airport Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't much better for motorists.  
</P>
<P>
	Stephan LaFrance, a trucker from Chicago, left California late  
Wednesday. By 3 a.m. Saturday, the wind was howling and ``with the 
shadows, you didn't know what you were seeing until you hit it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So he pulled off at the Dixie Trucker's Home on Interstate 55 in  
McLean, about 135 miles southwest of Chicago. By afternoon, he was 
still there, sipping coffee and chewing the fat with about 100 
other truckers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew once I got off the road, I wouldn't get back on. But  
I'd rather be here than out there,'' said LaFrance, who's been 
driving for 31 years. ``The only thing is, with the wind blowing, 
you could end up in somebody's field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He complained about the lack of tow trucks to help him get out  
of the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sissies,'' he sputtered. ``...If you want nice weather, go to  
Florida.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Snow was falling on the parking lot at a rate of an inch an  
hour. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've cleared the snow away twice and you can't tell,'' said  
Tami Loewen, Dixie's field desk manager. ``We're hanging tight. 
There are drivers standing all around and we're making the best of 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The snow didn't stop everyone.  
</P>
<P>
	``If you go slow, you can stay on the road,'' said Steve Little,  
who drove to an auto parts store in the Chicago suburb of Carol 
Stream to get an alternator and battery to fix his four-wheel-drive 
truck. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love it,'' said 12-year-old Billy England. ``Playing in it --  
snowballs, sledding -- it's fun.''

<HEADLINE> Drexler Allows Malone To Leave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Clyde Drexler, facing his first player crisis  
since taking over the coaching job at his alma mater, has agreed to 
allow Houston guard Moses Malone Jr. to seek a scholarship 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Malone has played in nine of the Cougars' 11 games, but started  
only one and is averaging just over 10 minutes a game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everyone was concerned about his future,'' Drexler  
told the Houston Chronicle in Saturday editions, two days after the 
son of NBA great Moses Malone Sr. bitterly criticized the coach and 
the Houston program. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want nothing but the best for him and want him to succeed.  
It was a mutual parting, and we wish him nothing but the best. This 
is in his best interest, I believe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Malone was unhappy that his talent wasn't showcased and upset  
with his limited playing time for the Cougars. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I was given a chance to show what I could do,''  
said Malone, a guard who had a season-high 13 points at California. 
``I didn't get an opportunity to play. And I don't think they were 
interested in me for the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Malone, 18, was benched against Sam Houston State early in the  
season, because of his lack of defense. He started against Portland 
State Dec. 28 in the Lobo Invitational at New Mexico, but did not 
play in the championship game against the Lobos the following 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was unpredictable when you would play,'' Malone said. ``I'm  
disappointed it came down to this. I wanted to stay. I still love 
the school, but the decision is best for me for the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Drexler, a former NBA star with the Houston Rockets and Portland  
Trail Blazers, and the Cougars' staff hope Malone's departure won't 
hurt team chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anything went wrong,'' Drexler said. ``I just  
think there may have been some unfair expectations. When you get an 
opportunity, you have to make the most of it. If you don't, you 
have to learn. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we try to have is a fair system. If you play well, you  
play. If you don't play well, you sit. The fact that you are not 
happy with it, the door is always open. But there is nothing but 
opportunity, and that's the only system that is there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Malone first thought of leaving after Houston lost at Cincinnati  
115-78 on Dec. 22. He decided to make sure it was the right 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	His father was one of the few players to go directly from high  
school into first, the ABA, then the NBA, without playing college 
basketball. He was an all-NBA performer for the Rockets and won 
league MVP honors in 1979, 1982 and 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have an 18-year-old son, all you can do is advise  
him,'' the elder Malone said. ``It was his decision to go to UH and 
his decision on the other part. He just wanted to showcase his 
talent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was not trying to influence him one way or the other. Most  
young guys -- if they are players -- they want to play. My son felt 
he was a good player. It's nothing against the UH coaches or the 
school. I just want him to be happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Malone received his release Friday and already has  
had contact with other programs about transferring. 
</P>
<P>
	Drexler, who met on Thursday with Malone Jr. and his mother,  
said the player simply walked into a situation that was not for 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just think that everyone on our team liked Moses, for the  
most part, and wishes him well,'' Drexler said. ``I just think a 
lot of guys on the team are thinking, `Hey, I have a chance to get 
the 10 minutes a game that he was getting.' For the most part, we 
are going to miss him.''

<HEADLINE> Lone Sailor Operates on Himself </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Crouched over the navigation table in his tiny cabin, the  
exhausted sailor plunges the scalpel into his arm. 
</P>
<P>
	He cuts fast and deep, just as the doctor instructed.  
</P>
<P>
	Pus and blood spurt everywhere and he gasps at how far the  
infection has spread. 
</P>
<P>
	The boat heaves, shoving him against the side. Above, the wind  
shrieks through the sails. For a second, he worries as much about 
his yacht's chances of survival as his own. 
</P>
<P>
	Focus, he thinks to himself. Focus.  
</P>
<P>
	He pulls a 4-inch stick of gauze from his medical kit and pushes  
it hard into the wound. 
</P>
<P>
	The pain would make most people scream or pass out.  
</P>
<P>
	But no one will hear Viktor Yazykov if he screams. And if he  
passes out, he knows he will probably die. 
</P>
<P>
	Alone in the middle of the South Atlantic, the 50-year-old  
Russian is 1,000 miles from shore. His autopilot is broken, he has 
lost power, and his only light is a miner's lamp strapped to his 
forehead. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been at sea for 40 days, on the first leg of a grueling  
27,000-mile solo sailboat race around the world that began in 
Charleston, S.C., in September and will take competitors to Africa, 
New Zealand, around the treacherous Cape Horn to South America and 
then back to Charleston. 
</P>
<P>
	The eight-month odyssey is called Around Alone. In the churning  
ocean darkness, Viktor Yazykov has never felt so alone. 
</P>
<P>
	He has tried to follow the 14-step surgical procedure the doctor  
from Boston e-mailed him hours earlier. But he can't stop the 
bleeding, and he's afraid he is losing his arm. 
</P>
<P>
	Slumped against the bulkhead, he sips some wine. The waves are  
banging so hard against the thin carbon fiber hull, it feels like 
they are sloshing around in his brain. 
</P>
<P>
	With his good arm, Yazykov reaches for his laptop.  
</P>
<P>
	``Have been sitting on the bloody cabin floor almost completely  
naked all covered with blood with right arm lashed up and watching 
as my life blood drop by drop leaving me,'' he types. 
</P>
<P>
	Who will find me here, he wonders, as he closes his eyes. Who  
will see this terrible mess? 
</P>
<P>
	Hurtling downwind into the dark, Yazykov's yacht would set a  
record that November night, covering a total of 239 miles in 24 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
	But would Yazykov survive?  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of miles away, in the heart of Boston, Dr. Dan Carlin  
had spent the day in his cozy, crimson-colored office at the New 
England Medical center. A 39-year-old former ship's medical 
officer, he runs a practice called WorldClinic that provides 
emergency care, through computer technology, to people around the 
globe. 
</P>
<P>
	His specialty: how and why people die at sea.  
</P>
<P>
	Carlin, a sailor himself, was the doctor assigned to Around  
Alone. He had met all the competitors, had fitted their boats with 
emergency medical kits: scalpels and staplers, antibiotics, dental 
cement. 
</P>
<P>
	He expected calls during the race. Sailors get banged up  
stumbling about their boats, dodging booms, climbing masts, fixing 
rudders and keels. Sometimes they suffer from dehydration or 
hypothermia. Fatigue is a constant. 
</P>
<P>
	The race, which takes place every four years, has a history of  
medical emergencies and high seas rescues. Hurricanes. Icebergs. 
Dismastings. Death. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlin was sure there would be an emergency in this race too.  
But not six weeks into the race, not when skippers and their 
vessels should be at their fittest. 
</P>
<P>
	So on that crisp November day, the last thing Carlin was  
thinking about was Around Alone. In fact, he was looking forward to 
skating with his wife and children on the Boston Common after work. 
</P>
<P>
	The call from race headquarters in Charleston interrupted his  
daydreaming. Officials were worried by an e-mail from Yazykov. 
</P>
<P>
	--''My right elbow does not look good. After a day I have spent  
working on the mast...it became red and even bigger...it feels like 
it's dead.''-- 
</P>
<P>
	Carlin frowned. Patients don't come any tougher than Yazykov, a  
former Soviet commando with a chiseled body and piercing blue eyes. 
Yazykov had sailed oceans alone, fought in Afghanistan, helped 
clean up Chernobyl. Not the kind of guy to complain about a minor 
infection. 
</P>
<P>
	Clean the wound, Carlin wrote, typing into his computer. Make a  
sling. Start antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
	But he wondered: Was something more serious going on?  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Yazykov's boat, a graceful 40-foot sloop with sleek white lines  
and a distinctive canting keel, is one of the smallest in the race. 
</P>
<P>
	He is proud of the yacht he built with own hands, proud of the  
way she slices the waves, smooth and clean at speeds of up to 20 
knots. He talks to her every day, his soft voice filled with 
emotion, as though talking to a lover. 
</P>
<P>
	``Perfect,'' he tells her. ``You are just perfect.''  
</P>
<P>
	Wind of Change, he named her, built as she was during the  
tumultuous changes that swept through Russia in the early 1990s. 
She has a spirit, he says, a sense of the sea. 
</P>
<P>
	Other racers, the 60-footers in Class 1, have heaters, toilets,  
satellite phones -- and hundreds of thousands of dollars in 
professional sponsorships. The inside of Yazykov's smaller boat is 
stripped bare; everything, down to the paintwork, is designed to 
make her as light as possible. Competing in Class 2, Yazykov 
depends on volunteers and goodwill. 
</P>
<P>
	This boat, this race, is his dream.  
</P>
<P>
	``Boat, boat, boat, all these years,'' sighs his wife, Ludmila.  
``Nothing but boat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But his dream has come at enormous personal cost, including a  
bitter fight with his American partner who helped build and finance 
the yacht. The two haven't spoken since the start of the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Other things have gone wrong, too. A hurricane delayed his  
arrival in Charleston and forced him to start the race six days 
behind everyone else. He suffered food poisoning and a broken 
tooth. The elbow he bruised on the way to Charleston swelled badly. 
The autopilot broke, and so did the engine. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he was enjoying the rhythm of the race, the solitude. He  
celebrated his 50th birthday on Oct. 29 with a candlelit dinner of 
fried eggs and wine and a letter he had carried with him from 
Ludmila. 
</P>
<P>
	His celebration was short-lived.  
</P>
<P>
	On Nov. 7, Wind of Change slammed into a storm with a sickening  
crack. One of the shrouds, thin metal rods that stabilize the 
60-foot mast, snapped. 
</P>
<P>
	Yazykov spent five hours clinging to the mast, working on  
repairs. He fixed the shroud. But he had another problem. His right 
elbow, which had ached since he left Charleston, had swollen to 
five times its normal size. It didn't hurt anymore. It didn't have 
any feeling at all. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we might have a problem.''  
</P>
<P>
	Race officials were on the phone from Charleston again, with the  
latest e-mail from Yazykov. His elbow had blown up like a soft 
pillow and he wanted to cut it open. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlin started typing immediately. Clearly and concisely, he  
laid out a memo, telling Yazykov how to cut, drain and dress the 
wound. He had to be brutally clear, conveying the pain of surgery, 
while reassuring Yazykov that it was safe. There was no anesthetic 
and he couldn't let his patient be affected by a painkiller until 
the operation was over. 
</P>
<P>
	So he told the sailor how much it will hurt. And that he had no  
choice. 
</P>
<P>
	--''Make your incision rapidly. It will hurt less if you do.''--  
</P>
<P>
	Swirling through Carlin's brain was a picture of the medical  
kit, the cramped cabin, the heaving sea. 
</P>
<P>
	Fingers on a keyboard: Tap. Tap. Tap.  
</P>
<P>
	--''It hurts a great deal when you insert the gauze... Get it  
down into the depths of the wound as much as possible.''-- 
</P>
<P>
	Carlin was conscious of the time: Yazykov's engine hadn't been  
working properly, and he was using solar panels to charge his 
batteries. He would lose power after dark. Carlin was conscious of 
the language barrier: Yazykov's English was good, but was it good 
enough to fully understand medical terms? Most of all, Carlin was 
conscious that if the arm was not treated properly, the infection 
could spread, meaning loss of the arm, or worse. 
</P>
<P>
	Tap. Tap. Tap.  
</P>
<P>
	Carlin pictured the wound, the infection pouring out, the sailor  
wincing in pain. He knew Yazykov won't cry out. 
</P>
<P>
	Focus, Carlin told himself. Think of what could go wrong. Have  
you covered everything? 
</P>
<P>
	--''Take the squeeze bottle that is full of water and iodine and  
gently rinse out the pus pocket. The rinsing out will cause you 
pain.''-- 
</P>
<P>
	For an hour, Carlin typed and thought and typed some more. He  
told Yazykov to rest after surgery, to take a painkiller, to apply 
heat compresses. He reassured him that doctors would be waiting in 
Cape Town. 
</P>
<P>
	And when he couldn't think of anything else to say, he signed  
off: 
</P>
<P>
	``Good luck.''  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Yazykov is frightened. He has done everything Carlin instructed.  
But something has gone wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	The doctor never said there would be so much blood, and now it  
is everywhere, dripping over the table and the medical kit, soaking 
his pants, flowing into a red pool on the floor where it rolls with 
the motion of the boat. 
</P>
<P>
	Remembering what he learned as a soldier, he grabs two bungee  
cords and strings them together. Using his teeth and his good arm, 
he ties them around the wound, seven times, as tight as possible. 
Then he hooks the cord to an overhead handrail and pulls as hard as 
he can. 
</P>
<P>
	The bleeding stops.  
</P>
<P>
	So does all sensation in his arm.  
</P>
<P>
	Yazykov doesn't hear the wind howling anymore, hardly feels the  
pitching of the boat. The tiller is lashed down and Wind of Change 
is steering itself, racing through the darkness, surfing down 15 
foot waves. 
</P>
<P>
	Softly Yazykov talks to his arm, in the same soothing tone he  
reserves for his vessel. 
</P>
<P>
	``My poor arm,'' he says, trying to massage some feeling back.  
``You have worked so hard for me all my life, and now I cannot save 
you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No response. No feeling. Just cold and white, like a lump of  
rubber. 
</P>
<P>
	Yazykov stumbles over to the laptop. It's nearly 10 p.m. and the  
ocean is dark. He prays that there will be enough power for his 
message to reach Charleston. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did it, but was something unexpected. I could not stop  
bleeding,'' he types. ``Please, what should I do before too late. 
Viktor.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            	--------	 
</P>
<P>
	Carlin has spent the day pacing the office. He hasn't heard from  
Yazykov in six hours. What was going on in the Southern Ocean? 
</P>
<P>
	Crawling home at rush-hour, cellphone by his side, he gets the  
call. The message from race headquarters confirms his worst fears. 
Yazykov is killing his arm. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the din of Boston traffic, Carlin yells into his cell  
phone, ``TELL HIM REMOVE THE SHOCK CORDS IMMEDIATELY.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Charleston, a race official starts typing.  
</P>
<P>
	Carlin's head is spinning. Why so much blood? He had diagnosed  
an abscess. Had he been wrong? 
</P>
<P>
	Aspirin. Yazykov had been taking aspirin for weeks for the pain  
and it must have thinned his blood, preventing it from clotting 
after surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tell him not to take any more aspirin,'' he shouts into the  
phone. ``Tell him to put the arm in a sling and not to use it for 
several hours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tell him,'' he searches for the right words, ``that it is not,  
repeat NOT likely you can bleed to death from this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 5:21 p.m. Charleston time, Carlin's instructions are e-mailed  
to Yazykov. 
</P>
<P>
	Still clutching his cellphone, Carlin goes home to his family  
and prays. In Charleston, race officials sit by their computers and 
wait. 
</P>
<P>
	They are all sailors here -- some of them former solo racers.  
They know the sheer impossibility of steering a boat through stormy 
seas when you are crippled and alone. 
</P>
<P>
	They think of others who have been lost: Harry Mitchell, the  
irrepressible 70-year-old Briton, lost in the Southern Ocean during 
the 1994-95 race; Mike Plant, the 41-year-old American whose yacht 
capsized in the Atlantic during a race in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlin remembers them, too.  
</P>
<P>
	Tucking his children into bed that night, he asks them to say a  
special prayer that God will keep Viktor safe. Then he turns to his 
wife. ``I might lose this guy tonight,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
                            	--------	 
</P>
<P>
	-- ``Viktor. Dr. Carlin has some questions. Did the feeling in  
your arm and hand come back? Can you feel your pulse? Can you move 
all your fingers?''-- 
</P>
<P>
	6 p.m. at race headquarters, an hour since the last message to  
Yazykov, and still no word. 
</P>
<P>
	--''Viktor. Did you get the message?''  
</P>
<P>
	``Viktor. Dr. Carlin is waiting for the answers?''  
</P>
<P>
	``Viktor. Are you ok?''--  
</P>
<P>
	All night they pound the computer keys, sending e-mail after  
e-mail. They might as well be trying to contact the moon. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no other way to reach the stricken sailor, nearly 1,000  
miles from Cape Town. They can't send a helicopter that far into 
the ocean, and the nearest boat is days away. 
</P>
<P>
	Morning dawns in the Southern Ocean. Nighttime in Charleston.  
Still they keep typing. 
</P>
<P>
	--''Viktor. Please send a message telling us how you are.''--  
</P>
<P>
	The words pop up on the computer at 3:07 a.m. in Charleston.  
It's 8:07 a.m. in the ocean, 12 hours since Yazykov performed 
surgery, nearly 10 hours since his last desperate plea. He has just 
awakened. 
</P>
<P>
	--''I AM OK''--   	
</P>
<P>
	--''The hand is still very sleepy. Getting strength back very  
slowly. Thank you very much for your help.''-- 
</P>
<P>
	In bed, in Boston, Carlin gets the call he has been waiting for.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	On Nov. 16, 45 days after leaving Charleston, Viktor Yazykov  
sails into Cape Town to crowds and cheers and champagne. 
</P>
<P>
	He hugs Ludmila tightly. He waves his bandaged arm. When a radio  
station hooks him up with Carlin, he tells the doctor that they are 
brothers for life. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he turns and gazes at his boat.  
</P>
<P>
	``Wind of Change is the real hero,'' he says. ``She's a great  
little boat.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Viktor Yazykov set off on the second leg of the race, from Cape  
Town to Auckland, New Zealand, on Dec 5. His arm appeared healthy 
and almost completely healed. He is expected to arrive in Auckland 
in early January. The third leg of the race, from Auckland to Punta 
del Este in Uruguay, begins on Feb. 6. The race ends in Charleston, 
S.C., sometime in May. 
</P>
<P>

	EDITOR'S NOTE -- This story is based on interviews with Dr. Dan  
Carlin, officials of Around Alone and Viktor Yazykov. It also draws

<HEADLINE> Hawaii TV To Start News On Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- For the first time in decades, Hawaii news  
watchers can expect something novel from the 10 O'Clock News -- that 
it will start at 10 o'clock. 
</P>
<P>
	Hawaii's network affiliates have long started their late news up  
to 10 minutes late in order to cram in more commercials. The 
practice began when the stations were broadcasting tapes shipped 
from the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
	But with the new year, two affiliates -- Fox's KHON and ABC's  
KITV -- decided to make the switch to what the industry calls 
``clock time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``To compete in a 70-channel universe, you have to be on the  
clock. You can't be expecting your viewers to wait to watch the 
news when they switch over from a show that ended on time,'' said 
KITV news director Walter Zimmerman. ``The viewers will like it 
better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	KHON switched on Jan. 1 and KITV will switch over on Jan. 5.  
</P>
<P>
	Two other affiliates, CBS' KGMB and NBC's KHNL, are holding off  
until they see what happens to the other stations, but expect to 
ultimately switch as well. The February ratings that come out March 
15 should show the impact, KHNL general manager John Fink said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kent Baker, KHON's general manager, believes the change is  
happening now because all four network affiliates are owned by big 
mainland companies that can support them financially during the 
transition. 
</P>
<P>
	Before satellite transmissions, Hawaii television stations got  
their network programs on tapes flown to the islands. The programs 
were shown a week late and not necessarily in the same time slot as 
on the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
	To cover the added shipping costs, the networks allowed the  
local stations to delay program starts in order to sandwich in a 
few more prime-time ads. 
</P>
<P>
	The switch should increase the value of prime-time advertising  
slots, help keep advertisers' ads from getting lost in a bundle of 
back-to-back commercials and increase competition in the market, 
Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a great idea,'' said Kate Stanley, a state  
administrator. ``I go to sleep after the news and if it were 
earlier, I could go to sleep earlier.''

<HEADLINE> GOP To Seek End of Marriage Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- GOP leaders are vowing to continue efforts to  
give married couples a tax break by ending the ``marriage tax 
penalty'' in existing law. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP lawmakers ``will work to make elimination of the marriage  
tax penalty our top tax relief priority to help families in 1999,'' 
Rep. Jerry Weller, R-Ill., said in the party's weekly radio address 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	With Weller as chief sponsor, the House last year passed  
legislation that would have given some 28 million married couples 
tax relief. But the measure died because the Senate never acted on 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Republicans believe it is wrong and unfair that today's tax  
code imposes higher taxes on married working couples,'' Weller 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In fact, an average married working couple pays almost $1,400  
more in taxes than an identical couple living together outside of 
marriage,'' he added. In his district, he said that is equal to a 
year's tuition to a community college or three months of day care. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the marriage penalty measure died, the old Congress was  
successful in other efforts to provide Americans with some tax 
relief. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, Congress enacted a $500-per-child tax credit,  
which Weller said will let parents of more than 48 million children 
keep more of their income. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress also increased deductions for student loan expenses.  
Weller said that will let approximately 3 million taxpayers this 
year deduct up to $1,500 in student loan interest costs.

<HEADLINE> Valid Reprized Wins at Calder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Valid Reprized caught Wertz at the eighth pole and  
drew away to a 3 3/4-length victory in the $100,000 Tropical Park 
Derby as Calder closed out its meeting Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mr. Roark, a 25-1 shot, closed fast for second, with Wertz  
lasting for third in the race for 3-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Javier Castellano, Valid Reprized was timed in 1:53  
2-5 for 1 1/8 miles and paid $20.20, $10 and $5.60. Mr. Roark returned 
$24.60 and $14.80. Wertz paid $5.20 to show. In Frank's Honor, the 
favorite, finished sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	Wertz opened a three-length lead into the first turn. Thanks  
Franks was second and Dance The Ballado third. Valid Reprized was 
sixth and Mr. Roark eighth. Leaving the far turn, Valid Reprized 
made a big move from the outside and Mr. Roark started his move, 
also from the outside. 
</P>
<P>
	Wertz's lead was reduced to two lengths at the three-sixteenths  
pole and vanished entirely in midstretch. Valid Reprized drove to 
the front with an eighth of a mile to go and was home free. Mr. 
Roark finished 2 3/4 lengths in front of the pacesetter.

<HEADLINE> GM Concept Cars Target Young Buyers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp. forfeited its reputation as  
an automotive styling leader decades ago with increasingly bland, 
look-alike cars that contributed to a long, steady slide in its 
U.S. market share. 
</P>
<P>
	With this week's opening of the 1999 Detroit auto show, GM is  
unveiling a fleet of concept cars that executives hope will reverse 
its stodgy image and lure younger buyers. If reaction on the show 
circuit is positive, most if not all could make it into production. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Smith, GM's chairman and chief executive, had been  
promising for months that GM had exciting ``crossover'' vehicles in 
the pipeline that will see their way into production in the next 
few years. Crossovers are the latest industry trend, vehicles that 
combine attributes of cars and trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	GM planned to unveil the five vehicles during the North American  
International Auto Show's media preview Sunday. The show opens to 
the public next Saturday. Each concept is intended to help 
differentiate the GM division it represents: Chevrolet, Pontiac, 
Cadillac, Buick and Oldsmobile. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chevy Nomad attempts to combine the cool image, performance  
and handling of a sports car with the functionality of a sport 
utility vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you put the Blazer and a Corvette in a blender, the Nomad  
is what you would wind up with,'' said designer Christos Roustemis. 
``You can put anything in there that a small pickup truck would 
carry, only you've got a hot, sporty car for the weekends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The name plays homage to the Corvette-inspired show car that GM  
introduced in 1954 and the '55-57 production version that has 
become a prized collector's car. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nomad concept, like its ancestor, essentially is a two-door  
station wagon. 
</P>
<P>
	The doors slide back like those on a minivan, improving access  
to the interior where all but the driver's seat fold flat for 
cargo. The roof is designed like a Venetian blind, sliding forward 
to expose a yard-long opening for carrying tall cargo. The tailgate 
folds down and slides under the load floor to provide easier access 
from the rear. 
</P>
<P>
	Another youth-targeted concept is the Pontiac Aztek: part SUV,  
part midsize sedan and part van. It's edgy, aggressive look and 
functional design are aimed at active, outdoors-oriented people. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the Nomad, it features a flat load floor with a lot of  
vertical space. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's other concepts are:  
</P>
<P>
	--Cadillac Evoq (pronounced e-VOKE), a high-tech, luxury roadster  
with such features as a thermal-imaging display that allows the 
driver to see people and animals at night well before they are 
illuminated by headlights, an in-dash personal computer with 
Internet access, and rearview cameras that replace conventional 
mirrors. 
</P>
<P>
	--Buick Cielo, a sporty four-door convertible that uses two  
stationary roof rails to carry sliding roof panels while 
maintaining rollover protection. It has roof-mounted air bags that 
protect back-seat passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	--Oldsmobile Recon, similar in size to the Aztek but with a  
cleaner, industrial-techno look. It features a two-panel sunroof 
covering the front and rear seats, a ``docking station'' for a 
``personal data assistant'' computer, and a rearview camera instead 
of a mirror.

<HEADLINE> College Football Playoff Pushed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- People are not beating a path to Jim  
Wheeler's door. Not yet. 
</P>
<P>
	That hardly proves the marketing executive with big bucks and  
little name recognition doesn't have a better mousetrap. He does. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a playoff system for college football that did not  
originate with an overwrought sports writer, a disgruntled coach or 
overheated alumni. But that's only one reason why Wheeler and his 
employer, a Swiss-based sports marketing and licensing firm named 
ISL, might succeed where everyone else has failed. 
</P>
<P>
	There are another 2.4 billion or so reasons why it might work --  
roughly one for every dollar ISL plans to offer the power brokers 
in the sport to buy into their proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am encouraged by the feedback,'' Wheeler said last week,  
after three months spent selling the idea to a group of college 
presidents and athletic directors at almost 50 schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Few people in the know share his enthusiasm at the moment. Two  
of them, though, coach the teams that play Monday at the Fiesta 
Bowl to determine this season's national champion. And while 
Tennessee's Phil Fulmer and Florida State's Bobby Bowden are 
grateful to the Bowl Championship Series for making the matchup, 
they also know what more and more followers of the college game are 
figuring out. 
</P>
<P>
	For all the improvements the BCS made on the ``Super Alliance''  
(which was an improvement, in turn, on the ``Bowl Alliance'' and 
the earlier ``Bowl Coalition''), the system is still broken. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only way to know the true national champion,'' Fulmer  
said, ``is to have a playoff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Bowden, ``That last Saturday (of the regular season), I was  
saying to myself, `This ain't going to work.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden was sitting on a couch at home at the time, wondering how  
the BCS was going to decide which of three still-unbeaten teams -- 
Tennessee, Kansas State and UCLA -- would be out of the guaranteed 1 
vs. 2 game. As it turned out, both Kansas State and UCLA lost, 
enabling Florida State to move up to No. 2 to face Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	But just as in past years, that didn't solve all the problems.  
Instead of trouble at the top, this time around, the problems came 
at the next level. The most glaring example was the free-fall 
experienced by Kansas State. The Wildcats went all the way from 
being one play away from the national championship game to the 
Alamo Bowl, watching their payout make an equally steep drop, from 
$12 million to $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	That happened because the other bowls controlled by the BCS --  
Rose, Orange, Sugar and Cotton -- were under few constraints in 
filling out their games. As a result, both the Orange and Cotton 
selected teams that were less deserving, but easier to sell than 
Kansas State. A playoff would take the decision-making process out 
of the hands of the fat cats in loud blazers and replace it with a 
merit system. Nothing is more American than that. 
</P>
<P>
	While such corporate giants as Disney and Nike have been tied to  
playoff proposals that failed, the ISL plan offers both a format 
and a dollar value that's hard to ignore. Scheduled to begin in 
2002, after the current BCS deal with the bowls expires, it calls 
for 16 teams and incorporates bowl games for both the semifinals 
and final. 
</P>
<P>
	With ISL's credentials -- the firm has worked with both the  
Olympics and soccer's World Cup -- even some of the blazers plan to 
give it a serious airing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything is possible,'' said John Junker, executive director  
of the Fiesta Bowl. ``After this week, we're going to take a look 
at it. Obviously, our first concern is that the system in place 
should have some preference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The power brokers, led by BCS chairman and Southeastern  
Conference commissioner Roy Kramer, have no intention of budging. 
Graham Spanier, who heads the NCAA Division I Board of Directors, 
said after meeting with Wheeler that no amount of money is likely 
to change the thinking of his group, which essentially controls 
college athletics. 
</P>
<P>
	``My honest assessment,'' he said of a playoff, ``is it's not  
going to happen anytime soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Soon is a relative term. The ISL plan calls for a payout of $300  
million annually to the 100-plus major-college programs, more than 
double the $141 million the bowls currently pay. With that 
incentive out there, plus growing pressure from the coaches, 
players and an increasing number of the university's athletic 
directors who make the current system go, the resistance gets 
thinner by the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, a playoff is inevitable. It might not be exactly  
what the ISL is proposing and the firm might not even be part of 
whatever system is put into place. Television provides most of the 
financial underpinning for the current system and would have the 
biggest say in what replaces it. 
</P>
<P>
	All the familiar arguments against a playoff will get another  
airing. It cheapens the regular season and makes it too long. It 
commercializes college football and puts too much pressure on the 
players and coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	But remember this: If everybody was really concerned about the  
kids' academic load, there would be more study halls. And their 
coaches wouldn't make twice what their professors do.

<HEADLINE> Disappointment Haunts FSU's Weinke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- The headaches linger. Seven weeks after  
spinal surgery, just standing up makes him dizzy. But all that 
doesn't prevent Florida State quarterback Chris Weinke from 
harboring a fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe I'll sneak on some pads and run out there,'' he said  
with a half-hearted laugh, knowing his only role in Monday night's 
Fiesta Bowl will be as a mentor for his replacement, Marcus Outzen. 
</P>
<P>
	Six years of minor-league baseball and a lifetime of athletic  
competition could not inoculate Weinke from the pain he's enduring 
-- not from the hits that nearly paralyzed him, but from the 
frustration of being merely a spectator at the biggest game of his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not being able to play Monday night is probably the toughest  
thing I've ever had to deal with,'' he said. ``Each and every day 
something comes up where I wish I could be a part of this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weinke, a 26-year-old sophomore who came back to college after  
spending six years as a first baseman in the Toronto Blue Jays' 
organization, is lucky even to be able to stand on the sideline for 
the national championship game against Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	He endured two crushing hits in a Nov. 7 game against Virginia  
that caused a herniated disk and a thumbnail-sized bone chip 
pressing on a nerve. Five days after the game, he had surgery to 
remove the disk and fuse two vertebrae. 
</P>
<P>
	The operation went well, but the bone chip caused a leak of  
spinal fluid that caused massive headaches for weeks. He lost 22 
pounds. Sleeping more than three hours at a time was impossible 
because of the pain. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinke could barely walk and had just enough energy to click the  
remote control while watching UCLA and Kansas State get upset in 
late November, elevating Florida State to No. 2 in the nation and 
giving the Seminoles a chance to face undefeated and top-ranked 
Tennessee in the Fiesta Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time he arrived with his teammates in Tempe, most of the  
pain in his head had subsided. The reality of what he was about to 
miss started sinking in, though. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we got off the plane, I think it really set in that we're  
playing for the national championship and I can't be part of it,'' 
he said. ``It's been tough all week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It hardly has been the storybook ending that Weinke seemed to be  
leading up to. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the top prep athletes in the country in St. Paul, Minn.,  
the 6-foot-5 Weinke signed with the Seminoles in 1989 but opted for 
the Blue Jays' $375,000 signing bonus after spending only four days 
in fall football drills in Tallahassee. 
</P>
<P>
	He invested much of his bonus in real estate, and is financially  
secure. He played 750 minor-league games and even earned a two-week 
stint in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
	But he started missing football. While playing baseball in  
Tennessee, he would go to the empty football stadium in Knoxville 
and walk on the field. Tennessee coach Phillip Fulmer visited and 
kidded about him becoming a Volunteers quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing in Tennessee ``put that football blood back into me,''  
he said. ``But they couldn't get me -- I was still a Florida State 
fan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Weinke decided to try football again, Florida State coach  
Bobby Bowden had his old scholarship waiting. And when a couple of 
other quarterbacks got injured, Weinke became a starter. 
</P>
<P>
	He threw six interceptions in his second start, a 24-7 loss at  
North Carolina State Sept. 12 that is the Seminoles' only defeat 
this season, but rebounded to go the next 7 1/2 games without an 
interception. 
</P>
<P>
	When he was hurt, Weinke had thrown a school-record 218 passes  
without being picked off. During that span, he passed for 2,037 
yards and 17 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like I played a major role in the reason we're here  
playing for the national championship,'' he said. ``And I feel like 
I have a role to play this week and be in Marcus' shadow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outzen, who will be making his third collegiate start, said it  
will be good having Weinke on the sideline Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It helps me out, it's another quarterback with the Florida  
State playbook in his head,'' said the sophomore, who already plans 
on being Weinke's backup next season. ``Everything he can see that 
I'm not seeing helps me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weinke, too, already is thinking ahead to next season.  
</P>
<P>
	``Life is a challenge,'' he said. ``This is a chance for me to  
get back to 100 percent and try to get back to this game next year. 
Knowing I'm not able to play in a game of this magnitude, I think 
what it's going to do is make me hungrier for next year.''

<HEADLINE> San Francisco's City Hall Reopens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- San Francisco's worst earthquake prompted  
creation of its glittering City Hall. The latest deadly temblor 
brought its restoration. 
</P>
<P>
	The landmark crowned by a golden dome taller than the U.S.  
Capitol's reopens Tuesday, nearly a decade after the Loma Prieta 
quake put cracks in the French Renaissance-style building, forcing 
its closure in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The regal hall was first erected as a monument to San  
Francisco's rebirth after the city was leveled by the huge 1906 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
	``City Hall looks gorgeous,'' said city supervisor Barbara  
Kaufman. ``It really is the people's place, and I think San 
Franciscans will be so proud when they see how it has been restored 
to its former beauty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dulled by fog and salty ocean breezes over the years, the  
building's dome is back to its original lustre, thanks to more than 
$400,000 in gold filigree. The restoration project, which cost $293 
million, also refurbished stately marble and oak interiors. 
</P>
<P>
	Included in the price -- which was about $100 million more than  
originally planned -- were 600 rubber and stainless steel bumpers 
installed deep in the bowels of the building to help it withstand 
an earthquake up to magnitude 8. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Willie Brown, who was elected after it was closed, will  
move into a spacious office paneled in dark oak, with wooden 
parquet floors and a decorative fireplace. It's the same office all 
his predecessors have occupied since 1915. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every citizen in San Francisco will be proud of their new City  
Hall,'' he said. ``Equally important is that it's a working City 
Hall with full service capabilities for all of its citizens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown wanted to transform the building into a ceremonial  
showplace, reducing the number of city workers there from 1,300 to 
about 700. For the most part, opponents of that idea prevailed -- 
the new building will house about 1,000 city workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Routine city business will be conducted there, including  
securing marriage licenses, making tax payments, buying a dog 
license and registering to vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The restoration revealed the vision of original architect Arthur  
Brown Jr., who also designed Coit Tower. Gone are the 
post-earthquake cracks in the walls and the plywood braces -- 
painted to look like marble -- that held up arches and doorways. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers scurrying to put the finishing touches on the building  
in the week between Christmas and New Year's were dwarfed by the 
centerpiece staircase and towering 306-foot dome of the rotunda. 
Crystal chandeliers cast a warm glow. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor James ``Sunny Jim'' Rolph, who presided over the city when  
it was first built, directed Brown to make a larger dome than the 
U.S. Capitol, according to the project manager, Tony Irons. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's about 5 feet taller,'' he smiled.

<HEADLINE> Charles Haley Signed by Niners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Charles Haley was drenched in sweat  
and breathing hard after Saturday's light practice. And he 
wondered, along with everyone else, how ready he'd be to play his 
first game in two years with just one day of preparation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll find out on Sunday, won't we?'' Haley said.  
</P>
<P>
	In a stunning move borne out of the injury-riddled state of  
their defensive line, the San Francisco 49ers signed Haley on 
Saturday and will use him as a situational pass rusher in Sunday's 
wild-card game against the Green Bay Packers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if this was a desperation move,'' coach Steve  
Mariucci said. ``Maybe it's a bold move. Maybe it's a surprising 
move. I don't know if anybody expected us to do this. I don't know 
if we expected to do this. 
</P>
<P>
	``Much of this has to do with the health of our defensive line.  
Going into the playoffs, we would be remiss if we didn't 
investigate any opportunity that we may have to improve our 
situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once one of the most feared pass rushers in the league, Haley  
hasn't played since 1996 because of back problems that forced him 
to undergo three operations. In 11 seasons -- six with San Francisco 
and the last five with Dallas -- Haley racked up 97 1/2 sacks. 
</P>
<P>
	He also played on a record five Super Bowl championship teams,  
two with the 49ers and three while with the Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
	Haley wore out his welcome in San Francisco because of erratic  
off-field behavior and personality clashes with some of his coaches 
and teammates and was traded to Dallas in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to field the best team to win regardless of the  
baggage Charles Haley has,'' linebacker Ken Norton Jr. said. 
``Everyone knows how he can be at times, but he can play some great 
football. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one knows exactly what we're going to see. If he comes out  
there and he's good and he puts pressure on the quarterback, then 
it's a great move. If he doesn't, if he starts huffing and puffing 
and spitting up, it's a bad move.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Haley tried to make a comeback at the start of this season,  
the 49ers considered signing him but decided against it. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, San Francisco's defensive line has been weakened  
considerably by injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	End Roy Barker has been playing with a sore knee all season, end  
Chris Doleman has had a torn left pectoral muscle for the last 
month and star tackle Bryant Young was lost for the year when he 
broke his right leg Nov. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers have only five sacks in their last four games and fear  
Packers quarterback Brett Favre could wreak havoc on their 
secondary, which has been vulnerable to big plays, if unable to 
mount an effective pass rush. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I'm OK. I think I can come in and help the team and  
that's what I'm going to do,'' Haley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mariucci said the 49ers will use Haley to spell Barker and  
Doleman. 
</P>
<P>
	``For starters, he'll rush the passer,'' Mariucci said. ``That's  
what he has been best at over the years. How many snaps, we'll have 
to wait and see. We'll try to work him in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mariucci said he discussed the signing with the team's leaders --  
the club's 13 players over 30 years old -- before deciding to go 
ahead with it. 
</P>
<P>
	``To the man, we all felt that if can help us in any way, we  
should do this,'' Mariucci said. ``There was no hesitation by 
anyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Haley said he's not out to win any friends. He just wants to  
play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not one to put a lot of weight on whether someone cares  
whether I'm here or not,'' Haley said. ``My job is simple and 
plain. Put my hand down and go get Brett Favre. That's what I'm 
here to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Green Bay defensive end Reggie White, who led the NFC with 16  
sacks at age 37 this season, said he couldn't believe Haley was 
coming back. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope he doesn't surprise me, but shucks, with no practice  
and coming in trying to play two days after you tried out for the 
team? I just don't know how successful you can be,'' White said 
Saturday night at the team hotel. ``I hope he will stay well. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I heard about it this morning, I thought it was a joke.''

<HEADLINE> Fulmer Goes for Fiesta Bowl Victory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Tennessee coach Phillip Fulmer often is  
defined by what he is not. 
</P>
<P>
	He's not flashy. He's not svelte. He's not arrogant.  
</P>
<P>
	OK, so some of the more famous coaches have some of those  
traits. 
</P>
<P>
	But he has a better winning percentage than Steve Spurrier or  
anybody else currently coaching in Division I-A (66-11, .857), and 
his undefeated, top-ranked team is playing for the national 
championship Monday against Bobby Bowden and Florida State in the 
Fiesta Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not the flashiest guy around,'' Fulmer said. ``But I'm  
also not nearly as dull as these guys want to make me seem 
sometimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Right, agreed linebacker Al Wilson. ``Sometimes he can crack a  
couple of stale jokes,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fulmer isn't paid to do a standup routine and doesn't bother to  
try. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked to compare himself to the talkative, folksy Bowden, Fulmer  
said: ``I'm not going to get into a storytelling contest with 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a characteristic touch, he added: ``But I don't think that  
has anything to do with the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Right, the game. If Fulmer's personality is easy to overlook,  
his success is not. 
</P>
<P>
	``Phil Fulmer is just getting noticed,'' Bowden said. ``If the  
world stopped right now he'd go down as the winningest coach ever. 
He can't hide much longer. Everybody knows he's out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, he signed a new, six-year contract for $950,000 a  
year and unspecified other benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Fulmer is the consummate plodder, a tortoise in a field of  
hares. He's also smart, well-organized, a stickler for detail and a 
hard worker. 
</P>
<P>
	He promised to take the Tennessee program to a higher level when  
he took over in 1993, and he's done it by shoring up the 
behind-the-scenes stuff that isn't on TV every Saturday but can 
ensure that a team is: recruiting, academic tutoring, the weight 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	Fulmer is a small-town guy from Winchester in southern middle  
Tennessee, a lot closer to the Alabama line than to Knoxville. As a 
player out of high school, he chose Tennessee over Alabama and Bear 
Bryant, and lettered as an offensive lineman for three years in a 
relatively undistinguished college career. 
</P>
<P>
	He was an assistant coach at Tennessee immediately after his  
playing days, then for five years at Wichita State and one year at 
Vanderbilt before returning to Knoxville in 1980. He was the 
offensive coordinator before taking over from Johnny Majors at the 
end of the 1992 season. 
</P>
<P>
	In Fulmer's six full seasons, the Vols have won 10 games twice,  
11 games twice and 12 games this season -- the first undefeated 
regular season for Tennessee since 1956 and the most victories for 
the Vols in one season. 
</P>
<P>
	If Tennessee can handle Florida State, he'll have the school's  
first national title since 1951 and become only the second 
Tennessee coach to win one. The stadium is named after the other, 
Gen. Robert R. Neyland. 
</P>
<P>
	Fulmer is easy to underestimate, and he likes it that way. He is  
cautious in his public statements; he'd rather stick a hot poker in 
his ear than give an opponent bulletin-board fodder. 
</P>
<P>
	But he didn't get to be successful just by not being various  
things. 
</P>
<P>
	He can spot and recruit talent, the life's blood for a college  
coach. When the Vols lost Peyton Manning, two other first-round 
draft picks and a slew of other players to the NFL after last 
year's 11-2 season, they were expected to fall off. When they lost 
Jamal Lewis in the fourth game this season, they again were 
expected to suffer. 
</P>
<P>
	And yet here they are.  
</P>
<P>
	``We've got great players behind great players,'' Wilson said.  
</P>
<P>
	Fulmer is loyal to his staff. He has appointed three offensive  
or defensive coordinators during his tenure, and all three were 
promotions from within. 
</P>
<P>
	He has a reputation as a ``player's coach,'' and the players say  
he's gotten even better the past couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's letting us make a lot of the decisions in how this team  
is going to be run,'' said cornerback Steve Johnson, a fifth-year 
senior. ``He has the final say-so, of course, but he's letting us 
have a lot of say-so and I think it's been good for the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fulmer has been more relaxed this season, a function of  
experience and of liking the chemistry on this team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's all enjoy what we're doing, but let's don't cross the  
line,'' he said of his philosophy. ``You respect me and what I'm 
doing, and I'll certainly respect you and what you're doing, but 
don't cross the line.''

<HEADLINE> Niners Pin Hopes on Hearst </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The Green Bay Packers have ended the San  
Francisco 49ers' season three straight years, but they've never had 
to worry about a rushing attack like this. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers were the NFC's top-ranked rushing team thanks to  
Garrison Hearst, who is questionable for Sunday's showdown between 
the Packers (11-5) and 49ers (12-4) because of a mild right 
hamstring pull. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco coach Steve Mariucci is confident Hearst, who was  
ineffective in the NFC title game last year after returning from a 
broken collarbone, will be productive against the Packers, who have 
allowed only 85 yards rushing per game. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearst rushed for a club record 1,570 yards, third in the NFL  
and 44 more yards than the Packers rushed for as a team. He added 
39 catches for 535 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a durable back, a physical back, a smart back, a good  
receiver, will block, he's very versatile,'' Mariucci said. 
</P>
<P>
	And he's the one the 49ers are pinning their hopes on.  
</P>
<P>
	Hearst gained 99 yards on 17 carries in the 49ers' 36-22 loss at  
Green Bay Nov. 1, when Mariucci inexplicably didn't let him touch 
the ball after the third quarter. Quarterback Steve Young was 
sacked five times in the fourth quarter as the Packers pulled away 
for their fifth straight victory over San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Mariucci is hoping a retooled offensive line, three exceptional  
wideouts in Jerry Rice, JJ Stokes and Terrell Owens and a healthy 
Hearst will keep Reggie White and LeRoy Butler at bay this time. 
</P>
<P>
	Young, who set club records this season with an NFL-high 36  
touchdown passes and 4,170 yards passing, never has been able to 
put together a solid game against the Packers, who take no solace 
in their 8-0 mark against the 49ers' 37-year-old quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's playing this year as well as he has ever played,'' said  
Green Bay coach Mike Holmgren, who coached Young as an assistant at 
Brigham Young and with the 49ers. ``He's amazing. He has taken such 
good care of himself over the years and he is such a superb athlete 
and he is throwing the ball as well as I have ever seen him throw 
the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's had some great years prior to this, but it's amazing what  
he can do at his age. And he has taken more than his share of 
getting knocked around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks in large part to the Packers, who have sacked him 16  
times in the past three games, including a career-high nine times 
Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	In all five of the losses, the 49ers have fallen behind. They  
have been outscored 54-6 in the first quarter of those games, 
allowing the Packers to rush the passer with abandon. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the spot they want to put you in and that's what we've  
got to avoid, because then they can create a lot of havoc,'' Young 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	That's where Hearst comes in.  
</P>
<P>
	His 99 yards rushing at Lambeau Field two months ago was the  
best showing by a 49ers running back in the past five games against 
Green Bay. In the previous four meetings, San Francisco running 
backs averaged only 2.3 yards per carry on 61 attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you remember the last couple games when we didn't run the  
ball effectively in the NFC championship, that allowed them to tee 
off on Steve.'' Mariucci said. ``They have very good pass rushers. 
If we can continue to mix and match, Reggie White and Santana 
Dotson will have to play the run and pass, screens and draws, and 
they may not get to Steve as easily.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White plans not to get drawn into that indecision.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've always said what makes a great defensive line is when you  
shut the run down because that gives you the opportunity to rush 
the passer,'' said White, who led the NFC with 16 sacks, including 
three against Young. 
</P>
<P>
	A key to San Francisco's hope for a balanced attack will be  
Hearst's health. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Kirby, who played the final three quarters Sunday against  
St. Louis in Hearst's place, took more practice snaps in his 
absence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm ready, but I think Garrison is going to be fine,'' Kirby  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers also are counting on a healthy lineup in the  
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Tight ends Mark Chmura and Tyrone Davis, receivers Robert Brooks  
and Corey Bradford and defenders Vonnie Holliday and Craig Newsome 
returned to practice this week and should play Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It hasn't been this way for a long time,'' Packers All-Pro  
receiver Antonio Freeman said. ``But the army's starting to 
reassemble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And that makes Packers quarterback Brett Favre confident.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think we can make a run at the Super Bowl,'' he said. ``With  
all our guys back, we're basically the same team that got there 
last year.''

<HEADLINE> Consumers Make First Euro Purchases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- It didn't take long for a thirsty  
German to put the world's newest money to work -- just a second 
after the euro became Europe's common currency, he used a credit 
card to buy a bottle of champagne. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the purchase early New Year's Day in Frankfurt  
cost 63.91 euros, about $74. 
</P>
<P>
	It will take three years for euro coins and bills to enter cash  
registers and purses. On paper, though, the euro came into force 
for financial services and markets with the start of 1999. Banks 
and trading houses slaved through the New Year's holiday weekend 
getting computer systems ready for the launch of euro trading on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The champagne corks will pop on Jan. 5 -- if everything has  
gone well,'' said Zbynek Sokolovsky, who supervised euro 
preparations at Dresdner Bank in Frankfurt. 
</P>
<P>
	He and most of the team working overtime wore blue sweatshirts  
emblazoned with the euro symbol -- a large ``C'' with two horizontal 
slashes through the middle. Blue balloons decorated Dresdner Bank 
headquarters where 80 workers hunched over computer terminals, 
guzzling mineral water and looking weary. 
</P>
<P>
	The key challenge was converting stock papers and bank accounts  
into euros. Preparations began in 1996, but final conversions could 
take place only after the euro's value was announced Thursday. One 
euro equals about $1.17. 
</P>
<P>
	As the European Union represents 20 percent of the world's  
economic output and 18 percent of world trade, the euro will be a 
powerful player in the world economy. Some economists predict it 
could rival the U.S. dollar as the international currency of 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 15 EU nations, 11 joined the common currency. Suspicious  
of its political implications, Britain, Denmark and Sweden decided 
to wait. Greece, which did not qualify for the new currency, vowed 
to join in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	To celebrate the euro, about 10,000 people gathered Friday  
evening outside European Central Bank headquarters in Frankfurt. 
The bank will set monetary policy for the new currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheer was in abundance, fueled in part by mulled wine on sale  
for 1.53 euros -- $1.79 -- though people paid in marks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something special,'' said reveler Manfred Lohr, who  
acknowledged a feeling of real change would probably only kick in 
when euros enter circulation. 
</P>
<P>
	In an early sign of the euro's potential power, Chinese  
officials said they may convert a proportion of their $145 billion 
in foreign exchange reserves into euros. Hong Kong may follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
	Until the bills and coins enter circulation, German stores are  
advertising products in marks and euros. Customers chose which 
currency to use, paying in euros with a credit card or check. 
</P>
<P>
	At a Hertie department store in Frankfurt, salesman Roland  
Bertalot said customers were approaching the new currency with 
caution. By noon Saturday, just two people had asked to pay in 
euros. 
</P>
<P>
	``They both said they wanted to see if it worked,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Golding Out of World Yacht Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- Britain's Mike Golding,  
front-runner in the Around Alone around-the-world yacht race, has 
pulled out of the second leg after hitting a sandbank, but could 
still compete in the next two stages. 
</P>
<P>
	Golding's yacht sustained major damage to its keel and  
structural damage to the hull after hitting the sandbank Friday 
night off the northernmost tip of the North Island, four miles off 
the coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Golding's ground crew and boat builder and told race organizers  
Sunday that the boat would be towed to Auckland and hauled from the 
water for detailed inspection and possible repairs. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is out of this leg, so no time in this leg counts for him  
under the race rules,'' Around Alone media spokesman Dan McConnell 
said Sunday. ``He can continue in the race if he wishes, although 
he now can't win the race overall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until the mishap, Golding, in his yacht, Team Group 4, had a  
lead of more than two days on Giovanni Soldini of Italy. He sailed 
into Auckland early Saturday to win the second leg. 
</P>
<P>
	Golding won the first leg from Charleston, S.C. to Cape Town,  
South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	After the sandbank mishap, water flooded the hull up to 18  
inches deep before Golding could stem its inflow. 
</P>
<P>
	McConnell said if the damaged yacht can be repaired, Golding  
could still sail the next leg to Punta Del Este in Uruguay, and the 
final leg back to Charleston. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other leading competitors also hit submerged objects on the  
New Zealand coast Saturday, but were able to make running repairs 
to their damaged rudders. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday morning fourth-place Marc Thiercelin of France  
reported hitting what he believed was a submerged container, which 
damaged his rudder. 
</P>
<P>
	``He heard a metallic clang when he hit it,'' McConnell said.  
``It has damaged his rudder and links and slowed him down a 
little.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Countrywoman Isabelle Autisier was sailing less than 10 minutes  
ahead of him when she reported hitting a whale. 
</P>
<P>
	Autissier, lying third until the whale strike, dropped behind  
Thiercelin and was last reported sailing down New Zealand's east 
coast to the finish in Auckland.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Eyes Defense Spending Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton proposed a six-year infusion  
of $100 billion in new Pentagon spending Saturday, his answer to 
criticism of the armed forces' readiness to satisfy expanded 
commitments abroad despite aging weaponry and falling recruitment. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal, which would end 1 1/2 decades of nearly flat defense  
spending, includes the largest military pay raise since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	From Capitol Hill came immediate cries that Clinton's plan was  
insufficient to reverse the military's deteriorating readiness. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our troops continue to execute complex and dangerous missions  
far from home with flawless precision, as we've just seen in the 
Persian Gulf,'' the president said in his weekly radio address. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our challenge is to retain the ability to do this as we carry  
out our entire defense strategy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's proposed $12-billion increase for the next fiscal year  
would combine $4 billion in new money and $8 billion made available 
from the Pentagon budget by lower-than-forecast inflation and fuel 
prices. It would mark the first time since 1991, the year of the 
Persian Gulf War, that Pentagon spending rose above the level of 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	It also would be the largest increase since President Reagan's  
Cold War buildup of the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Plotted over six years, the Clinton administration's proposal  
would commit $100 billion additional funds to shoring up the 
Pentagon. The president's Defense Department request for the budget 
year beginning Oct. 1 would bring total military spending to $268.2 
billion, a $10-billion increase over levels earlier planned for 
that fiscal year, administration officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Republican Sen. John Warner, incoming chairman of the Senate  
Armed Services Committee who has long been critical of Clinton's 
treatment of defense spending, noted the military's joint chiefs 
testified to Congress last fall that they needed sums as high as 
$17.5 billion per year to repair readiness alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Because Clinton's proposed numbers lump in a pay raise and other  
benefits, Warner said, ``It leaves very few funds for readiness and 
procurement and training expenses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Virginia Republican plans to convene a hearing Tuesday to  
assess the military's needs. ``I'm confident Congress, in the 
coming year, will top the president's figures and bring a total sum 
much nearer to what the chiefs identified last September,'' Warner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	For Clinton, the proposal represented a big political shift from  
his presidency's focus on domestic spending. He was responding to 
complaints by military leaders and Republicans about a 
deteriorating level of readiness in a military under strain from 
declining recruitment, aging equipment, expanding anti-terrorism 
commitments and increasing overseas campaigns from Bosnia to Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	The budget proposal, which also includes an increase in  
retirement benefits and a 4.4 percent military pay raise, the 
largest since 1982, ``will help us to do right by our troops by 
upgrading and replacing aging equipment, barracks and family 
housing,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new money also would pay for joint exercises, flight  
training, badly needed spare parts, recruiting and ``the next 
generation'' of ships, planes and weapons systems, Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Skeptical reaction to the Clinton broadcast came from Democrats  
too. Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Mo., ranking Democrat on the House 
National Security Committee, worried that Clinton's proposal would 
not ``be sufficient to take care of the needs of the troops plus 
modernize our forces.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, officials said Clinton's fiscal 2000 budget will  
seek a 12 percent, $105 million increase in food safety programs, 
most of it to upgrade Agriculture Department inspections at smaller 
meat and poultry processing plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Budget director Jack Lew said Clinton's budget blueprint, due to  
Congress in early February, would ``balance defense needs with an 
aggressive domestic agenda in the context of the president's 
overall policy to save the surplus until we fix Social Security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has not advanced a plan for overhauling Social Security,  
but his aides have been busy executing a public relations campaign 
of sanctioned news ``leaks'' about spending proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	The strategy, coming as the Senate weighs how to proceed with  
Clinton's impeachment in the Monica Lewinsky affair, has a double 
intent: To remind friendly and powerful interest groups that the 
president remains an ally and in control; and to show Americans a 
chief executive immersed in business, standing above congressional 
squabbling over whether he should remain in office. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also is putting an edge on the political weapon credited  
with helping him ride out the first revelations of the Lewinsky 
scandal last year: the annual State of the Union address. 
</P>
<P>
	The speech, scheduled for Jan. 19, will not only outline his  
ideas but also underscore his resolve to serve out the two years 
remaining in his term, aides said. 
</P>
<P>
	During the week, Clinton will preside at three separate White  
House events aimed at showcasing progress on his health, education 
and crime initiatives. On Friday, he speaks at the Detroit Economic 
Club on challenges to the booming domestic economy.

<HEADLINE> Deion Sanders' Return Not Enough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Deion Sanders was back doing all the things  
he does best for the Dallas Cowboys: rallying the fans, closing off 
one side of the field on defense and wreaking havoc on punt 
returns. 
</P>
<P>
	But against the Arizona Cardinals on Saturday, it wasn't enough.  
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys lost the wild-card game 20-7 despite having Sanders  
for the first time since Nov. 22. Dallas went 2-3 while the Pro 
Bowl cornerback and punt returner was sidelined with a sprained 
left big toe. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardinals quarterback Jake Plummer and punter Scott Player went  
out of their way to avoid Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really hoped that they would come after me more,'' Sanders  
said. ``It was a big game and you all know how I play in big 
games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer threw a short pass to Sanders' right side on the second  
play of the game, but didn't go back in that direction until the 
game was out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
	Player either punted high and short or to the side away from  
Sanders the first three times he was back to field punts. Player 
finally rolled the dice late in the fourth quarter and Sanders 
burned him for a 41-yard return that helped set up Dallas' only 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders made one other big play in the game, chasing down Adrian  
Murrell at the Dallas 3 on a 74-yard run early in the third 
quarter. It didn't help much, though, as the Cardinals scored on 
the next play to take a 17-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders, who led players from both teams in a post-game prayer  
at midfield, didn't play offense. The Cowboys could've used someone 
with his speed and game-breaking ability. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't look in a mirror and be happy with the way we played  
today,'' Sanders said. ``This team is not getting any younger. It's 
time for some guys to step up or step out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders was expected to return Saturday, but he built suspense  
by not joining his teammates for pre-game warmups and by remaining 
in the locker room when lineups were introduced. He wasn't on the 
field for the national anthem, either. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, with 4:13 left before kickoff, Sanders came jogging out of  
the tunnel with a slight limp. He worked his way between his 
teammates amid cheers from the fans, said a quick prayer on his 
knees against the bench, then climbed aboard a stationary bicycle. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the coin toss, he loosened up on the field and incited  
fans to holler more, then returned to the bicycle for kickoff. As 
the Cardinals huddled before their first offensive play, he twirled 
his left hand to stir the fans and danced around the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders was injured late in the first quarter of a Nov. 15 game  
in Arizona. He left in the second quarter and returned for the 
final two drives after the Cardinals made a furious comeback during 
his absence. 
</P>
<P>
	He started the next Sunday at home against the Seahawks, but  
reinjured the toe midway through the second quarter and did not 
return for the last five games of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite playing in little more than 10 games, Sanders was voted  
to the Pro Bowl for the seventh time in his career. And, for the 
second time, he was picked at both cornerback and punt returner. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders, who did not play baseball last summer to concentrate  
solely on football, was having one of the best years of his career 
before the injury despite breaking a rib in the preseason. 
</P>
<P>
	He led the NFL in punt return average at 15.6 yards and returned  
two for touchdowns. He also had five interceptions, his most since 
snaring six in 1994, with one going for a touchdown.

<HEADLINE> Boston Has Millennium Clearinghouse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- In a small office on the Boston University campus,  
the interests of religious zealots, UFO fans, survivalists and 
computer aficionados bracing for the Y2K computer bug intersect. 
</P>
<P>
	With less than a year to go until the arrival of 2000, the  
Center for Millennial Studies has emerged as an academic 
clearinghouse for people pondering how society will make the shift 
to the 21st century. Will Christ make a second coming? Will good 
triumph over evil? Will computer glitches shut down everything from 
airports to Wall Street? 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to be the place where, in the next few years and far  
beyond, anyone who wants information about what occurred will look 
in our computers, at our files,'' Richard Landes, the center's 
founder, said in Saturday's editions of The Boston Globe. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Landes, 49, a medieval history professor at BU,  
traveled to Jerusalem to spend New Year's Eve interviewing a group 
of fundamentalist Jews awaiting the arrival of the Messiah. He 
plans to also be in the holy city on Dec. 31, 1999, when thousands 
of pilgrims from all over the world are expected to come in 
anticipation of salvation, destruction or the arrival of celestial 
beings. 
</P>
<P>
	Religious zealots and mainstream believers alike attach great  
significance to the arrival of the 21st century, although they 
disagree on exactly what will happen. 
</P>
<P>
	Much attention has been given to the Y2K problem, the term  
coined to describe computers' inability to deal with dates after 
Dec. 31, 1999. However, Landes and his colleagues are tracking some 
more eccentric folks as well. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, there is a group in Indonesia hunting out witches  
to prevent them from doing any millennial mischief. Another in the 
American West believe Y2K is an omen that the Earth is nearing its 
end, with destruction to come at the hands of aliens sent by God to 
punish humanity for ruining the environment. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the center's time is spent on more concrete matters,  
however. 
</P>
<P>
	In particular, Landes says he hopes his research will persuade  
municipalities, businesses and individuals to take the Y2K problem 
even more seriously than many already do. And he says the center's 
monitoring of religious organizations could serve as an early 
warning system against violence, anti-Semitism, and other negative 
responses he expects from people who will disappointed when their 
expectations aren't realized. 
</P>
<P>
	``Disappointment is the big black box in millennium studies,''  
says Landes, who bases this assessment on his study of previous 
millennial movements. ``If you think it's your movement, and God is 
on your side, the letdown could be enormous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the Rev. Jerry Falwell has produced a video in  
which he says that ``Y2K may be God's instrument to shake this 
nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to maintaining a site on the World Wide Web, the  
center keeps newspaper clippings, videotapes, pamphlets and other 
literature produced by millennium junkies. It also publishes a 
quarterly newsletter, hosts a monthly discussion group, runs 
periodic educational programs and sponsors an annual conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Landes figures his operation will thrive at least two more  
years, since the new millennium technically begins Jan. 1, 2001. 
And the center is already planning its conference for 2002. The 
tentative title: ``Disappointed Millennialism.''

<HEADLINE> Germany's Gerg Win Super-G </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARIBOR, Slovenia (AP) -- After Germany's Hilde Gerg stole the  
show from the Austrians in the World Cup super-G today, Anita 
Wachter responded in the giant slalom, winning by nearly a second. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the Austrian veteran's second straight victory in the  
event. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerg's victory in the super-G proved the Olympic slalom champion  
is capable of winning in all four events. Just two weeks ago, the 
23-year-old skier clinched her first career downhill in Veysonnaz, 
Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	``A podium is a great present for me,'' Gerg said.  
</P>
<P>
	Compatriot Martina Ertl finished just .13 seconds behind her for  
second place. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexandra Meissnitzer, who has already won five races this  
season, finished 1.23 seconds off the pace, placing ninth. She was 
third in the giant slalom, held just hours after the super-G. 
</P>
<P>
	The 25-year-old Austrian held on to her lead in both the super-G  
and overall World Cup standings, but Ertl narrowed the gap. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerg fought her way down the icy and bumpy super-G course,  
finishing in a time of 1 minute, 30.17 seconds. The result lifted 
her to third place in the super-G standings. 
</P>
<P>
	A layer of fog on the bottom portion of the course made  
conditions even more difficult, and several skiers, including 
Austria's Renate Goetschl, took bad spills. 
</P>
<P>
	``The piste was quite flat. Visibility was good in the upper and  
middle portion but not the bottom,'' said Gerg. ``I am happy with 
my skiing and I hope to be a success in the giant slalom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the giant slalom, Gerg finished fifth.  
</P>
<P>
	Austria's Michaela Dorfmeister claimed third position the  
super-G in 1:30.46. Kathleen Monahan of the United States was the 
top North American, finishing 12th in 1:31.95. 
</P>
<P>
	The super-G was originally scheduled for Friday but was  
postponed by a day because of thick fog, which also delayed the 
race several times today. 
</P>
<P>
	In the giant slalom, Wachter put in a phenomenal second run,  
moving up from second place. She finished the race in 2:15.66, 
followed by Switzerland's Sonja Nef.

<HEADLINE> Highest of Stakes in Clinton Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Redemption or repudiation. Political rise or  
fall. A fresh start or a lost opportunity. For Bill Clinton and the 
other key figures in the Senate impeachment trial, the choices that 
each makes carry the highest of stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	The president, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and the  
Republican Party all have much to gain or lose in the end game of 
an impeachment saga played out in the run-up to pivotal elections 
in 2000. Think of it as a fateful fork in the road. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a crossroads for a whole lot of people. It's uncharted  
territory. And it is a dangerous situation for everyone, because 
they may screw up, and people will remember it for a long time,'' 
said James Thurber, an American University professor who studies 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	With the president already stained by impeachment, he and his  
supporters want a quick end to the Senate trial. If necessary, his 
lawyers are prepared to fight for acquittal, no holds barred, and 
are readying an elaborate defense that could stretch as long as six 
months if the case goes to a full trial. 
</P>
<P>
	But not even his most aggressive lawyer, David Kendall, wants to  
carry it that far. In rare unanimity, the Clinton team knows a 
censure deal that would end a full year of scandal is the best 
option -- the only one that would give the president a chance to 
build modest domestic or foreign policy achievements in his final 
24 months in office. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first paragraph of his biographical entry will be William  
Jefferson Clinton, 42nd president, who was impeached by the House 
of Representatives ..., and then you can go on and write about 
other accomplishments. All he can do now is try to fill in that 
second part,'' said Stephen Hess, of the Brookings Institution 
think tank in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The president faces many tough choices in escaping a trial that  
could cost him his office. 
</P>
<P>
	He may have to admit making false or inaccurate statements. And  
he may have to set aside bitter animosity with Independent Counsel 
Kenneth Starr and reach out for a three-way deal that shields him 
from future prosecution. The prosecutor has not ruled out such a 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Some who know Clinton worry that the lawyer in him may be  
tempted to forgo a painful censure in favor of a trial in which he 
would seek acquittal and attack the legitimacy of the House 
impeachment as a way of altering his place in history. It's a 
choice his supporters believe is fraught with danger. 
</P>
<P>
	``What the president should want is public accountability for  
his conduct without being removed from office, because only that 
way can there be complete closure both personally, politically and 
historically,'' former White House special counsel Lanny Davis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If, for example, there were no censure resulting from the  
Senate trial after an acquittal, I believe there would be ongoing 
recrimination and divisiveness among many people on both sides of 
the aisle,'' Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the president is at the mercy of the main traffic cop in  
this drama. As the Senate leader, Lott can become through his 
handling of the trial the undisputed leader of congressional 
Republicans after four years in the shadow of Newt Gingrich. 
</P>
<P>
	``Trent Lott is a fellow who hasn't lived up to his potential.  
He has not created a record as a strong, forceful and creative 
leader, and this is a special opportunity for him,'' Hess said. 
``If he can produce a fair and expeditious resolution to this, I 
think he has a new lease on life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott made a bold move in that direction last week by proposing  
an abbreviated start to the trial, to be followed by a vote 
requiring two-thirds of the senators' approval before proceeding 
with a full airing of evidence. If the preliminary vote failed, 
Lott would allow an alternate vote on censure, something he 
previously opposed. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lott must keep control of a group to which he frequently  
capitulates, the GOP conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, the Republican Party may face the biggest risks. Its  
conservative wing, well represented among the 13 lawmakers the 
House appointed as prosecutors for the trial, wants a full-blown 
case made to remove Clinton from office. The public overwhelmingly 
does not. 
</P>
<P>
	The danger, according to GOP pollsters and political  
consultants, is that Republicans are better known for vitriolic 
opposition to the still-popular Clinton than for the tax-slashing, 
government cutting agenda that brought them to power. That reality 
cost Republicans in the 1998 election and may hurt them again in 
the next if it is not reversed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is absolutely time for them to move to the middle and try  
to govern in the way they did in 1996 when they started legislating 
with a balanced budget, welfare reform and the clean water act,'' 
Thurber said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott and incoming House Speaker Dennis Hastert both identify  
saving Social Security as a top priority and can elevate their 
status by getting the unpopular GOP Congress back to a populist 
agenda. So, too, can Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``There may be some mutual self-interest for all of them to  
focus on a short and concise agenda and possibly get something 
done,'' Hess said. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the American public, a difficult awakening may come years  
after the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been an incredible declination of the presidency, of  
political power, of the threshold for impeachment, and it is going 
to be a long while before the political system recovers from 
this,'' said retired professor Stanley Kutler,of the University of 
Wisconsin, who studied the demise of Richard Nixon's presidency.

<HEADLINE> Snow, Ice Shut Down Midwest Travel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A huge snowstorm blew across the Midwest on Saturday with  
whiteout conditions and drifts up to 8 feet high, canceling 
hundreds of airline flights, forcing motorists off roads and 
keeping mail deliverers from their appointed rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew it was going to be here one way or another,'' said  
snowplow driver Kerry Morris in Des Moines, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	By Saturday afternoon, the storm had dumped 17 inches at  
Chicago's Midway Airport, it was 13 inches deep in western 
Indiana's Parke County, and 10 inches of new snow had fallen in 
southwestern Ohio and Eldora, Iowa. Up to 15 inches was forecast in 
Missouri, and two feet was likely at Marquette, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	Wind gusting to 40 mph created blizzard conditions and northern  
Indiana's LaGrange County pulled its plows off the roads because 
snow was drifting 5 to 8 feet deep. 
</P>
<P>
	Icy roads contributed to more than a half-doze deaths throughout  
the region. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nasty. I wouldn't want to have to go out,'' Vickie Berkey  
said from her home near Angola, Ind. ``There's a drift in front of 
the garage and it just keeps getting bigger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 50 of Indiana's counties and cities declared snow  
emergencies, banning unnecessary travel; Indiana Gov. Frank 
O'Bannon declared a less-restrictive statewide snow emergency. 
</P>
<P>
	``The roads are impassable,'' said Pam Bright of the Indiana  
Emergency Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The Postal Service even quit delivering mail in the Indianapolis  
area. Rain, slush and freezing temperatures made it too dangerous 
for carriers to walk their routes, said Postmaster Mike Lamborne. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Chicagoans said the storm brought back memories of the  
``Blizzard of '79,'' which dumped about 19 inches of snow on the 
city and other parts of Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Richard M. Daley said more than 700 pieces of  
snow-fighting equipment would be deployed. The city's delay in 
plowing away the 1979 snowfall was blamed for Jane Byrne's upset 
victory over incumbent Mayor Michael Bilandic in the Democratic 
primary. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of travelers found themselves without a ride as  
hundreds of flights through major Midwest airports were called off. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been crazy, extremely hectic, madness,'' said Sara  
Shillito, a worker at a coffee shop in Ohio's Port Columbus 
International Airport, where one of the two runways was shut down. 
``Lots and lots of people, waiting around, walking around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	TWA canceled nearly 400 morning flights at St. Louis, its main  
hub. At Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, American canceled 
all flights through midnight Saturday and United shut down 
everything after midafternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	United spokesman Matt Triaca said anyone planning to fly out of  
O'Hare should wait until Monday -- or Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	That set up more delays and cancellations elsewhere across the  
country, including Denver and New York City's three major airports. 
Northwest Airlines shut down about 150 flights systemwide and Delta 
canceled dozens of flights to the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit's Metropolitan Airport planned to stay open through the  
storm, said spokesman Mike Conway. Crews shut down one of the three 
runways at a time to clear away snow, while thousands of travelers 
inside the terminal scrambled to rebook canceled flights. 
</P>
<P>
	Even hardy Minnesotans were grounded by the weather. The  
University of Minnesota basketball team's game at Purdue was called 
off because of the weather at West Lafayette, Ind., and the team 
was stuck at a hotel in Indianapolis because the city's airport 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
	All trips out of the Greyhound Bus station in Milwaukee were  
canceled Saturday. One of the stranded travelers was 20-year-old 
Frank Ramos, who had ridden a bus from New York City and was trying 
to get to Appleton, Wis., 100 miles north of Milwaukee, to give his 
girlfriend an engagement ring and meet her parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm trying to have a good attitude,'' Ramos said. ``I don't  
know when I'm going to get there. If I have to go walking I 
probably will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blizzard conditions resulted in two car pileups on Wisconsin  
highways Saturday, killing one person. A 10-year-old Iowa boy was 
killed Friday when he sledded in front of a truck. Two people were 
killed in car accidents in Missouri on Friday. Nebraska and 
Arkansas each had two storm-related traffic deaths Friday. Illinois 
had one storm-related death. 
</P>
<P>
	Freezing rain along the southern edge of the storm pulled down  
power lines in Arkansas and some 75,000 customers were in the dark 
Saturday, down from more than 100,000 the night before. Utilities 
said more than 11,000 customers lost power during the morning in 
northern Illinois, with widespread outages in other parts of the 
state, and some 3,000 were blacked out in Indiana.

<HEADLINE> Martin vs. Marcus in Fiesta Bowl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Tee Martin knew the game plan from the  
start. Wait for Peyton Manning to break nearly every single record 
in the history of passing, then he'd get a chance to be Tennessee's 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	Worked out well, too.  
</P>
<P>
	Marcus Outzen knew the game plan when he signed at Florida  
State. Wait until the next century for Chris Weinke to leave, then 
he'd get a shot to run the Seminoles' offense. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinke, though, injured his neck against Virginia last month and  
Outzen was calling signals a few minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
	Worked out well for Outzen, too.  
</P>
<P>
	On Monday night in the Fiesta Bowl, it's No. 1 Tennessee (12-0)  
vs. No. 2 Florida State (11-1) in the national championship 
deciding game. 
</P>
<P>
	If the matchup seemed improbable at the start of the season,  
what were the odds of a quarterback matchup featuring Martin vs. 
Marcus? Astronomical, for sure. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just amazing I'm in this position,'' said Outzen, who  
considered transferring after last season but was talked into 
staying by coach Bobby Bowden. ``It's beyond my wildest dreams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The same could be said for Tennessee, which couldn't win a  
national championship -- or beat Florida -- with Manning, but is one 
victory away from its first national title since 1951 with Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never came into the season thinking about replacing  
Peyton,'' Martin said. ``We planned to come into the season and win 
games. We knew we could do it if we focused as a team. This is not 
surprising to us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is to just about everyone else.  
</P>
<P>
	Martin, a 6-foot-3, 215-pound junior from Mobile, Ala., threw 16  
passes his first two years at Tennessee. Manning threw for 11,201 
yards before moving on to the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	But Martin stepped right up and led the Vols to an unlikely  
perfect regular-season, which included narrow wins over Syracuse, 
Florida and Arkansas, an NCAA record-setting effort against South 
Carolina and a comeback 24-14 win over Mississippi State in the SEC 
title game. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I know is this kid hasn't lost,'' Tennessee coach Phillip  
Fulmer said. ``He has had a great year and has been a phenomenal 
leader for our team in a very quiet way. We wouldn't be here if it 
wasn't for Tee Martin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Martin handled the pressure of replacing Manning calmly,  
perhaps it was because he learned at an early age how to deal with 
stressful situations. He witnessed three murders, and 12 of his 
friends have died in the past three years, either by accident or 
illness or as crime victims. 
</P>
<P>
	He also wanted to make the most of his chance. Ten starters from  
last year's 11-2 team had to be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody who was behind those guys wanted to show what we  
could do,'' Martin said, ``because it was like we didn't exist at 
the university for a couple of years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And when players began working out last summer, Martin knew this  
team would be different; it would be a team, not just Manning's 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody felt they mattered, that they made a difference,  
that they played a big part in the team's success,'' Martin said. 
``I didn't want to come in and have the weight on my shoulders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it was there, mostly because his teammates trusted him to  
carry the load. 
</P>
<P>
	``He leaves everything he has out there on the field, and it's  
great to have a quarterback like that,'' wide receiver Peerless 
Price said. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin threw for 2,164 yards and 19 touchdowns, with only six  
interceptions, and ran for 287 yards and seven TDs. Against South 
Carolina, he set three NCAA records by hitting 23 of 24 passes for 
315 yards and four touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	Former offensive coordinator David Cutcliffe, who left to coach  
Mississippi after the SEC title game, retooled the offense to take 
advantage of Martin's running ability. But after tailback Jamal 
Lewis' season-ending knee injury against Auburn, it became crucial 
for Martin to become a more consistent passer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had confidence in my ability, but my breakout game was  
Georgia,'' said Martin, who threw for 156 yards and two touchdowns 
in a 22-3 win over the Bulldogs in the Vols first game without 
Lewis. ``I just needed to go out and show I could do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outzen is eager to show he can do it against the Volunteers,  
having come through against the Gators in only his second start. 
The 6-2, 220-pound sophomore from Fort Walton Beach, Fla., was 13 
of 22 for 167 yards and one TD in the 23-12 win over Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden believes Outzen will be just fine at gametime.  
</P>
<P>
	``This could not be any bigger to him than Florida,'' Bowden  
said. ``Florida is our big game every year, Florida and Miami. 
Whoever wins that game goes to play for the national championship. 
Florida has knocked us out of two national championships the last 
two years, Miami knocked us out of about four. So when you play in 
that ballgame and won in that ballgame, you ain't afraid of nobody 
else. 
</P>
<P>
	``They might beat you, but you ain't afraid of 'em.''  
</P>
<P>
	When Outzen and his father went to Bowden, the coach told the  
quarterback to go through spring practice and see what happens. 
Expected starter Dan Kendra got hurt in practice, Weinke became the 
starter and Outzen and freshman Jared Jones the backups. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the half ended against Virginia, Weinke went out with a  
neck injury and Outzen became the starter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think in the spring he saw he could compete,'' Bowden said,  
``so he stayed with it, thank goodness. So anyway, here he is now 
and who would have ever predicted this?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Certainly not Outzen.  
</P>
<P>
	``I knew coming to Florida State I would be a backup and the  
most I could ask was just some mopup duty,'' he said. ``A quarter 
here or there because at Florida State we get on top of people and 
we let a lot of people play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both quarterbacks will face tough defenses. The Seminoles are  
tops in the nation, allowing 214.8 yards per game, while the Vols 
are 17th at 303 yards per game. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have a basic defense and they have some good guys who get  
the job done,'' Martin said. ``We've watched them for a few weeks 
and it's not like we had to figure out a whole lot of complicated 
stuff. It's just that it's going to be a physical game and 
execution is all we're focusing on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outzen says the Vols' defense has a familiar look. ``They remind  
me a lot of our defense -- they're fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And disruptive.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's going to be a deal of which quarterback takes  
care of the football best,'' Martin said. ``There are good defenses 
on the field and you don't want to make a lot of mistakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, Martin and Outzen haven't.

<HEADLINE> Travolta Collects Wedding Rings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- John Travolta and Kelly Preston's marriage has  
survived a lot of lost jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
	``I lose so many wedding rings that every time I see her it's a  
new one,'' Travolta says in the January issue of Harper's Bazaar. 
</P>
<P>
	But Preston isn't threatened by his absentmindedness.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know he's not fooling around or anything,'' she said. ``It's  
just that he goes to the spa and loses them. He gets in the car and 
loses them. He loses them on the set, or at dinners. Sometimes we 
find them again. He has a box of them by the bed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Travolta's many credits range from ``Saturday Night Fever'' to  
``Pulp Fiction'' and ``Primary Colors.'' His latest film is ``A 
Civil Action.'' Preston's credits include ``Twins,'' ``Jerry 
Maguire'' and ``Addicted to Love.'' Her latest movie is ''Jack 
Frost.''

	Time Gets Osama bin Laden Admission  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Exiled Saudi billionaire Osama bin Laden appears  
to admit in a Time magazine interview that he instigated the 
terrorist bombing of two U.S. embassies in Africa. ``If the 
instigation for jihad (holy war) against the Jews and the

<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Midwest was hit with a huge snowstorm today  
as whiteout conditions caused drifts up to 8 feet high, canceled 
hundreds of airline flights, forced motorists off roads and kept 
mail deliverers from their appointed rounds. By midday, snow was 13 
inches deep in western Indiana's Parke County, and 10 inches of new 
snow had fallen in southwestern Ohio and Eldora, Iowa. Up to 15 
inches was forecast in Missouri, and two feet was likely at 
Marquette, Mich.

<HEADLINE> Florida Hopes To Stop McNabb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- After 12 seasons coaching under Steve Spurrier, Bob  
Sanders is now serving as No. 7 Florida's defensive coordinator for 
the Orange Bowl against 18th-ranked Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
	His first task: Figure out how to stop Donovan McNabb.  
</P>
<P>
	``He is in a class of his own,'' said Sanders, who tonight steps  
into the role vacated when Bob Stoops was hired as Oklahoma's head 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``(McNabb) throws well, scrambles well and stresses the  
defense,'' he continued. ``And he can run the option. They have a 
lot of sets and Donovan is extremely smart. If you take his 
athletic ability away from him, he still keeps the play alive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For all the praise heaped upon Florida's ``Fun `n' Gun''  
offense, the Gators may have met their equal in Syracuse's varied 
attack. It should make for a matchup high on entertainment value, 
even if it has no bearing on the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Syracuse (8-3) averaged 42.5 points, third-best in the nation,  
and 430 yards per game during the regular season. Florida (9-2) 
averaged 31.7 points and 461.9 yards -- a down year by standards 
established since Spurrier took over nine years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Did somebody say shootout?  
</P>
<P>
	``Could be,'' Syracuse safety Jason Poles said. ``Both teams  
have plenty of firepower on offense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNabb, Syracuse's career leader in total offense, allows the  
Orangemen to throw almost anything at an opponent. He is just as 
apt to run the option, drop back to pass or suddenly take off on a 
quarterback draw out of shotgun formation. 
</P>
<P>
	He threw for 2,134 yards and 22 touchdowns this season and  
rushed for 438 yards and eight TDs, accounting for 54 percent of 
Syracuse's offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``McNabb's the best quarterback we've played all season,''  
Florida safety Teako Brown said. ``You'll see guys look like 
they'll get a sack on him, then all of a sudden it's an 80-yard 
touchdown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Florida finds itself in flux defensively, with three key players  
missing in addition to Stoops' departure. Tackle Ed Chester is out 
with a knee injury and end Tim Beauchamp and backup cornerback Dock 
Pollard were suspended for breaking university rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know we're going to have to work for it,'' cornerback Tony  
George said. ``We don't put a lot of fear in other teams' hearts. 
People don't fear the Gators anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That can't be said about the Florida offense, which still has  
quick-strike ability. The Gators scored 26 of their 44 touchdowns 
in two minutes or less, and their average TD drive was just 1:43. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're in more formations than anybody we've ever played,''  
Syracuse coach Paul Pasqualoni said. ``They can go with four 
wideouts, they can go five wideouts. Then they'll go with two 
wideouts and two tight ends. It can wear you out just trying to 
keep track of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback Doug Johnson, who regained his starting job after  
Jesse Palmer broke a collarbone against LSU, threw for 2,346 yards 
and 19 TDs this season. Palmer also is available after taking about 
half the snaps in practice this week, but Spurrier was coy about 
his playing time. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Doug gets hurt, Jesse goes in,'' Spurrier said. ``If Doug  
throws about seven interceptions in the first half, Jesse goes 
in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Syracuse, which visits every other year to play Big East rival  
Miami, actually is more familiar with the venue. The Orange Bowl is 
the Gators' first visit to South Florida in more than a decade, 
even though their Gainesville campus is only about 330 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	But any ``home'' advantage for the Orangemen is likely to be  
negated with some two-thirds of the 70,000 in attendance cheering 
for Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't matter where we play,'' Syracuse defensive end Marc  
Pilon said. ``Once you start scoring, you can quiet a crowd. I hope 
we can.''

<HEADLINE> Coach Bowden Generates Loyalty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Distraught over the death of Florida State  
lineman Pablo Lopez in a shooting near campus in 1986, quarterbacks 
coach Mark Richt sought out head coach Bobby Bowden. 
</P>
<P>
	``I walked right into his office and he ministered to me the day  
or two after that happened, talking about eternal life, eternal 
things, not just winning football games,'' Richt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Called ``St. Bobby'' by some, the 69-year-old coach's religious  
devotion is part and parcel of a persona that has engendered 
intense loyalty to and from his staff and players. 
</P>
<P>
	``That enables us to get through bad times,'' said Bowden, a  
Southern Baptist. ``We realize there are things more important than 
football. In fact there's quite a few things. My family is more 
important than football and my religion is more important than 
either one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden has had to endure a lot this season in guiding the  
second-ranked Seminoles (11-1) to the Fiesta Bowl on Monday for a 
matchup against No. 1 Tennessee (12-0) for the national 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of those bad times have included son Terry's resignation  
under pressure as Auburn's coach, an upset loss to North Carolina 
State and injuries that sidelined Florida State's top two 
quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	After Terry's mid-season resignation, Bowden gathered his  
assistants and told them how much he appreciated their loyalty 
toward him, said Richt, now also Florida State's offensive 
coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just us giving back what he's given to us,'' Richt said.  
``He's earned every ounce of loyalty that we've given him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That loyalty has enabled Bowden to assemble a staff with  
longevity almost unheard of in college football. It includes Richt 
with 13 seasons, defensive coordinator Mickey Andrews with 15, 
assistant head coach Chuck Amato with 17, running backs coach Billy 
Sexton with 23 and defensive coach Jim Gladden with 24. 
</P>
<P>
	``He gives you a job, a responsibility, he doesn't tell you how  
to do it,'' Andrews said. ``When you goof up, he's there to help 
you, but he doesn't micro-manage you and tell you how to do your 
job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His assistants have helped Bowden and Florida State win at least  
10 games for 12 years in a row and achieve a final ranking no lower 
than fourth for 11 straight years, a record unmatched in college 
football. 
</P>
<P>
	In 23 years at Florida State, Bowden is 219-52-4. Lifetime,  
including four years at Samford and six at West Virginia, Bowden is 
292-84-4. His victory total is fifth-best among Division I-A 
coaches. The only active coach who has more wins is Penn State's 
Joe Paterno with 306. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden has one national championship in 1993. That he hasn't had  
more doesn't bother him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like to win it and I'm disappointed when we don't, but I  
came from the other side of the tracks so I'm just happy to be 
here,'' Bowden said. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, the offense-minded Bowden has delegated  
play-calling to Richt, who has come under fire from some fans for 
being too conservative. The ever-loyal Bowden defends his 
assistant. 
</P>
<P>
	``He does exactly what I want him to do,'' Bowden said.  
``Sometimes he looks conservative because I told him to be 
conservative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden, who gained a reputation as a riverboat gambler in his  
early years at Florida State, seldom needs to use trick plays or 
take chances now that he has better players. 
</P>
<P>
	That doesn't mean he won't use them.  
</P>
<P>
	``I do it for momentum,'' Bowden said. ``Tell our coaches if  
they don't have 'em in there I'm going to suck my thumb. If you 
don't want me to suck my thumb, get me some barnyard plays in, 
reverses and stuff like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden pulled out a gimmick in the final regular-season game  
against Florida. The Seminoles were clinging to a 13-12 lead in the 
fourth quarter when an apparent 48-yard touchdown run by Travis 
Minor was called back because of a holding penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seminoles scored on the next play when wide receiver Peter  
Warrick threw a 46-yard pass off a reverse and took a 20-12 lead. 
Florida State added a field goal to win 23-12. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coach Bowden called the play,'' Richt said. ``He didn't say  
`L-48-Z reverse pass.' He just said `I want that reverse pass with 
Pete.' That's where we've got to get the right personnel group in 
the game and the right formation and the right call.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden's success starts with recruiting, a task many coaches  
dread but one he embraces with the same bubbly enthusiasm and charm 
that makes him a favorite on the speaking circuit and among the 
media. 
</P>
<P>
	All-American defensive lineman Corey Simon said Bowden is the  
same whether the cameras are on or off. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's like a father figure to us,'' Simon said. ``He's not so  
big that you can't sit down and talk to him as a father or as a 
coach.''

<HEADLINE> Celebrex Ruling Benefits Merck </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Monsanto will be first to sell a revolutionary  
type of arthritis medication, but its battle with Merck &AMP; Co. in 
the high stakes painkiller drug wars is far from over. 
</P>
<P>
	Celebrex, made by Monsanto's Searle pharmaceutical unit, on  
Thursday became the first ``cox-2'' inhibitor to win Food and Drug 
Administration approval. The drugs have been touted as possibly the 
next wonder pills because of their promise to be easier on 
patients' stomachs than existing medications. 
</P>
<P>
	But Monsanto was dealt a blow when the FDA declared there is no  
proof that Celebrex actually is safer for patients' stomachs than 
older painkillers. As a result, when Celebrex hits retail outlets 
next month it must bear the same warning about side effects as many 
of its older competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Merck, which is awaiting FDA approval for its Vioxx drug,  
another cox-2 pill, hopes to get a less stern warning label. One 
reason Merck was behind Monsanto in seeking federal approval is 
because it was waiting for the results of some longer term studies. 
</P>
<P>
	The warning label could be a key driver of physician use, and  
whether either drug reaches the $1 billion in annual sales that 
some Wall Street analysts had forecast. 
</P>
<P>
	Merck also hopes to gain another advantage by getting approval  
for Vioxx to be taken only once a day for arthritis users. The 
recommended dose of Celebrex is once or twice a day for 
osteoarthritis, and twice a day for rheumatoid arthritis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Merck may be able to use Monsanto's experience to get a better  
label,'' said Sergio Traversa, an analyst with Mehta Partners in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	After the FDA ruling Thursday, shares of Monsanto rose $1.19 to  
$47.50. Pfizer, which will be co-marketing Celebrex, fell $1.12 to 
$125. Merck shares dropped $1.31 to $147.50. 
</P>
<P>
	Merck spokesman John Bloomfield refused to speculate whether the  
company has enough research results to get a better warning label 
than Monsanto. Merck is working closely with the FDA to demonstrate 
that Vioxx has safety advantages over existing drugs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are pretty darn happy,'' said Scarlett Lee Foster, a  
Monsanto spokeswoman. ``I think we got a label we can use...to have 
the drug widely accepted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Monsanto is continuing to study Celebrex in hopes of providing  
FDA with enough evidence to advertise Celebrex as a safer 
painkiller. 
</P>
<P>
	Millions of people now depend on aspirin, ibuprofen, and a host  
of other pills called ``non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,'' or 
NSAIDs for arthritis and other pains. NSAIDS can cause ulcers, 
stomach bleeding and other gastrointestinal side effects, and are 
blamed for causing 107,000 Americans to be hospitalized every year, 
and for killing 16,500. 
</P>
<P>
	Monsanto said it will price Celebrex comparably to other  
prescription strength painkillers that cost about $2.40 a day. With 
the traditional safety warnings on Celebrex, Monsanto would have 
faced considerable difficulty convincing insurers to pay any more. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the warning label issue, the government approval of  
Celebrex is a boost for Monsanto, which last summer had to drop 
plans to merge with American Home Products, maker of Robitussin 
cough syrup and Advil pain reliever. The $33.6 billion marriage 
would have been the biggest merger ever in the pharmaceutical 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Monsanto, based in St. Louis, makes the artificial sweetener  
Nutrasweet and is also heavily involved in genetic research for 
agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	``This adds credibility to their pipeline,'' said Sano Shimda,  
president of BioScience Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	And the FDA approval is a boost for Pfizer, who some analysts  
feared would grow too dependent on its anti-impotence drug Viagra 
to spur sales growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Merck knows that being first to market with a new class of drugs  
is no guarantee of long-term success. Merck held the lead in 
cholesterol lowering drugs with its Zocor drug, but Warner Lambert 
in the last two years has taken the market lead with its Lipitor 
pill.

<HEADLINE> Cowboys Can't Overcome Mistakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- The Dallas Cowboys played in January the  
same way they played most of December. That's not a good thing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys, who hoped they had turned things around with an  
impressive first half in their season finale, gave their worst 
playoff performance since 1991 in a 20-7 loss Saturday to the 
Arizona Cardinals in a wild-card game. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the problems were on offense, just as they had been in  
the last month when Dallas lost twice, barely beat a bad 
Philadelphia team at home then looked good when the starters played 
the last game against Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys hoped their success against the Redskins would carry  
over into the playoffs. Instead, they retreated to their woeful 
ways. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looked similar to the mistakes we made in December and you  
can't allow that to happen, you can't be that kind of offense,'' 
coach Chan Gailey said. 
</P>
<P>
	It all began with Troy Aikman, who had trouble finding open  
receivers and often didn't complete passes when they were. Some of 
the mistakes were his, but there also were plenty of drops. The 
line was plenty to blame, too, as it couldn't hold off a Cardinals 
defense it had dominated twice before this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``From an offensive standpoint I think you could place blame and  
criticism at all positions,'' said Aikman, who was 22 of 49 for 191 
yards and a late touchdown. He was sacked four times, after taking 
nine all season, and threw three interceptions, compared to five in 
10 regular-season games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just didn't go out and execute the way we're capable of. We  
couldn't seem to get anything going. And when we did, we failed to 
convert to keep drives going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas had no trouble moving the ball in the first two meetings,  
beating Arizona 38-10 in the season opener and taking a 28-0 lead 
before holding on for a 35-28 victory Nov. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, Dallas went more than 56 minutes before scoring.  
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys had several other chances, though, with Richie  
Cunningham missing a 36-yard field goal in the first quarter and 
Emmitt Smith getting stopped on fourth-and-1 from the Cardinals 7 
midway through the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas was down just 7-0 at the time, then an Arizona field goal  
just before halftime made it 10-0. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt fine about where we were at halftime,'' Gailey said.  
``I really thought that we'd go out and play well and I told them 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But by the time the Cowboys got the ball in the third quarter,  
they were down 17-0 and were forced to try throwing their way back 
into the game and Aikman just wasn't able to do it. 
</P>
<P>
	``You get to a point where it no longer matters if you complete  
a 4-yard pass,'' Aikman said. ``Would I say I was pressing early? 
No. As we got into late in the third quarter and the fourth, yes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas reached the Arizona 20 midway through the fourth quarter,  
but turned the ball over on downs. A big punt return by Deion 
Sanders set up a 6-yard touchdown pass to Billy Davis with 3:33 
left, but it was too late. 
</P>
<P>
	``On offense you've got to have cohesiveness and we never had  
it,'' guard Nate Newton said. ``If you don't push them over the 
edge, they get their confidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was surprising to see so much inconsistency from a veteran  
team led by several guys who own three Super Bowl rings. It was 
just as surprising that a team playing its first postseason game 
since 1982 had so much poise. 
</P>
<P>
	Aikman said one thing had nothing to do with the other.  
</P>
<P>
	``Not to take anything away from Arizona,'' he said, ``but if we  
had played that way against a lot of other teams we would've 
lost.''

officially file his candidacy for president on Monday. Smith, a 
conservative who has made the rounds in Iowa and his home state of 
New Hampshire to gauge support for his candidacy, said he would be 
the first to file with the Federal Election Commission, though 
several others have established exploratory committees.

	Bin Laden Terrorist Link Exposed  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Suspected terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden  
appears to admit he instigated the bombing of two U.S. embassies in 
Africa, a Time magazine interview reports. The interview, conducted 
at bin Laden's secret encampment in Afghanistan on Dec. 22, seems 
the closest the exiled Saudi billionaire has come to admitting a 
role in the deadly attacks. ``Our job is to instigate, and by the 
grace of God, we did that, and certain people responded to this 
instigation,'' bin Laden says in the Jan. 11 issue of Time 
magazine.

clinching the governorship, former professional wrestler and Reform 
Party candidate Jesse Ventura moved closer to officially taking 
office today by beginning his inaugural festivities. Though the 
official swearing is Monday, about 100 Ventura friends and

	Midwest Nailed by Brutal Snowstorm

<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Midwest was hit with a huge snowstorm today  
as whiteout conditions caused drifts up to 8 feet high, canceled 
hundreds of airline flights, forced motorists off roads and kept 
mail deliverers from their appointed rounds. By midday, snow was 13 
inches deep in western Indiana's Parke County, and 10 inches of new 
snow had fallen in southwestern Ohio and Eldora, Iowa. Up to 15 
inches was forecast in Missouri, and two feet was likely at 
Marquette, Mich.

billion in new spending, his answer to criticism of the armed 
forces' readiness to satisfy expanded commitments abroad despite

<HEADLINE> Travolta Collects Wedding Rings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- John Travolta and Kelly Preston's marriage has  
survived a lot of lost jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
	``I lose so many wedding rings that every time I see her it's a  
new one,'' Travolta says in the January issue of Harper's Bazaar. 
</P>
<P>
	But Preston isn't threatened by his absentmindedness.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know he's not fooling around or anything,'' she said. ``It's  
just that he goes to the spa and loses them. He gets in the car and 
loses them. He loses them on the set, or at dinners. Sometimes we 
find them again. He has a box of them by the bed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Travolta's many credits range from ``Saturday Night Fever'' to  
``Pulp Fiction'' and ``Primary Colors.'' His latest film is ``A 
Civil Action.'' Preston's credits include ``Twins,'' ``Jerry 
Maguire'' and ``Addicted to Love.'' Her latest movie is ''Jack 
Frost.''

<HEADLINE> Sampras Out of Australian Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PERTH, Australia (AP) -- Pete Sampras' bid to tie the all-time  
Grand Slam singles title record will have to wait a little longer. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras pulled out of the Australian Open Friday, citing fatigue  
from a relentless schedule which allowed him to remain No. 1 for a 
record sixth straight year. He played seven tournaments in Europe 
during October and November. 
</P>
<P>
	``He obviously had a very long end of the year and he's worn out  
and needs to take a rest,'' said tournament director Paul McNamee, 
who was informed of the decision by Sampras' manager. ``It's 
disappointing and was a very big decision for Pete. It means he 
misses the opportunity at the Australian Open to equal Roy 
Emerson's record of 12 Grand Slam singles victories.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras, a loser in the quarterfinals last year, has two  
Australian Open titles, in 1994 and 1997, among his 11 Grand Slam 
championships. He won Wimbledon for the fifth time in the past six 
years, but otherwise struggled last year, winning only three other 
singles titles. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time Sampras failed to play a Grand Slam was the 1992  
Australian Open, and his decision opens the way for several players 
to take his top ranking. 
</P>
<P>
	One is Marcelo Rios, who Sampras narrowly beat for the top  
ranking in 1998. The others include Patrick Rafter, last year's 
U.S. Open champion, Carlos Moya and Alex Corretja. 
</P>
<P>
	``It opens up the race for No. 1 right at the start of the  
year,'' McNamee said. ``There'll be a lot of players thinking they 
have a chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras' next opportunity to tie Emerson's mark will be at the  
French Open, beginning May 24. Sampras was upset last year in Paris 
by little-known Ramon Delgado in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
	The Australian Open, which was won by Petr Korda last year,  
begins Jan. 18 and ends Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Wimbledon finalist Nathalie Tauziat of France also has withdrawn  
from the tournament.

<HEADLINE> Bus Crashes on N.J. Highway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DOVER, N.J. (AP) -- For the fourth time since Christmas Eve, a  
casino-bound bus has been involved in a crash on a New Jersey 
highway. 
</P>
<P>
	No one on the bus was injured in Saturday's multi-vehicle  
accident on the Garden State Parkway, and police said the bus 
continued on its trip to Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
	A 13-year-old boy riding in another vehicle was in critical  
condition after icy conditions caused the pileup. He was taken by 
ambulance to Jersey Shore Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Ice storms struck the state Saturday night, causing a rash of  
accidents on New Jersey roads, including nearly a dozen on the 
Parkway alone. 
</P>
<P>
	The bus accident was the fourth involving a casino-bound bus in  
the past two weeks. Eight people died and 14 were hurt in a 
Christmas Eve crash on the Parkway.

<HEADLINE> Senate Set To Take up Charges </HEADLINE>

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When the 106th Congress convenes on Wednesday,  
the Senate will open more than just another legislative year. 
</P>
<P>
	First on the agenda are the perjury and obstruction of justice  
charges the House passed last month against President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Under pressure from conservatives to both hold a full-fledged

Leader Trent Lott has proposed a truncated trial to start the week 
of Jan. 11. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal has come under fire from Republicans who want a  
full hearing of the evidence against Clinton. Many logistical 
questions - such as how long the trial will last and whether to 
discuss censuring the president - remain to be answered, likely 
after Republicans and Democrats caucus privately on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly beforehand, however, they will be sworn in. When the  
trial opens, the articles of impeachment will be read and Chief 
Justice William H. Rehnquist, who would preside over the trial, 
will be sworn in. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, all 100 senators would swear to a special oath as jurors.  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's defense team will then have an opportunity to answer  
the charges. At any time, senators could overrule Rehnquist's 
rulings with a simple majority vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers widely believe, however, that the two-thirds majority  
doesn't exist to remove Clinton from office.

<HEADLINE> Spurrier Plans To Stay at Florida </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Florida fans can rest easy. Steve Spurrier  
apparently isn't going anywhere -- again. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that the enigmatic Gators coach has given any indication to  
the contrary. But Saturday night's Orange Bowl also marked the end 
of the annual window for him to freely pursue whatever opening may 
be linked to his name. 
</P>
<P>
	A clause in Spurrier's contract allows him to leave without  
cause only if he gives written notice between Dec. 1 and Jan. 2. 
The only way Spurrier can terminate the agreement otherwise is if 
the University Athletic Association fails to live up to its 
financial obligation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just too happy, too comfortable,'' Spurrier said earlier  
in the week. ``Life's too good in Gainesville, Florida. That's 
where I get my competitive fires stoked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Each year, the spate of NFL firings brings another round of  
reports that Spurrier might be wooed by the pros. This year's 
speculation wasn't nearly as intense, though his name did come up 
for the Carolina Panthers' vacancy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've learned over nine years at Florida not to worry too much  
about rumors,'' Spurrier said. ``I look at it as a compliment, that 
they think I'm worthy of coaching in the NFL. They don't mention a 
lot of other college coaches for the NFL.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Spurrier's nine years at Florida, the Gators have won at  
least nine games every season, including five Southeastern 
Conference titles. An Orange Bowl win would ensure their eighth 
straight finish in the Top 10. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1966 Heisman Trophy winner entered the Orange Bowl with a  
92-18-1 record at Florida, 102-31-2 overall including three years 
at Duke. He also coached three years in the now-defunct United 
States Football League, going 35-19 with two playoff appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, Spurrier has addressed his team at the end of  
the regular season, telling them not to pay attention to any 
reports linking him to an NFL job. 
</P>
<P>
	``He tells us that everybody tries to say stuff that he's going,  
but he's not,'' quarterback Doug Johnson said. ``I expect him to be 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spurrier came closest to leaving the Gators three years ago when  
he was pursued by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Bucs made a $2 
million offer that Spurrier weighed deeply before rejecting at the 
last minute. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been offered too much money in the past to accept  
something now,'' Johnson said. ``I don't see why he'd leave to go 
somewhere else now. He loves Gainesville too much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spurrier got his $2 million anyway, part of a six-year contract  
he signed in September 1997 that made him the highest-paid coach in 
college football. That includes his base salary, nearly $1 million 
from clothing contracts, income from radio and television shows, 
new cars and 24 tickets to Florida home games. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I were leaving, I sure wouldn't have made those 42  
recruiting calls I made last Wednesday night,'' Spurrier said.

<HEADLINE> Small Plane Crashes in NY Cemetery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST FARMINGDALE, N.Y. (AP) -- Talk about a brush with death.  
</P>
<P>
	A single-engine plane crash-landed in a cemetery Saturday,  
knocking over a few gravestones but leaving the pilot and his 
passenger unhurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like it just fell short of the runway,'' said Chief  
Charlie Crimi of the East Farmingdale Fire Department. ``It took 
out some headstones and the tops of trees, but all in all it was a 
pretty good landing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The single-engine Beechcraft Sierra propeller plane came to a  
stop at 9:45 a.m. in Mount Ararat cemetery, about a half-mile from 
the landing field of Republic Airport, said John Lauth, operations 
manager at the airport. The crash was about 35 miles east of New 
York City. 
</P>
<P>
	The two men on board were able to walk away from the accident  
but were taken to Nassau County Medical Center for examination, 
Lauth said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilot Robert Berneby, 42, suffered a concussion, cuts and  
bruises, and the passenger, Berneby's nephew, George Noeth, 19, had 
cuts and bruises, said Officer Al Prim, a spokesman for the Suffolk 
County police. 
</P>
<P>
	Berneby was in stable condition, while Noeth was treated and  
released. 
</P>
<P>
	The two told authorities the plane lost power while they were  
practicing taking off and landing, Prim said.

<HEADLINE> Reeves Wins AP Top Coach Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Neither heart problems nor the losing history of the Atlanta  
Falcons could stop Dan Reeves from being selected as The Associated 
Press' NFL Coach of the Year on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves, sidelined for the final two regular-season games after  
undergoing heart surgery, led the Falcons to their best season 
(14-2) and their first NFC West title since 1980. He is expected to 
coach the Falcons in next weekend's home playoff game, although he 
might work from the coaches' box upstairs rather than the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves, 54, won the top coach award for the second time; he also  
got the honor in 1993 with the New York Giants. Previously, Reeves 
also led the Denver Broncos to three AFC championships, although 
they lost each time in the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tremendous honor,'' said Reeves, the NFL's winningest  
active coach (170-124-1). ``When you look at the people that could 
have won it -- Denny Green, Bill Parcells, Mike Shanahan, guys that 
have had fantastic years -- you feel honored. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, it's a thrill because of coming in here and turning  
this thing around; it certainly happened a lot bigger than what I 
thought. There was no way I could tell you I thought we were going 
to win the NFC West. We wanted to challenge for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was extremely proud of our team last year being 1-7, then  
finishing 6-2 in the second half. That was rewarding. It was 
probably one of the most fun years I had coaching to see a team do 
that. Then, to come into this year, expecting to challenge for the 
playoffs, and to have the year we've had is just unreal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So unreal that a team generally picked to finish as an also-ran  
wound up with the second-best record in the league, tied with 
Denver. Only Minnesota (15-1) was better, and one of Atlanta's 
losses, to the New York Jets, came when quarterback Chris Chandler 
was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves received 23 1/2 votes from a nationwide panel of 47 sports  
writers and broadcasters. Minnesota's Green was next with 14 1/2 and 
the Jets' Parcells got nine votes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a very strong personal feeling for him, not only as a  
coach but a guy that I think highly of personally,'' Parcells said 
of Reeves. ``He's one of my peers, right in the same group I was 
in, there, so there is something a little extra there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves put the award in an historical perspective, noting the  
fates of recent winners. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bad thing is it's scary, because it seems like about a  
year or two after getting coach of the year, you get fired,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ray Rhodes was coach of the year. I was coach of the year and  
got fired a couple of years later. It's a tough profession. What it 
says is for one year, anyway, people feel like you've done a good 
job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes won the award in 1995 and was fired by the Philadelphia  
Eagles last week. Dom Capers, the 1996 winner, also was fired last 
week by Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's winner was Jim Fassel, who replaced Reeves with the  
New York Giants in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves credited to his staff and players for carrying on after  
he was hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got sick. They were special before I got sick,'' he said.  
``They play together, do things together, the way a team should. 
Then to have a coaching staff that you think is good, then when 
you're out of it for two weeks, you know how good they are.''

<HEADLINE> Short Puts NFL Career on Hold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Penn State linebacker Brandon Short said  
today he will return to school for a fifth year, passing up the NFL 
for now. 
</P>
<P>
	Short spent the past month weighing whether to leave the Nittany  
Lions and take the money his family needs. Short said he made the 
decision to stay a week ago as Penn State prepared for its 26-14 
win over Kentucky in the Outback Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``Initially, when this whole thing started, I thought this was  
going to be the most difficult decision I ever had to make in my 
life,'' Short said this morning before the team flew back home. ``I 
thought I was choosing between my family, everybody who was in 
financial need, and the school and the team that I love. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I took a closer look, it wasn't that hard a decision at  
all,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Short said that, since almost all of the players on the two-deep  
chart are returning, he thinks this team can win the national title 
in 1999. He wants to be a part of that. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I was sitting there watching them playing for a national  
championship and I was playing for the Bills or whatever, I don't 
know if I could rest,'' Short said, ``knowing that I had the 
opportunity to achieve everything that I dreamed of and I passed on 
it because I was scared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Short had plenty of reasons to leave: a 3-year-old daughter  
living in the same project where he grew up, a grandmother 
recovering from a hospital stay and a brother in legal trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	According to information the Penn State staff gleaned from  
people in the NFL, Short may have been picked late in the first 
round, but he also could have slipped as far as the third round. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most people felt that he'd be better off coming back,'' coach  
Joe Paterno said. ``But you know, every case is a little different. 
He's assumed a lot of responsibility for a young guy that most 
young people do not have. Obviously, from a selfish standpoint, I'm 
delighted he's coming back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Short will graduate in the fall and plans to enroll in a  
graduate program in logistics. 
</P>
<P>
	He led Penn State this season with 85 tackles, including 15  
tackles for losses. He had eight tackles in the Outback Bowl.

<HEADLINE> Rock Hall Chief Is Avid Collector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Its attendance falling, the Rock and Roll Hall  
of Fame and Museum hopes yet another new director -- one familiar 
with superhero feats -- can resurrect the money-losing shrine. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Stewart, 52, is a former top executive of Marvel Comics.  
He'll be the fifth director of the hall since it opened Sept. 1, 
1995 at a cost of $97 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, who starts Monday, is an avid collector of rock 'n'  
roll memorabilia himself. He has some 200,000 vinyl records, 5,000 
compact discs, dozens of rare concert posters and 20 jukeboxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess you could say I'm a fanatic,'' Stewart said.  
</P>
<P>
	The museum said it lost $1.37 million as attendance fell from  
867,000 in 1996 to 615,000 in 1997. The 1998 attendance was about 
560,000. Stewart wants to push those numbers back up by luring 
return visitors with concerts, commemorations and more memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
	He supports a proposal by Jann Wenner, the hall's co-vice  
chairman and Rolling Stone magazine publisher, to boost interest by 
building a rock library and archive center. 
</P>
<P>
	The tricky part will be coming up with new ways to market the  
museum without making it too commercial, Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to turn it into Disneyland or use theme  
restaurants,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	That approach is markedly different from one he took while at  
Marvel Entertainment Group from 1989 to 1997. He oversaw the comic 
book company's entry into theme parks and developed Marvel-themed 
restaurants under a joint venture with Planet Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	The market for comic books took a nosedive in the early 1990s,  
eventually forcing Marvel to seek bankruptcy protection. 
</P>
<P>
	``The blame can't all be placed on Terry even though he was at  
the helm,'' said Alexander Paris Jr. of Barrington Research 
Associates Inc. in Chicago. Stewart was a ``fun, enthusiastic sort 
of CEO'' while at Marvel and his office was filled with gigantic 
toys and a jukebox, Paris said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was struck by his boyish enthusiasm for the company,'' he  
said. ``He'll do well as head of the rock museum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart remembers being fascinated with records owned by a  
friend of his mother when he was growing up in the small town of 
Daphne, Ala., barely old enough to walk. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd toddle over and ask him to play the bejesus out of them.  
He got so tired of hearing the records that he told me to take them 
home,'' Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
	When he got a little older, he would travel 40 miles every week  
to Mobile, Ala., to spend part of his $5 allowance on records. That 
passion grew in the 1960s, thanks to bargains at yard sales, junk 
shops and flea markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first day I went into a junk shop, there were mounds and  
mounds of records. I had a box of 45s in my hands and got it for 
just $1,'' he said. ``That was the beginning and I haven't found an 
end to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart has already decided on his first donation to the museum:  
a rare 1953 poster of the rhythm and blues group the Swallows. How 
he'll decorate his office is a tougher decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems kind of overkill to bring a bunch of memorabilia in.  
Maybe a jukebox because I'll need a stereo. Some posters would be 
nice,'' Stewart said. ``There's so much to choose from.''

<HEADLINE> In Finance, We Push the Limits / Commentary  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                        *AP Business Analyst    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- We did it last year and most likely we'll set  
out to do it again: Push the limits. 
</P>
<P>
	Push the economy to new records, or at least begin the year  
trying to do so. Push for more spending, toys, debt, stocks. Buy 
cars, houses and computers at near-record levels. Take cruises, 
visit theme parks. 
</P>
<P>
	In the corporate world, we'll seek new ways to squeeze out more  
profits, even selling the company if we have to. We'll make 
antiques of 2-year-old electronic gadgetry and follow technology 
wherever it leads. 
</P>
<P>
	In such ways will we express our consumer and business  
confidence, defying all the economic demons that lie a few hours 
from our borders, creating financial collapses, recessions, poverty 
and social chaos. 
</P>
<P>
	Only in looking back over the past year -- make that the past  
decade -- can Americans understand how intensively they've been 
living as they push the economic boundaries. The 1970s are already 
a bygone era. 
</P>
<P>
	If you don't think so, just consider one of the things Americans  
like to do most, such as borrowing money. In 1970 you applied for 
credit, explained your purpose, waited a week and were granted half 
the amount. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, you open a letter in your home to find a bank  
solicitation, one of about 3 billion mailed each year. In effect, 
it is a plea from the bank to ``please take our money'' -- about 3 
billion of these pleas are mailed in a year -- and it offers various 
inducements to get you to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	There are limits to economic change, of course, but after  
viewing events of the past few years you must ask what they are. 
</P>
<P>
	The expansion, declared near death a half-dozen times, is now in  
its eighth year. The Federal Reserve fought an inflation apparition 
month after month before conceding it wasn't real. Surprise follows 
surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps none more surprised are those who thought they knew  
everything about these things and have found out they don't. How 
many times did you hear that the falling jobless rate would soon 
touch off inflation? 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody really knows where inflation went. They have only clues,  
such as the collapse of many commodity prices, intense world 
competition and technological improvements that have contributed to 
productivity gains. 
</P>
<P>
	What makes the stock market defy the predictions? Based on old  
criteria, how in the world can the market justify soaring prices 
for companies that never earned a nickel? What justifies such 
exuberance? 
</P>
<P>
	And explain if you can how marketing folks, who know a lot about  
peddling products and more about consumers' behavior than they know 
about themselves, failed to foresee the surge of Internet holiday 
buying. 
</P>
<P>
	What it all suggests is that Americans have relentlessly pushed  
themselves into new, uncharted territory not understood by the old 
prophets, and very likely not by the new ones either. 
</P>
<P>
	As Gregg Easterbrook writes in ``The New Republic,'' the new  
ways have led to a decline in crime, a booming economy, lower teen 
pregnancies, a budget surplus, better air and water, improved 
health, less poverty ... . 
</P>
<P>
	But you can as easily enumerate the problems and the dangers.  
There is cynicism about the political process, a dangerous sense 
that nothing can go wrong, a gnawing feeling that big issues aren't 
being dealt with. 
</P>
<P>
	The economy has pushed the limits in so many ways that you have  
to wonder how much longer it can push. 
</P>
<P>
	It is unmapped territory, with as many hidden dangers, failures  
and endless trails to nowhere as faced by the old geographical 
explorers. But, as then, great riches also could lie ahead.

<HEADLINE> Dallas Stars Become NHL Powerhouse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- One hand is enough to count the number of losses  
the Dallas Stars have this season in 35 games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars have become an NHL powerhouse, beating teams with a  
combination of a high-powered offense and airtight defense. All 
while compiling a league-best 24-5-6 record. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, we're playing so often that we have a good  
chemistry going and we know what we're doing,'' Brett Hull said. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, they're doing it better than they did last season, when  
the Stars won the President's Trophy for the best regular-season 
record and advanced to the Western Conference finals. This season, 
the Stars are six points ahead of their 1997-98 pace. 
</P>
<P>
	With Friday's 2-1 overtime victory over the Phoenix Coyotes, the  
Stars are 11-0-3 since Dec. 4 for a franchise-record 14-game 
unbeaten streak. That ties this season's league best by the Coyotes 
and includes the league's longest road undefeated streak (7-0-2). 
</P>
<P>
	The inconsistency that plagued the team when their schedule was  
lax in the first two months of the season -- four and five days 
between games wasn't uncommon -- is gone. 
</P>
<P>
	It all changed during December, when Dallas played 15 games -- 10  
on the road. Even before the season, Stars coach Ken Hitchcock had 
expressed concern that Dallas' aging lineup -- the oldest in the NHL 
-- would have trouble withstanding December's grueling schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's had the opposite effect. The Stars had 11 wins during  
December, a team record for victories in one month. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our team has learned about the level of emotion that you need  
to have to be a consistently competitive club,'' Hitchcock said. 
``We've won and we've lost because of it the last two seasons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The last time the Stars lost was a month ago against lowly  
Vancouver. Dallas responded with a 6-2 victory over the Edmonton 
Oilers the following night. 
</P>
<P>
	The streak also includes a 3-1 victory over the defending  
Stanley Cup champion Red Wings at Joe Louis Arena, where the Stars 
had been 1-17-2 in their previous 20 games. Detroit has not beaten 
Dallas in three meetings this season, and was 18 points behind the 
Stars before Saturday's games. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas' strength is a deep, balanced lineup that's as good at  
attacking as it is at defending. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've got two excellent scoring lines and two good checking  
lines,'' Boston coach Pat Burns said. ``The checking lines are the 
key. Guys like (Guy) Carbonneau and (Mike) Keane and (Brian) 
Skrudland know their roles. They're not after bonus points. They 
want to win and they know how to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, the Stars' role players are scoring.  
</P>
<P>
	In Thursday's 6-1 win over Boston, 13 Dallas players contributed  
to the scoring, including defenseman Craig Ludwig, who got his 
first goal in 156 games. Forward Tony Hrkac, a minor-league castoff 
the past four seasons, scored the game-winner against Ottawa Dec. 
20. Grant Marshall, who had 9 goals and 19 points last season, 
already has 8 goals and 15 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas also has benefited from a stingy defense and great  
goaltending. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas' 67 goals-against is second only to the Coyotes 63. Ed  
Belfour has a glittering goals-against average of 1.87 and backup 
Roman Turek is undefeated (6-0-2). 
</P>
<P>
	The success of the Stars' goaltending tandem, Burns said, was  
attributable to the defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have big and experienced defensemen who don't make  
mistakes,'' Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them are Derian Hatcher and Richard Matvichuk, who are  
among the top hitters in the league and lead the team in 
plus-minus. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, it's made for an unbeatable combination over the past  
month.

<HEADLINE> Reform Party Fans Join Ventura </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HASTINGS, Minn. (AP) -- Two months after wowing the nation by  
clinching the governorship, former professional wrestler and Reform 
Party candidate Jesse Ventura moved closer to officially taking 
office Saturday by beginning his inaugural festivities. 
</P>
<P>
	About 100 friends and supporters of Ventura turned out amid  
blowing snow and subzero wind chills to mark the first day of two 
weeks of the inaugural celebration. The official swearing-in 
ceremony is Monday at the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing I'm real pleased about is Monday I finally start  
getting paid,'' said Ventura, also formerly an actor and Navy SEAL. 
His annual salary is $120,303. 
</P>
<P>
	The official events began near the Brooklyn Park wetland that  
drew him to politics eight years ago. He entered and won the 
suburban mayoral race mainly out of concern that the wetland would 
be destroyed by developers with the city's blessing. The wetland, 
he noted with pride, is still there. 
</P>
<P>
	At the site, he released a bald eagle that had stepped into a  
trap and was nursed back to health at the University of Minnesota. 
Ventura, wearing the boots, a Minnesota Wild NHL hockey jacket and 
black knit cap over his own bald head, stood on a stage with his 
wife, Terry Ventura, and 15-year-old daughter, Jade, to release the 
bird. 
</P>
<P>
	From there, Ventura headed to a potluck lunch on a 600-acre farm  
in Hastings, south of the Twin Cities. The theme music from the 
movie ``Rocky'' played as he entered the farm's barn. 
</P>
<P>
	Valli Sharpe-Geisler of San Jose, Calif., a former California  
Reform Party chairwoman, came, saying Ventura's victory ``answered 
the question of `Is it a wasted vote to vote for someone other than 
for a Democrat or Republican?' You end up getting someone dynamic 
and creative.''

<HEADLINE> Ball Bounces Dolphins' Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The Buffalo Bills' first play was a fumble and  
their last play was a fumble, with plenty of crazy bounces in 
between. Most went the Miami Dolphins' way. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami beat Buffalo 24-17 Saturday in a wild-card playoff game  
filled with weird plays and more plot twists than a 900-page novel. 
</P>
<P>
	Jimmy Johnson tried an onside kick with a 6-0 lead, Dan Marino  
completed a pass to his center and the Bills committed a turnover 
on a 65-yard completion. Then there was a wild sequence in the 
final 24 seconds of the first half, when: 
</P>
<P>
	--Doug Flutie threw an interception at the goal line;  
</P>
<P>
	--Marino completed a 52-yard ``Hail Mary'' to Oronde Gadsden, who  
lateraled to O.J. McDuffie for another 4 yards; 
</P>
<P>
	--Olindo Mare's 26-yard field-goal attempt bounced off the  
upright as the half ended. 
</P>
<P>
	No points, lots of excitement.  
</P>
<P>
	The Bills were angry that receiver Andre Reed was ejected for  
pushing an official with 1:47 left after being tackled at the Miami 
1-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just getting up. I don't know an official was right  
there,'' Reed said. ``He said I pushed him, and he threw me out of 
the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That play killed us,'' coach Wade Phillips said. ``We not only  
don't get a touchdown, we lost Andre.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo settled for a field goal that made the score 24-17,  
which forced it to try unsuccessfully for a tying touchdown in the 
final minute. 
</P>
<P>
	The breaks starting going against the Bills on the first play.  
Eric Moulds beat Terrell Buckley on a 65-yard bomb, but fumbled 
when he was hit by Buckley, and Miami recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	``It started off well,'' Dolphins linebacker Zach Thomas said.  
``That first play set the tone. That's great heart, to fight back 
after getting beat like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes the ball bounced the Bills' way. They recovered Mare's  
onside kick and scored three plays later for a 7-6 lead, but Miami 
coach Jimmy Johnson defended the strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been successful with the onside kick, and they didn't  
have the alignment to stop it,'' Johnson said. ``Going against a 
25-mph wind, we figured they would get good field position 
anyway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marino found a new target in Tim Ruddy, the Dolphins' 300-pound  
center. He caught a deflected pass and ran several yards to 
complete an 8-yard gain. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just tried not to get hurt,'' Ruddy said. ``Three Bills were  
there, but they were laughing too hard, so I got through them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The gain helped Miami drive to a tie-breaking field goal early  
in the fourth quarter. The Bills caught one break down the stretch, 
recovering an onside kick, but they couldn't catch the Dolphins.

``reprehensible conduct'' in his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Florida QB Suffers Broken Leg </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Doug Johnson, who appeared to have won the job as  
No. 7 Florida's starting quarterback, broke his left leg in the 
second quarter of Saturday night's Orange Bowl against No. 18 
Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who had led the Gators to a 4-1 record since taking  
over as the starter, had his ankle bent underneath him with 4:18 
left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
	Marc Pilon hit Johnson after he threw an 18-yard pass to Nafis  
Karim to the Syracuse 7. 
</P>
<P>
	The junior immediately grabbed his ankle and grimaced as Florida  
trainers worked on him. The game was stopped for about five minutes 
until he was wheeled off on a cart. X-rays showed a broken fibula. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson had completed 12 of 17 passes for 195 yards and two  
touchdowns to that point, staking the Gators to a 14-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Jesse Palmer, whose broken collarbone allowed Johnson to regain  
the starting job, came in and threw a 4-yard TD pass to Erron 
Kinney two plays later. Palmer later scored on a 2-yard run for a 
28-3 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson threw for 2,346 yards with 19 touchdowns and just eight  
interceptions during the season. He began the year alternating 
plays with Palmer, but was relegated to backup duty Oct. 10 against 
LSU. Palmer was hurt in the first half of that game. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, coach Steve Spurrier said a good performance  
would allow Johnson to establish himself as the No. 1 quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury may also affect Johnson's baseball future.  
</P>
<P>
	A second-round pick of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays out of high  
school, he spent the summers of 1996 and '97 in the rookie leagues. 
He sat out last summer while recovering from rotator-cuff surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, a third baseman, once ranked as high as the Devil Rays'  
third-best prospect, according to Baseball America magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, he hit .231 with one home run and nine RBIs in 28 games  
at St. Petersburg of the Gulf Coast League. The next year, he hit 
only .201 with four homers and 19 RBIs in 34 games at Princeton 
(W.Va.) of the Appalachian League. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike some two-sport prospects, Johnson won't have to repay any  
of his $400,000 signing bonus if he does not report. 
</P>
<P>
	He said recently he would decide after the Orange Bowl whether  
to play another season of minor league ball or spend the summer 
working on his football skills.

<HEADLINE> Packers Coach Would Rather Be Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Mike Holmgren returned to his hometown of  
San Francisco and found himself homesick for Wisconsin's wintery 
weather. 
</P>
<P>
	It was sunny and in the 60s Saturday when the Green Bay Packers  
(11-5) held their walk-through at 3Com Park, where they'll face the 
San Francisco 49ers (12-4) Sunday in a wild-card game. 
</P>
<P>
	But Holmgren, who has guided Green Bay to a franchise record six  
straight playoff berths, was longing for the more than foot of snow 
that blanketed Lambeau Field back home. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would love to be playing the game back in Green Bay right  
now but we didn't earn that,'' Holmgren said. ``And they did. So, I 
just hope we come out tomorrow and execute like I know we can and 
give them a good game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers have never lost in the playoffs at home, but San  
Francisco has become their home away from home lately as they've 
ended the 49ers' season here in 1995 and '97. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe it was that success or the five-game winning streak they  
own over the 49ers or maybe it was the warm weather, but the 
Packers had a highly spirited 45-minute workout filled with 
laughter and enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, we were able to come out and win a game out here or two  
under real tough situations, so they know they can do it,'' 
Holmgren said. ``But we also are very well aware of the fact that 
the 49ers are a great football team, and they earned the right to 
have homefield advantage. And it still is an advantage for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several of Holmgren's friends and family members took in the  
workout. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's fun. The guys I went to high school with, my good  
friends, my brother, has a lot of fond memories this place,'' said 
Holmgren, who still owns a home in the Bay area. ``So, it is 
exciting, every time we step out here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also in attendance was Holmgren's agent, Bob LaMonte, who will  
be working on making his client the league's highest-paid coach 
once the Packers season is over. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren, who has a year left on his contract, had an escape  
clause inserted after last season that allows him to leave for a 
coach-general manager job in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Packers general manager Ron Wolf has said he will try to keep  
Holmgren but may not be able to afford his price. The Packers have 
offered Holmgren an extension reportedly worth about $4 million a 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	LaMonte said Holmgren would either sign the extension or leave,  
but won't go into next season as a lame duck and have to go through 
all the speculation about his future again. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he chooses to stay in Green Bay, he would definitely sign  
the proposal we have in front of us that's been sitting there since 
August,'' LaMonte said. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren is a hot commodity in the NFL after turning around the  
Packers. There's even speculation he could wind up back in San 
Francisco, where he grew up and where he began his career as an 
assistant. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco's second-year coach Steve Mariucci, who is 17-1 at  
home -- his only loss being last year's 23-10 NFC championship game 
loss to the Packers -- has balked at signing an extension that many 
believe could be rescinded if the 49ers lose to the Packers on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mariucci, who was one of Holmgren's assistants in Green Bay, was  
hired to beat the Packers and he hasn't been able to do that. 
</P>
<P>
	Mariucci told his players this week not to worry about or even  
discuss his job status. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our focus needs to be on this football game, not on any  
speculation or rumors whatsoever,'' Mariucci said. 
</P>
<P>
	LaMonte said he wouldn't be surprised if Holmgren chooses to  
stay put: ``It will be a great story and I can go back and relax, 
play golf at Oneida Country Club.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``People lose sight of the fact this isn't someone dying to get  
out of Green Bay,'' LaMonte said. ``This isn't Bill Parcells 
wrenching himself to get out of New England. This isn't Dan Reeves 
wrenching himself out of New York. This is a happy guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One who would just rather be back in Green Bay this weekend.

<HEADLINE> Cowboys Have Experience Over Ariz. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- The Dallas Cowboys have been in an  
NFL-record 23 playoff games. They own three Super Bowl rings in the 
1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arizona Cardinals haven't played in one since 1982. In fact,  
the franchise hasn't won a playoff game since the Chicago Cardinals 
took the NFL title in 1946. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas quarterback Troy Aikman is 11-2 in playoff games. Arizona  
quarterback Jake Plummer, in his second year in the NFL, was to 
play in his first in today's NFC wild-card matchup. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like the finality of a playoff game,'' Aikman said. ``You  
have to get the job done. There are no excuses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aikman's postseason play was one of the big advantages the  
Cowboys held going into the game. He has three Super Bowl rings to 
prove he thrives in the playoff atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is something to be said about playoffs experience,''  
Aikman said. ``I view it as a positive, but it can be overrated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer has led six comebacks in the fourth quarter this season  
for the Cardinals, who finished 9-7 to earn a wild-card spot behind 
the NFC East champion Cowboys (10-6). 
</P>
<P>
	``They've been in a lot of games they had to win to get into the  
playoffs and I'm sure it felt like a playoff game to them,'' Aikman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Aikman has played against Plummer twice this season. Dallas beat  
Arizona 38-10 in the opener, but had to hold off a rally to defeat 
the Cardinals 35-28 in the rematch. Plummer passed for 314 yards in 
the second half of the second game. 
</P>
<P>
	Aikman was impressed by the energetic Plummer.  
</P>
<P>
	``Jake is a good, young player,'' Aikman said. ``He's very  
athletic and does a good job giving them a spark. He will be a 
great player at some point. He'll get better as his supporting cast 
gets better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aikman is more of a pocket passer, while Plummer can unreel some  
wild scrambles. 
</P>
<P>
	Aikman said the Cardinals, who have lost nine consecutive games  
in Texas Stadium, always pose a threat for the Cowboys despite 
Arizona's record against them. 
</P>
<P>
	``It won't be any different Saturday,'' Aikman said. ``They  
always play us tough. '' 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer, who recently signed a $29 million contract in only his  
second season, said he's looking at the game as a fun time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever it takes to do to win I'll try it,'' Plummer said.  
``The fact the Cowboys have a lot of experience could work in their 
favor, but I hope it won't make any difference. This will be fun, a 
first-time experience. We'll just try to stay cool.''

<HEADLINE> Drescher Knows When She Needs Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In ``The Nanny,'' Fran Drescher is the help. In  
real life, she needs a lot herself. 
</P>
<P>
	Drescher produces and stars in the sitcom, now in its sixth  
season. She is also writing a sequel to her book ``Enter Whining,'' 
and developed the comedy series ``The Daytrippers'' for MTV. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very organized and detail-oriented, and when I was a  
struggling young actress, I did it all myself,'' Drescher says in 
the January issue of InStyle magazine. Now, she relies on ``a loyal 
group of disciples, each on a 24-hour pager. Running an empire is 
hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alone now after separating two years ago from her high-school  
sweetheart husband, Drescher credits her success with emotional 
independence to more outside help -- psychotherapy four times a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got a lot of satisfaction out of being the best,'' she said.  
``But when you reach what you've been striving for and you're still 
not happy -- well, I realized I was totally out of touch with my own 
feelings.''

<HEADLINE> Midwest Socked by Big Snow Storm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- A massive winter storm arcing from Gulf Coast  
states to the upper Midwest grounded scores of New Year's flights, 
knocked out power to thousands and threatened to dump more than a 
foot of snow across the northern half of the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Highway officials warned motorists to stay off roads and  
airlines canceled flights today, hoping the storm would lift in 
time for the post-holiday traffic peak Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're urging everyone, if you don't need to be out, don't go  
out,'' said Sgt. Hubert Looney of the Missouri Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters said parts of Illinois, Indiana, Iowa and Missouri  
could get up to 15 inches of snow by tonight, with gusty winds 
creating near-blizzard conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	About a half-foot covered St. Louis by Friday night, along with  
areas of central and southeastern Illinois and central Iowa. 
Several inches fell on the Dakotas. 
</P>
<P>
	More than three dozen flights were canceled Friday at Lambert  
Airport in St. Louis and dozens of others were delayed, some for 
three hours or more. Trans World Airlines canceled all of its 
Saturday morning flights into and out of the airport -- about 140 
total. 
</P>
<P>
	In Chicago, walls of sandbags were placed along Lakeshore Drive  
to prevent waves from Lake Michigan from flooding the busy road. 
O'Hare and Midway airports assembled than 100 pieces of snow 
removal equipment, along with hundreds of cots for travelers who 
may be stranded by the storm. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now we have our crews in place, additional staff has  
been called in and is ready to go,'' Monique Bond, a spokeswoman 
for the Chicago Department of Aviation, said Friday. ``We're ready 
to go -- just waiting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	United passengers planning to fly from O'Hare should wait until  
Monday or Tuesday as the airline expects delays and cancellations, 
said spokesman Matt Triaca. Before dawn today, American Airlines 
already had canceled half of its flights in and out of O'Hare, said 
spokeswoman Mary Frances Fagan. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputies in Texas said tornadoes injured at least seven people  
and destroyed three mobile homes east of Huntsville. None of the 
injuries were life-threatening, said hospital spokeswoman Jill 
Baine. Both Walker and Trinity counties reported downed power lines 
and significant tree damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the state line in Arkansas, freezing rain toppled power  
lines and cut service to more than 100,000 utility customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The trouble with an ice storm like this is it's so widespread  
and it all happens all at once,'' said Dan Daugherty of Entergy 
Arkansas, the state's largest electricity supplier. ``We are 
restoring some power, but we're just not able to get ahead of the 
number going out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The storm was blamed for at least seven deaths. Six of them --  
two in Arkansas, two in Nebraska and two in Missouri -- occurred in 
traffic accidents. 
</P>
<P>
	In Edinboro, Pa., a quadriplegic college student froze to death  
after his electric wheelchair became stuck in the snow early Friday 
on his way home from a New Year's Eve party. 
</P>
<P>
	The body of Justin Bradley, 22, was found near an Edinboro  
University student union building at 2 p.m. Friday. He had left an 
off-campus party at 2 a.m. and refused an offer of a ride home, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Midwesterners headed to supermarkets and hardware stores  
Friday in search of storm supplies. In Evansville, Ind., customers 
flocked to Buehler's Buy-Low to stock up on milk, bread, eggs and 
meat. 
</P>
<P>
	``We tried to call in everybody we could,'' assistant manager  
Jeff Quirk said of the extra staff brought in to help with the 
rush.

<HEADLINE> Mars Lander Launch May Be Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Thunderstorms may delay NASA's  
planned launch Sunday of a Mars lander. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters said Saturday that storms would move into the area  
overnight, reducing the odds of acceptable launch weather to a 
scant 30 percent. Much better weather is expected Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mars Polar Lander is scheduled to take off aboard an  
unmanned Delta rocket in midafternoon and arrive at the red planet 
in December, setting down on three legs near the planet's South 
Pole. 
</P>
<P>
	The Polar Lander will scoop up and analyze Martian soil to see  
if any water ice is present. It's the companion to the Mars Climate 
Orbiter, some 4 million miles from Earth following a launch last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA's last Martian lander was the padded Pathfinder, which  
bounced down in the equatorial region of the planet in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Arizona Defense Comes Up Big </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Thanks to a ball-hawking, big-play defense,  
the Arizona Cardinals didn't need another strong finish Saturday to 
win the franchise's first playoff game in 51 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals' perfect performance on three fourth-down plays  
preserved a shocking 20-7 victory in the NFC wild-card playoffs 
over the Dallas Cowboys, the same Cowboys who scored 73 points on 
Arizona in two earlier victories 
</P>
<P>
	``Watching the change in this team all season was like watching  
a flower grow from a seed to a beautiful bloom,'' said defensive 
end Andre Wadsworth, who played his first game as a rookie in a 
38-10 loss to the Cowboys on Sept. 6. ``After that loss in the 
opener, I think this time that flower had some poison in it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals, despite being the 12th and last team to qualify  
for the NFL playoffs, had the best single-season record in close 
games in league history. They won seven of eight games decided by 
three points or less and won their last three on the final play. 
</P>
<P>
	But this time, said linebacker Jamir Miller, who had two sacks  
among his 12 tackles, ``we wanted to get on them early and stay on 
them. It's hard for anyone to beat a team three times, and we felt 
we got gypped on the last play in the last game. We didn't want it 
to come down to a last play or a last call.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals intercepted three of Dallas quarterback Troy  
Aikman's passes, but perhaps their biggest play was Miller's sack 
of Aikman on a fourth-and-1 early in the fourth quarter, ending any 
hope of a miracle comeback by the Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew they would try a bootleg, and since Aikman's  
right-handed, I thought it would come to my side,'' Miller said. 
``They called timeout when we stacked up against the run, so I knew 
they would pass.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona stopped Dallas on another fourth-and-1 in the first  
quarter, stuffing Emmitt Smith for a 1-yard loss at the Cardinals 
8. Aikman also threw incomplete on a fourth-and-5 play deep in 
Arizona territory in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Defensive back Aeneas Williams, who will play in his fifth  
consecutive Pro Bowl, said the secret of turning 73 points in two 
games to seven points Saturday was that ``we declared war on the 
state of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew there would be some casualties, but we didn't care. We  
endured to the end. That's what we had to do -- never, ever give 
up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona had lost 16 of 17 overall and nine straight to the  
Cowboys in Texas Stadium, a fact that bothered Miller, playing his 
fifth year. 
</P>
<P>
	``They didn't respect us, and we had to make plays to turn that  
around,'' Miller said. ``They thought we were a joke. 
</P>
<P>
	``It means a lot to win a playoff game, but to come here to  
Dallas and do it, it makes it all the sweeter to come in here and 
dominate them.''

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton got up early Saturday to  
catch the National Gallery of Art's popular Vincent van Gogh 
exhibit, which ends this weekend. The 72-painting collection, on 
loan from the Van Gogh Foundation in Amsterdam, is estimated to 
have drawn 450,000 visitors since it opened in early October. 
</P>
<P>
	As scores of tourists waited in the cold for tickets to the  
exhibit's 10 a.m. opening, the presidential motorcade entered the 
gallery through a side entrance. President Clinton saw the exhibit 
with his daughter, Chelsea, who returns to her sophomore year at 
Stanford University this weekend. The Clintons arrived at the 
National Gallery at 8:30 a.m. and stayed for about an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent days, lines to the van Gogh exhibit have stretched six  
blocks and started at 6 a.m. The National Gallery gives out 2,000 
free tickets each day; scalpers and agencies have recently sold 
tickets at up to $125 a piece. The van Gogh exhibit travels next to 
the Los Angeles County Art Museum, where it will go on display Jan.

<HEADLINE> Seifert Closer to Panthers Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- George Seifert is close to an agreement  
with the Carolina Panthers to become their new head coach, The 
Charlotte Observer reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper, citing sources, said ``substantial progress'' had  
been made in the negotiations and that a multiyear deal could be 
announced by early next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Seifert wouldn't discuss the status of his negotiations with the  
Panthers on Friday, but did confirm he was a coaching candidate. 
Seifert met with Carolina owner Jerry Richardson in Charlotte 
earlier this week, but declined to say whether he had been offered 
the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't answer that one way or the other,'' Seifert said.  
``What I can say is there are conversations going on. I would 
imagine everyone involved has other options to consider.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Richardson nor his son Mark, the team president, could  
be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one other team interested in Seifert, the Baltimore  
Ravens, dropped him from its list of prospective candidates 
Thursday, apparently because he's working on a deal with the 
Panthers. The Seattle Seahawks also are interested in Seifert, but 
haven't been nearly as aggressive as Carolina in pursuing him. 
</P>
<P>
	Seifert has been out of coaching the past two years. He won two  
Super Bowl championships and compiled the best winning percentage 
in NFL history -- .755 with a record of 108-35 -- during seven 
seasons in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Seifert wants control over player personnel decisions, but isn't  
insisting on the title of coach/general manager, the newspaper 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren wants that dual role, and is widely regarded as the  
league's hottest coaching candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Panthers already are working on assembling a staff of  
assistant coaches. Tony Wise, most recently the assistant head 
coach of the Chicago Bears, is the top choice to be the offensive 
line coach and is scheduled to come to Charlotte early next week 
for an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Three offensive assistants from former coach Dom Capers' staff --  
coordinator Gil Haskell, tight ends coach Don Breaux and wide 
receivers coach Richard Williamson -- have been retained.

	JOHNSON CITY, Tenn. (AP) -- Doctors delivered a baby boy from the  
body of a woman who was fatally injured in a house fire.

<P>
	The unnamed, full-term baby boy was in critical condition early  
today at the Johnson City Medical Center.

<HEADLINE> Springer Doesn't Defend Virtue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jerry Springer doesn't think his trashy talk  
show is evil. Still, don't expect him to spend a lot of effort 
defending its virtue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would argue against it being bad, but there's certainly  
nothing of sustaining value,'' Springer says in the January issue 
of Esquire magazine. ``It's chewing gum. I could hardly with a 
straight face say anything else. I don't think I could even concoct 
a speech saying this is important for America to watch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Springer, the son of German-Jewish Holocaust refugees, came to  
the United States from England when he was 4 years old. The 
lawyer-turned-politician became mayor of Cincinnati before turning 
to television. 
</P>
<P>
	His talk show that often features spurned lovers, cross-dressers  
and meddling relatives is known for onstage fighting between 
guests. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of funny, because I've never been in a fight in my  
life,'' Springer said. ``I mean, Phoebe Nelaboff pushed me into the 
bushes in third grade on the way to school. But short of that, I 
honestly don't remember being in a physical fight in my life.''

<HEADLINE> Desert Ladyo Wins Monrovia Handicap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) -- Desert Lady, making her second American  
start, took the lead midway through the stretch and then held off 
32-1 longshot Sweet Mazarine to win Saturday's $108,500 Monrovia 
Handicap at Santa Anita by one length. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Corey Nakatani and carrying 116 pounds, Desert Lady  
covered 6 1/2 furlongs on turf in 1:14 2-5 and paid $10.60, $5.60 and 
$4. 
</P>
<P>
	The win was the third in 10 career starts for Desert Lady and  
was worth $65,100, raising the career earnings of the 4-year-old 
Irish-bred daughter of Danehill to $107,501. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweet Mazarine, ridden by Corey Black and carrying 118 pounds,  
crossed the finish line a head in front of Supercilious and 
returned $20 and $7.20. 
</P>
<P>
	Supercilious, ridden by Laffit Pincay and carrying 119 pounds,  
was another head in front of Desert Drama at the wire and paid $4 
to show. 
</P>
<P>
	Following Desert Drama across the finish line in the race for  
older fillies and mares were Plus, Statua and Morgan J. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan J., the 8-5 favorite, broke stride and lost her chance  
when crossing the dirt track strip of the turf course turning for 
home.

<HEADLINE> Buckeyes Win Probably Not Enough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- If it's not a team from Michigan beating them  
on the field, it's a team from Florida beating them in the polls. 
Either way, the Ohio State Buckeyes keep coming up short in their 
bid for a national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, the Buckeyes pulled out a late win over  
undefeated Arizona State in the Rose Bowl, but had to settle for 
No. 2 when Florida beat top-ranked Florida State for the national 
title. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State now appears headed for the same fate.  
</P>
<P>
	``We gave it our best shot,'' coach John Cooper said Saturday  
morning after Ohio State's 24-14 victory over Texas A&AMP;M in the 
Sugar Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	He won't give up hope on the third-ranked Buckeyes' first  
national championship since 1968 until after the Fiesta Bowl on 
Monday night between No. 1 Tennessee (12-0) and No. 2 Florida State 
(11-1). 
</P>
<P>
	The Fiesta winner is the automatic choice for national champion  
in the coaches' poll, but Cooper has said all week that an ugly win 
by the Seminoles would give Ohio State a right to claim a share of 
the title. 
</P>
<P>
	``I may watch that game and say, 'Hey, these teams are better  
than us.' But I don't think that will be the case,'' Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether voters in the AP poll agree with him is another story.  
</P>
<P>
	Those who tuned in to the Sugar Bowl saw the Buckeyes roll to  
432 yards against the Texas A&AMP;M Wrecking Crew defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``People who saw the game saw, particularly in the first half,  
how dominant we were,'' Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Three touchdowns in a span of 6 1/2 minutes in the first quarter  
almost blew the Aggies out of the Superdome, but the Buckeyes 
managed only a chip-shot field goal the rest of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a fast start, but we missed some opportunities to put  
more points on the board,'' said Joe Germaine, who threw an Ohio 
State bowl-record 38 passes trying. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter how impressive Cooper thought the Buckeyes were, he  
admitted it could have been much better. As receiver David Boston 
talked Saturday morning about whether he would return for his 
senior season, Cooper thumbed through the play-by-play sheet on the 
table and highlighted one play after another. 
</P>
<P>
	It's amazing he still had any ink left in the pen.  
</P>
<P>
	The Buckeyes had 210 yards rushing, but couldn't pick up a  
4th-and-1 from the 24 leading 21-7 early in the second quarter. 
Boston, the Sugar Bowl's MVP after catching 11 passes for 105 
yards, couldn't handle a perfectly thrown pass in the end zone on 
the next possession. 
</P>
<P>
	Late in the first half, Germaine was falling forward when he  
spotted Matt Keller alone at the goal line, but his pass came up 
inches short. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State went 40 yards on the first series of the second half,  
only to miss a field goal. Another 12-play, 50-yard drive also came 
up empty when Dan Stultz's 47-yard field goal hit the upright. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Aggies' only touchdown of the second half was set up by  
two third-and-long penalties -- one that negated an interception, 
another that put Texas A&AMP;M in scoring position. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what kept it from being a blowout,'' Cooper said.  
</P>
<P>
	Could that ultimately doom the Buckeyes?  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if it should,'' Cooper said. ``But it probably  
could.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What haunts the Buckeyes more is the 28-24 loss at home to  
unranked Michigan State, which knocked them from No. 1 after 10 
straight weeks. Two years ago, it was a home loss to Michigan that 
gave Ohio State its only loss of the season, and denied Cooper and 
the Buckeyes yet again. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of great coaches who haven't won a national  
championship,'' he said. ``You've got to be fortunate to go 
undefeated. Sometimes it's out of your control. I've got the 
greatest respect in the world for Bobby Bowden, but Bobby's never 
had an undefeated football team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No, but Bowden has a national championship. And if his Seminoles  
beat the Vols in the Fiesta Bowl on Monday night, he'll likely have 
another one.

<HEADLINE> Dallas Stars Become NHL Powerhouse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- One hand is enough to count the number of losses  
the Dallas Stars have this season in 35 games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars have become an NHL powerhouse, beating teams with a  
combination of a high-powered offense and airtight defense. All 
while compiling a league-best 24-5-6 record. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, we're playing so often that we have a good  
chemistry going and we know what we're doing,'' Brett Hull said. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, they're doing it better than they did last season, when  
the Stars won the President's Trophy for the best regular-season 
record and advanced to the Western Conference finals. This season, 
the Stars are six points ahead of their 1997-98 pace. 
</P>
<P>
	With Friday's 2-1 overtime victory over the Phoenix Coyotes, the  
Stars are 11-0-3 since Dec. 4 for a franchise-record 14-game 
unbeaten streak. That ties this season's league best by the Coyotes 
and includes the league's longest road undefeated streak (7-0-2). 
</P>
<P>
	The inconsistency that plagued the team when their schedule was  
lax in the first two months of the season -- four and five days 
between games wasn't uncommon -- is gone. 
</P>
<P>
	It all changed during December, when Dallas played 15 games -- 10  
on the road. Even before the season, Stars coach Ken Hitchcock had 
expressed concern that Dallas' aging lineup -- the oldest in the NHL 
-- would have trouble withstanding December's grueling schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's had the opposite effect. The Stars had 11 wins during  
December, a team record for victories in one month. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our team has learned about the level of emotion that you need  
to have to be a consistently competitive club,'' Hitchcock said. 
``We've won and we've lost because of it the last two seasons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The last time the Stars lost was a month ago against lowly  
Vancouver. Dallas responded with a 6-2 victory over the Edmonton 
Oilers the following night. 
</P>
<P>
	The streak also includes a 3-1 victory over the defending  
Stanley Cup champion Red Wings at Joe Louis Arena, where the Stars 
had been 1-17-2 in their previous 20 games. Detroit has not beaten 
Dallas in three meetings this season, and was 18 points behind the 
Stars before Saturday's games. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas' strength is a deep, balanced lineup that's as good at  
attacking as it is at defending. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've got two excellent scoring lines and two good checking  
lines,'' Boston coach Pat Burns said. ``The checking lines are the 
key. Guys like (Guy) Carbonneau and (Mike) Keane and (Brian) 
Skrudland know their roles. They're not after bonus points. They 
want to win and they know how to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, the Stars' role players are scoring.  
</P>
<P>
	In Thursday's 6-1 win over Boston, 13 Dallas players contributed  
to the scoring, including defenseman Craig Ludwig, who got his 
first goal in 156 games. Forward Tony Hrkac, a minor-league castoff 
the past four seasons, scored the game-winner against Ottawa Dec. 
20. Grant Marshall, who had 9 goals and 19 points last season, 
already has 8 goals and 15 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas also has benefited from a stingy defense and great  
goaltending. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas' 67 goals-against is second only to the Coyotes 63. Ed  
Belfour has a glittering goals-against average of 1.87 and backup 
Roman Turek is undefeated (6-0-2). 
</P>
<P>
	The success of the Stars' goaltending tandem, Burns said, was  
attributable to the defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have big and experienced defensemen who don't make  
mistakes,'' Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them are Derian Hatcher and Richard Matvichuk, who are  
among the top hitters in the league and lead the team in 
plus-minus. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, it's made for an unbeatable combination over the past  
month.

<HEADLINE> Chicago Being Transformed Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- It is called the City of Big Shoulders, a tough  
town whose image is rooted in a brawling, bloody past that's part 
truth and part fiction. 
</P>
<P>
	Don't bother trying to keep up with Chicago, Mark Twain advised  
more than a century ago. ``She outgrows her prophecies faster than 
she can make them. She is always a novelty; for she is never the 
Chicago you saw when you passed through the last time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sure enough, those Big Shoulders are shrugging again, putting  
Chicago through yet another transformation. 
</P>
<P>
	Piece by piece, the city of 2.7 million is being reshaped, both  
by market forces and by a mayor with the political clout and 
financing to realize his vision of a post-industrial city of public 
spaces, greenery and a booming tourist economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Tourists still take buses along the Al Capone trail. But the 27  
million who visited Chicago in 1997 mostly came for the shopping, 
the architecture and the thriving theater scene, according to city 
figures. Capone himself wouldn't recognize the place. He'd find 
flowers and trees planted along the streets, baskets of flowers 
dangling from old-fashioned wrought-iron lampposts and planters 
overflowing with prairie grass and mums. 
</P>
<P>
	It goes beyond pretty. A lakefront highway has been moved. An  
airport is to become a park. Funky galleries in the River North 
neighborhood are overshadowed by ``eatertainment'' outlets such as 
Planet Hollywood and the Hard Rock Cafe. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Capone's Chicago'' museum, a kitschy tourist trap, has  
given way to the big green frog of the Rain Forest Cafe. Old market 
streets that once were home to Greek grocers and peep shows have 
become European-style boulevards lined with flowers and 
cigar-and-martini-intensive restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackhammers clatter away on construction projects across the  
Loop. The Goodman Theater is building a new home. Nearby, the 
historic Oriental Theatre has been rescued from a seedy decline 
with a grand renovation. 
</P>
<P>
	The city has rebuilt itself in a big way before, of course. By  
1875, scant evidence of the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 remained. 
</P>
<P>
	Some compare the changes to the remaking of Paris in the  
mid-19th century, when Baron Haussmann uprooted whole neighborhoods 
to create the grand boulevards of the modern French capital. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chicago doesn't quite have that kind of medieval heritage to  
destroy. But as neighborhoods change, as old stores, taverns, 
houses, disappear, people miss them,'' says University of Chicago 
political scientist Neil Harris. 
</P>
<P>
	``The image of Chicago is of the El, the stockyards, the steel  
mills, but that in fact is no longer the way the city is,'' Harris 
says. ``There's an image of Chicago becoming feminized almost, if 
you use old gender categories.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago feminized? The rough-and-tumble Windy City on Lake  
Michigan? The Prohibition-era stamping ground of the crime 
syndicate? The birthplace of Playboy magazine? 
</P>
<P>
	This is the can-do city that built the world's tallest  
skyscraper, and reversed the flow of its river to curb disease. The 
University of Chicago produced America's first Nobel Prize-winning 
scientist. This is the metropolis that writers from Rudyard Kipling 
to Norman Mailer have described as the most American city of all. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, says Larry Bennett, a political science professor at DePaul  
University, ``It is becoming a theme park for tourists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But that's a lament heard in many great American and European  
cities in the post-industrial age, and it isn't shared by Mayor 
Richard M. Daley, Chicago's version of Baron Haussmann. 
</P>
<P>
	Daley speaks of the changes with the passion of an architect or  
urban planner, reeling off the names of schools that have been 
improved, parks built, streets beautified. He sounds like the proud 
proprietor of a family business; after all, a Daley has run Chicago 
for more than 30 of the last 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The city's like a big puzzle,'' Daley says. ``There's more to  
a city than concrete and steel. There's life in the city. We're 
making it a city to live in, to raise your children in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His father, Mayor Richard J. Daley, was immortalized as ``The  
Boss,'' an old-school politician who ran the storied Democratic 
Machine and whose name seems forever linked with the image of 
baton-swinging police during the 1968 Democratic National 
Convention. 
</P>
<P>
	But that Daley and that convention are as firmly in the city's  
past as the St. Valentine's Day Massacre, or the stockyards, which 
closed for good in 1971. The Daley currently in City Hall brought 
the Democrats back in 1996, putting the ghost of convention past to 
rest. 
</P>
<P>
	This Daley is a thoroughly modern mayor, an ex-prosecutor and  
mountain bike enthusiast with a passion for architecture and urban 
life. But while he may be a kinder, gentler Boss, he enjoys 
something close to political carte blanche in reshaping the city. 
The city council does his bidding and the administration in 
Washington is friendly and often comes through with grants for 
Daley's projects. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's actually sort of thrilling,'' says Stanley Tigerman, one  
of the city's best-known architects. He compliments Daley for 
trying ``to find somehow a bridge between the environment and 
profits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Now if we could figure out how to keep the big developers from  
entering into the fray or to continue to motivate them without 
giving away the store.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's the trick.  
</P>
<P>
	Beautification is hard to knock. But critics cite Daley's  
campaign to rid the streets of newsstands and pushcart vendors; the 
theme restaurants that draw tourists to the fast-growing River 
North area, and the proliferation of chain stores where 
neighborhood businesses once thrived. 
</P>
<P>
	``How many Starbucks does a nation need?'' asks Wim Wiewel of  
the University of Illinois-Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of it I think doesn't have to do with any grand plan but  
is the coming together of the economic restructuring, the 
demographic changes and the very positive economic cycle,'' says 
Wiewel, dean of the College of Urban Planning and Public Affairs at 
UIC. 
</P>
<P>
	The university itself is expanding, and taking criticism that it  
is destroying a piece of old Chicago by pushing aside the old 
Maxwell Street market, a gritty, grungy street bazaar immortalized 
in Chicago blues songs, where merchants sold everything from 
hubcaps to stereos to Polish sausage slathered with grilled onions. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Chicagoans can quote Daniel Burnham's famous comment on his  
1907 plan for the city: ``Make no little plans; they have no magic 
to stir men's blood ... make big plans; aim high in hope and 
work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the city has always thought in grand scale, taking pride in  
having the biggest buildings (the Merchandise Mart is so big it has 
its own ZIP Code), busiest airport (O'Hare International) and 
winningest basketball team (the Chicago Bulls). 
</P>
<P>
	Architect Tigerman is delighted by some of Chicago's smaller  
changes, but many of the larger projects, he says, ``I don't think 
are so wonderful. There's more and more below-grade stuff and there 
will be more of the same.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One project that draws his ire is the North Bridge entertainment  
complex going up a block west of Michigan Avenue, with its planned 
Disney ``virtual amusement park'' and ESPN restaurant and bar. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney also is adding a store on North Michigan Avenue, where it  
will share a building with a Saks Fifth Avenue men's store. Retail 
vacancy rates on the street are a minuscule 1.3 percent and 
ground-floor space rents for $200 a square foot. 
</P>
<P>
	Just east of the Loop, the city plans to use 16 acres of weedy  
rail yard and outdoor parking lot as a site for a bandshell with 
seating for 30,000, reflecting pool-skating rink, sculpture garden, 
below-ground parking and transit connections. 
</P>
<P>
	Farther south, the city plans to close Meigs Field, a  
small-plane airport on the lakefront, and turn it into a park in 
2002. If the plan goes ahead -- politics stalled it once before -- 
the lakefront will be lined by 25 miles of parks from Evanston to 
the Indiana state line. 
</P>
<P>
	That includes the new Museum Campus, a green space created by  
moving Lake Shore Drive off the swath of land that connects the 
Shedd Aquarium, Field Museum of Natural History and Adler 
Planetarium. 
</P>
<P>
	While acknowledging that he hasn't followed developments too  
closely, author and commentator Studs Terkel says he's not 
impressed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The key to Chicago is not downtown,'' he says. ``That's great  
that the Loop's coming back, with theaters and everything. But I 
still think neighborhoods are the key to Chicago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor denies he is neglecting the neighborhoods.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's more money being spent there than on Michigan  
Avenue,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Daley envisions neighborhood transformation starting with public  
schools; he's spending $50 million at 100 schools over five years 
to replace asphalt with grass and trees. He wants to turn school 
grounds into campuses to be used by the public, while improving 
education standards. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I can't turn that around, then all these other things are  
for naught,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	The contrast between old and new Chicago is particularly vivid  
west of the Loop on Randolph Street, where tony Urban Hair Werks 
sits hard by the giant egg that marks Pepe's Meat Packing. Trendy 
restaurants have sprouted up almost as quickly as the black-eyed 
Susans and purple cone flowers that filled the planters in summer, 
and affluent young people are buying up condos and lofts as fast as 
the old buildings are renovated. 
</P>
<P>
	Wholesale grocer Larry Pienta notes approvingly that the city  
helps neighborhood businesses spruce up their facades, and that 
people are starting to spend money to make the neighborhood look 
nice. 
</P>
<P>
	But Pienta doesn't like the way new flower planters make it  
impossible to see cross-traffic, and he has little sympathy for new 
residents who complain about the noise of the delivery trucks or 
the smell of the butcher shops. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you buy something down here, you should buy it with your  
eyes wide open,'' he says, standing by barrels of dried beans and 
herbs. ``This is a market. There are going to be smells; there is 
going to be noise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smells and noise notwithstanding, ``Chicago is a very beautiful  
city,'' says Harris, the professor. ``When I have friends and 
family come from the East to see Chicago they're always taken 
aback.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But then, the city's image as the home of Capone and Saul  
Bellow's Augie March, hog butcher to the world and steel maker for 
the nation -- ``Stormy, husky, brawling, City of the Big 
Shoulders,'' in the words of the poet Carl Sandburg -- hasn't 
reflected reality for years. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, Harris chuckles, ``We haven't had cattle killing here  
for a long time.''

<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Dr. Claire Louise Caudill, a family  
practitioner who delivered 8,000 babies and lent her name to the 
local hospital, died Thursday. She was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the deliveries she performed were in rural homes with no  
electricity. She stopped delivering babies at age 70 but continued 
to practice medicine at her patients' insistence. 
</P>
<P>
	Caudill and her longtime nurse and friend, Susie Halbleib,  
struggled to improve health care in the region. They were devoted 
to women's health issues and pushed for better prenatal care. 
</P>
<P>
	Caudill was instrumental in establishing Morehead's St. Claire  
Medical Center, which was named in her honor. She helped raise 
$294,000 in 1960 to build the facility and helped secure staffing 
for it. She was its first chief of staff, from 1963 to 1972.

while shoveling snow outside his home Saturday, WQAD-TV officials 
said. He was 65. 
</P>
<P>
	King was the anchor of the WQAD-TV's weekend news and host of  
the station's ``On The Road'' series. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jim was a friend, mentor and colleague to everyone at the  
station and extremely active in the Quad City community,'' Marion 
Menginnis, WQAD-TV president and general manager, said in a 
release. 
</P>
<P>

 *Robert Emory Kirby    	
</P>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Robert Emory Kirby, who fought off bankruptcy  
and took on uranium suppliers in nine years as chairman and chief 
executive officer of Westinghouse Electric Corp., died Thursday 
after a series of strokes. He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirby took over Westinghouse on Feb. 3, 1975, when the  
corporation had just seen its stock fall to about $8 a share, down 
from a high of $55 in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	He quickly rid the company of money-losing endeavors, reduced  
the work force from 166,000 to 132,000, sold businesses 
representing $2.5 billion of revenue and compressed 144 
Westinghouse divisions into 37. 
</P>
<P>
	He tackled what the company called ``the uranium crisis,'' when  
prices for the mineral soared from about $6 a pound to more than 
$40 a pound in 1975. Westinghouse, which used uranium as a primary 
source of fuel to supply nuclear plants, faced potential 
liabilities of more than $2 billion. He was ultimately able to 
negotiate with 27 utilities that had sued the company for breach of 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Westinghouse sales during Kirby's tenure nearly doubled to $9.7  
billion, and the company acquired Teleprompter, one of the nation's 
biggest cable television operators, for $646 million. That move 
doubled the size of Westinghouse's broadcasting operations and 
positioned it as a player in the communications industry. He 
retired in 1983.

everything from Igor Sikorsky's first helicopter flight to feature 
images for the Post Publishing Co. during his half-century career 
there, died Thursday in South Carolina. He was 90. 
</P>
<P>
	Mathewson's first photographs were published in 1921 when he was  
13. He landed his first job at age 17 at The Providence Journal,

</P>
<P>
	He had a short stint at the Observer Dispatch in Utica, N.Y.,  
before joining the staff of the Bridgeport Post in 1933. 
</P>
<P>
	In his photo of Sikorsky demonstrating his new VS-300  
helicopter, Mathewson showed several other news photographers in 
the foreground, setting his photo apart from all the other shots of 
the historic flight, as well as giving it some perspective. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years, he photographed the presidential campaigns of  
Wendell Wilkie and Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the 1944 Hartford 
circus fire, and the launching of the atomic submarine U.S.S. 
Nautilus in New London in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1987, Mathewson retired from the now-defunct Post Publishing  
Co., which had owned the Bridgeport Post, the Sunday Post and the 
Morning Telegram.

stepsons.

<HEADLINE> NFL Had Strange Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Welcome to Wonderland and the NFL rabbit hole, where the Mad  
Hatter and the March Hare would feel right at home. In this 
cockeyed football season, when heads turned out to be tails and Mr. 
Magoo seemed to be refereeing some of the games, a tea party might 
be more appropriate than a playoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Set the table, Alice, and consider a few matters.  
</P>
<P>
	Item: Minnesota invested $15.5 million in quarterback Brad  
Johnson, then found out that Randall Cunningham wasn't used up, 
after all. Then Buffalo invested $25 million in quarterback Rob 
Johnson and found out that Doug Flutie wasn't too short, after all. 
</P>
<P>
	Item: Denver won 13 straight games and just as Miami was  
marshaling the alumni from the perfect '72 Dolphins to make a 
stand, oops, the Broncos stumbled against the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	Item: Five coaches got fired on the same day, four in the same  
hour, and two of them -- Dom Capers and Ray Rhodes -- were immediate 
candidates for other head coaching jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	A strange season, indeed.  
</P>
<P>
	It was strangest, perhaps, for the Atlanta Falcons and New York  
Jets, who are sitting at home on the first weekend of the playoffs. 
There's nothing unusual about that. These two teams have been down 
for so long, it was beginning to look like up. They're supposed to 
be at home at this time of year. 
</P>
<P>
	What's different is that by next weekend, when the playoff  
intensity gets turned up, the Jets and Falcons will be in the 
middle of the mix, serious contenders for the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Oh, Alice, something is all wrong here.  
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons and Jets have been longtime members of the NFL  
wilderness, two teams wandering through the league with little 
direction and less hope. And now, in the same strange season, both 
are division champions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets won the AFC East -- their first title in 29 years. The  
last time the franchise finished first it was in the old AFL, which 
was merged out of business a year after that. There is no evidence 
that the two events were connected. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, every other franchise has finished first -- even  
Atlanta, which was stuck by some kind of geographical joke in the 
NFC West, alongside five-time Super Bowl champion San Francisco. 
The Jets, however, managed to avoid the top of their division, 
acting as if some kind of magnet was pulling them in the other 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
	It got so dreadful that four years ago, during one of the team's  
myriad coaching changes, reclusive owner Leon Hess felt obliged to 
come out of hiding long enough to issue a plaintive plea. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm 80 years old,'' the oilman said. ``I need results now.''  
</P>
<P>
	Touched, the Jets responded by going 3-13, followed by 1-15.  
</P>
<P>
	And then, along came Bill Parcells.  
</P>
<P>
	Overnight, it seemed, the pieces of the puzzle began falling  
into place. The Jets won nine games last season and a team-record 
12 this season. And the wondrous part is that 17 survivors from the 
1-15 morass are on the roster of the AFC East champions. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, Hess has his results. Why things are so good now, you  
can even buy his gas for under a $1 a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there are the Falcons.  
</P>
<P>
	An afterthought team -- created at the height of the AFL-NFL war  
in a sort of preemptive land grab, then consigned to the same 
division as the 49ers -- Atlanta usually did little more than 
provide two almost automatic wins for the perpetual NFC West 
champions. 
</P>
<P>
	Once, in 1980, Atlanta won the division title. Then, almost in  
retribution, the team finished over .500 only three times in the 
next 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
	And then, along came Dan Reeves.  
</P>
<P>
	Just like his pal, Parcells, he turned the team around. Atlanta  
won five of its final six games last season. Then the Falcons went 
on a 14-2 tear this season, earning them the second NFC West title 
in franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
	Naturally, one of the Falcons' losses was against their old  
pals, the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
	And the other?  
</P>
<P>
	Why, against the rejuvenated Jets, of course.  
</P>
<P>
	So, Alice, would you like one or two sugars in your tea?

<HEADLINE> Fight of the Aged Still May Be Held </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Don't count out George Foreman and Larry Holmes  
just yet. 
</P>
<P>
	Promoter Roger Levitt says the former heavyweight champs may  
still fight on Jan. 23. The 12-round match, scheduled for the 
Houston Astrodome, was called off Friday, according to Foreman's 
brother. 
</P>
<P>
	``George says it's off,'' Roy Foreman told The Associated Press,  
adding that Levitt did not meet the deadline for paying Foreman the 
remaining $9 million of his $10 million purse. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were supposed to have the money last week and they didn't  
have it,'' Roy Foreman said. ``George gave them an extra week and 
they still didn't have it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes hadn't been told that the fight was off.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what's going on,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	But Levitt said Friday he still expected the deal to be closed  
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``George Foreman will have his letter of credit,'' Levitt told  
KRIV television. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ninety-five percent of the financial markets have been away  
for the holidays,'' he said. ``George knows the pressure we've been 
under and his lawyers have been extremely kind in working with us. 
Everybody is trying to get this on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The match, scheduled for two weeks after Foreman's 50th  
birthday, was to carry a $39.95 closed circuit television price 
tag. Holmes, who was 49 on Nov. 3, had promised it would be worth 
the money. 
</P>
<P>
	``I appreciate George giving me the opportunity to whip on him a  
little bit,'' Holmes said when the fight was announced in 
September. ``He says the same thing about me, so you got to buy a 
ticket to see it. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will be a classic. It's history. It's two men who over  
the decades never fought. Two men with lots of pride. Two men will 
give it all and only one will win. I'm sure that it will be me and 
George thinks it will be him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Foreman, who became the oldest heavyweight champion when he  
regained the WBA crown at age 45 by knocking out Michael Moorer on 
Nov. 5, 1994, seemed eager for the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``Larry Holmes was a second-rate fighter sparring for (Muhammad)  
Ali when I had my original career,'' he said. ``This is the only 
time this fight could be made. This is the only time it is 
important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 99, the combined age of the fighters was believed to be the  
highest in boxing history. Holmes' career record is 66-6 and 
Foreman's is 76-5. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't care if we're 900 years old,'' Holmes said. ``You got  
two old guys almost the same age that are going to fight. We might 
not fight like young guys today, but we are going to fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was if the money was in place.  
</P>
<P>
	The fight ran into trouble a week ago when one of its major  
backers pulled out. Levitt claimed a replacement backer had come 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the promoter said he was going through ``financial  
machinations'' with the two fighters and that the letters of credit 
would be deposited by Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had an extension for the letters of credit until the close  
of business Los Angeles time (Thursday),'' Levitt said. ``We might 
need another extension.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Foreman wasn't waiting. He received a nonrefundable $1 million  
deposit and Holmes got a $400,000 down payment on his $4 million 
purse.

<HEADLINE> Sen. Bob Smith To Run for President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Republican Sen. Bob Smith said Saturday he  
planned to officially file his candidacy for president on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, a conservative who has made the rounds in Iowa and his  
home state of New Hampshire to gauge support for his candidacy, 
said he would be the first to file with the Federal Election 
Commission, though several others have established exploratory 
committees. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said the reception he got in the 20 or so states he has  
visited in the past 1 1/2 years convinced him to run, though he has 
barely registered in the polls, even in New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cynics out there, doomsayers, say you don't show up in the  
polls. The polls don't mean anything,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he would conduct a grassroots campaign and spend a lot  
of time in New Hampshire and Iowa, the states with the earliest 
primary and earliest caucuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, a former teacher who also was in the real estate  
business, served three terms in the House of Representatives before 
winning a Senate seat in 1990, and winning re-election in 1996.

<HEADLINE> NJ Sen. Compiles Historical Quotes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- He is, as anyone on Capitol Hill will tell  
you, a prolific talker. But Sen. Robert Torricelli also pays 
attention to the words of others. 
</P>
<P>
	The New Jersey Democrat is compiling memorable quotes from  
throughout history, as well as great speeches from the 20th 
century. The quotes may eventually be published; the speeches are 
being turned into a book, ``In Our Own Words: The American 
Century,'' to be released this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In this project, he is emulating the senior Democratic senator,  
West Virginia's Robert C. Byrd, who has written a history of the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Torricelli's book will include the congressional testimony of  
Titanic survivor Olaus Abelseth; Woodrow Wilson's World War I 
declaration; a pre-game speech by football coach Vince Lombardi; 
Christmas greetings beamed from the orbiting Apollo 8 astronauts; 
and the words of prosecutor Marcia Clark at the O.J. Simpson trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Like their speeches, the speechmakers in the book are both noble  
and ignoble. 
</P>
<P>
	Here is Al Capone at a farewell press conference in 1927: ``Let  
the worthy citizens of Chicago get their liquor the best they can. 
I'm sick of the job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is a Ku Klux Klan Grand Dragon speaking in North Carolina  
in 1923: ``(T)he strength of unity and completeness lies in the 
fact that there is only one Klan -- one Klan, one nation, one and 
indivisible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torricelli explained, ``I want someone to be able to read these  
speeches and without the filter of a historian or journalist, 
understand the 20th century in the words of leading Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among his favorites is William Faulkner's Nobel Prize acceptance  
speech in 1950, a time of Cold War anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that man will not merely endure; he will prevail,''  
Faulkner said. ``He is immortal, not because he alone among 
creatures has an inexhaustible voice, but because he has a soul, a 
spirit capable of compassion and sacrifice and endurance. The 
poet's and writer's duty is to write about these things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torricelli collected quotes long before he first ran for  
Congress in 1982. Having concluded there was no adequate book of 
quotations, he compiled his own -- 174 pages of ruminations 
throughout the centuries on war and peace, art and economics, life 
and death, global affairs and civil rights, even insults (Winston 
Churchill on a member of Parliament: ``He spoke without a note and 
almost without a point.'') 
</P>
<P>
	One copy of the compilation sits on Torricelli's office desk, a  
handy reference tool for when he works on speeches of his own. He 
said he may approach Rutgers University Press about publishing the 
compilation. 
</P>
<P>
	Torricelli said he was determined to compile a book on great  
speeches ever since he was a boy, when he would listen to famous 
American speeches on 33-rpm records his mother, a school librarian, 
would bring home. 
</P>
<P>
	He found a partner for his project after hearing author Andrew  
Carroll on the radio reading excerpts from his book ``Letters of a 
Nation: A Collection of Extraordinary American Letters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Carroll and the assistance of students from Rutgers and  
Princeton universities, Torricelli collected 170 great speeches for 
the upcoming book. 
</P>
<P>
	As incoming chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign  
Committee, Torricelli is expected to expand his prolific 
speechmaking to audiences nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	His political action committee published a collection of his own  
speeches and writings in 1995 as Torricelli, then a member of the 
House, prepared for his successful run for the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Torricelli has employed speech writers on occasion, but says he  
prefers to go it alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``Public officials who can't write their own speeches shouldn't  
say anything,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Midwest Socked by Big Snow Storm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- A massive winter storm arcing from Gulf Coast  
states to the upper Midwest grounded scores of New Year's flights, 
knocked out power to thousands and threatened to dump more than a 
foot of snow across the northern half of the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Highway officials warned motorists to stay off roads and  
airlines canceled flights today, hoping the storm would lift in 
time for the post-holiday traffic peak Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're urging everyone, if you don't need to be out, don't go  
out,'' said Sgt. Hubert Looney of the Missouri Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters said parts of Illinois, Indiana, Iowa and Missouri  
could get up to 15 inches of snow by tonight, with gusty winds 
creating near-blizzard conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	About a half-foot covered St. Louis by Friday night, along with  
areas of central and southeastern Illinois and central Iowa. 
Several inches fell on the Dakotas. 
</P>
<P>
	More than three dozen flights were canceled Friday at Lambert  
Airport in St. Louis and dozens of others were delayed, some for 
three hours or more. Trans World Airlines canceled all of this 
morning's flights into and out of the airport -- about 140 total. 
</P>
<P>
	In Chicago, walls of sandbags were placed along Lakeshore Drive  
to prevent waves from Lake Michigan from flooding the busy road. 
O'Hare and Midway airports assembled than 100 pieces of snow 
removal equipment, along with hundreds of cots for travelers who 
may be stranded by the storm. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now we have our crews in place, additional staff has  
been called in and is ready to go,'' Monique Bond, a spokeswoman 
for the Chicago Department of Aviation, said Friday. ``We're ready 
to go -- just waiting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	United passengers planning to fly from O'Hare should wait until  
Monday or Tuesday as the airline expects delays and cancellations, 
said spokesman Matt Triaca. Before dawn today, American Airlines 
already had canceled half of its flights in and out of O'Hare, said 
spokeswoman Mary Frances Fagan. 
</P>
<P>
	A Northwest Airlines spokesman said the Eagan, Minn.-based  
carrier had canceled about 150 flights systemwide today because of 
bad weather to the east. 
</P>
<P>
	In Indiana, state officials declared snow emergencies in 19  
counties, allowing police to ticket drivers on roads and tow cars 
parked on emergency roads. 
</P>
<P>
	Heavy, drifting snow also halted mail delivery in the  
Indianapolis area. Postmaster Mike Lamborne said the threat of 
freezing rain and icy conditions made it too dangerous for mail 
carriers to hit the streets today. 
</P>
<P>
	The weather forced Purdue University to postpone its men's  
basketball game with Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputies in Texas said tornadoes injured at least seven people  
and destroyed three mobile homes east of Huntsville. None of the 
injuries were life-threatening, said hospital spokeswoman Jill 
Baine. Both Walker and Trinity counties reported downed power lines 
and significant tree damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the state line in Arkansas, freezing rain toppled power  
lines and cut service to more than 100,000 utility customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The trouble with an ice storm like this is it's so widespread  
and it all happens all at once,'' said Dan Daugherty of Entergy 
Arkansas, the state's largest electricity supplier. ``We are 
restoring some power, but we're just not able to get ahead of the 
number going out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The storm was blamed for at least seven deaths. Six of them --  
two in Arkansas, two in Nebraska and two in Missouri -- occurred in 
traffic accidents. 
</P>
<P>
	In Edinboro, Pa., a quadriplegic college student froze to death  
after his electric wheelchair became stuck in the snow early Friday 
on his way home from a New Year's Eve party. 
</P>
<P>
	The body of Justin Bradley, 22, was found near an Edinboro  
University student union building at 2 p.m. Friday. He had left an 
off-campus party at 2 a.m. and refused an offer of a ride home, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Midwesterners headed to supermarkets and hardware stores  
Friday in search of storm supplies. In Evansville, Ind., customers 
flocked to Buehler's Buy-Low to stock up on milk, bread, eggs and 
meat. 
</P>
<P>
	``We tried to call in everybody we could,'' assistant manager  
Jeff Quirk said of the extra staff brought in to help with the 
rush.

<HEADLINE> Snow, Ice Shut Down Midwest Travel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A huge snowstorm blew across the Midwest on Saturday with  
whiteout conditions and drifts up to 8 feet high, canceling 
hundreds of airline flights, forcing motorists off roads and 
keeping mail deliverers from their appointed rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew it was going to be here one way or another,'' said  
snowplow driver Kerry Morris in Des Moines, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	By midday Saturday, snow was 13 inches deep in western Indiana's  
Parke County, and 10 inches of new snow had fallen in southwestern 
Ohio and Eldora, Iowa. Up to 15 inches was forecast in Missouri, 
and two feet was likely at Marquette, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	Wind gusting to 40 mph created blizzard conditions and northern  
Indiana's LaGrange County pulled its plows off the roads because 
snow was drifting 5 to 8 feet deep. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nasty. I wouldn't want to have to go out,'' Vickie Berkey  
said from her home near Angola, Ind. ``There's a drift in front of 
the garage and it just keeps getting bigger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 50 of Indiana's counties and cities declared snow  
emergencies, banning unnecessary travel; Indiana Gov. Frank 
O'Bannon declared a less-restrictive statewide snow emergency. 
</P>
<P>
	``The roads are impassable,'' said Pam Bright of the Indiana  
Emergency Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The Postal Service even quit delivering mail in the Indianapolis  
area. Rain, slush and freezing temperatures made it too dangerous 
for carriers to walk their routes, said Postmaster Mike Lamborne. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of travelers found themselves without a ride as  
hundreds of flights through major Midwest airports were called off. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been crazy, extremely hectic, madness,'' said Sara  
Shillito, a worker at a coffee shop in Ohio's Port Columbus 
International Airport, where one of the two runways was shut down. 
``Lots and lots of people, waiting around, walking around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	TWA canceled nearly 400 morning flights at St. Louis, its main  
hub. At Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, American canceled 
all flights through midnight Saturday and United shut down 
everything after midafternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	United spokesman Matt Triaca said anyone planning to fly out of  
O'Hare should wait until Monday -- or Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	That set up more delays and cancellations elsewhere across the  
country, including Denver and New York City's three major airports. 
Northwest Airlines shut down about 150 flights systemwide and Delta 
canceled dozens of flights to the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit's Metropolitan Airport planned to stay open through the  
storm, said spokesman Mike Conway. Crews shut down one of the three 
runways at a time to clear away snow, while thousands of travelers 
inside the terminal scrambled to rebook canceled flights. 
</P>
<P>
	Even hardy Minnesotans were grounded by the weather. The  
University of Minnesota basketball team's game at Purdue was called 
off because of the weather at West Lafayette, Ind., and the team 
was stuck at a hotel in Indianapolis because the city's airport 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
	All trips out of the Greyhound Bus station in Milwaukee were  
canceled Saturday. One of the stranded travelers was 20-year-old 
Frank Ramos, who had ridden a bus from New York City and was trying 
to get to Appleton, Wis., 100 miles north of Milwaukee, to give his 
girlfriend an engagement ring and meet her parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm trying to have a good attitude,'' Ramos said. ``I don't  
know when I'm going to get there. If I have to go walking I 
probably will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Freezing rain along the southern edge of the storm pulled down  
power lines in Arkansas and some 75,000 customers were in the dark 
Saturday, down from more than 100,000 the night before. Utilities 
said more than 11,000 customers lost power during the morning in 
northern Illinois, with widespread outages in other parts of the 
state, and some 3,000 were blacked out in Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Snow community of northern Arkansas, Dave Adkins and his  
wife and daughter did what they usually do in blackouts -- they 
pulled out the kerosene heater, turned on the gas stove, lit the 
hurricane lamps and flicked on the 12-volt television set. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of their location, they're always the last to get  
electricity back, Adkins said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in the plumb 40,'' he said. ``It's plumb rough and 40  
miles out of town.''

<HEADLINE> Ford Reincarnates 1950s Thunderbird </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Crank up the Beach Boys. The T-Bird is coming  
back. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford Motor Co. is hoping to rekindle the love affair many  
Americans had with the original 1955-57 Thunderbird when it unveils 
its concept T-Bird on Sunday at the North American International 
Auto Show's press preview. 
</P>
<P>
	Insiders say the concept car will differ little from the  
production model Ford plans to introduce for the 2001 model year. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford bills it as a modern interpretation of the classic  
roadster. 
</P>
<P>
	Styling cues from the original abound: A removable hardtop with  
porthole windows. A hood scoop. An oval egg-crate grill. There are 
even subtle little shoulders on the rear fenders that resemble the 
original's dainty fins, adorned with the same script nameplates 
from '55. 
</P>
<P>
	Just don't call the car retro, says J Mays, Ford's new design  
chief, who had a big role in the design of the very retro New 
Beetle when he worked for Volkswagen AG. ``While the Thunderbird 
concept is loaded with heritage cues, it is a decidedly modern 
machine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Based on the same chassis as the new 2000 Lincoln LS, the T-Bird  
will be offered only with the LS's 3.9-liter V8 engine and 
five-speed automatic transmission. 
</P>
<P>
	The T-bird disappeared from Ford's lineup in September 1997. By  
then it had long been a big, five-seat coupe, the kind of car that 
Americans abandoned in the early '90s. 
</P>
<P>
	But despite its many overweight years, T-Bird lovers still  
associate the name with the sprightly little roadster of the `50s, 
and images of sock hops, drive-ins and cruising down Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe that's due to the Beach Boys singing ``she'll have fun,  
fun, fun 'til her daddy takes the T-Bird away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe it was Suzanne Somers in ``American Graffiti,'' her  
platinum blond bouffant glistening as she mouthed ``I love you'' 
through the window of a white '56 T-Bird. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are only a select few nameplates that have earned their  
way into the hearts of the motoring public by establishing a true 
heritage,'' Mays said. ``Thunderbird is certainly one of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although some fans would have been satisfied with a faithful  
recreation of the original T-Bird, Ford designed the concept car to 
have a decidedly more modern look, calling the new T-Bird's styling 
``modern heritage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's similar to what Ford did with the last major redesign of  
the Mustang sports coupe, which borrowed heavily from the styling 
of the original mid `60s Mustangs. Ford's Jaguar division took the 
same approach with the XK8 roadster, which evokes the look of the 
classic E-type Jags of the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst Chris Cedergren of the market-research firm Nextrend in  
Thousand Oaks, Calif., said he expects the new T-Bird to sell well 
if it's priced right. 
</P>
<P>
	``The primary buyers are maturing baby boomers approaching their  
50s, some in the empty nest stage,'' Cedergren said. ``Others are 
at their peak earning years and want to have a fun vehicle in the 
household.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Ford prices the T-Bird under $30,000, it could sell as many  
as 60,000 a year, Cedergren said. But many analysts expect Ford to 
sacrifice volume for higher per-car profits by pricing it closer to 
$40,000, where the Mercedes-Benz SLK and Porsche Boxster compete.

<HEADLINE> Lone Sailor Operates on Himself </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Crouched over the navigation table in his tiny cabin, the  
exhausted sailor plunges the scalpel into his arm. 
</P>
<P>
	He cuts fast and deep, just as the doctor instructed.  
</P>
<P>
	Pus and blood spurt everywhere and he gasps at how far the  
infection has spread. 
</P>
<P>
	The boat heaves, shoving him against the side. Above, the wind  
shrieks through the sails. For a second, he worries as much about 
his yacht's chances of survival as his own. 
</P>
<P>
	Focus, he thinks to himself. Focus.  
</P>
<P>
	He pulls a 4-inch stick of gauze from his medical kit and pushes  
it hard into the wound. 
</P>
<P>
	The pain would make most people scream or pass out.  
</P>
<P>
	But no one will hear Viktor Yazykov if he screams. And if he  
passes out, he knows he will probably die. 
</P>
<P>
	Alone in the middle of the South Atlantic, the 50-year-old  
Russian is 1,000 miles from shore. His autopilot is broken, he has 
lost power, and his only light is a miner's lamp strapped to his 
forehead. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been at sea for 40 days, on the first leg of a grueling  
27,000-mile solo sailboat race around the world that began in 
Charleston, S.C., in September and will take competitors to Africa, 
New Zealand, around the treacherous Cape Horn to South America and 
then back to Charleston. 
</P>
<P>
	The eight-month odyssey is called Around Alone. In the churning  
ocean darkness, Viktor Yazykov has never felt so alone. 
</P>
<P>
	He has tried to follow the 14-step surgical procedure the doctor  
from Boston e-mailed him hours earlier. But he can't stop the 
bleeding, and he's afraid he is losing his arm. 
</P>
<P>
	Slumped against the bulkhead, he sips some wine. The waves are  
banging so hard against the thin carbon fiber hull, it feels like 
they are sloshing around in his brain. 
</P>
<P>
	With his good arm, Yazykov reaches for his laptop.  
</P>
<P>
	``Have been sitting on the bloody cabin floor almost completely  
naked all covered with blood with right arm lashed up and watching 
as my life blood drop by drop leaving me,'' he types. 
</P>
<P>
	Who will find me here, he wonders, as he closes his eyes. Who  
will see this terrible mess? 
</P>
<P>
	Hurtling downwind into the dark, Yazykov's yacht would set a  
record that November night, covering a total of 239 miles in 24 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
	But would Yazykov survive?  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of miles away, in the heart of Boston, Dr. Dan Carlin  
had spent the day in his cozy, crimson-colored office at the New 
England Medical center. A 39-year-old former ship's medical 
officer, he runs a practice called WorldClinic that provides 
emergency care, through computer technology, to people around the 
globe. 
</P>
<P>
	His specialty: how and why people die at sea.  
</P>
<P>
	Carlin, a sailor himself, was the doctor assigned to Around  
Alone. He had met all the competitors, had fitted their boats with 
emergency medical kits: scalpels and staplers, antibiotics, dental 
cement. 
</P>
<P>
	He expected calls during the race. Sailors get banged up  
stumbling about their boats, dodging booms, climbing masts, fixing 
rudders and keels. Sometimes they suffer from dehydration or 
hypothermia. Fatigue is a constant. 
</P>
<P>
	The race, which takes place every four years, has a history of  
medical emergencies and high seas rescues. Hurricanes. Icebergs. 
Dismastings. Death. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlin was sure there would be an emergency in this race too.  
But not six weeks into the race, not when skippers and their 
vessels should be at their fittest. 
</P>
<P>
	So on that crisp November day, the last thing Carlin was  
thinking about was Around Alone. In fact, he was looking forward to 
skating with his wife and children on the Boston Common after work. 
</P>
<P>
	The call from race headquarters in Charleston interrupted his  
daydreaming. Officials were worried by an e-mail from Yazykov. 
</P>
<P>
	--''My right elbow does not look good. After a day I have spent  
working on the mast...it became red and even bigger...it feels like 
it's dead.''-- 
</P>
<P>
	Carlin frowned. Patients don't come any tougher than Yazykov, a  
former Soviet commando with a chiseled body and piercing blue eyes. 
Yazykov had sailed oceans alone, fought in Afghanistan, helped 
clean up Chernobyl. Not the kind of guy to complain about a minor 
infection. 
</P>
<P>
	Clean the wound, Carlin wrote, typing into his computer. Make a  
sling. Start antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
	But he wondered: Was something more serious going on?  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Yazykov's boat, a graceful 40-foot sloop with sleek white lines  
and a distinctive canting keel, is one of the smallest in the race. 
</P>
<P>
	He is proud of the yacht he built with own hands, proud of the  
way she slices the waves, smooth and clean at speeds of up to 20 
knots. He talks to her every day, his soft voice filled with 
emotion, as though talking to a lover. 
</P>
<P>
	``Perfect,'' he tells her. ``You are just perfect.''  
</P>
<P>
	Wind of Change, he named her, built as she was during the  
tumultuous changes that swept through Russia in the early 1990s. 
She has a spirit, he says, a sense of the sea. 
</P>
<P>
	Other racers, the 60-footers in Class 1, have heaters, toilets,  
satellite phones -- and hundreds of thousands of dollars in 
professional sponsorships. The inside of Yazykov's smaller boat is 
stripped bare; everything, down to the paintwork, is designed to 
make her as light as possible. Competing in Class 2, Yazykov 
depends on volunteers and goodwill. 
</P>
<P>
	This boat, this race, is his dream.  
</P>
<P>
	``Boat, boat, boat, all these years,'' sighs his wife, Ludmila.  
``Nothing but boat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But his dream has come at enormous personal cost, including a  
bitter fight with his American partner who helped build and finance 
the yacht. The two haven't spoken since the start of the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Other things have gone wrong, too. A hurricane delayed his  
arrival in Charleston and forced him to start the race six days 
behind everyone else. He suffered food poisoning and a broken 
tooth. The elbow he bruised on the way to Charleston swelled badly. 
The autopilot broke, and so did the engine. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he was enjoying the rhythm of the race, the solitude. He  
celebrated his 50th birthday on Oct. 29 with a candlelit dinner of 
fried eggs and wine and a letter he had carried with him from 
Ludmila. 
</P>
<P>
	His celebration was short-lived.  
</P>
<P>
	On Nov. 7, Wind of Change slammed into a storm with a sickening  
crack. One of the shrouds, thin metal rods that stabilize the 
60-foot mast, snapped. 
</P>
<P>
	Yazykov spent five hours clinging to the mast, working on  
repairs. He fixed the shroud. But he had another problem. His right 
elbow, which had ached since he left Charleston, had swollen to 
five times its normal size. It didn't hurt anymore. It didn't have 
any feeling at all. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we might have a problem.''  
</P>
<P>
	Race officials were on the phone from Charleston again, with the  
latest e-mail from Yazykov. His elbow had blown up like a soft 
pillow and he wanted to cut it open. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlin started typing immediately. Clearly and concisely, he  
laid out a memo, telling Yazykov how to cut, drain and dress the 
wound. He had to be brutally clear, conveying the pain of surgery, 
while reassuring Yazykov that it was safe. There was no anesthetic 
and he couldn't let his patient be affected by a painkiller until 
the operation was over. 
</P>
<P>
	So he told the sailor how much it will hurt. And that he had no  
choice. 
</P>
<P>
	--''Make your incision rapidly. It will hurt less if you do.''--  
</P>
<P>
	Swirling through Carlin's brain was a picture of the medical  
kit, the cramped cabin, the heaving sea. 
</P>
<P>
	Fingers on a keyboard: Tap. Tap. Tap.  
</P>
<P>
	--''It hurts a great deal when you insert the gauze... Get it  
down into the depths of the wound as much as possible.''-- 
</P>
<P>
	Carlin was conscious of the time: Yazykov's engine hadn't been  
working properly, and he was using solar panels to charge his 
batteries. He would lose power after dark. Carlin was conscious of 
the language barrier: Yazykov's English was good, but was it good 
enough to fully understand medical terms? Most of all, Carlin was 
conscious that if the arm was not treated properly, the infection 
could spread, meaning loss of the arm, or worse. 
</P>
<P>
	Tap. Tap. Tap.  
</P>
<P>
	Carlin pictured the wound, the infection pouring out, the sailor  
wincing in pain. He knew Yazykov won't cry out. 
</P>
<P>
	Focus, Carlin told himself. Think of what could go wrong. Have  
you covered everything? 
</P>
<P>
	--''Take the squeeze bottle that is full of water and iodine and  
gently rinse out the pus pocket. The rinsing out will cause you 
pain.''-- 
</P>
<P>
	For an hour, Carlin typed and thought and typed some more. He  
told Yazykov to rest after surgery, to take a painkiller, to apply 
heat compresses. He reassured him that doctors would be waiting in 
Cape Town. 
</P>
<P>
	And when he couldn't think of anything else to say, he signed  
off: 
</P>
<P>
	``Good luck.''  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Yazykov is frightened. He has done everything Carlin instructed.  
But something has gone wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	The doctor never said there would be so much blood, and now it  
is everywhere, dripping over the table and the medical kit, soaking 
his pants, flowing into a red pool on the floor where it rolls with 
the motion of the boat. 
</P>
<P>
	Remembering what he learned as a soldier, he grabs two bungee  
cords and strings them together. Using his teeth and his good arm, 
he ties them around the wound, seven times, as tight as possible. 
Then he hooks the cord to an overhead handrail and pulls as hard as 
he can. 
</P>
<P>
	The bleeding stops.  
</P>
<P>
	So does all sensation in his arm.  
</P>
<P>
	Yazykov doesn't hear the wind howling anymore, hardly feels the  
pitching of the boat. The tiller is lashed down and Wind of Change 
is steering itself, racing through the darkness, surfing down 15 
foot waves. 
</P>
<P>
	Softly Yazykov talks to his arm, in the same soothing tone he  
reserves for his vessel. 
</P>
<P>
	``My poor arm,'' he says, trying to massage some feeling back.  
``You have worked so hard for me all my life, and now I cannot save 
you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No response. No feeling. Just cold and white, like a lump of  
rubber. 
</P>
<P>
	Yazykov stumbles over to the laptop. It's nearly 10 p.m. and the  
ocean is dark. He prays that there will be enough power for his 
message to reach Charleston. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did it, but was something unexpected. I could not stop  
bleeding,'' he types. ``Please, what should I do before too late. 
Viktor.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            	--------	 
</P>
<P>
	Carlin has spent the day pacing the office. He hasn't heard from  
Yazykov in six hours. What was going on in the Southern Ocean? 
</P>
<P>
	Crawling home at rush-hour, cellphone by his side, he gets the  
call. The message from race headquarters confirms his worst fears. 
Yazykov is killing his arm. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the din of Boston traffic, Carlin yells into his cell  
phone, ``TELL HIM REMOVE THE SHOCK CORDS IMMEDIATELY.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Charleston, a race official starts typing.  
</P>
<P>
	Carlin's head is spinning. Why so much blood? He had diagnosed  
an abscess. Had he been wrong? 
</P>
<P>
	Aspirin. Yazykov had been taking aspirin for weeks for the pain  
and it must have thinned his blood, preventing it from clotting 
after surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tell him not to take any more aspirin,'' he shouts into the  
phone. ``Tell him to put the arm in a sling and not to use it for 
several hours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tell him,'' he searches for the right words, ``that it is not,  
repeat NOT likely you can bleed to death from this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 5:21 p.m. Charleston time, Carlin's instructions are e-mailed  
to Yazykov. 
</P>
<P>
	Still clutching his cellphone, Carlin goes home to his family  
and prays. In Charleston, race officials sit by their computers and 
wait. 
</P>
<P>
	They are all sailors here -- some of them former solo racers.  
They know the sheer impossibility of steering a boat through stormy 
seas when you are crippled and alone. 
</P>
<P>
	They think of others who have been lost: Harry Mitchell, the  
irrepressible 70-year-old Briton, lost in the Southern Ocean during 
the 1994-95 race; Mike Plant, the 41-year-old American whose yacht 
capsized in the Atlantic during a race in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlin remembers them, too.  
</P>
<P>
	Tucking his children into bed that night, he asks them to say a  
special prayer that God will keep Viktor safe. Then he turns to his 
wife. ``I might lose this guy tonight,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
                            	--------	 
</P>
<P>
	-- ``Viktor. Dr. Carlin has some questions. Did the feeling in  
your arm and hand come back? Can you feel your pulse? Can you move 
all your fingers?''-- 
</P>
<P>
	6 p.m. at race headquarters, an hour since the last message to  
Yazykov, and still no word. 
</P>
<P>
	--''Viktor. Did you get the message?''  
</P>
<P>
	``Viktor. Dr. Carlin is waiting for the answers?''  
</P>
<P>
	``Viktor. Are you ok?''--  
</P>
<P>
	All night they pound the computer keys, sending e-mail after  
e-mail. They might as well be trying to contact the moon. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no other way to reach the stricken sailor, nearly 1,000  
miles from Cape Town. They can't send a helicopter that far into 
the ocean, and the nearest boat is days away. 
</P>
<P>
	Morning dawns in the Southern Ocean. Nighttime in Charleston.  
Still they keep typing. 
</P>
<P>
	--''Viktor. Please send a message telling us how you are.''--  
</P>
<P>
	The words pop up on the computer at 3:07 a.m. in Charleston.  
It's 8:07 a.m. in the ocean, 12 hours since Yazykov performed 
surgery, nearly 10 hours since his last desperate plea. He has just 
awakened. 
</P>
<P>
	--''I AM OK''--   	
</P>
<P>
	--''The hand is still very sleepy. Getting strength back very  
slowly. Thank you very much for your help.''-- 
</P>
<P>
	In bed, in Boston, Carlin gets the call he has been waiting for.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	On Nov. 16, 45 days after leaving Charleston, Viktor Yazykov  
sails into Cape Town to crowds and cheers and champagne. 
</P>
<P>
	He hugs Ludmila tightly. He waves his bandaged arm. When a radio  
station hooks him up with Carlin, he tells the doctor that they are 
brothers for life. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he turns and gazes at his boat.  
</P>
<P>
	``Wind of Change is the real hero,'' he says. ``She's a great  
little boat.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Viktor Yazykov set off on the second leg of the race, from Cape  
Town to Auckland, New Zealand, on Dec 5. His arm appeared healthy 
and almost completely healed. He is expected to arrive in Auckland 
in early January. The third leg of the race, from Auckland to Punta 
del Este in Uruguay, begins on Feb. 6. The race ends in Charleston, 
S.C., sometime in May.
