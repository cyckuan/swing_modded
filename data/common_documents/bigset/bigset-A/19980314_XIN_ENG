<HEADLINE> India's Left Parties to Discuss Formation of Govt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Senior Left party leader H.
Singh Surjeet Friday night said that they did not make any claim
to form government when he called on President K. R. Narayanan
here.
</P>
<P>
He said that he had sought three to four days from the
president to discuss the issue of government formation with
Congress and United Front constituents.
</P>
<P>
"The political situation has radically changed since last
evening after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Atal Behari
Vajpayee submitted a list of only 240 MPs to the president," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The president has invited leaders of the Congress, United Front
and Left parties for consultations separately Friday evening on
government formation following BJP furnishing documents claiming
support of only 240 MPs Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
Surjeet said that the Congress should formulate its strategy
first before the United Front could make a decision. No
negotiation has been held so far between the United Front and
Congress on the question of government formation.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the United Front would support a Congress-led
government, another senior Left party leader A. B. Bardhan, who
called on the president together with Surjeet, said that some
mechanism has to be worked out. "Let us discuss first," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the just-concluded general elections to the 12th Lower House
of Parliament, the BJP and its allies secured 252 seats out of the
elected 539 so far while the Congress and its allies as well as
the 14-party United Front got 167 and 96 seats respectively.
Maneuvering is still going on among the three major political
forces and so far no single party could muster enough support to
form the next government at the center.
</P>
<P>
Congress leader Sitaram Kesri said Friday night that a non-BJP
coalition would be able to provide a stable government only if it
is headed by the Congress, which has emerged as the single largest
party among all the secular forces. Both the Congress and the
United Front called themselves "secular forces" and labeled the
BJP "communal force".

<HEADLINE> Fertilizer Smuggled to Afghanistan Despite Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Fertilizer worth more than 200
million rupees (4.5 million U.S. dollars) has been smuggled to
Afghanistan during the current season despite a ban on its
transportation along the border areas.
</P>
<P>
According to a report appearing on the major English daily The
Business Recorder, about 30,000 to 35,000 tons of fertilizer have
moved across the border to neighboring Afghanistan, posing threat
to the supply-demand balance for local consumption in addition to
other losses.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted well informed sources as saying that the
matter of fertilizer smuggling was noted with serious concern at a
recent high-level meeting in the Ministry of Food and Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government of Balochistan was advised to stop
permit system as that would help in lessening transportation of
fertilizer across the border.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Food and Agriculture has asked the National
Fertilizer Corporation to inquire into the matter and report on
the factual position.

<HEADLINE> Cardiff to Be New Welsh Assembly Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The British government announced
on Friday that Cardiff, the Welsh capital, will be the site of the
new Welsh assembly.
</P>
<P>
The decision to choose Cardiff puts paid to a bid by rival city
Swansea, also in south Wales, to have the assembly built there.
</P>
<P>
"Cardiff is already established as a leading administrative and
financial center...It must also become our political center,"
Welsh Secretary Ron Davies said in a speech.
</P>
<P>
The first meeting of the assembly, to be elected in May 1999,
will be held at the University of Wales Court while a
purpose-built building is constructed.
</P>
<P>
The Welsh people narrowly voted for the setting up of a new
assembly in Wales in a referendum last September. The assembly
will return a measure of autonomy to Wales for the first time in
almost 600 years
</P>
<P>
The assembly will have no power to make laws or levy taxes but
will give 60 elected members a greater say over Welsh daily life.
</P>
<P>
With an annual budget of seven billion pounds (11.6 billion
U.S. dollars) it will run services ranging from schools to sport
by the year 2000. The central government will retain control over
taxes, defense, law and order, foreign policy and macro-economics.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: W. Africa Heading For Single Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 13 (Xinhua) -- West African countries are heading
unswervingly for the establishment of a single monetary zone,
despite disagreement between Francophone and Anglophone neighbors
which led to the failure in launching a sub-regional traveler's
cheque not long ago.
</P>
<P>
The idea of the single monetary zone in the region was agreed
upon by heads of state and government of the 16-member Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in 1987.
</P>
<P>
The deadline to adopt the common currency was fixed for the
year 2000 and the launch of the ECOWAS traveler's cheque is set
as the first step toward the goal.
</P>
<P>
The five million traveler's cheques already printed out now
remain kept from being issued among member nations to facilitate
settlement of both financial and commercial transactions within
the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
The launch of the payment instrument suffered two setbacks at
the last minute last December and February respectively, due to
disagreement among some member states, particularly the
reservation of French-speaking countries which asked for the
clearance of debt owed by some members to ECOWAS.
</P>
<P>
Despite the setbacks, ECOWAS, the sub-regional economic bloc
set up 23 years ago, has begun to finalize operational modalities
for a single currency.
</P>
<P>
For the modalities to be ready the coming May, the
Guinea-based West African Monetary Agency (WAMA), an arm of
ECOWAS mandated to handle the project, is seeking a specialist
for the drafting of a protocol relating to the establishment of
the single monetary zone.
</P>
<P>
According to a WAMA invitation to tender for the person which
was carried in local newspapers, the common currency, for which a
name is yet to be found, is billed to "replace the nine
currencies currently circulating within the sub-region by the
year 2000".
</P>
<P>
Observers noted that the work on the project at this stage is
quite delicate as it involves who will qualify for the single
currency and who will not.
</P>
<P>
It will also deal with the sensitive issue of what WAMA calls
"co-existence of various currencies with the common currency".
</P>
<P>
To establish the single monetary zone, WAMA says it is
"drawing from the experiences of the European Monetary Union,
West African Monetary Union and other regional monetary systems".
</P>
<P>
And the draft protocol is expected to be acceptable to
international financial institutions notably the World Bank, the
International Monetary Fund and regional development banks.
</P>
<P>
To this end, WAMA requests the document "clearly highlight the
different stages and processes for achieving the single monetary
zone, and highlight existing problems and obstacles and how they
can be surmounted".
</P>
<P>
It should also "clearly define the monetary unit and all
related problems, suggesting how the latter can be concretely
resolved".
</P>
<P>
West African leaders have long been working to improve the
status of the sub-region, one of the poorest in the world.
</P>
<P>
Since the single monetary zone project began 11 years ago,
several member countries have undertaken measures within the
context of their national structural adjustment programs to
facilitate its achievement.
</P>
<P>
However, lack of unity and different considerations of
national interests, among other things, have hobbled the steps of
ECOWAS toward its ultimate goal of economic integration in the
entire sub-region.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President Inspects Barracks in North </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kampala, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni inspected barracks in the northern city of Gulu on
Thursday, The Monitor reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The President chaired a meeting on his arrival on Thursday
evening during which officers there reported to him about the
security situation in the region, the report said. But it did not
reveal any detail of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Museveni's inspection tour to the north took place ten days
before the visit by U.S. President Bill Clinton to the country.
</P>
<P>
The United States has asked Uganda to hold talks on the
rebellion in the north. But Uganda noted that the rebels of LRA
have no desire for a political solution to the problem.
</P>
<P>
The President's inspection to the north is seen as a signal of
a possible mop-up operation by Uganda army against the LRA
rebels.
</P>
<P>
A recent report said some of top field commanders of LRA are
tired of rebellion and are conceiving a surrender plan to Ugandan
authorities. But Joseph Kony, the LRA top political leader,
ordered to intensify subversive activities such as kidnapping
civilians to fill the LRA ranks.
</P>
<P>
LRA has some 2,000 members in previous years. But it has now
only hundreds of remnants in its ranks.
</P>
<P>
Gulu is home to the headquarters of the Fourth Division, which
is the main forces of Ugandan Army, responsible for the security
of the north where the rebels of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA)
are haunting.
</P>
<P>
President Museveni was welcomed by Major General Salim Saleh,
the caretaker of the country's Defense Ministry, and Brigadier
Wamala Katumba, the commander of the Fourth Division, among
others.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe on Local Companies' Survival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Local companies should produce
value-added goods if they are to survive the fluctuations in the
world prices of primary products, Zimbabwean president Robert
Mugabe said Friday.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking at the ground breaking ceremony of a fruit and
vegetable project being set up by Zimbabwe Progress Fund, a local
indigenous venture capital company, in Ruwa, 30 kilometres east
of Harare, the Zimbabwe News Agency Reported.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said the government encouraged the formation of joint
ventures between locals and foreign investors to produce
value-added goods whose prices were stable on international
markets.
</P>
<P>
This would cushion the country against global fluctuations in
prices of primary products from the mining industry and
unprocessed agricultural products, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The world is becoming a global village and we are seeking to
strategically position ourselves in a way that will make us a
beneficiary as well as a destination of foreign capital," Mugabe
said.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe urged local firms to network with foreign investors to
access foreign capital, technology, information and technical
expertise to help them grow in a competitive environment.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe laid the first brick of the factory which is expected
to be completed by October this year.
</P>
<P>
The president said the project, being promoted by women, was a
good example of how women could take their rightful position in
the development of the economy and create wealth for themselves.
</P>
<P>
Manager of the project Sheila George said when in full production,
the plant had a capacity to produce 20 to 25 tons of vegetables and
10 to 15 tons of fruits per two eight hour shifts. 90 percent of the
products would be exported to Europe while 10 percent would be sold
on the local market.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Calls for Lifting Sanctions Against Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederich
Chiluba Friday expressed his hope that sanctions against Libya
will be lifted soon so that the country can start participating
in free trade.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba made the appeal here when receiving credentials from
Libyan Ambassador to Zambia Khallifa Omar Alssawi.
</P>
<P>
Sanctions against Libya have been there for too long, he said,
adding that Zambia sympathizes with the people of Libya.
</P>
<P>
The president called for the strengthening of existing ties
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the need for Africa to develop on its own.
</P>
<P>
Africa will never be completely free if it continues to be
economically dependent on the international community, said the
president.
</P>
<P>
Sanctions were imposed on Libya in March 1992 by the United
Nations Security Council since the north African country refused
to extradite two of its citizens who were alleged to have been
responsible for an explosion which destroyed a Pan American World
Airways passenger aircraft over Lockerbie, Scotland in December
1988.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Producer Prices Take Tiny Dip in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Thanks mainly to continued
plunging energy costs, producers prices in the United States fell
for the fourth straight month in February, the Labor Department
reported here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The monthly 0.1 percent decline in the Producers Price Index
(PPI) followed a 0.7 percent drop in January, the biggest
one-month plunge in more than four years, according to the
department.
</P>
<P>
February also marked the 12th month in last 14 months that the
PPI has declined or remained unchanged. Over the past 12 months,
the PPI had fallen 1.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Energy prices fell 1.8 percent in February after a 3.7 percent
drop in the previous month, which continued the trend in most of
last year. Experts attributed the drop to El Nino, which resulted
in unseasonably warm weather to much of this country.
</P>
<P>
However, floods and storms caused by El Nino have ruined
vegetable crops in California and thus pushed food prices higher
for the first time since last October. Food prices rose 0.4
percent in February. Vegetable prices shot up by 3.9 percent,
including increases of 62.7 percent for tomatoes, 45.2 percent for
green peppers and 32.1 percent for sweet corn. El Nino related
flooding in California was likely behind the increase in
food-prices, experts noted.
</P>
<P>
Crude goods prices in February fell 2.5 percent. Crude energy
prices fell 6.5 percent during the month.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco costs rose 1.8 percent, following an announcement in
January that tobacco producers were raising wholesale prices. The
rise in tobacco prices was the sharpest since September 1997.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the volatile food and energy sectors, the so called
core rate PPI rose 0.1 percent, its first increase since last
September and slightly above market expectations of an unchanged
performance.
</P>
<P>
Computer prices dropped 6.6 percent, the largest one-month dip
ever, surpassing the 6.4 percent drop in May 1997. The cost of
computers and other electronics is expected to decline further,
partly due to sharp currency devaluations in Asia which in turn
help chip and component producers to lower their prices.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Canada's unemployment rate dropped
0.3 percentage points to 8.6 percent in February, Statistics
Canada reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The country's employment rose by 82,000 in the month, mainly
the result of a continued increase in Ontario and a rebound in
Quebec following the ice storm.
</P>
<P>
The employment gain builds on the growth of 1997, leaving
employment up 448,000 over the last 12 month, the statistics
agency said.
</P>
<P>
In February, full-time employment rose by 84,000, continuing
the surge that began a year ago.
</P>
<P>
In the last 12 months, full-time employment has risen 4.2
percent to 472,000, while part-time employment has fallen
slightly.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that nearly half of February's employment
increase went to Canadian youths 15 to 24 years of age, the first
major increase in six months.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the youth unemployment rate dropped to 15.5
percent from 16.5 percent in January.
</P>
<P>
There was also an increase in employment women in adult women,
with half of the gain in full time. Among adult men, full-time
work rose by 42,000 while part-time dropped 28,000.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The United States has agreed
to release Thailand from a contract agreement to buy U.S.-made jet
fighters as Thailand can no longer afford it, government officials
said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The officials made the announcement in advance of a meeting
between U.S. President Bill Clinton and Thai Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai who came to Washington on Thursday for a two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
"We have solved their problem for them," one official said,
referring to Thailand's desire to cancel the deal.
</P>
<P>
Thailand wanted relief from an agreed payment for eight F-A-18
fighter jets it ordered from McDonnell Douglas, now part of
Boeing, for 392 million U.S. dollars. It also wanted relief from
payments on smaller defense contracts.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Software Pirates to Face Stiff Fines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Canadian software pirates will
face tougher civil penalties under changes to the country's
copyright law expected to be proclaimed within six weeks, a report
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
One in five Canadians pirates software occasionally, acording
to a survey by the Canadian Alliance Against Software Theft
(CAAST).
</P>
<P>
The alliance estimates that piracy costs it 357 million
Canadian dollars (250 million U.S. dollars) in 1996, according to
Canada's national newspaper the Globe and Mail.
</P>
<P>
Changes to the Copyright Act are likely to be proclaimed by the
end of April, said Michael Eisen, secretary and general counsel at
CAAST.
</P>
<P>
Those changes are part of a larger package that was approved
last April, Eisen said.
</P>
<P>
Under the changes, a judge can decide on a penalty of 500 to
20,000 dollars for each illegal copy of software.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey by the Software Publishers Association,
42 percent of Canadian software had been pirated in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The association believed that the most effective approach to
bring down Canada's piracy rates is to make Canadians realize that
software piracy is nothing less than outright theft.

<P>
LONDON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The number of underage pregnancies
in Britain stood at 8,800 in 1996, the highest for more than a
decade and 11 percent higher than in 1995, according to figures
from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) Friday.
</P>
<P>
The conception rate among girls under 16 years of age in 1996
was 9.4 per 1,000 girls, 11 percent higher than the 1995 rate of
8.5 per 1,000 and the third year in a row that there has been such
a rise, said the ONS.
</P>
<P>
Family planning campaigners said that they were concerned about
the figures and blamed the rise in part for the health scare in
October 1995 over some brands of the contraceptive Pill.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the government is now looking at ways to
tackle the problem of underage pregnancies in the country and a
national program is expected to be launched in May.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Continue Protests at Israeli Killings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Palestinians in the West Bank
on Friday continued to protest against the killing of three of
their nationals by Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of protesters attempted to march to Jewish holy site
of Josef's Tomb at the center of Nablus after their Friday prayer.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian policemen fired tear gas for the first time to
disperse the protesters and succeeded in keeping them away from
possible clashes with Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
Israeli soldiers shot dead three Palestinian workers on Tuesday
at a roadblock near Hebron when they drove back to the Palestinian
self-rule area.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians in Hebron on Friday threw petrol bombs and stones
at Israeli troops guarding the Jewish quarter in the divided city.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian police were sent to separate the protesters from
the Israelis and try their hard to avoid the escalation of the
violence.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has pledged to continue the
Palestinian-Israeli peace process after Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu expressed regrets and condolences over the
shooting incident.
</P>
<P>
Head of Israel's Central Command Uzi Dayan, who toured Hebron
on Friday, praised the effort of the Palestinian police to bring
the situations under control.
</P>
<P>
But he said that the crisis was not over, and Israeli troops
and police in the area would remain on high alert.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile a bomb exploded in Jerusalem during the day, lightly
injuring four Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
No one has claimed responsibility for the blast.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police have suspected that Palestinian militants may
have launched the attack. But they did not rule out that Jewish
rightwing extremists might have perpetrated the explosion.

<HEADLINE> UN Study Finds Palestinian Trade Hampered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian trade is still
heavily dependent on the promises of the peace process, according
to a new study by the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD) released here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The study, "Palestinian merchandise trade in the 1990s:
Opportunities and Challenges," finds that the Palestinian
economy has enjoyed growing investor confidence and
entrepreneurial activity in times of progress, as was the case
in 1994-1995.
</P>
<P>
But, the study says, during the periods of political stalement
or disruptions in the peace progress, such as in 1996 and 1997,
buiness activity shrinks, income falls and investment declines.
</P>
<P>
Merchandise exports, which 15 years ago generated 400 million
U.S. dollars for the Palestinian economy, has fallen to an
estimated 265 million U.S. dollars by 1996, which includes exports
to Israel.
</P>
<P>
The study will serve as the basis for a major technical
assistance project, to be launched in May by UNCTAD and the
United Nations Development Programme, to promote trade
cooperation between the Palestinian Authority, Egypt and Jordan.
Among its goals, the project will aim to improve trade
efficiency.

</P>
<P>
Salim made the appeal during talks here at the OAU

</P>
<P>
Salim emphasized the need for Africa's partners to take into
consideration the priorities and agenda decided by the continent
in its quest to achieve socio-economic development through
economic cooperation and integration.
</P>
<P>
The OAU chief also stressed the fact that Africa has embarked
on a serious process of reforms both politically and socio-
economically.
</P>
<P>
He highlighted the sustained efforts made by African countries
towards democratization, good governance and respect for human
rights and creation of enabling environment for development and
investment.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon and Syria to Hold Summit Meeting on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon and Syria is to coordinate
their position on the Israeli withdrawal offer and regional
affairs in a summit meeting to be held in Damascus on Saturday,
the independent Central News Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Israel had offered to withdraw from south Lebanon in return
for Lebanese government's agreement of its security demands.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon, along with Syria, the main power broker in the
country, have flatly rejected the offer, saying it violated the
United Nations Resolution 425 which calls for an unconditional
pull-out from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The agency said the meeting will take place on the same day
that Lebanon will commemorate 20 years of Israeli occupation in
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel first invaded Lebanon on March 14, 1978, with the
declared aim to crack down on Palestinian guerrillas who used
south Lebanon to launch Katyusha rockets into Israel and
occasionally penetrated the heavy border defenses.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Israeli troops have never left Lebanon and set up a
1,200-square-kilometer area buffer zone in the south in 1985 to
protect its northern villages from Lebanese guerrillas
cross-border attack.
</P>
<P>
Also on the agenda are regional developments in light of the
U.N. secretary general Kofi Annan's visit to the region, scheduled
for March 19-26, and Lebanese internal affairs, including the
forthcoming presidential elections, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese President Elias Harawi will be accompanied by House
Speaker Nabih Berry and Prime Minister Rafik Hariri to
Damascus.

<HEADLINE> UK Is Unlikely to Join EMU before 2005, Says Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Britain is unlikely to be able to
join the European economic and monetary union (EMU) before 2005 as
its financial sector's preparation for the introduction of the
euro will not be ready before that, according to a latest study
from the Bank of England.
</P>
<P>
The bank said in its latest quarterly update on EMU
preparations that banks will not even start getting their computer
systems ready for the full-scale introduction of the euro until
they have dealt with the millennium bomb.
</P>
<P>
"Banks say they want to get the millennium out of the way
first. Whether they start (preparation for the introduction of
euro) then will depend on the signals they are getting from the
government," said the bank's deputy director John Townend, who is
in charge of EMU issues.
</P>
<P>
The UK government has ruled out joining EMU in the life of the
current parliament, which means an EMU referendum is unlikely
before 2002.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that the financial sector may not begin preparing
for the euro unless they are confident of the government's
intentions and once the sector starts preparing seriously for the
euro, it will need another three years to get ready.

<HEADLINE> EU Ministers Call for Dialogue on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) foreign
ministers meeting in Edinburgh Friday urged the Yugoslav
government and the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo to start a real
dialogue in a bid to revolve the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, who chaired the two-day
EU ministerial session starting Friday, was reported as saying
that the EU would press both Belgrade and ethnic Albanian leaders,
who failed to reach agreement on a political dialogue, to start
reconciliation talks as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Cook, whose country is the current EU president, termed a
Belgrade offer of "open dialogue" as nothing new but he also
voiced regret over the flat rejection of the offer by ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo, who demanded total independence of the
province.
</P>
<P>
"I must say it (Belgrade offer) does not go beyond the offer
they have made previously, and we will be looking for a much more
meaningful offer of real dialogue for enhanced autonomy," Cook
told reporters Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
On the blunt reaction of the ethnic Albanians, Cook said: "It
would have been helpful if the Kosovo leadership had not reacted
negatively so immediately".
</P>
<P>
"But I can fully understand that they want more on the table
and we will be pressing Belgrade to move that way," Cook added.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day session, the ministers of the 15-nation bloc
are expected to focus on implementing the strategy on Kosovo
agreed upon by Contact Group on Monday rather than looking for new
alternatives.
</P>
<P>
The EU foreign ministers also discussed the Asian financial
crisis and agreed to put in new efforts to stabilize the region's
economies by contributing to an International Monetary Fund rescue
package and offering European expertise on financial systems.
</P>
<P>
At Saturday's session, the EU ministers will concentrate on the
EU enlargement talks especially on Cyprus and fresh European
efforts to revitalize the stalled Middle East peace process.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Farmers Urged to Grow Traditional Cereals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Minister for Agriculture
Musalia Mudavadi Friday called on Kenyan farmers to grow
traditional cereal crops to enable the country to attain self
sufficiency in food production.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the statement here when he received a
Tanzanian delegation led by Godliving Moshi who has been in Kenya
for the last three days for visiting irrigation facilities in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Mudavadi noted that research on better yielding and drought
resistant crops such as cassava, millet and sorghum had been
carried out in the east African country.
</P>
<P>
He advised Kenyans to supplement maize with traditional crops
to avert a situation in which Kenya had to import food during
production shortfalls.
</P>
<P>
Referring to irrigation, the minister said, his ministry will
concentrate in water harvesting and small scale irrigation
schemes in order to increase agricultural production in the
country, especially in the arid and semi-arid areas.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-based Board on Science and Technology for
International Development warned that traditional cereals in
Africa being replaced by acclaimed relatives including maize,
wheat and rice could spell doom to the continent's food
production and security.
</P>
<P>
Scientists from the International Crops Research Institute for
Semi-Arid Tropics said traditional grain crops in Africa contain
special genes which control valuable characters such as plant
disease resistance and drought tolerance.
</P>
<P>
With global warming as a constant threat, the scientists
noted, finger-millet, pearl millet and sorghum could become vital
for keeping arable lands in production in Africa.
</P>
<P>
In the past six years except for 1995/96, Kenya had to import
large quantities of food annually. It also needs massive maize
imports for 1998.
</P>
<P>
The El Nino-induced heavy rains since last October have
already damaged large fields of food crops and Kenya faces a
severe maize shortage after the government exhausted its
strategic reserves of 270,000 tons of maize.
</P>
<P>
According the Kenyan agricultural minister, the Kenyan
government has to import 630,000 tons of maize this year to meet
the country's consumption requirement.

LUANDA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government has set
the revitalization of tourism as one of its tasks in rebuilding
the country's economy in 1998 after final peace is materialized.
</P>
<P>
Jorgo Valentim, Angola's Hotel and Tourism Minister made the
remarks at a press conference on Friday, at which his ministry's
1998 Action Plan was made public.
</P>
<P>
Valentim said that the country is to build some four-to-five
star hotels in major cities, as to lay a sound basis for tourism
development.
</P>
<P>
The training of management personnel is one of the crucial
tasks for the industry. He noted that the government has failed
to pay enough attention to tourism development in the past few
years because of the protracted civil war.
</P>
<P>
He said it is also an important policy for the country to
attract foreign investment, adding that a Portuguese construction
company has offered to invest 40 million U.S. Dollars in building
a five-star hotel in Angola and a British company is also to
invest 25 million dollars for building a four-star hotel.
</P>
<P>
Some Angolan companies are also planning to build hotels, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Valentim said that with an agreeable climate and a long
coastline, Angola enjoys unique condition for tourism development
which would offer job opportunities and spur the development of
relevant industries.

<HEADLINE> Russia, Chechnya Hold 10th Joint Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Russia and its break-away republic
Chechnya held the tenth session of the joint negotiating
commission on drafting a comprehensive treaty between themselves
on Friday in Nazran, Ingushetia, the Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Rybkin who heads the
commission from the federal side was quoted as saying that the
talks focused on the implementation of earlier agreements over the
past 18 months, and the two side agreed to existing accords
largely sufficed for an uninterrupted restoration process in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Rybkin said that he had told Chechen negotiators about specific
measures taken by Moscow, including a governmental draft
resolution to give the Sheikh Mansur airport in Grozny the status
of an international airport within the framework of the CIS.
</P>
<P>
The Chechen side accepted the proposal and the airport will be
refurbished by Russian and Chechen structures together, he said.
</P>
<P>
Rybkin also brought to Nazran a draft agreement on the payment
of pensions to residents of the Chechen capital and other
documents dealing with improvement of living conditions of the
Chechen people.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister declared that the instruction issued
by President Boris Yeltsin last year to set 475 billion old rubles
aside for Chechnya must be implemented without delay.
</P>
<P>
"Wasted time is wasted trust, which was gained with such
pains," Rybkin said at the end of the Russian-Chechen
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
According to him, only 112 billion rubles of the sum has so far
been released. The program of urgent measures to rebuild Chechnya,
intended to last a year and a half or two years, is estimated at
almost 5 billion new rubles.
</P>
<P>
Rybkin also supported further talks on extending the agreement
on oil transit, which is due to expire with the transportation of
200,000 tons of oil via the pipeline going trough Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Movladi Udugov, who heads the commission from the Chechen side,
noted that the main condition of further meetings between Russia
and Chechnya is fulfillment of the accords reached earlier.

<HEADLINE> Explosion Occurs in Freetown Barracks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 13 (Xinhua) -- There was a big explosion in a
barracks in the Sierra Leonean capital Freetown Friday morning,
leaving seven people seriously wounded.
</P>
<P>
No deaths can be confirmed at the moment, the British
Broadcasting Corporation reported.
</P>
<P>
Within the barracks are large number of arms and ammunition
surrendered to the west Afrcan peacekeeping force ECOMOG by
remnants of the military junta and its allied rebels four weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
The bomb blast took place at 9:00 Friday morning when ECOMOG
troops controling the barracks were trying to remove the arms and
ammunition.
</P>
<P>
One of the boxes got down on the ground during the process and
caused the explosion, the BBC quoted Sierra Leone's state radio
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The military school inside barracks was damaged during the
explosion and the Fire Brigade managed to control the fire from
spreading to other sections of the barracks.
</P>
<P>
While people in Freetown were worring about other explosions
of the sort as ECOMOG continues clearing up weapons and
ammunition left over by the junta, they are reassured that due
care will be taken to prevent any recurrence of this kind of
incident.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG also pledged to go all-out to prevent any bomb blast
that could lead to casualties.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian-led sub-regional force overthrew the junta last
month, paving the way for the return of President Kabbah last
Tuesday after more than nine months of self-exile in neighboring
Guinea.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Crack Down on Sand Diggers by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The management of Tanzania
Electric Supply Company (TANESCO) said it will take stern measures
against any person found excavating sand under high voltage electric
poles which is likely to cause the collapse of the poles.
</P>
<P>
The TANESCO managing director, Baruany Luhanga, said in a statement
issued in Dar es Salaam Friday that several people have been spotted
excavating sand under electric poles of 220 kv and 132 kv transmitting
at Ubungo and Kimara areas.
</P>
<P>
The people were excavating sand at night hours with bags, lorries
and caterpillars, which is hazardous to the transmission of electricity
from the major hydro-electric power stations of Kidatu and Mtera,
Luhanga said.
</P>
<P>
Some of the sand miners were apprehended Thursday and face
criminal charges, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We appeal to local government leaders and the public to report the
malpractices immediately when they spot the culprits engaging in
such activities," Luhanga said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
He also appealed to citizens to protect national resources at any
cost rather than looking at the lawbreakers indifferently.

<HEADLINE> French Leftwing Coalition Expected to Win Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 13 (Xinhua) -- France's leftwing coalition are
expected to win elections of regional parliaments in 18 regions
out of 20 across the country in the voting on Sunday, said the
daily Le Monde quoting latest projections on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The rightwing oppositions of Rally for the Republic (RPR) and
Union for French Democracy (UDF) will only win in the central Pays
de la Loire and eastern Alsace regions, according to projections
by the Politique Opinion, a periodical specialized in analyzing
political situation in France, which are confirmed by Le Monde.
</P>
<P>
The Socialist-led leftwing coalition, including the Communists,
ecologists and other smaller leftwing parties, will have a close
fight with the RPR and UDF in the northeast Champagne-Ardenne and
the western Basse-Normandie regions, said the projections.
</P>
<P>
The leftist candidates for presidents of regional parliament
will win absolute majority in five regions: the southwest
Aquitaine, Poitou-Charentes and Midi-Pyrenees, the central
Limousin, and the northern Nord-Pas-de-Calais.
</P>
<P>
The leftist parties are also expected to have a narrower win in
the southern Languedoc-Roussillon and Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur
bordering the Mediterranean, the Paris region of Ile-de-France,
the northwestern Haute Normandie, Bretagne, and Picardie, the
central regions of Auvergne, Centre and France-Comte and
Bourgogne, and the eastern regions of Rhone-Alpes and Lorraine.
</P>
<P>
The far-right National Front will play a role of arbitrator
between the left and right in many regions, and will consolidate
its position as the third force, said the projections.

<HEADLINE> Greece urged to Reconsider Turkey's Initiative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has called on Greece
to give a positive response to the Turkish peace initiative for
the settlement of the Aegean problems, Turkey's foreign ministry
said in a press release Friday.
</P>
<P>
It said that the Greek ambassador in Ankara was invited to the
Turkish Foreign Ministry on Wednesday to hear Turkey's views on
the peace plan.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, which was annoyed by Greece's cold attitude, urged
Athens to give full and serious consideration of the peace
initiative put forward by Turkey concerning the settlement of the
Aegean issues.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey wishes that all Aegean problems be settled through
peaceful means, including third party procedures best suited to
their specific nature and to be determined by mutual consent,"
the press release said.
</P>
<P>
It said that Turkey hopes that the Greek government could
adopt a more constructive and cooperative approach towards the
Turkish peace proposal which might remove the stumbling block
preventing the normalization of the ties of the two neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Turkey proposed a peace plan to the Greek
government calling for solving the protracted Aegean problems
through bilateral peace talks.
</P>
<P>
It also suggested that a high-level meeting of the Turkish and
Greek foreign ministries be held in Ankara or Athens to discuss
ways of resolving their disputes over the Aegean Sea.
</P>
<P>
Greece had been refrained from making a clear-cut statement on
the peace initiative of Turkey, causing complaints from Ankara
saying that Athens lacks sincerity on the issue.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis told reporters
in London that "Turkey's proposals are irrelevant regarding the
essence of the problems," making the success of the peace plan more
gloomy.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece have long been at odds over the Aegean Sea
and their disputes include the limits of air space, sovereignty
over many small uninhabited islands as well as the abundant
sea-bed mineral resources.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has maintained that these problems could be settled
through the bilateral talks and dialogues between the two
governments on an equal basis while Greece holds that the Aegean
issue should be submitted to the Hague-based International Court
for a final settlement.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, which fears that the European-dominated court might
shield Greeks, firmly opposes this scheme.

<HEADLINE> Butler: Recent Weapons Inspection in Iraq Goes Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The recent weapons
inspection led by American Scott Ritter had gone very well,
Richard Butler, the Executive Chairman of the United Nations
Special commission in charge of ridding Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction, said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We are given access of the kind that we never had before, in
terms of places we got into and the way in which we got into the
places," Butler was responding to Ritter's visit to the
Headquarters of Iraq's Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Butler said the arrangements had been completed to begin visits
to the presidential compounds and that these will begin " a couple
of days after I leave."
</P>
<P>
Butler has planned to visit Baghdad next week, during which he
will hold talks with Iraqi officials on the weapons inspection of
Iraq's presidential sites. This will be his first visit to
Iraq since the latest crisis over the UN weapons inspection in the
country.

<HEADLINE> Greek Drachma to Enter EU Exchange Rate Mechanism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Greece has requested for its
national currency, drachma, to enter the exchange rate mechanism
(ERM) of the European monetary system, the Greek government
announced in a statement issued Friday.
</P>
<P>
Athens asked Thursday for the entry of the drachma to the ERM.
The entry began Friday and would be completed on Sunday, said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
The realignment of the Greek drachma's parity against European
Union (EU) currencies and the ecu would be decided on Sunday night
after Greece's EU partners responded positively to the request
from Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis for the drachma's entry
into the ERM.
</P>
<P>
The drachma came under sudden pressure on the domestic money
market from early Friday with some 400 million ecu in outflows
being recorded during later fixing.
</P>
<P>
The drachma-ecu parity reached 323.70 drachmas, but has fallen
to 316.55.
</P>
<P>
The EU's monetary committee will decide on the terms of the
drachma's entry to the ERM on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Calls for Continued Struggle Against Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon called on its people on
Friday to continue struggles against Israel until it implements
U.N. resolution and withdraw troops from its soil.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the 20th anniversary of Israel's occupation of
southern Lebanon, Lebanese Defense Minister Mohsen Dalloul said in
a statement that March 14 should serve as a day to firm Lebanese
confidence and determination in fighting Israeli occupying force,
rather than a day for crying for or remembering the past.
</P>
<P>
He condemned Israel's occupation of Lebanon's territory and
demanded an unconditional withdrawal by the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Israel invaded Lebanon in 1978 in an attempt to crack down on
Palestinian guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
After the invasion, the United Nations Security Council passed
the resolution 425, demanding an unconditional Israeli withdrawal
from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Without complying with the U.N. resolution, Israel set up a
so-called "security zone" in southern Lebanon in 1985 to allegedly
protect its northern areas from cross-border attacks by Lebanon's
Muslim guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese minister stressed that Lebanon would never let the
U.N. resolution become a tool used by Israel to prepare traps.
</P>
<P>
Israel has offered to pull back troops from southern Lebanon if
the Lebanese government agrees to make an arrangement concerning
the security in the areas bordering the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has rejected the offer, arguing it is conditional and
aimed at driving a wedge between Lebanon and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Syria is stationing 40,000 troops in Lebanon as peacekeepers.
The two countries agree to coordinate their stances on key issues
and not to conceive peace unilaterally with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Syria also has a tough task to recover the Golan Heights, which
was occupied by Israel in 1967.

<HEADLINE> Russia, U.S. to Discuss START III </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The United States is ready for
"expert-level" talks with Russia on drawing up framework points
for a START III treaty without the ratification of the START II
accord by the Russian parliament, Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax news agency cited Sergeyev as saying that moving
the deadline for meeting START II commitments to 2007 makes
fulfilling these obligations "less costly." Under the measure, the
service life of Russian strategic missiles slated for dismantling
shall be exhausted by the new deadline, Sergeyev said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the Russian land forces are now in the most
difficult situation and no unit was up to strength as of last
year. Today Russia has 21 regiments which are between 5 percent
and 10 percent under strength, Sergeyev said.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the START III will be aimed at reduction by the
two sides of nuclear warheads instead of carrier rockets, which
hankers after the START II.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton recently expressed the hope that he
will visit Russia for a summit after the Russian State Duma
ratifies the START II treaty.

<HEADLINE> UNITA Censured of Delaying Angolan Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 13 (Xinhua) --The former general secretary of
the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA),
Friday described UNITA's refusal to accept the legalization of it
by the government as " a trick to stall peace process" in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Eugenio Manuvbakola, former UNITA Secretary General, who
signed the 1994 Lusaka Peace Protocol, criticized UNITA leader
Jonas Savimbi's refusal to accept the government's recognition of
UNITA as a legal party.
</P>
<P>
He also urged UNITA leaders not to link up the removal of the
party's headquarters to Luanda with the collecting of illegal
arms scattered among the citizens, since the collecting of
illegal weapons is a complicated task.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that UNITA distributed some weapons to the masses
in areas under its control during the years of civil war, but
UNITA seems to be reluctant to collect these arms. UNITA's
insistence on the linkage of illegal arms collection with the
removal of its headquarters is, actually a way to delay the peace
process designed to be finished on March 31st, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Manuvbakola called on the UNITA to respect the will of the
majority of the Angolans and participate actively in the
reconstruction of the country.
</P>
<P>
Manuvbakola backed out from UNITA in November 1997 after he
found his views different from other leaders in the party.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Cancells Football Match With Ghana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has cancelled a friendly
football match with Ghana due to the latter's inability to raise
a "formidable" team, the national football authority announced
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Chairman of the Nigeria Football Association, Abdulmumini
Aminu, however, said that arrangements are underway for
friendlies with Germany, Yugoslavia and Holland before the World
Cup begins in June.
</P>
<P>
The friendly with Ghana was scheduled for March 25. But there
has been criticism of the proposed match on the excuse that weak
Ghana is not a good choice for the Nigerian team to warm up for
the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
Aminu also condemned those Nigerians who have been working
against Nigeria's participation in the World Cup by writing
"devilish things" about the country and sending them to the
International Football Associatin (FIFA).
</P>
<P>
The unpatriotic elements, he said, also wrote to the German
parliament to legislate against a friendly between the two
countries, but he disclosed that the match has been approved upon
by the German government.
</P>
<P>
The chairman also disclosed that FIFA has agreed to postpone
its inspection of Nigeria's facilities for the 1999 FIFA-Coca
Cola World Youth Championship from April to August.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria had suggested that the inspection tour was shifted to
allow it more time to rehabilitate its facilities.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Releases Thailand from Military Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The United States has agreed
to release the Thai government from a contract to buy U.S.-made
jet fighters because of its economic troubles, Undersecretary of
State Stuart Eizenstat said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We've... agreed to relieve Thailand of its remaining financial
liability in connection with the purchase" of the jet fighters,
Eizenstat told a press conference. "This was one of their major
concerns."
</P>
<P>
Eizenstat said the Pentagon will purchase the eight F-A-18
fighters Thailand had ordered from McDonnell Douglas, which is now
part of Boeing. They will be added to the Marine Corps' F-A-18
fleet.
</P>
<P>
Eizenstat's announcement came after President Bill Clinton held
a meeting with Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai. It will save
Thailand about 250 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has already paid 72 million dollars of the purchase
price of the jet fighters, but has been hard pressed to complete
the deal following a currency devaluation and restraints on
government spending required by a 17.2 billion dollar bailout
package arranged by the International Monetary Fund.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Tourism to be Recovered in 1998: Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's tourist industry will
gradually regain its previous levels with an increase of 8.3
percent in tourist influx for 1998 over the previous year, the
Middle East News Agency Saturday quoted a government plan as saying.
</P>
<P>
The economic and social plan for 1998 that has already been
endorsed by the Egyptian cabinet expects 3.25 million tourists to
visit Egypt, recording an 8.3 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
The plan, to be delivered to the People's Assembly and the
Shura Council, also expects tourist earnings to rise by 8.4
percent, reaching 10.3 billion pounds (3.03 billion U.S. dollars),
with an increase of 800 million pounds (235.29 million dollars)
over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
A terrorist attack on tourists in a southern Egyptian city last
November has seriously shaken the country's tourist industry and
the following month saw the lowest ebb of tourists visiting Egypt
in three years.
</P>
<P>
About 178,00 tourists visited Egypt in December, less than half
the figure for the same month in 1996 and the lowest monthly
number for almost three years.
</P>
<P>
The number of tourists fell further by 35.4 percent to
168,000 in January 1998, far below 260,000 in January
1997. However, the year-on-year decline for January have slowed
compared to figures for December.
</P>
<P>
Tourism, a main hard currency earner, was hit hard by the
November 17 attack which killed 58 foreign tourists and four
Egyptians in Luxor.
</P>
<P>
Tourism Minister Mamdouh el-Beltagui told reporters recently
that the majority of countries have responded positively to
Egypt's aggressive tourist selling pitch despite the Luxor
assault.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cypriots Urged to Joint Accession Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Foreign Minister Ioannis
Kasoulides has expressed the hope that Turkish Cypriots would
participate in the island's European Union (EU) accession talks
scheduled to start on March 31.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus News Agency Saturday quoted Kasoulides as saying that a
mixed team made up of representatives from both communities of the
island would mean a number of issues dividing its people for many
years have been overcome.
</P>
<P>
This would also have a positive impact on the bicommunal
talks, which have been going through an impasse, Kasoulides told
reporters in London while commenting on a Cyprus government
proposal on the Turkish Cypriot participation in the EU accession
talks.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was submitted by the Cyprus government to Britain,
the current EU rotating presidency, on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
If the Turkish Cypriots accept the proposal, the settlement of
the Cyprus problem would be easier, the Cypriot foreign minister
said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed optimism over the outcome of the island's EU
accession talks.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey
landed its troops and took over the northern third of the island
following a short-lived pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared in 1983 a breakaway Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus, which was only recognized by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the divided
island as a bizonal, bicommunal federation through peace talks,
but so far no tangible results have been achieved.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides clarified that the proposal was submitted only when
the Cyprus government was assured that the accession talks will
take place between the EU and the Republic of Cyprus; the Turkish
Cypriot participation should not lead to direct or indirect
recognition of the breakaway state in northern Cyprus and the
participating representatives of the Turkish Cypriot community
should not oppose the island's EU accession.
</P>
<P>
The EU's views on the issue were in line with those of the
Cyprus government, Kasoulides said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Cyprus' purchase of surface-to-air missiles from
Russia, which are expected to be deployed in Cyprus later this
year, Kasoulides said the Cypriot government's position was that
this issue was irrelevant to the island's political problem.
</P>
<P>
He said that the EU should not relate Cyprus' accession with
the missiles issue, saying "this would be counter-productive."
</P>
<P>
"We consider the EU accession as an important issue but the
reunification of the island, the security of its people" and the
protection of Cyprus' international personality as an independent
state are even more important, Kasoulides said.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government's decision to buy Russian-made
anti-aircraft missiles was criticized by the U.S. and some other
EU member states. Turkey has threatened to strike the missiles if
they are deployed on the island.

WASHINGTON, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The captain of the U.S. ice
hockey team regretted Friday the damage his teammates caused to
their rooms after losing to the Czech Republic at the Nagano
Winter Olympics and send a 3,000 U.S. dollars compensation to
Japan.
</P>

"Certain conduct by a few members of our team was inexcusable,"
Chris Chelios, Chicago Blackhawks defenceman, said in the letter
to the Japanese Olympic Committee, according to reports reaching
here.
</P>
<P>
"I want to take this opportunity to apologize to the people of
Japan, the Japanese Olympic committee, the USOC, and to all hockey
fans throughout the world," said Chelios, who signed the letter on
behalf of the United States ice hockey team.
</P>
<P>
Chelios said the 3,000 dollars was meant to make up damages on
February 18 to three rooms at the Nagano's Olympic Village as ten
chairs were broken and the walls were damaged by a fire
extinguisher.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Georgia and Turkey reached an
agreement on cooperation in the power industry on Saturday, the
Interfax news agency reported from Tbilisi, capital of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by Georgian President Eduard
Shevardnadze and by visiting Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz
in Tbilisi at the end of his two-day visit to Georgia.
</P>
<P>
Georgian Foreign Minister Irakly Menagarishvili hailed the
document as "historic" because it unveiled the implementation of a
global project to transport Azerbaijani oil from Baku to Turkey's
Ceyhan, via Georgia.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also announced a start in cooperation in
building a trans-Caucasus gas pipeline, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Menagarishvili highlighted the "untraditional character" of
Yilmaz's visit. He said Ankara's emphasis on boosting cooperation
with Tbilisi was proven by the fact that Yilmaz was accompanied by
several dozen officials and major business figures, as well as
about 70 Turkish journalists.
</P>
<P>
He was sure that close contacts between Turkey and Georgia
would be continued.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Calls for International Protection of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Expressing frustration over
the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian violence, Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat called Saturday for international protection of
Palestinians from "aggression" of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Gaza, Arafat denounced Israel for
"escalating their aggression against our people." "We are asking
for international protection very soon," he added.
</P>
<P>
Arafat did not elaborate the nature of his call for
international intervention in the Israeli-Palestinian violence,
but it is believed that he will intensify diplomatic efforts to
demand the United States and Europe increase pressure on Israel.
</P>
<P>
In an earlier statement issued Friday night, the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) warned that the clashes would continue
unless Israel tries the three Israeli soldiers who killed three
Palestinian workers at a roadblock near Hebron Tuesday. The three
soldiers were released Thursday following initial investigation
that found out that they had acted accordingly.
</P>
<P>
The Tuesday killing has triggered widespread Palestinian
violent protests in the territories in the past four days. On
Saturday, violent clashes continued in the town of Dura near
Hebron, where about 200 Palestinian youths attacked Israeli
soldiers with stones. Israeli soldiers answered by firing rubber
bullets and tear gas.
</P>
<P>
In Bethlehem, one Palestinian policeman was injured by Israeli
soldiers who used rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse
hundreds of stone-throwing Palestinian protesters. The clashes
occurred when the protesters marched toward the Jewish holy site
of Rachel's Tomb at the entrance to the city.
</P>
<P>
About 17 people including 14 Palestinians were hurt Friday
night in violent clashes between Israeli settlers and Palestinian
residents in Hebron. Among the injured included eight Palestinian
journalists employed by foreign news agencies.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police are investigating the settlers who sparked the
clashes by attempting to enter the Palestinian-ruled area of
Hebron. The police are also probing the claim that the
journalists were deliberately targeted by Israeli soldiers despite
they had identified themselves as journalists.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to give Banking Reforms priority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's newly-appointed
Finance Minister Fuad Bawazier said here on Saturday that reforms
in the banking sector will be one of the government's top
priorities in order to solve the monetary crisis.
</P>
<P>
"After the banking reforms, the government will make serious
efforts to restore international confidence towards the country's
private sector," Bawazier said.
</P>
<P>
Bawazier, who along with 35 persons was appointed by President
Soeharto Saturday morning as ministers of the seventh cabinet in
Indonesia, said apart from the need to strengthen the banking
system, there is also a need for the banks to have larger capitals
to gain the confidence of the people.
</P>
<P>
"It is urgent that the problem of foreign debts be also solved
soon," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has a total of 140 billion U.S. dollars foreign debts
and the private debts accounts for 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
On the rupiah's sharp depreciation, the minister said, the
currency crisis that affected other sectors should be restored
soon and the rupiah should be brought to its realistic value.
</P>
<P>
On the plan to implement the Currency Board System (CBS),
Bawazier said it is still studied carefully.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, President Soeharto also said he was confident the new
cabinet could help him bring the nation out of foreign dependence
which in turn would enable Indonesia to deal with various problems
caused by globalization.
</P>
<P>
"Freeing ourselves from foreign dependence means we have to
strengthen national resilience. It also means that we have to
promote mutual respect and cooperation with other countries and
other international institutions," the president said when
announcing the list of the new cabinet.

<HEADLINE> Local Elections in Mozambique to Be Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The National Committee for
Elections will present to the Council of Ministers its proposal
that local elections be postponed until June, the Noticias
reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
With local elections being postponed, the deadlock between the
ruling party, the Mozambique Liberation Front Party (FRELIMO) and
the largest opposition party, the Mozambican National Resistance
(RENAMO) might ease up.
</P>
<P>
Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano said at a press
conference here on Friday morning that his government is willing
to consider postponing the elections as long as the National
Committee for Elections, an independent institution, makes such a
proposal.
</P>
<P>
The local elections are scheduled to be held in 33 cities and
towns on May 29 in line with the election law passed by the
Mozambican parliament.
</P>
<P>
Afonso Dhlakama, Chairman of RENAMO, reaffirmed that his party
would quit the elections after his meeting with President
Chissano on Monday.
</P>
<P>
RENAMO demanded that voters should be registered anew for
election in the 33 cities and towns, the power of the National
Committee for Elections be redefined and representatives from
opposition parties be included in the Technical Secretariat of
Election Administration.
</P>
<P>
The Savana weekly published today said that there are signs
that RENAMO's position on elections may change with the flexible
attitude shown by President Chissano.
</P>
<P>
The central committee of the ruling party FRELIMO ended its
second session on Monday, declaring its opposition against
postponing elections.
</P>
<P>
The ruling party said that the problems occurring in voter
registration were not serious and are being rectified, therefore,
there is no reason to postpone the elections.

The arrangement of the captured members of rebel groups is a

<HEADLINE> British Defense Secretary Arrives in Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 14 (Xinhua) -- British Defense Secretary
George Robertson arrived in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Saturday on a
two-day visit for talks on defense and security issues, Kuwait
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted British diplomatic sources in Riyadh as
saying that Robertson, who is paying his first visit to Saudi
Arabia since he assumed office last May, will hold talks with
Saudi second Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense Prince
Sultan Ibn Abdul-Aziz to discuss means of boosting defense
cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Britain is the second largest arms supplier to Saudi Arabia
after the United States. The two countries signed a defense
agreement in 1985 under which Britain was to sell the kingdom
sophisticated weapons and defense equipment worth about 21
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The deal also envisions joint investments of a sum of 1.6
billion dollars in strategic projects under the offset program.
</P>
<P>
The sources said Robertson will discuss with Prince Sultan the
latest developments in the Gulf region in light of the
Iraq-U.N. deal over unconditional access of U.N. weapons
inspectors to the Iraqi palace sites suspected of hiding weapons
of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Robertson will also meet with Saudi Crown Prince and
Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz.
</P>
<P>
He will continue his tour to the United Arab Emirates (UAE)
after wrapping up his Saudi Visit Sunday. He will attend the
third international defense exhibition and conference in the UAE,
the sources said.

<HEADLINE> Writethru: Sonia Gandhi Appointed New Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Congress star campaign and
widow of former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi Sonia Gandhi was
appointed new Congress president here Saturday to replace Sitaram
Kesri.
</P>
<P>
Announcing this, senior party leader Sharad Pawar said Sonia
Gandhi would preside over a meeting of the Congress Working
Committee (CWC), the highest policy-making body of the party,
convened here at 17:30 (local time) Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In search of a charismatic and able leader, CWC in its meeting
on Saturday morning appointed Sonia Gandhi as new party president,
removing incumbent Sitaram Kesri, whose resignation was not
confirmed yet.
</P>
<P>
"To remove the confusion and state of uncertainty leading to
irreparable and immense harm to the party (in the wake of Kesri's
announcement on Monday to resign), the CWC resolves to appoint
Sonia Gandhi as the president of Indian National Congress in
exercise of its powers conferred in clause (j) of article 19 of
the party constitution with immediate effect," said a resolution
adopted at the CWC meeting on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It was not clear whether Kesri had resigned but the
announcement about the appointment of Sonia as the new president
was made by senior leaders of the party who held discussions with
Sonia midway through a meeting of the CWC.
</P>
<P>
The resolution took note of the special situation arising out
of Kesri's March 9 announcement that he had decided to resign in
favor of Sonia Gandhi. "After considering the special situation
since this announcement, CWC feels that the organizational work
had come to a standstill and that a hiatus had been created in the
smooth functioning of the party," the resolution said.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the top job of the Congress organization was offered
to Sonia Gandhi immediately after her husband and former prime
minister Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated during election campaign in
Tamil Nadu on May 21, 1991, but she declined the offer. After
seven years of silence, she finally decided to campaign for the
Congress in the just concluded general elections to the 12th Lower
House of Parliament and is credited by observers with preventing a
rout for the 113-year-old party. The Congress, which was forecast
not to cross the double digit mark, managed a tally of 141 seats
alone out of 539 already elected MPs in the House, largely due to
her charismatic presence during the campaigns.
</P>
<P>
Defiant incumbent Kesri refused to quit and termed her
appointment as "illegal". Addressing a press conference here
shortly after an emergency CWC meeting from which he walked out in
a midway, Kesri said that the CWC decision was "unconstitutional"
and that he would take the issue to the people's court. In the CWC
meeting earlier, Kesri was learnt to have reacted to the
suggestion to make way for Sonia Gandhi by saying "don't bring
pressure. I will do it in a dignified way". When asked about his
often repeated quote that he would make way for Sonia Gandhi to
take over as Congress president, he said he still stood by it but
would go out only in a dignified manner.

<HEADLINE> Head of U.N. Special Arms Inspection Group Leaves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Head of the U.N. special group of
international experts and senior diplomats designated to inspect
Iraqi presidential palaces, Sri Lankan Jayanatha Dhanapala, left
here Saturday after a four-day visit to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Dhanapala held talks with Iraqi Deputy
Prime Minister Tariq Aziz and Oil Minister Amir Mohammed Rashid,
and discussed measures to visit Iraqi presidential sites
according to the Iraq-U.N. memorandum of understanding signed last
month.
</P>
<P>
They have reportedly agreed to carry out inspections to
presidential sites later this month.
</P>
<P>
Dhanapala, 60, a specialist in disarmament, was appointed last
month as commissioner of the U.N special group which will inspect
the eight Iraqi presidential sites under the accord signed by
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Aziz.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with Dhanapala, Aziz said Iraq was keen to
implement the accord and cooperate with the United Nations to
ensure transparent and objective effectuation that would ensure
Iraq's sovereignty, dignity and national security.
</P>
<P>
While Dhanapala underlined the United Nations' commitment to
applying the accord as soon as possible and in good will, and that
his special group will take into consideration of Iraq's
legitimate concerns.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of this U.N. special group was included in
the accord which successfully defused, at least for the time
being, a crisis over U.N. arms inspection in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The special group will comprise senior diplomats appointed by
Annan and experts drawn from the U.N. Special Commission, known
as UNSCOM in charge of eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction, and the International Atomic Energy Agency.

<HEADLINE> Ma Man Kei on Macao's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- A noted patriotic businessman
from Macao today expressed the hope that the younger generation in
Macao would carry forward locals' tradition of loving Macao and
the country and devote themselves to Macao's smooth return to
China at the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
"I believe Macao will smoothly return to the embrace of the
motherland and have a still better tomorrow," said Ma Man-kei, 78,
who was just re-elected vice-chairman of the National Committee of
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC),
the country's top advisory body, on Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, he acknowledged, there remains a lot of work to do
before Macao's return to China, and the Preparatory Committee for
the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR), which is expected
to be set up soon, will face arduous tasks.
</P>
<P>
Despite the friendly ties and cooperation between China and
Portugal on various issues concerning Macao's return, there are
still some major problems that are required to be solved as soon
as possible, he noted.
</P>
<P>
These problems include localizing Macao's civil service and
laws, confirming the Chinese as the official language of Macao and
improving Macao's economy and public security, he said.
</P>
<P>
Although Macao's economic growth has slowed down over recent
years, Ma said that he still has a strong faith in the region's
future economic development.
</P>
<P>
"Macao is small in terms of area and population, but has its
own advantages," he said. "It has a convenient transportation, the
status of a free harbor and independent customs region, and close
economic and trade links with the European Community and the
United States."
</P>
<P>
What's more important, he added, is that Macao has the backing
of China's interior areas, whose economic growth has maintained a
strong momentum in the past years.
</P>
<P>
"It is out of question that Macao will be turned into a
medium-sized international economic, information, convention,
tourism and trade center," he noted.

<HEADLINE> Profile of India's New Congress President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The following is a profile of
new Congress President Sonia Gandhi, who was appointed by the
Congress Working Committee (CWC), the highest policy-making body
of the party, here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Sonia Gandhi was born in an obscure Italian town of Ovassanjo
on December 9, 1946. Married to India's best known family of
Nehru-Gandhi in 1968, the 52-year-old widow of assassinated former
prime minister Rajiv Gandhi became a primary member of the
Congress two years ago.
</P>
<P>
After a tortuous suspense, Sonia finally decided to campaign
for the Congress in the just concluded general elections to the
12th Lower House of Parliament and is credited by observers with
preventing a rout for the 113-year-old party. The Congress managed
a tally of 141 seats alone, largely due to her charismatic
presence during the election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
Sonia, whose Italian origin gave her opponents propaganda
grist, became an Indian citizen in 1984.
</P>
<P>
Sonia met Rajiv Gandhi in Cambridge, Britain during the 1960s'
when Rajiv was studying at the famous British university. Sonia
and Rajiv became extremely fond of each other.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the top job of the Congress organization was offered
to her on a platter immediately after the death of her husband on
May 21, 1991, but she declined the offer.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Plays Down EU Proposal on Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa Saturday played down the reported European initiative as
insufficient to resuscitate the deadlocked Mideast peace talks,
Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The ideas to be floated by British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook
during his tour of the region next week came to light as the U.S.,
the main sponsor of the peace process, has failed to reactivate
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"We can not call this an initiative, but a number of sound and
logical ideas. There should not be exaggeration over these ideas
as reported in yesterday's local press headings," Moussa said
following a meeting with President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister noted that these ideas have already been
rejected by the Israelis, adding that they "do not appear to be
enough" to break the current deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Cook, who will arrive here on Sunday at the start of his
six-leg regional trip, is scheduled to meet with Mubarak and
Moussa, to discuss the European Union plans, forged in
coordination with Britain, in its capacity as current EU chairman.
</P>
<P>
The initiative calls for Palestinian commitment to Israel's
security demands, and urges Israel to implement a significant
redeployment, halt settlement operations and support the
Palestinian economy.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace process have been deadlocked for
nearly a year over Israeli construction of a Jewish settlement in
Arab East Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Macao Holds Largest Basic Law Lecture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, March 14 (Xinhua) -- A lecture featuring the Basic Law
of Macao attracted more than 2,000 people here on Saturday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Organized by the Macao Prosperity Promotion Association and
attended by members of the association and middle schools
students, the lecture included the making of the law, its main
contents, the principle on which the law is based, the function of
the law, and the rights and responsibilities of residents in the
future Macao Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
Chow Kam Fai David, president of the association, said in a
speech that the lecture was designed to mark the 5th anniversary of
the law and to enhance awareness of the law among members of the
association as well as the whole society.
</P>
<P>
"The law is closely connected with every one of the
400,000-plus residents in Macao as it is the constitutional law of
the Macao Special Administrative Region," he said. "I hope that
more of our members would study the law and play an active role in
handling Macao's transitional affairs so that a smooth handover
could be achieved."
</P>
<P>
The association has planned to organize more such lectures in
the near future, including one in the Portuguese language which
aims to boost confidence of the Portuguese descendants who have
decided to stay on after 1999, Chow said.
</P>
<P>
A series of activities will be launched by the Macao Basic Law
Promotion Association, mainly composed of the people who
participated in the drafting of and consultation on the law,
around March 31 to mark the 5th anniversary of the law.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Calls for Trying U.S., British Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has called for trying
U.S. and British leaders for having committed crimes against the
Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Iraqi Ministry of Culture and Information
was quoted by the Iraqi News Agency (INA) as making a response to
the U.S. Senate resolution adopted Friday calling for convening an
international war-crimes tribunal to indict, prosecute and
imprison Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
If there is an international tribunal to try war criminals it
should be "whoever have taken part in annihilating the Iraqi people
and deprived them of their right to live," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"The war criminals are Former American President George Bush,
his successor Bill Clinton, Former British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, American and British defense and foreign secretaries and
American and British field commanders," the spokesman argued.
</P>
<P>
"War criminals are not those who defend their native soil,
their sovereignty and the legitimate rights of their people -- as
Iraqi officials do -- because it is a national duty," he added.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that all those people who fired uranium-coated
bombs, which are internationally banned, and buried with their
vehicles and tractors hundreds of Iraqi troops alive in the
trenches, should be tried. He was referring to the deeds by the
U.S.-led allied forces during the 1991 Gulf War.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Session Praised as Democratic, Truth-Seeking One </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The just-ended First Session of
the Ninth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC), China's top advisory body, has
been cited by its members as "democratic, truth-seeking, united
and encouraging".
</P>
<P>
The 12-day First Session of Ninth CPPCC National Committee
Session, which has a membership of over 2,000, closed here this
morning amid resounding applause.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC National Committee members set forth a total of 2,863
proposals on heated topics, which were related to all social
sectors and on China's social and economic development programs.
They were contended with the outcome of the session and many of
them felt excited as they left the Great Hall of the People,
the venue of the session.
</P>
<P>
Li Xiaohua, a new member of the CPPCC National Committee who
came from the All-China Federation of Commerce and Commerce, said
the democratic and down-to-earth work style, which impressed him
most, has been penetrated throughout the session and its panel
discussions.
</P>
<P>
Xu Liangjie, president of the Heng'an Group in east China's
Fujian Province, described the CPPCC session as "very pragmatic".
The CPPCC's role of participating in the administration and
discussion of state affairs and the exercise of democratic
supervision was no empty talk.
</P>
<P>
At the new century is approaching, the new CPPCC and the entire
Chinese nation are facing both rare opportunities and challenges
just as Li Ruihuan, chairman of the new CPPCC National Committee,
put it, "It symbolizes the new development of our patriotic united
front, demonstrates the vitality of the CPPCC's work."
</P>
<P>
Prof. Lin Yaoji, a CPPCC National Committee member from the
Central Conservatory of Music, expressed his confidence in the
future of both the state and the cause of the CPPCC when he
stepped out of the east entrance of the Great Hall of the People
at the end of the session.
</P>
<P>
All CPPCC National Committee members are unanimous in the view
that the CPPCC, as the broadest patriotic united front work
organization in the country and an important organization to
implement the multi-party cooperation and political consultations
under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the CPPCC
shoulders heavy historical tasks as the Chinese nation will surely
be revitalized in the next century.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Frankie Fredericks, double
Olympic sprint silver medallist, threatened to boycott the
Commonwealth Games unless he receives his medal from the 1994
Games.
</P>
<P>
Fredericks, who arrived in Johannesburg Saturday, said that he
finished fourth in the 100m final in the 1994 Victoria Games, but
was promoted to third place because second-placed Horace Dove
Edwin was disqualifed after testing positive for steroids.
</P>
<P>
The Namibian star said he is still waiting for his bronze medal
in Victoria, Canada.
</P>
<P>
"I ran in the 200m as well and was around in the athletes'
village for quite some time after the 100m final, so there is no
excuse why the organisers did not get my medal to me," Fredericks
said in a press conference.
</P>
<P>
"If I don't receive my medal soon, I won't go to the Kuala
Lumpur Games."
</P>
<P>
Fredericks will compete in Monday's second Grand Prix Summer
Series track meeting in Roodepoort, and Friday's series final in
Cape Town.

<HEADLINE> UNGA President: UN Members Should Fulfill Financial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 14 (Xinhua) -- United Nations General
Assembly (UNGA) President Hennadiy Udovenko Saturday called upon
members of the United Nations to pay their arrears to the world
body.
</P>
<P>
Any member country should fulfill its financial obligations to
the UN "without any conditions", he told a news conference at the
end of his three-day official visit to Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The world body is facing financial problems, said Udovenko, who
succeeded Malaysia's Tan Sri Razali Ismail as UNGA president for
the 52nd session.
</P>
<P>
He said he had a very detailed exchange of views with Malaysian
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, Deputy Prime Minister Anwar
Ibrahim and Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi on a few major
issues pertaining to the current international and regional topics
including the Kosovo crisis and problems of reforming the United
Nations Organization and its Security Council, and discussed with
them further steps in developing Ukrainian-Malaysian bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
On the UN reforms, the UNGA president said it was difficult to
perform the reforms of the Security Council as there is no
consensus on how to enlarge the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to a press communique issued Saturday at
the end of Udovenko's visit, the Malaysian side welcomed efforts
by Ukraine aimed at its rapid integration into the world community
and supported, in particular, its aspiration to participate in the
political and economic processes in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral matters, Udovenko, who came here also in his
capacity as Ukrainian foreign minister, said he discussed with the
Malaysian leaders the idea of establishing a joint commission on
trade, economic, scientific and technical cooperation to enhance
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The press communique said it was agreed that the two sides
would encourage at the state level the establishment of
Ukrainian-Malaysian joint ventures and arranging of exhibition,
business conference and seminars.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed that the establishment of a proper
legal framework of bilateral relations is one of priority tasks.
</P>
<P>
Udovenko leaves here for Tokyo later Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Mothers Can Pass On Hepatitis Virus: Chinese Scientists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Researchers at Shanghai's Ruijin
Hospital have shown that the hepatitis-C virus can be transmitted
not only by blood but by a mother directly to her child.
</P>
<P>
A study of 36 women with the virus found that 10 of their
babies had been infected before birth, said Prof. Lu Zhimeng, who
directed the research, meaning that it is transmitted to the fetus
through the placenta in the womb.
</P>
<P>
The virus can also be found in a person's saliva and urine,
meaning that body fluids are also a possible vector for the virus,
she said. Blood has long been shown to be the major means of
transmission, but about half the patients with the virus in the
world do not have a clear history of contact with tainted blood,
so finding another vector has been a major research topic.
</P>
<P>
Hepatitis-C affects about 3.2 percent of the Chinese, and 70
percent are expected to become chronic hepatitis sufferers later
in their lives. Some 20 percent of those sufferers will finally
develop liver cirrhosis or even cancer.
</P>
<P>
No vaccine for the virus is available because of the great
variability of the disease, scientists said, but Chinese
researchers have discovered three differences that have not been
reported before and that may be helpful for developing a vaccine,
Lu saids.

<HEADLINE> Ethical Progress A Hot Topic At NPC and CPPCC Sessions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Cultural and ethical progress is
an inevitable demand born of China's developing economy as well as
a guarantee for steady economic growth and long-term social
stability.
</P>
<P>
This view is held by Chinese legislators and members of the
country's top advisory body, in Beijing for the annual sessions
respectively of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC) and the
Ninth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC).
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers and CPPCC national committee members spoke highly of
the part of Premier Li Peng's government work report that stresses
the importance of "grasping with both hands and with equal
emphasis" -- a reference to the need to give equal importance to
material progress and ethnical progress -- and promises to "ensure
necessary material input" into projects aimed at promoting
cultural and ethical progresses.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xianliang, a noted man of letters, said China's rapid
economic development has promoted people's pursuit of a cultural
life. A marked improvement in people's education, a lower
illiteracy rate among the population, and a more open attitude of
the people have laid a solid foundation for cultural and ethical
progress, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li Yan, a CPPCC national committee member from the Jiusan
Society, one of the eight non-Communist parties, noted there is
much to be desired with regard to social ethics. He called for
more material input into cultural- and ethical-related projects so
as to maintain a co-ordinated progress in both economic and
cultural advances.
</P>
<P>
Li Wenshan, a former chairman of the CPPCC Hebei Provincial
Committee and Xu Qixiong, a famous calligrapher, said cultural and
ethical progress is not a matter within the domain of the Party's
publicity departments alone.
</P>
<P>
It is the responsibility of governments at all levels as a
common task of the entire society, they said, emphasizing that
cultural and ethical progress should be included in a general plan
of national economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
Sheng Zhongguo, a noted violinist, pointed out that, like
economic development, there should be a set goal for cultural
and ethical progress.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Arrives in Cairo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat arrived here Saturday afternoon on a
lightning visit for talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
amid rampant Arab unrest in the Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival, the Palestinian leader lashed out at Israel's
rejection of a recent European initiative to salvage the stalled
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli government turns down all initiatives whether they
are European, Arab, American or Russian, because it insists on
evading the agreements signed between the Palestinian side and
former Israeli government," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's visit here came a day before British Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook launches his six-leg tour of the region to float the
European initiative that calls on Israel to withdraw from the West
Bank and halt Jewish settlement activities, while urging the
Palestinians to guarantee Israeli security demands.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is a frequent visitor of Cairo for meetings with
Egyptian leaders on Mideast peace.
</P>
<P>
Arafat came here as clashes between stone-throwing Palestinians
and Israeli troops have raged for three days in the West Bank over
the killing of three Palestinian workers on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader has expressed hope that the tensions
would not affect peace moves which have already been in shatters
for a year over Israeli settlement building, overdue troops
withdrawal from the West Bank and Palestinian bombing
attacks.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN to Form New Body to Facilitate Engineers Mobility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) Saturday agreed to form a new body to be
called "ASEAN Engineer" to facilitate mobility of engineers within
the member countries.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached at the ASEAN Federation of Engineers
Organization Round Table meeting here attended by leading
engineers from Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Brunei and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Such a body is needed due to the growth triangles among ASEAN
countries that might require movement of engineers within the
region, Mohamed Mazlan, president of the Institution of
Engineers, Malaysia, representing Malaysia at the meeting, told a
news conference.
</P>
<P>
He said ASEAN Engineer would be quite similar to the model of
Euro Engineer and would be implemented in about one-and-a-half
years' time.
</P>
<P>
He said this special body would benefit ASEAN engineers as they
would get the priority to work within ASEAN countries compared to
western engineers.
</P>
<P>
"In case an ASEAN country is short of engineers, while another
country has engineers, we should take from that country instead of
from the west.... In the past, we tend to look at the west," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The member countries can also benefit from the transfer of
technology resulting from the engineers' mobility, he said, adding
every member country has its unique strength.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has been chosen as ASEAN Engineer's first secretariat
and will have a special accreditation body for ASEAN engineers.
</P>
<P>
With this accreditation body, engineers would not face
difficulties regarding academic qualifications when working
outside their country as they have to meet specific criteria set
by ASEAN Engineer, Mohamed Mazlan said.

<HEADLINE> China Hands Over Irrigation Project to Namibia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NOORDOEWER (Namibia), March 14 (Xinhua) -- China Saturday
officially handed over a multi-million-U.S. Dollar irrigation
project to Namibia.
</P>
<P>
Namibian President Sam Nujoma unveiled the plaque for the
Aussenkehr Irrigation Project on Orange River bordering Namibia
and South Africa, some 40 kilometers west of Noordoewer.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma said in a speech that the scheme was of "national
importance" and will help local people self reliant in food
production.
</P>
<P>
He said the project would give impetus to similar schemes in
other parts of the country and thanked the Chinese government for
its "generous assistance."
</P>
<P>
After he started the pump, Nujoma also visited the reservoir,
which is part of the water project.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador Lian Zhengbao said in his speech that the
project would enhance friendship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
A handover document was signed by Lian and Namibian Minister
of Agriculture, Water and Rural Development, Helmut Angula.
</P>
<P>
The 2.95-million-Dollar project was constructed by China
Overseas Engineering Corporation, using interest-free loans from
China.
</P>
<P>
The pump station was designed to have a capacity of 2,500
cubic meters per hour, but owing to power constraint, it now
pumps only 1,100 cubic meters. To its full capacity, the project
could cover 2,000 hectares of land.
</P>
<P>
General Manager of the project, Shen Huming, told reporters
that the just completed was only the first phase of an ambitious
plan and that the second phase, focused on agricultural
development in the region, was under negotiation.
</P>
<P>
A farmer from Yugoslavia, Dusan Vasiljevic, who grows grapes
here, said the project was "very impressive and very important to
the Namibian economy."
</P>
<P>
He said he was planning to buy some of the water pumped
through the project to expand his vineyard.
</P>
<P>
Chinese economic and commercial counsellor, Yuan Chengyu, and
several local officials also attended the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Yuan said China had offered Namibia interest-free loans of 250
million Renminbi yuan (about 30 million Dollars) since Namibia's
independence in 1990.

<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The State Bureau of Technology
Supervision held a program today in Wangfujing, the busiest
commercial area in Beijing, for "International Consumer Rights
Protection Day", on March 15.
</P>
<P>
Bureau personnel and people from technology supervision
departments explained the Chinese Consumer Rights Protection Law
and gave consumers other advice and provided quality appraisals.
</P>
<P>
Other activities are being held nationwide, according to Li
Chuanqing, director of SBTS.
</P>
<P>
Awareness of consumer rights in China has improved a lot in
recent years, Li says, and the bureau will cooperate with the
State Administration for Industry and Commerce to benefit
consumers across the country even more.
</P>
<P>
A recent study has shown that urbanities had greater interest
in the Consumer Rights Protection Law than in any other laws,
including the Labor Law and the Criminal Law.
</P>
<P>
The bureau has passed regulations in response to appeals for
product quality to provide greater protection.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Technology Supervision Bureau received 9,600
consumer complaints in 1997, and helped people recover 6.8 million
yuan (819,000 US dollars) in potential losses.
</P>
<P>
The local administrative bureau for indutry and commerce has
opened a hotline in Beijing, to receive consumer
complaints. Similar hotlines are operating in Zhejiang and Fujian
provinces and in some other cities.

<HEADLINE> India's Regional Party Hands Over Letters of Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The All-India Anna Dravida
Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) and its allies Saturday handed over to
President K. R. Narayanan delayed letters of support for a
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government at the Center.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, AIADMK supremo Jayalalitha at a press
conference launched a virulent attack on BJP leaders. She said she
was not happy with the BJP, but was clearing the delivery of
support letters to the president in public interest, as AIADMK was
being accused of stalling the government formation.
</P>
<P>
The 27 MPs of the AIADMK and its allies would extend support to
a BJP-led government only from the outside, she further said. She
denied that she had set any pre-conditions for her support.
</P>
<P>
With the support of the AIADMK and its allies, the prospect of
forming the next government has become brightened for the BJP,
which emerged the largest political party in the just concluded
general elections.
</P>
<P>
BJP prime ministerial candidate A. B. Vajpayee furnished a
letter of support of only 240 members out of the 539 already
elected MPs in the 12th Lower House of Parliament to the president
on Thursday. The President did not invite him to form the
government. Instead, he expanded his consultation scope by
inviting leaders of other political formations to discuss the
issue of government formation.
</P>
<P>
The BJP Saturday expressed the hope that the president would
now invite Vajpayee to form the next government following
Jayalalitha's decision to extend the support of the AIADMK and its
allies to a BJP-led coalition.

<P>
Technology supervision departments should answer complaints

complaints about lesser problems will be dealt with by
administrative measures, the regulations state.
</P>
<P>
The regulations also explain procedures and time limits in

<HEADLINE> Top ANC Officials to Meet on TRC Court Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 14 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's ruling
African National Congress (ANC) Saturday will discuss the court
application by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) to
overturn the blanket amnesty granted to 37 ANC officials.
</P>
<P>
The ANC's National Executive Committee's Subcommittee on Truth
and Reconciliation, chaired by Vice President Thabo Mbeki, would
meet in Gauteng to discuss the issue and would issue a statement
later, The Citizen quoted ANC spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa as saying
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The TRC on Friday filed an application on the Cape Town High
Court to overturn the blanket amnesty granted to 37 ANC members
by the TRC's Amnesty Committee last November and to direct the
Amnesty Committee to consider it afresh.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki and five cabinet ministers, Defense Minister Joe Modise,
Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo, Justice Minister Dullah Omar,
Transport Minister Mac Maharaj and Tourism Minister Pallo Jordan,
are among the 37 given blanket amnesty.
</P>
<P>
However, the TRC's move was described by the National Party
(NP), the country's largest opposition party, as a damage control
exercise, coming a day after the NP had filed similar papers.
</P>
<P>
The NP said Friday it would not easily withdraw its
application to the High Court as requested by the TRC, because
the TRC could then be able to settle the matter on much weaker
terms than the relief they were apparently seeking from the
court.
</P>
<P>
TRC chairman Desmond Tutu said earlier that he hoped the NP
would consider withdrawing its application, because the papers,
which cited the TRC as a respondent, complicated matters.
</P>
<P>
The TRC, set up in 1995, is a fact-finding body authorized by
the government. It listens to claims by the victims of violence
in the Apartheid, prepares for ultimate affordable reparation,
and receives amnesty applications from those who inflicted the
injury.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar Port Lost Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The Zanzibar Port has lost
business after the union government of Tanzania harmonized taxes
there with those on the mainland ports, the Daily News reported
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
From July 1996 to June 1997, 4,694 containers of various goods
equivalent of 33,000 tons, toured through the isles to Dar es
Salaam, compared with 6,186 containers equivalent of 52,000 tons
during July 1995 and June 1996, Tanzanian Revenue Authority
officials revealed in the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar used to be a favorite route of tax evaders due to the
low tax rates charged on import goods there. Prior to the
harmonization of taxes, businessmen took the advantage of the
Zanzibar Port to import goods and transferred them to Dar es
Salaam for sales with maximized profits.
</P>
<P>
The harmonization of taxes between the mainland and the isles
port prompted businessmen to transport their goods directly to
Dar es Salaam instead of using the Zanzibar Port as a transit
route.
</P>
<P>
As a result, only 9.6 billion Shillings (about 1.6 million US
dollars) from taxes on containers were collected from July 1996
to June 1997, a sharp decrease from 15.6 billion Shillings from
1995 to 1996.

hailing the success of the First Session of the Ninth National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), the country's top advisory body, which closed

</P>
<P>
"It is a democratic and pragmatic, united and encouraging
session convened at the turn of the century, which will bring
together people of all ethnic groups and social sectors across the
country and encourage them to take big strides toward new
magnificent goals," it says.
</P>
<P>
It notes that the next five years represent a critical period
for China's development, and that new situation and tasks have
raised new and higher demand on the CPPCC.
</P>
<P>
"We're convinced that the Ninth CPPCC National Committee will
continue to hold high banners of socialism and patriotism,
constantly consolidate and develop the patriotic united front,
conscientiously subject itself to and serve the country's overall
situation, and make new contributions to the reform, opening up
and socialist modernization drive and to the great cause of
China's peaceful reunification," it says.
</P>
<P>

political consultation under the leadership of the CPC is a basic
political system of China, and that as a major form of this
system, the CPPCC plays an extremely important role in the
country's political life.

<P>
The article describes the CPPCC as a united front organization
with the widest social representation and maximum political
inclusion.
</P>
<P>
"This nature has laid a solid foundation for the CPPCC to
collect opinions and combine the wisdom of all sectors of the
society, and successfully carry out its functions of political
consultation, democratic supervision, and discussion about and
participation in the running of state affairs," it says.
</P>
<P>
It goes on to say that the CPPCC has enrolled a large number of
highly-competent skilled personnel, including both experienced
leading officials and outstanding experts and scholars.
</P>
<P>
"We should give full play to this advantage and provide a
strong intellectual support for the development of various
undertakings of our country," it suggests.
</P>
<P>
As a result of nearly half a century of active probe and
practice, the article says, the CPPCC has now established a fine
tradition of uniting as many people as possible both at home and
abroad.
</P>
<P>
"We must carry forward this tradition, unite every
motherland-loving Chinese across the world, improve our links and
friendship with people in other countries, and strive for the
realization of the great goal of reunifying the motherland and
reinvigorating the Chinese nation," it notes.
</P>
<P>
It points out that the CPC is both the initiator and the
backbone of the CPPCC, and that the CPPCC must attribute its
steady growth over the past decades to the correct leadership of
the CPC.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, we must further strengthen and improve the Party's
leadership over the CPPCC work, to ensure that the CPPCC always
focus on the central tasks of the Party and the state while
effectively performing its duties," it says.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 14 (Xinhua) - The Organization of African
Unity (OAU) will increase its budget by 3.1 percent in the next
fiscal year, local newspapers reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, the budget of OAU will go up to 33.1
million US dollars in the 1998/1999 fiscal year from 32.1 million
US dollars in the 1998/99 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Minister for Foreign Affairs and International
Cooperation Jakaya Kikwete, who is also current Chairman of the
OAU Council of Ministers, said at a press conference here on
Friday that his Council is considering to raise the fixed
budget-increase ceiling by 10 percent so as to enable the
oganization to meet its obligations more smoothly.
</P>
<P>
"The move will help to finance the newly established African
Economic Community (AEC) in the OAU budget," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kikwete said that during the meeting in Addis Ababa, the
Ethiopian Capital and headquarters of OAU late last month, the
Council decided that this year the AEC has to use the money to be
accrued from the payment of the arrears.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that OAU member states owe the organization seven
million US dollars in annual contribution arrears.
</P>
<P>
"The indebted countries should settle their arrears as soon as
possible to enable the organization to operate smoothly," Kikwete
added.
</P>
<P>
As the most powerful organization in Africa, the OAU with 53
member states has been playing an important role in promoting
unity, cooperation and development in the continent since its
foundation on May 25, 1963.

<HEADLINE> Irani, Kazakh FMs Discuss Oil Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi and his visiting Kazakh counterpart Kasymzhomart Tokayev
held a meeting Friday evening and underlined importance of oil
cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, Kharrazi stressed the need for practical
steps towards oil cooperation and called for exploring new fields
of cooperation in the light of potentials of the two countries,
the official news agency IRNA reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He called for the expansion of Tehran-Almaty bilateral ties,
saying that relations between the two countries should be based on
a consolidated basis.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan has the intention to export its oil through Iranian
soil. But reports said that the Kazakh government has been under
strong pressure from the United States over the issue.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the issue of the Caspian Sea, Kharrazi urged for
speedy formulation of its legal regime based on the consensus of
the five littoral states and with the aim to exploit its resources
rationally.
</P>
<P>
As long as the Caspian Sea legal regime has not been adopted,
any unilateral exploitation of its resources will be detrimental
to the interests of other neighboring states, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tokayev, who arrived here Friday afternoon for
a one-day visit, said that promotion of cooperation with Iran topped
on the agenda of Kazakhstan's foreign policy, adding that Almaty
has made extensive efforts to further expand relations with
Tehran.
</P>
<P>
He voiced Kazakhstan's readiness for cooperation with Iran in
the field of oil, terming the prospect of Tehran-Almaty bilateral
relations as "bright."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the three Iranians arrested in Kazakhstan on
charges of espionage, the Kazakh foreign minister expressed the
hope that with their release in the coming days, misunderstandings
between the two countries would be removed.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers also reviewed major regional and
international developments, including the situation in Afghanistan
and Kosovo, Yugoslavia, as well as issues related to the Economic
Cooperation Organization.

<HEADLINE> Iran Condemns U.S. Court Ruling on Terrorist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Iran has strongly condemned a
U.S. district court ruling that Tehran should compensate the
family of an American citizen killed in Gaza, the Iranian official
news agency IRNA reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The summary judgement by a U.S. district court against the
Islamic Republic of Iran is baseless and irresponsible in the
extreme and representative of a dangerous trend and should be
condemned," Iran's mission to the United Nations was quoted as
saying in a press release Friday.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. court in Washington recently ruled that Iran should pay
247 million U.S. dollars to the family of an American woman, Alisa
Flatow, who was killed in a bomb blast in Gaza, the Palestinian
self-rule area, in April 1995, since the Iran-backed Palestinian
Islamic Jihad has claimed responsibility for the attack.
</P>
<P>
Iran's U.N. mission said that the allegations "are without a
shred of substantiation and have no basis in fact and fail any
standard of evidence," describing the court ruling as "politically
motivated."
</P>
<P>
It said that Iran has consistently condemned terrorism in all
its forms and manifestations and categorically rejected any part
in the incident leading to Flatow's death.
</P>
<P>
"The court ruling based on testimony of witness totally
lacking objectivity and credibility, represents a flagrant
violation of the minimum standards of internationally accepted due
process," the press release read.
</P>
<P>
Iran's U.N. mission noted that Iran, as a victim of terrorism,
sympathizes with all who fell victim to this international menace,
adding that "the (U.S.) court decision and the dangerous
legislation, which is itself contrary to rules and principles of
international law and had been tailor-made to serve the political
agenda of this case, neither serve justice nor the fight against
terrorism."

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Budget Deficit Drops Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon made a good start in
realizing its tough 1998 budget deficit goal, with the red figure
for January and February sharply dropped to 27 percent from the 52
percent a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The state collected 644.1 billion Lebanese pounds (about 423
million U.S. dollars) of revenues for January and February and
spent 877 billion pounds (about 576 million U.S. dollars),
according to latest official figures quoted in the Daily Star
newspaper Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese economy deteriorated in 1997 due to the high
deficit which reached 59 percent, far over the 36 percent
budgetary forecast.
</P>
<P>
The government has vowed to bring the deficit down through
checking overspending. The 1998 budget deficit has been set at 42
percent.
</P>
<P>
But economists said it is generally too early to judge the
government's fiscal performance, adding the latest figures failed
to indicate a smooth development and could be misleading.
</P>
<P>
An unusual 8 percent budget surplus was achieved for February,
but a deficit as high as 45 percent was recorded for January.
</P>
<P>
Minister of State for Finance Fuad Sinyoura was also quoted as
pointing out to the fact that revenues and expenses are not
coordinated to come equally every month.
</P>
<P>
"My message is: stay with us and judge the government
objectively. We are committed to keep the deficit below 42
percent for the year," he said.

<HEADLINE> South Korea's Trade Surplus With China to Rise in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Crisis-engulfed South Korea will
see its trade surplus with China jump to five billion U.S. dollars
this year, compared with last year's 3.8 billion U.S. dollars,
the Korea International Trade Association (KITA) said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
South Korean exports to China will grow by 16.7 percent to 16
billion dollars this year while its imports to rise by 10.9
percent to 11 billion dollars, the association predicted.
</P>
<P>
The KITA attributed the forecast trade surplus to the price
competitiveness of the South Korean products resulting from the
devalued won and wage stability in the country, which has been in
a serious financial crisis caused by corporate failures and bad
loans of financial institutions since late 1997.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, China's fourth largest trade partner, saw its
exports and imports to China up by 20.6 percent and 16.2 percent
respectively in 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, South Korea's trade deficits last year rose up 13.7
billion dollars against Japan, 9.2 billion dollars against the
United States and 2.5 billion dollars against the European Union.

<HEADLINE> US Rejects Abacha Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The United States said Friday it
will not accept the current head of state, General Sani Abacha or
any of his military aides as the next civilian president of
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time in two days the U.S. clarifies its
position on Nigeria's political transition program, under which
the military regime will hand over to an elected government on
August 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Information Service (USIS) Thursday refuted reports
carried in Nigerian newspapers credited to the American
ambassador, who was quoted as saying that the U.S. supports
Abacha under certain conditions.
</P>
<P>
USIS stressed that Ambassador Williams Twaddell "was misquoted
by a number of newspapers on the issue".
</P>
<P>
Coming on the heels of the clarification, Assistant Secretary
of State for African Affairs Susan Rice spoke again Friday on the
country's position.
</P>
<P>
"Any military candidate or top government official who emerges
as civilian president would not be accepted by the U.S.," she
said, quoted by a report reaching here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Rice was commenting on Nigeria's transition to civil rule
program ahead of President Bill Clinton's official visit to some
African countries later this month.
</P>
<P>
She also warned that the existing sanctions against the
country following the annulment of the June 12, 1993 election
will remain in place until the country returns to a democratic
rule.
</P>
<P>
Rice's comment, according to observers, also came in the heels
of a strong pressure on Abacha to succeed himself.
</P>
<P>
A two-million-man rally was held in the Nigerian capital Abuja
last week to ask Abacha to contest the presidential election
billed to start in August.
</P>
<P>
The rally was given official protection while the anti-Abacha
five-million-man march in Lagos was disrupted by the police.
</P>
<P>
Abacha is yet to make his position known on the issue but his
special adviser on political affairs told the Abuja rally that he
would respond in a few weeks.

<HEADLINE> Ugadna's Business Idea Appreciated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Ugadna's business idea of
developing private sector was appreciated by local business
communities in east Africa, "The Monitor" reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
James Mulwana, chairman of Uganda Manufacturers' Association,
told the newspaper Friday that Africans have to produce for local
consumers first before they send their products to the world
market.
</P>
<P>
Just returning from the African Trade and Investment
Conference held in Addis Ababa, he championed the concept of
regional integration of resources, markets and policies.
</P>
<P>
"Few African countries on their own have the market size to
justify internationally competitive investments or the capital to
implement such investments," his address on the conference reads.
</P>
<P>
The most challenging problem facing now African continent is
how to reach the objective of regional integration, he added.
</P>
<P>
Organized private sector grows faster because of easier
interaction with government, access to markets and sharing of
limited research and training facilities, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The private sector development program (PSDP) funded by the
government of Uganda has spent last year 500 million Uganda
Shillings (some 450,000 U.S. Dollars) to support training and
research in benefit of private sector, he told the conference.
</P>
<P>
His idea attracted businessmen from Kenya and Tanzania and
they are preparing to establish similar organization. PSDP has
already sent its officials to Kigali to set up a similar
organization in Rwanda, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Eria Kategaya, the first deputy prime minister of Uganda,
appealed east Africans to take real step to develop business and
regional cooperation on basis of mutual benefit on the eve of the
second anniversary of the East African Cooperation (EAC), which
falls on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> South Korea to Import Raw Materials with Rescue Loan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 14 (Xinhua) -- South Korea will appropriate three
billion U.S. dollars from the World Bank's rescue loan to help
import much-needed raw materials amid fears of troubles of its
export industries suffering from the deepening financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce, Industry and Energy Ministry said Saturday that
it will use the money to open letters of credit for raw material
importers after consultation with the International Monetary Fund
(IMF).
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Korea and the Korea Development Bank will be in
charge of issuing letters of credit to importers.
</P>
<P>
As South Korean banks are unable to issue letters of credit due
to lack of foreign currency and the nation's lowered credit
ratings caused by the financial crisis, the country's businesses
have to pay cash to buy raw materials.
</P>
<P>
The government has already allocated about two billion
U.S. dollars to assist small businesses in importing raw materials
and offered guarantee for low-interest borrowings from the Korea
Export and Import Bank.
</P>
<P>
Currently, it is considering to scrap or lower tariffs on
imported products, said the ministry.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Sets Free 23 Suspects in Religious Riot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has set free 23
persons who were accused of taking part in a religious riot which
caused extensive damages in Dar es Salaam in mid-February.
</P>
<P>
The Kisutu Resident Magistrate's Court decided on Friday to
acquit the suspects at prosecution request that the accused were
not involved in the riot, local newspapers reported.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution, led by Senior Superintendent of Police
Reinhard Lisapita, asked the court to release the 23 accused from
police custody in accordance with Section 98 of the 1985 law on
criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
This is the second group that has been acquitted in connection
with the riot. The first group of six people were set free on
February 27 on the same grounds.
</P>
<P>
However, the other 80 suspects returned to the Keko Remand
Prison after the police told the court that investigations have
not ended.
</P>
<P>
Violent clashes broke out during February 12-13 as the police
tried to seize several fanatics of an Islamic sect, Khidmat
Daawat Islamia, who preached against other religions with
blasphemous words.
</P>
<P>
The police opened fire, killing two people, and arrested
hundreds of mobsters who were damaging motor vehicles, physically
harming people and attacking police posts.
</P>
<P>
The Committee for Muslims Rights said last Thursday that it
will use public influence to ensure the prosecution of policemen
who killed the two persons during the riot.

<HEADLINE> AIADMK to Give Support Letters to BJP Saturday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Supremo Jayalalitha of the
All-India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) announced
Saturday that the AIADMK and its allies would send letters of
support to a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government Saturday.
</P>
<P>
She said all the 27 MPs of AIADMK and its allies in the Lower
House of Parliament would only give outside support.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference in Chennai, capital of Tamil Nadu
in southern India, Jayalalitha said she did not want to be seen
"stalling" the formation of the government any more. She, however,
attacked the BJP leadership for its "condescending, patronizing
and contemptuous" attitude toward AIADMK and its allies in Tamil
Nadu.
</P>
<P>
The BJP has already got letters of support from other allies.
Yet with only 240 out of the 539 elected MPs in the 12th Lower
House of Parliament, the BJP prime ministerial candidate, A. B.
Vajpayee, did not have enough support to form the next government.
Support from the AIADMK and its allies has thus increased the
BJP's prospect of forming the next government.
</P>
<P>
Jayalalitha said that although she was unhappy with the BJP
leadership, she was still hoping that the BJP would agree to meet
the demands she had raised in the interests of the state.
According to reports, her demands include the designation of Tamil
as an official language and the passing of a women's reservation
bill.

DAR ES SALAAM, March 14 (Xinhua) - The Organization of African

Tanzanian Minister for Foreign Affairs and International

Initiative should look African instead of being foreign oriented
and should be under the auspices of the United Nations Security
Council and the OAU," he said.
</P>

Kikwete said that the council also revised a report by the

<HEADLINE> World Bank to Loan Kenya 105 Million US Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank will release 6.3
billion Shillings in emergency funds to Kenya, according to the
East African Standard reports on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
World Bank Vice President for Africa Callisto Madavo said on
Friday that the loan agreement, yet to be finalized, is expected
to help Kenya to speed up its infrastructure development.
</P>
<P>
Kenya is facing immediate serious economic challenges. This
loan, some 105 million U.S. dollars, will be used to patch up
roads, water supplies and sanitation systems now collapsing after
years of sub-standard construction, disrepair and recent months
of heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Madavo said the 205-million-Dollar Enhanced
Structural Adjustment Facility under the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) will remain frozen until the Kenyan government tackles
issues of corruption and economic governance.
</P>
<P>
However, the World Bank and IMF will work with the Kenyan
government which has agreed to place fresh economic programs to
establish a sound medium-term budgetary framework, he said.
</P>
<P>
Madavo stressed that through this, the issue of economic
governance would be tackled, and "on this basis, the World Bank
is prepared to provide substantial support and assistance to
Kenya to accelerate its economic growth and reduce its poverty."
</P>
<P>
Kenya watchers see the emergency bail-out as a bid to prevent
total collapse of the economy and to encourage the fight against
official corruption in the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Undersecretary
Patrizia Toia announced here Friday that Italy would host the
conference on the creation of a permanent War Crimes Court.
</P>
<P>
Toia made this announcement after signing a document with
U.N. Permanent Representative in Italy Steffan De Mistura.
</P>
<P>
The document, she said, spelled out rights and duties of
nations to attend the conference scheduled between June 15 and
July 17.
</P>
<P>
The conference was expected to address such issues as the
status of the tribunal, the definition of crimes to fall under the
court's jurisdiction and the court's power to act with no approval
of states involved, she said.
</P>
<P>
The court, Toia added, would model itself on the way the
U.N. court in the Hague works in dealing with such crimes as those
against humanity perpetrated in former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
She disclosed that the choice of Italy as the conference host
was contained in a United Nations General Assembly resolution
adopted in December last year.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- American Jan-Michael Gambill,
ranked 126th in the world and a wild-card entry, has ended
compatriot Andre Agassi's 13-match winning streak with a 7-6
(8-6), 3-6, 6-3 victory at the Newsweek Champions Cup tennis
tournament in Indian Wells on Friday.
</P>
<P>
It was the third quarter-final meeting between the two
Americans in a month. Agassi had beaten Gambill in the San Jose
and Scottsdale, Ariz. tournaments.
</P>
<P>
Gambill, 20, who first played on the men's tour in 1996, rode
18 aces to the victory over Agassi, who had just seven.
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old Agassi, coming back from a two-year slump, had
won two titles this year before Gambill ended his string of match
victories.
</P>

Other quarter-finals winners included Britain's Greg Rusedski,
who defeated Sweden's Thomas Enqvist 2-6, 7-6 (9-7), 6-4; Marcelo

<HEADLINE> Crackdown on Counterfeit Products Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- A deputy to the Ninth National
People's Congress (NPC), in session here since early March, called
for cracking down more seriously on the manufacture and sales of
counterfeit and shoddy goods to protect the rights and interests
of consumers.
</P>
<P>
"The production and sales of counterfeit and shoddy products
have become a social evil," said Ding Jiemin, an NPC deputy from
east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, 39 cases of profiteers selling toxic liquid passed
off as spirit fit for drinking have been uncovered and they have
resulted in the death of 202 drinkers; and there have also been
numerous cases involving death-causing electrical appliances and
motorbikes of inferior quality, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Existing laws on product quality impose too lenient a
punishment on producers and sellers of counterfeit and inferior
good," he said.
</P>
<P>
For instance, punishment for forging and using counterfeit
labels of quality is just an open correction, confiscation of
illegal earnings and fines, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is difficult to define accurately what "unlawful earnings"
are. Previous practices have shown that only a small amount of
ill-gotten takings is ever confiscated, he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is the root cause for continued production and selling of
counterfeit and inferior products even though they are repeatedly
prohibited by the government," he said.
</P>
<P>
It is a matter of great significance to strengthen technical
supervision and management on product quality and safeguard market
order, Ding said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the state to amend relevant laws.
</P>
<P>
His views were shared by many other NPC deputies and have been
included in a bill submitted to the current session.

<HEADLINE> Mandela to Visit Angola in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- South African President Nelson
Mandela will visit Angola on April 14, aiming to push the Angolan
peace process forward for final peace in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
This was announced Friday by South African Foreign Minister
Alfred Nzo at a joint news conference with Angolan Foreign
Minister Venancio de Moura in Luanda.
</P>
<P>
Nzo, who ended a brief visit to Angola Friday, said this is
the first time for Mandela to visit Angola since he took the post
of president.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, Nzo said that there are still some South
Africans who are trying to disrupt the Angolan peace process and
destabilize the political situation in the country, referring to
some South African planes violating Angola's air space to deliver
assistance to the opposition National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
He said the South African government is firmly against such
illegal actions which break the UN sanctions against the UNITA,
but it is difficult to control the situation as there are more
than 200 airports and airstrips in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
However, the South African government has taken measures to
curb the situation, including approving a legislation banning
such "mercenary" activities to enable the peace process to
proceed more quickly.
</P>
<P>
The move was welcomed by the Angolan foreign minister.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto left here Saturday afternoon for Jakarta on a two-day
visit to discuss with Indonesia's leaders on its ongoing economic
and financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto is "to talk directly with (Indonesian) President
Suharto" about Indonesia's economic difficulties, a Japanese
Foreign Ministry spokesman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Suharto scheduled for Sunday morning,
Hashimoto will urge Indonesia to fully implement the reform
measures it has agreed with the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
in exchange for a 43-billion-dollar IMF-led international rescue
package.
</P>
<P>
Suharto, who was reelected president unopposed for a seventh
five-year term Tuesday, has described the IMF package as too
liberal for Indonesia's tastes and said it runs counter to its
1945 Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Japan, which is the largest bilateral contributor to the
IMF-led rescue package, has joined the IMF in advising Indonesia
not to immediately proceed with its idea to peg the collapsing
rupiah to U.S. dollar through a currency board system, which was
not envisaged when the IMF package was formed.
</P>
<P>
"Hashimoto will tell Suharto that Japan hopes the new
(Indonesian) administration will promote reform, recover
international confidence and overcome the current crisis." a
Foreign Ministry official said.

<P>
HONG KONG, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, arrived back by
air on Saturday from visits to Germany and France.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at the Kai Tak International Airport,
Tung described the visits as "very successful."
</P>
<P>
"It was rather a rushed trip but i thought a very useful trip,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that during his stay in Germany and France from March
9 to 13, he met with leaders of the two governments and leading
personalities in the industrial, commercial and financial sectors
of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"I had the opportunity to explain to Chancellor (Helmut) Kohl,
as well as President (Jacques) Chirac and Prime Minister (Lionel)
Jospin how well Hong Kong has been going since the return of Hong
Kong, and these leaders all congratulated us on the smooth return
of Hong Kong," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We also had the opportunity to discuss the Asian currency
turmoil and I stated our determination to maintain the currency
linkage," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tung said both countries underlined the importance of the
stability of the Hong Kong Dollar as well as the Renminbi because
in a very unstable environment in Asia the two currencies are a
symbol of stability.
</P>
<P>
Tung particularly mentioned the importance of maintaining the
currency stability, adding that it is not just because of
international considerations but basically it is in the interests
of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He said he also emphasized his confidence in the continued
vitality of Hong Kong's economy in the longer term and pledged to
enhance Hong Kong's "very important" commercial relationship with
both Germany and France.
</P>
<P>
"We also raised the issue of the visa-free access to all the
European nations and this is a subject which both governments have
undertaken to pursue further," he said.

market prospects very promising. The company plans to open
boutiques in more remote cities, he said.

had nothing to bargain with in talks with U.S. government and
business leaders.
</P>
<P>
One of Chuan's missions is to persuade the U.S. public and
business sectors to roll over loans to Thai public and corporate
borrowers so as to allow them to continue their businesses.
</P>
<P>
"I would not say what we expect to get, but I will simply
explain the facts to them in the hope that they will better
understand Thailand," Chuan noted.
</P>
<P>
His remarks reflect the fact that Thailand and the United
States, two traditional allies, have trouble in "understanding
each other."
</P>
<P>
Thai-U.S. relations have been strained somewhat by Washington's
slow response to Thailand's economic crisis. There has been
opposition from the U.S. Congress to offering financial aid to
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
That is one reason that Chuan was trying to keep a low profile
in terms of his visit to the United States, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The United States, on its part, did not want to let down
Thailand, its "good friend." In his meeting with Chuan on Friday,
U.S. President Bill Clinton said, "We want to do whatever we can
to be a good friend and a good partner because we have confidence
in the prime minister's leadership."
</P>
<P>
But Clinton did not elaborate on possible measures, saying only
that he would announce later "one or two things" to provide
Thailand with support.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Michael McCurry said the two leaders
would discuss possible credits from the U.S. Export-Import Bank
and hinted at another big boost for Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
"They will talk about Ex-Im Bank and there's actually another
issue that's pending between the United States and Thailand that
will provide some substantial financial relief for Thailand,"
McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps, one of the concrete results of the visit is the U.S.
agreement to allow Thailand to cancel its 392-million-dollar
purchase of eight F/A-18 fighter jets. Thailand, which has already
paid 72 million U.S. dollars for the purchase, faces another
100-million-dollar payment by the end of this month to the planes'
manufacturer, Boeing Co., but Thailand asked to cancel the order
for lack of money.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said the decision to allow Thailand to break the
contract showed the Clinton administration' desire to maintain
good ties with the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Agreement is also expected to be reached to allow Thai students
in the United States to work off campus legally along with the
allocation of more scholarships.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Unocal Corp. and American International Group
announced a 2-million-dollar fund to help Southeast Asian
students. They are also contributing a fund to help technical
training in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The United States, while promising substantial aid, did not
hesitate to heap praise on Chuan's government. Clinton lauded
Chuan for his handling of Thailand's economic crisis, saying, "We
obviously have been very concerned about the challenges facing the
Thai economy but very, very impressed with the leadership o this
prime minister."
</P>
<P>
U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, in his meeting with
Chuan, said Thailand has done "an extraordinary job" in addressing
its economic problems. "We in turn will engage with Thailand
throughout this process," he added, citing U.S. support for an
IMF-arranged bailout package.
</P>
<P>
Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, in a breakfast
meeting with the Thai delegation in New York, acknowledged that
the U.S. response to Thailand's economic hardships is "slow" but
said he has been "impressed" by the "tremendous effort" that has
been made by Thailand toward reforms.

<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria and Kazakhstan on Friday
signed a package of treaties on cooperation in oil and gas supply,
and in construction industry.
</P>
<P>
The treaties were signed by Bulgarian Transport Minister
Wilhelm Kraus and Kazak Labour and Social Security Minister
Natalija Korzhova at the end of the first session of the
Bulgaria-Kazakhstan inter-governmental commission for trade,
economic, scientific and technological cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Korzhova arrived here Thursday at the head of a Kazak
government delegation for a two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
The session also examined possibilities of long-term bilateral
cooperation in the supply of Kazak gas and oil to Bulgaria, and
through Bulgaria, to eastern and central-western European
countries.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, trade between Bulgaria and Kazakhstan has been
declining continuously. The figure for last year stood at only 12
million U.S dollars, four million dollars down from 1996.
</P>
<P>
To correct the situation, Bulgarian President Petar Stoianov
and his Kazak counterpart Nursultan Nazarbayev decided on the
establishment of the commission last month while attending the
World Economic Forum in Davos, Sweden.

<P>
SHENYANG, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Shenyang, the capital of
northeast China's Liaoning Province, now ranks fifth in the
country in economic strength after years of development.
</P>
<P>
The leading four are Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou of Guangdong
Province, and Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
The ranking is the result of a study of 219 Chinese cities at
and above the prefectural level that evaluated 51 basic indexes of
their population, labor, economic and social conditions,
environment, and infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Dalian, a coastal city, and the important industrial bases of
Anshan and Fushun, which are all in Liaoning, were listed among
the top 55 cities in the country in terms of comprehensive
economic strength.
</P>
<P>
The cities of east China have certain advantages for economic
development, while those in the western and central parts of China
have plentiful labor resources, and some rising cities like
Shenzhen and Zhuhai in south China are doing well in environment
protection and infrastructure.

<P>
SHANGHAI, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, the largest commercial
center in China, has issued a circular on the trading of bank
notes withdrawn from circulation, and gold and silver coins.
</P>
<P>
Ordinary memorial coins are allowed to be traded at face-value
within one year after their issuance, while gold and silver coins
could be traded according to market prices immediately after they
are issued.
</P>
<P>
Some circulated bank notes are allowed to be traded at market
prices only for the purpose of cultural exchanges and under some
special cases.
</P>
<P>
All the dealers have to do is to acquire the necessary licenses
from the Shanghai Branch of the Peoples Bank of China before they
enter into business, the circular says.
</P>
<P>
So far, some local traders have applied for the approval from
the Shanghai branch of the central bank to go into business.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Against Internationalization of Kosovo Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic said Friday his country is firmly against any attempt to
internationalize the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
The Kosovo issue is an internal affair resolvable only through
political means within Serbia, Milosevic was quoted as saying by a
report of the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Albanians in Kosovo had no justification to turn down
the open dialogue proposed by the Serbian government, he told Leni
Fiser, parliamentary president of the Council of Europe.
</P>
<P>
Fiser said her talks with Milosevic were substantial.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo should accept, out of
their own interests, the Serb government's invitation for
political dialogues, Fiser reportedly said.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Serbia said it would send a delegation headed by
Deputy Prime Minister Ratko Markovic to Kosovo for talks with
representatives of ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
The delegation arrived in the Kosovo provincial capital of
Pristina Thursday, and waited at the city hall there for
representatives of ethnic Albanians to appear.
</P>
<P>
But the Albanian representatives boycotted the talks.
</P>
<P>
Markovic said the Serbian delegation would stay in Pristina and
stand by for talks with ethnic Albanians, who account for over 90
percent of the population in the Yugoslav province.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Uncertainty May Continue About Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The exploratory efforts by
President K. R. Narayanan for the government formation may take
longer than was earlier expected as the Bharatiya Janata Party
(BJP), the largest party emerged in the just concluded general
elections, is yet to muster enough support to form the government.
</P>
<P>
BJP prime ministerial candidate A. B. Vajpayee in his meeting
with the president on Tuesday staked claim to form the next
government and pledged to the president that he would be able to
form a stable government.
</P>
<P>
Two days later, however, he furnished to the president a letter
of support of only 240 members out of 539 already elected MPs in
the Lower House of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The president did not invite him to form the next government
and decided to discuss the government formation with other
political formations including the Congress and the United Front,
which emerged the second and third largest political forces in the
elections respectively.
</P>
<P>
President Narayanan on Friday evening held separate meetings
with a group of Congress leaders headed by its President Sitaram
Kesri, United Front Chairman Deve Gowda and Left senior party
leaders H. Singh Surjeet and A. B. Bardhan. All of them did not
stake any claim to form a government, but they sought three to
four days for consultations on the issue among them.
</P>
<P>
The president is scheduled to continue his meetings Saturday
with other political party leaders including former prime minister
Chandra Shekhar.
</P>
<P>
As was evident from the trend of Friday's discussion, the
president was keen on the stability of a new government at the
Center and, to that end, wanted credible evidence of support to
whoever would stake the claim to power.
</P>
<P>
This was the rationale of involving in discussions an unusually
large number of leaders representing practically all parts of the
political spectrum. His discussions with the BJP also continued.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the president would face a tough job was forecast
even before the poll, and that perception was confirmed when the
election results were out.
</P>
<P>
No political party secured a single majority in the elections.
The BJP and its allies won 252 out of 539 already elected seats in
the Lower House of Parliament while the Congress and its allies as
well as the United Front got 167 and 96 seats respectively. No
one, however, anticipated the ticklish situation of the type that
has arisen now.
</P>
<P>
In the past, there used to be a tussle among the rival
claimants to power. Now, all of them are cautious in staking their
claim. Even at the initial stage, when the BJP exuded confidence,
Vajpayee refrained from putting forward any claim when he first
called on the president last week.
</P>
<P>
The stalemate could possibly be resolved in two ways -- either
the problem between the BJP and Tamil Nadu allies is sorted out
and Vajpayee's case is strengthened or the Congress and the United
Front are able to cobble together a viable combination. What
happens in the non-BJP camp may be known only next week. The
situation may well become a nightmare for constitutional experts
if none of these formations is able to provide a way out.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Retain Jurisdiction Over Cable Car Crew </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The United States has refused to
give up its jurisdiction over the U.S. marines involved in a cable
car tragedy, the Italian prime minister's office said Friday.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. military jet, an EA-6B Prowler with a four-man crew,
severed a ski lift cable in northern Italy on February 3, sending
20 people inside the cable car to their deaths.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the U.S. Marine Corps acknowledged that the pilot
of the jet flew lower and faster than authorized.
</P>
<P>
Italy requested to prosecute the crew under its laws.
</P>
<P>
But U.S. Army General Wesley Clark, commander of the
U.S. forces in Europe, decided Friday evening that the United
States could retain jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
In a communique, the prime minister's office said the
U.S. Embassy in Italy notified the Italian government Friday
evening about Clark's decision.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement governing the legal status of NATO forces in
Italy, the United States has "primary jurisdiction" over its
troops in cases involving performance of official duty.
</P>
<P>
Italian Defence Undersecretary Massimo Brutti said Thursday
"the constant practice" within NATO was to allow trials in the
country of origin.
</P>
<P>
The United States said Friday the crew would face charges of
manslaughter or homicide by military courts.

<HEADLINE> Thai Export Sector Receives Support from Foreign Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's export sector
successfully secured loans from 10 international banking
institutions during a meeting aimed at setting up a one billion
U.S. dollar fund to support the sector, the nation newspaper said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from 70 international banks attended the
meeting on Friday, which was jointly organized by the Finance
Ministry, the Bank of Thailand, the Asian Development Bank (ADB)
and the Export-Import Bank of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Some 10 leading institutions, such as Abn-Amro Bank, Nova
Scotia Asia Ltd, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi and Banque Nationale de
Paris, "have fully underwritten 950 million dollars which they now
want to sell down," an ADB official said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ADB is contributing 50 million dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
The repayment term is five years with a grace period of 18
months at an interest rate of 0.8 percent above the libor (London
inter-bank offered rate).
</P>
<P>
Bruno Schricke, country manager Thailand of Abn-Amro Bank, said
the loan facility is very attractive as it is supported by ADB and
endorsed by the government and the banks are not concerned about
the possibility of default.
</P>
<P>
According to Sommai Phasee, director general of the Fiscal
Policy Office, the loan is the largest international borrowing
since the beginning of the financial turmoil last July.

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Colombia's industry
grew 5.8 percent in January over the same month last year, the
National Association of Colombian Industrialists said Friday.
</P>
<P>
President Luis Carlos Villegas Echeverry of the association,

unfavorable, while 34.5 percent were confident about future.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The United States and Canada
discussed Friday reinforcing the 700-man United Nations
peacekeeping force in Macedonia to prepare for possible spreading
of the crisis in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen and his Canadian
counterpart Art Eggleton met at the Pentagon to discuss possible
Canadian participation in the contingent in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
"I indicated in the discussion that if it is necessary to have
further peacekeeping operations in the vicinity -- we're not
talking about Kosovo itself but nearby in surrounding areas --
then we are certainly willing to look at that," Eggleton told
reporters after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
In Kosovo, dozens of people were killed in the conflicts
between the Albanian separatists and the Serbs in the past two
weeks. Tensions are still high after the Albanians refused to talk
with the Serb authorities on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The United States and its allies fear that the outbreak of war
in Kosovo could quickly spread through the Balkans, drawing in
Albania, Macedonia, Bulgaria, and possibly Greece and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The lightly armed U.N. force, consisting of 400 soldiers from
Scandinavian nations and 300 Americans, is intended to prevent any
fighting from spilling over into Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
"I think we're concerned about the explosive possibilities in
the area and wanting to ensure that it doesn't spread," Eggleton
said.
</P>
<P>
"We're all watching the situation very carefully," he said,
adding that his country is "quite prepared to look at an increase
in its contribution" if it requires further peacekeeping
operations in the area.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Thailand, hungry for foreign
money to balance its current account deficit, is trying to draw
from a well of wealth -- the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Thai officials are pushing to sell more Thai products to the
U.N. operations and are discussing ways to waive a dividend tax to
attract U.N.'s gigantic 19-billion-dollar pension fund to invest
in Bangkok's equity and debt markets, the Bangkok Post reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to have more Thai companies sell humanitarian products
to the U.N., the Thai Foreign Ministry earlier this year invited
several U.N. officials to Thailand to explain the U.N. procurement
system to Thai traders.
</P>
<P>
The visit prompted a few Thai medicine companies and
conglomerates like Charoen Pokphand Group to bid for the potential
sales.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Thai ambassador to the U.N. Asda Jayanama as
saying that Thailand had ignored this potential business
opportunity for so long and he planned to bring the U.N. "down to
earth" closer to the attention and interests of more Thais.
</P>
<P>
Asda said Thai and U.N. officials currently were working
together to bring more U.N. money into Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Li Ruihuan Calls for Better CPPCC Functions in Unity, Democracy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the Ninth
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), today said the CPPCC will continue promoting
unity and improving democracy under the new situation.
</P>
<P>
"Our job is to give full scope to the initiative and
creativeness inherent within the masses of people, pool the
strength from all factors and work together for the great
rejuvenation of the Chinese nation," Li said at the closing
meeting of the First Session of the Ninth CPPCC National
Committee.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC is the most extensive patriotic united front
organization in the country. The Chinese Communists represented by
Mao Zedong created the united front in the process of protracted
struggle and played an extremely important role in the new
democratic revolution, Li said.
</P>
<P>
"The united front, armed struggle and Party building
constituted the 'three magic weapons' of the Chinese revolution,"
he recalled.
</P>
<P>
In building new China, he noted, the Communist Party of China (CPC)
continued to adhere to the untied front organization and created
the CPPCC through working in cooperation with all non-Communist
parties, mass organizations and personages without party
affiliation.
</P>
<P>
After the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee of the
CPC held in December 1978, Deng Xiaoping put forward a series of
new expositions on the nature, principle and tasks of the united
front and the CPPCC in light of new historical conditions. And he
advanced the theory concerning the united front and the CPPCC to a
new stage.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping emphasized that the united front remains an
important magic weapon, that it should be strengthened instead of
being weakened, and should be broadened instead of being narrowed.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan also quoted Deng as saying that united front in
China has been turned into the broadest alliance that embraces all
socialist laborers and patriots who support socialism and the
reunification of the motherland, and that the CPPCC is an
important organization to carry forward the people's democracy and
maintains contacts with people from all walks of life.
</P>
<P>
"The task of the CPPCC is very glorious, and and there is
plenty of scope for the talents of its members," Li Ruihuan said.
</P>
<P>
Under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping Theory, multi-party
cooperation and political consultation led by the Communist Party
have been defined as the country's basic political system, and the
CPPCC is an important institution to realize this system, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC upholds the basic theory of the Marxist united front
and peole's democracy, embodies the Chinese nation's tradition of
working together with one accord and absorbing all good things. It
was a brilliant concept of the older generation of leaders, he
said.

"History over the past half century qives an eloquent proof
that the CPPCC conforms to China's specific conditions, has a
distinctive Chinese characteristics and plays an indispensable
role in the Chinese political system," Li Ruihuan said.
</P>
<P>
As an important means of improving socialist democracy, the
CPPCC should actively report on social conditions and popular
feelings of the people, arouse people from all walks of life to
participate in state affairs and strive to promote democracy, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Li went on to note that political consultation, democratic
supervision and the participation in and deliberation of state
affairs are the major functions of the CPPCC.
</P>
<P>
Political consultation means to confer on major national and
local policy decisions and major issues concerning political,
economic, cultural and social affairs before policy decisions are
made or in the course of their implementation.
</P>
<P>
Democratic supervision means to monitor or supervise the
implementation of the Constitution, other laws, regulations and
major policies, as well as the work of government departments and
their personnel.
</P>
<P>
Participation in and deliberation of state affairs means to
engage in various economic, political, cultural and social affairs
and international exchanges, and to discuss very important matters
and cardinal issues which are of public concern, to conduct
investigations and research and put forward opinions and
proposals.
</P>
<P>
"The duty of the CPPCC is to concentrate on its main functions.
We should conscientiously carry out the guiding principles of the
CPC Central Committee and make reremitting efforts to promote
standardization and institutionalization of CPPCC functions," Li
Ruihuan said.
</P>
<P>
The new situation and tasks set new requirements for the Ninth
National Committee of the CPPCC, he said.
</P>
<P>
"With regard to our thinking concerning CPPCC Work, we must
blaze new trails while forging ahead, and forge ahead while
blazing new trails. We should first do the things which we are
supposed to do and which we can handle. We should gradually
promote our work first by doing easy things and then difficult
ones afterwards, and we should create a lively working atmosphere
as quickly as possible," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In this process, we should emancipate our minds, make bold
explorations and daring innovations and achieve successes. With
regard to the orientation for our work, we should always uphold
the leadership of the Party, serve the overall interests of the
country, maintain the characteristics of the CPPCC and form close
ties with the masses," he said.
</P>
<P>
With regard to work style, Li Ruihuan said that the CPPCC
members underline practical conditions, practice and experience.

<HEADLINE> Italian Cabinet Sacks Undersecretary of Interior Ministry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The Italian cabinet has decided to
sack undersecretary of the Interior Ministry Angelo Giorgianni for
his alleged links with the Mafia.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting Friday morning, cabinet ministers agreed to
formally revoke Giorgianni's mandate from the government, a
procedure expected to take a day or two.
</P>
<P>
The unusual move followed Giorgianni's refusal to resign
despite of an urge by the prime minister, the interior minister
and his party chief Lamberto Dini asking him to step down.
</P>
<P>
"In Italy, if somebody resigns, it is seen as an admission of
guilt," the undersecretary said.
</P>
<P>
Giorgianni was accused by the parliament's Anti-Mafia
Commission of associating with Mafia members when he was serving
as a public prosecutor in the Sicilian port of Messina.
</P>
<P>
He also allegedly obstructed probes into his Mafia links.
</P>
<P>
In response, Giorgianni vowed to defend himself, saying he was
simply a victim of slander and personal vendettas.
</P>
<P>
While there were no formal charges against him and no judicial
investigations, he was accused of meeting Domenico Mollica, a
big-time builder in Messina closely associated with the Mafia.
</P>
<P>
Giorgianni is said to have joined Mollica and an unnamed
minister on a boat trip around the Acolian islands off Sicily,
which he firmly denied. But he admitted having met Mollica on
other occasions.

<HEADLINE> Democracy and Rule of Law Key to Curbing Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Members of China's top lawmaking
and advisory bodies, in session here since early March, agreed
that improving democracy and the legal system is an effective way
to curb the spread of corruption.
</P>
<P>
"The principle of administering the country according to law
can provide a fundamental solution to the problems of embezzlement
and bribe-taking," said Wang Huaiyuan, a deputy to the Ninth
National People's Congress (NPC), top Chinese legislature, from
northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Lin Xicai from east China's Zhejiang Province noted that
the success of anti-corruption efforts should rely on democracy
and legal means as well as on a people with a strong sense of
justice.
</P>
<P>
Chen Hui, a member of the Ninth National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC),
China's top advisory body, said that although both the people's
congresses and CPPCC organizations have had the function of
democratic supervision, it's still necessary to allow ordinary
people to play a more significant role in this regard.
</P>
<P>
"A comprehensive supervisory system should also include
internal supervision within the Party, supervision by the general
public and by the news media," said Luo Yifeng, an NPC deputy from
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The Zhejiang delegation to the ongoing NPC session has put
forth two motions urging early enactment of a law on supervision.
Similar motions have been raised by lawmakers from Beijing and
south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers and advisors representing farmers have highly praised
a system of direct election of and democratic supervision over
village leadership by the villagers, which has been introduced to
most parts of rural China in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
"Democracy can help raise transparency in the running of
village affairs and prevent corruption," said Deputy Liu Jianzhi,
a farmer from east China's Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
According to Deputy Li Qinglin, who is Party secretary of
Harbin City in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, the
forthcoming institutional restructuring, which aims at separating
the functions of government and the enterprise, will greatly help
remove breeding ground for corruption.

<HEADLINE> New CPPCC Chairman Confident of China's Future (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- "The Chinese people have enormous
initiative and creativity, and as long as we do not waiver, or
slacken our efforts, or create troubles for ourselves, and as long
as we work hard whole-heartedly for another 20 years and for
several 20 years after that, China is bound to rise as a strong,
modernized socialist country in the East."
</P>
<P>
The remark was made today by Li Ruihuan, chairman of the Ninth
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), at the closing meeting of the committee's
first session.
</P>
<P>
Li said the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is destined to
be associated with the progress of the entire humanity. The world
today is undergoing profound changes. Peace and development remain
the main themes of the times and the world is developing further
toward multi-polarity, he said.
</P>
<P>
Employing dialogue rather than confrontation and settling
disputes through consultations have become a common wish of the
international community, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted many countries are devoting themselves to developing
their economies, improving their people's standard of living and
boosting their national strength, and they are also devoting
themselves to reform, adjustment and improvement of their economic
systems.
</P>
<P>
Giving economic development top priority has become a guiding
principle for most countries in their contacts with others. The
trend toward economic globalization is becoming increasingly
evident with economies becoming more interdependent and
interactive, and cooperation and competition between countries are
becoming more extensive and more profound than ever before thanks
to a new scientific and technological revolution that is sweeping
the globe and high and new technologies that are being translated
into productive forces on an unprecedented scale and more quickly
than ever before.
</P>
<P>
This new era of knowledge and economics is profoundly affecting
all aspects of human society. Population, resources, the
environment and other global issues have become more critical; the
challenge of achieving a harmonious coexistence between man and
nature and a coordinated economic and social development has
attracted wide attention; and sustainable development is now a
major concern for all countries in their modernization programs.

<P>
While maintaining their own cultural features, many nations are
absorbing and learning from the outstanding cultural achievements
of others. The boundless creativity brought about by human
civilization and progress is now propelling the world toward the
future.
</P>
<P>
In taking the whole world into consideration, China can see
that it's now presented with rare opportunities as well as serious
challenges, he said, adding that China must be soberly aware of
the following:
</P>
<P>
-- The world today is far from tranquil; hegemony and power
politics still exist; and it requires the hard work of many
quarters to safeguard peace and security.
</P>
<P>
-- China is still at the primary stage of socialism, which is
characterized by a poor foundation to start with and an economic
system needing to be further rationalized.
</P>
<P>
-- In the course of economic globalization, China must face the
economic superiority of developed countries and competition on an
unequal footing. China is also unavoidably subject to all kinds of
pressures including international economic risks.
</P>
<P>
--China's overall level of science and technology remains
relatively low, the gap between China and Western countries in
scientific and technological development could widen, and China is
in danger of being controlled by others as relates to high
technology.
</P>
<P>
-- China is burdened with a large population, deficient
resources and a deteriorating environment and it is shouldering an
arduous task in trying to meet the people's increasingly material
and cultural needs.
</P>
<P>
In the course of progress, many difficult problems are yet to
be studied and solved. China must recognize its position in
today's world, enhance its confidence, remain vigilant in peace
time and manage its affairs in a down-to-earth manner, he said.

<HEADLINE> New Projects to Boost Romanian Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian Government pledged
to lay the basis for a wholesome rise in the country's 1998
economy by selling out all the industries slated for privatization
and stop dwindling of the Gross Domestic Product, sources in the
Romanian government announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Rompres, Sorin Dimitriu, head of Romania's
main privatization body -- the State Ownership Fund, said that
1,600 sell-offs, worth lei 10,000 billion (1.2 billion US
dollars), would be signed under contract this year. He also said
that two banks-- Bankpost and the Romanian Bank would shift to
private hands too.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, 46 companies were sold out, bringing in revenues worth
465 million dollars. In that year, the privatization process in
textile and ready-made industry was fully accomplished. Plastics
industry's privatization was completed up to 90 percent and the
cement industry, 80 percent. Privatization in dyestuff, detergents
and fertilizers' industries reportedly amounted to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
Sources in the Government said the 1998 reform programme
includes the extension of the Stock Exchange mechanism, opening of
new business centers abroad and passing the Agricultural Bank to
private persons. The Government in 1999 will switch to the
comprehensive tax system and personal income taxes.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Aquatic Processors Acquire U.S. Export Credentials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) has granted 138 Chinese aquatic-processing
companies HACCP credentials allowing them to export products to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
This marks a breakthrough in reducing U.S. restraints on
importing aquatic products from China. Of the 138 aquatic
exporters Shandong Province has 36; Liaoning, 30; Guangdong, 28;
and Zhejiang, 23.
</P>
<P>
The Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) became
effective on imported aquatic products at the end of 1997 and
imposes quality controls on imported products that could pose
physical, chemical or microbial risks.
</P>
<P>
The FDA's control criteria on imported food have been adopted
by the United Nations, the European Union, Canada, Japan and many
other countries.
</P>
<P>

BRASILIA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's coffee export earnings
went up 11 percent in February over the same period last year to
reach 186.9 million U.S. dollars.

</P>
<P>
The BFCE, based in Rio de Janeiro, predicted that Brazil would

The resolution goes on to say that the session holds that Hong
Kong's smooth return to its motherland in 1997 and continued
prosperity and stability indicate a tremendous success for the
principle of "one country, two systems".
</P>
<P>
"All CPPCC members support every effort by the Chinese
government to ensure the smooth transition and handover and
prosperity and stability of Macao, and eagerly expect the return
of Macao in 1999," it says.
</P>
<P>
The session firmly supports the eight-point proposition of
President Jiang Zemin on developing relations across the Taiwan
Straits and promoting China's peaceful reunification, and
resolutely opposes any splittist activities aimed at creating
"Taiwan independence", "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan",
says the resolution.
</P>
<P>
"The session places hopes on the broad masses of Taiwan
compatriots, who have a glorious tradition of patriotism, and
hopes that the Taiwan authorities will respond in earnest to the
CPC's solemn call for conducting political negotiations as early
as possible, to resolve the motherland's reunification issue by
the Chinese on both sides of the Straits through their own
efforts, it says.
</P>
<P>
The session calls on CPPCC organizations at all levels and all
parties, organizations and people of various ethnic groups and
social sectors that have joined in the CPPCC to hold high the
great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory, adhere to the basic line and
program for the primary stage of socialism, and effectively carry
out the CPPCC's functions of political consultations, democratic
supervision and participation in the discussions and running of
state affairs, to serve the magnificent goals set by the 15th CPC
National Congress.
</P>
<P>
"We must unite all forces that can be united with, bring all
positive factors into play, rally closely around the CPC Central
Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core, work with joint
efforts and in a down-to-earth manner and strive for an all-round
advancement of the great cause of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics into the 21st century," it concludes.

<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The First Session of the Ninth

</P>
<P>
The resolution says that the current CPPCC session has heard

reports on China's national economic and social development plan,
national budgets and a plan on institutional restructuring of the
State Council.
</P>
<P>
"The session endorses the government work report and other
reports," says the resolution.
</P>
<P>
It notes that, under the leadership of the Communist Party of
China (CPC), China has scored tremendous achievement over the past
five years in its reform, opening up and modernization drive, with
its social productivity, comprehensive national strength and the
people's living standards all ascending a new stage.
</P>
<P>
"People of all ethnic groups across the country are taking big
strides along the road of socialism with Chinese characteristics,"
it says.

re-employment of laid-off workers, preventing and heading off
financial risks, bettering social morals and public security
situation, curbing the spread of corruption and developing
science, technology, education and culture.
</P>
<P>
The session holds that under current circumstances of deepening
economic restructuring and developing a socialist market economy,
it is highly necessary to carry out government institutional
restructuring in an active but steady and prudent manner, the
resolution says.
</P>
<P>
"Doing a good job in institutional reform constitutes a key
measure in further improving the system of leadership by the CPC
and the state, and also a major component of the restructuring
of the political system," it notes.
</P>
<P>
It says that CPPCC members attending the session have put forth
ideas and suggestions for the blueprint for institutional
restructuring, and have expressed the sincere hope that a highly
efficient, coordinated and standardized administrative management
system with Chinese characteristics that suits the socialist market
economic system would be gradually established through the
institutional reform.

<P>
CHENGDU, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Sichuan
province promised to pour at least 400 million yuan, or 48.2
million U.S. dollars, into pollution-control efforts this year,
local officials said today.
</P>
<P>
The province will complete about 1,200 environmental protection
projects in 1998, making 60-to-70 percent of its industrial
enterprises meet specific discharge standards on waste gas,
wastewater and solid pollutants, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The most important comprehensive industrial center in southwest
China, which stands on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River,
previously was plagued by environmental deterioration. Some cities
even suffered from waves of acid rain.
</P>
<P>
In 1997 local law-enforcement groups cracked down on polluters
such as small paper mills, tanneries, dye factories and 15 other
kinds of polluting businesses. The environmental authorities
closed down 1,634 such businesses last year.
</P>
<P>
The officials said the overall environment in the province has
improved as a result.

<HEADLINE> Survey: Chinese Cling To Traditional Family Values </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese family values remain
largely traditional, stressing filial loyalty to the elderly while
being caring and instructive to the young, a survey finds.
</P>
<P>
The survey -- which questioned 5,138 households in Beijing,
Shanghai, Guangzhou and seven other major cities -- shows that
48.4 percent of the people, the majority of whom were aged 35-44,
prefer to have a family of three: two parents and a child.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 42.6 percent of those questioned see their ideal
families as having their elderly parents live with them.
</P>
<P>
Only 6.1 percent of the people, a dominant group of whom were
aged 18-34, would like to have a family of only a husband and a
wife. They defend their choice with claims which include being too
hard to raise a child, too busy in work and lacking the knowledge
to be responsible parents.
</P>
<P>
Some said they were afraid that having a child would spoil
their life.
</P>
<P>
Some 2.9 percent of those questioned choose to live alone,
according to the survey conducted by Horizon, a leading market
research company.

<HEADLINE> Guangxi CPPCC Members Contribute to Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Regional Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC) has been playing an important role in building
socialist democracy, and in economic development and social
progress.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi is a less-developed area and has the largest population
among China's five ethnic autonomous regions. Social stability,
national unity and economic growth have always been hot issues for
CPPCC members, said Chen Huiguang, chairman of the CPPCC Guangxi
Regional Committee.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, the committee has submitted more than
20 reports and 1,510 proposals to related government departments
on issues concerning construction of southwest outlets to the sea,
agricultural development, reform of state-owned enterprises and
poverty relief, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, the CPPCC Guangxi Committee has also expanded its
channel to participating in governmental affairs, and giving full
play to members in putting forward views on economic and social
progress, offering important economic information, recommending
talents and helping solve technical difficulties.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Cycas Trees Growing Well In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, March 14 (Xinhua) -- China's state nature reserve for
cycas trees, older than dinosaurs, is doing well with the ancient
trees prospering and blooming year by year.
</P>
<P>
The 1,360-hectare reserve, which has 234,776 cycas trees
including 136,087 adult trees, is the world's largest wild cycas
forest.
</P>
<P>
China discovered the existence of the cycas trees in the early
1970s, when there were only 80,000 cycas trees left. The cycas
trees, located in Panzhihua city on the upper reaches of the
Yangtze River, are unique among its more than 170-member
family. For instance, it shoots out flowers every year while cycas
trees in other places bloom after a much longer term.
</P>
<P>
Biologists say that the protection of the reserve is necessary
because cycas trees are helpful for the study of ancient life,
climate and geographical conditions.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Rapid growth in the service
sector in the capital of south China's Guangdong Province has made
it more attractive as a regional economic center.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the city reported more than 80 billion yuan in retail
sales of consumer goods, up 17.6 percent, with state-owned,
collective and private companies competing equally.
</P>
<P>
By last year, the city had 260,000 commercial outlets, divided
into large department stores, chain stores and special
markets. The sector had 207.4 billion yuan in sales.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Develops Powered Bicycles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Battery-powered bicycles,
cheaper than cars and more environmentally friendly than
motorcycles, are emerging as a transportation choice for residents
in east China's Shanghai municipality.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than 4,000 such bicycles of 16 varieties are in
use and another 90,000 are expected to be produced this year.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that this kind of bicycle, with a price of
5,000 yuan plus batteries, has great potential on the market.
</P>
<P>
The industrial sector has listed the production of the powered
bicycle as a backbone industry to help protect the environment.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Powered Bicycle Industrial Center, set up one year
ago, has made a long-term plan to invest 1.39 billion yuan for an
estimated annual output of 2.38 billion yuan in the next several
years.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the healthy development of the industry, the
municipality worked out a local standard last year to regulate
production.
</P>
<P>
The local government also plans to set up more than 100
battery-charging centers to ensure the smooth flow of powered
bicycles on the street. The speed of this kind of bicycle is about
20 kilometers (km) per hour, and each charging guarantees 50-to-60
km of distance.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai now has 600,000 motorcycles in operation. But
considering serious pollution, the local government has promised
to decrease that number to 100,000 in the next three years.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends 57 Points Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Profit-taking ate into the
blue-chip sector on Wall Street Friday, pushing the Dow Jones
industrial average to finish 57.04 points lower to 8,602.52.
</P>
<P>
The barometer of 30 blue-chips saw its index go up 32 points in
the morning session after the Labor Department reported that U.S.
wholesale prices at the manufacturing level fell for the fourth
straight month in February.
</P>
<P>
The report helped fade worries about imminent inflationary
pressure and boost investors' optimism in the economy's
resiliency, traders said.
</P>
<P>
But the Dow ebbed back in the afternoon session amid
profit-taking. The close trimmed the week's gains to 35.38 points.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators ended mixed with the technology heavy
Nasdaq composite index and small companies' stock indexes up.
</P>
<P>
Gains of such technology shares as Oracle, Motorola, Lucent and
Intel led the Nasdaq index to jump 7.60 to 1,771.66.
</P>
<P>
On the rank of declining indexes, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
stock list was down 1.31 to 1,068.61, and the New York Stock
Exchange composite index fell 0.73 to 557.17.
</P>
<P>
On the NYSE, advancing issues led decliners by 1,474 to 1,389,
with 570 unchanged. Total trading volume amounted to 594.58
million shares against 593.51 million shares Thursday.

<HEADLINE> EU Agrees to Impose Further Sanctions on Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 13 (Xinhua) - The European Union (EU) foreign
ministers holding two-day unofficial talks in Edinburgh Friday
agreed to impose further sanctions on Yugoslavia over the Kosovo
crisis.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, who chaired the meeting
starting Friday, told a news conference that the ministers had
agreed the EU would take urgent steps to apply the package of
sanctions agreed upon by a meeting of the six-nation Contact Group
in London Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Next week (EU) officials will be meeting to take forward the
implementation of the specific sanctions which the Contact Group
committed itself to, in particular the visa ban and the refusal of
government credit for investment," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
Further sanctions on Belgrade agreed at Friday's meeting are as
follows:
</P>
<P>
-- to hold a Paris conference of countries in the region to
discuss their concerns about the situation and to prevent the
Kosovo crisis from spreading and Russia and the United States will
be invited;
</P>
<P>
-- to designate a special EU representative to back mediation
between Belgrade and the Kosovans;
</P>
<P>
-- to ban Yugoslavia's national football team from this year's
World Cup finals in France if Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic did not open dialogue with the Kosovans;
</P>
<P>
-- to increase the EU's presence in the region and reinforce
its demand for opening an office in the Kosovan capital
Pristina; and
</P>
<P>
-- to send a letter to Ibrahim Rugova, leader of the main
ethnic Albanian party, to let him know that while the EU supports
increased autonomy for Kosovo, it is implacably opposed to the
idea of the region gaining full independence.
</P>
<P>
Cook stressed that he would "assure him (Rugova) we will
continue our pressure on Belgrade to make a meaningful offer for
dialogue with the leaders of the Kosovan people and that we hope
both Belgrade and Dr Rugova will be willing to enter into dialogue
without preconditions being set by either side."

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Relationship With China Important </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
confirmed here Friday that he had moved up his trip to China to
keep growing the relationship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters in the Oval Office during a picture-taking
session with Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai that "our
relationship with China is so important that we needed to try to
build on it and make some more progress."
</P>
<P>
According to press reports, his trip was originally planned for
November and now moved up to late June and early July on the
recommendations of key advisers. However, no firm date has been
made public so far for the trip, a return to last year's visit to
the United States by Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
"We had such a successful summit here with President Jiang,"
Clinton recalled, adding that "a lot got done; much has happened
since then."
</P>
<P>
The two presidents agreed to establish constructive strategic
partnership between the two countries for the next century at
their Washington summit last October. They met again in Vancouver,
Canada, several weeks later at an APEC gathering.
</P>
<P>
Clinton hailed China's Thursday statement that it intends to
sign the Covenant on Political and Civil Rights, saying he was
"very pleased" by that.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Deputy Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen told
reporters in Beijing that his country was ready to sign the
covenant to show its sincerity in handling the human rights issue.
</P>
<P>
"This is a very significant step forward in our attempts to
work with them to establish rational legal systems and to elevate
the cause of democracy and human rights," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed satisfaction about the cooperation with China in
nonproliferation, saying the Chinese side moved promptly and
firmly when concern is raised.
</P>
<P>
When the U.S. inquired recently about a "possible" low-level
sale of chemicals to Iran, "the Chinese followed through on it and
kept their agreement to the letter," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
The president praised China's action as an example of
cooperation between the two countries on proliferation issues.
</P>
<P>
He formally certified to Congress in January that China had met
nuclear nonproliferation requirements, a prerequisite for the
implementation of an accord on peaceful nuclear cooperation signed
a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
If Congress showed no objection, the accord would come into
effect in days, State Department spokesman James Rubin said at a
daily press briefing Friday.
</P>
<P>
Such big American companies like Westinghouse are eager to have
a part to play in China's nuclear power programs.

<HEADLINE> Greece Urges U.S. to Positively Influence Cyprus Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Greece urged Friday the U.S. and
the European Union (EU) to play a constructive role and positively
influence the development of the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Greek Foreign Undersecretary Yiannos Kranidiotis made the
appeal during his meeting with the visiting U.S. State Department
special envoy for Cyprus, Thomas Miller.
</P>
<P>
Kranidiotis hoped that the starting of Cyprus' accession
negotiations with the EU at the end of this month would help find
a just and viable solution to the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
He added that Athens was willing to cooperate with U.N.
Secretary General Kofi Annan and assist all other efforts to be
undertaken for the resumption of intercommunal talks in the
divided island republic.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Miller said that the Cyprus problem was a very
tough one which would require a lot of work as well as a
give-and-take exchange on the part of all sides.
</P>
<P>
He said that the role of the U.S. in helping resolve the Cyprus
problem would be played backstage.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops occupied
the northern third of the island in a wake of an abortive coup
backed by Athens.
</P>
<P>
On March 31, Cyprus is expected to start the accession talks
with the EU, but the Turkish Cypriots and Turkey have expressed
their opposition to the talks.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Russia to Ratify START II Before Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Friday that his summit with Russian President Boris Yeltsin
could be held up until the Russian parliament ratified the START
II treaty.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, during an Oval Office photo taking session, discussed
what would be necessary for a U.S.-Russia summit.
</P>
<P>
"President Yeltsin and I agreed a long time ago -- probably a
year or so ago -- that I would come to him for the next visit but
that it would occur after the Russian Duma ratified START II,"
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that would allow them to "begin to work on START
III and really take the next big step in lowering the nuclear
weapons arsenals of both countries."
</P>
<P>
He said that "if the Russian Duma should decide" to act on
Start II, "then I would attempt to respond as I promised President
Yeltsin over a year ago I would."
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin confirmed Thursday the
administration had again urged prompt ratification.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry, meanwhile, said Clinton was
not insisting on ratification as a precondition for going to
Russia this year for a summit.
</P>
<P>
But he said nuclear weapons reduction was a "key ingredient" of
Clinton's next meeting with Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
"That certainly includes spelling out in greater detail and
beginning to work on START III," McCurry said. "That can't happen
until START II is ratified by the Duma."
</P>
<P>
Russian Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin talked about
summit preparations with Clinton Wednesday during a visit focused
on enhancing U.S.-Russian economic and scientific cooperation.
</P>
<P>
A senior official explained that Clinton wanted to make work on
START III a centerpiece of his next meeting with Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have been refining guidelines for more than a
year, but detailed negotiations are on hold until the START II
treaty is approved.
</P>
<P>
The Senate ratified the treaty in 1996. START III would set
ceilings of 2,000 to 2,500 long-range nuclear warheads for each
side.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Friday called for more actions to push forward the Northern
Ireland peace process, and raised the possibility of traveling to
Belfast in May.
</P>
<P>
"The next 60 to 90 days are very, very important," Clinton said
in remarks to reporters in the Oval Office. "We have to do
everything we can to get the parties together to move in a timely
fashion."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he intends to meet with Gerry Adams, leader of the
Sinn Fein party that is allied with the Irish Republican Army, and
several others who will be at the White House Tuesday for a St.
Patrick's Day reception.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said Clinton also expects to
meet with John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labor
Party, Sinn Fein's larger and more moderate rival for Catholic
votes.
</P>
<P>
Clinton noted that he might visit Northern Ireland during a
scheduled trip to Birmingham, England, in May.
</P>
<P>
"Whether I would go to Belfast or not... would depend upon what
the posture of things is then with the peace process... and
whether I can make any kind of constructive contribution," added
Clinton.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls for Better Health Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Friday ordered new efforts to improve health care quality,
including giving consumers better information about health plans.
</P>
<P>
"For all its strengths, our health care system still is plagued
by avoidable errors, overused and underused procedures and gaps in
the quality of care," Clinton said at a White House ceremony.
</P>
<P>
He said, for example, that hundreds of thousands of patients
are needlessly injured in hospitals, 18,000 Americans die of heart
attacks that did not have to be fatal and 80,000 women undergo
unnecessary hysterectomies each year.
</P>
<P>
Accepting a report by his commission on quality in the health
care industry, Clinton embraced its recommendations and moved
immediately to implement some.
</P>
<P>
Clinton repeated his call for Congress to pass legislation
guaranteeing rights for patients, particularly those who have been
pushed into managed care plans.
</P>
<P>
"Congress must take the next step and make the patient's bill
of rights the law of the land," he said.
</P>
<P>
While recognizing that millions of Americans get excellent
health care, the commission's report said that too many errors are
made, needed services are not always delivered, unneeded services
are sometimes given for no good reason and the best methods are
not used uniformly.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of Americans are injured each year and
tens of thousands die as a result of avoidable errors in hospital
care, and many people do not get needed preventive care, according
to the report.
</P>
<P>
Others overuse services for no good reason; for instance, about
80,000 women have unnecessary hysterectomies each year, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The commission recommended a federal council to set national
goals for quality and monitor progress in meeting them, and a
private forum that would identify ways to measure quality that
would be adopted by health plans nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The 34-member commission, which has been working for a year,
included representatives of medicine, insurance companies,
consumer groups, employers, unions and academia.
</P>
<P>
The commission's bill of rights includes giving consumers more
information about their health plans, the right to appeal denials
of care to an independent panel and access to specialists and
emergency care.

<HEADLINE> European Shares Mixed, Paris Hits New Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- All the three major European stock
markets opened firmer but ended the week mixed and well off their
day's best levels Friday, with London extending Thursday's losses
to end in the negative ground and Frankfurt and Paris closing
higher.
</P>
<P>
Britain's FTSE 100 index of leading shares closed with a 0.22
percent loss or 12.5 points down at 5,782.3, a drop of 0.6 point
over last Friday, undermined by weakness in the U.S. treasury bond
and profit-taking ahead of the British budget next week.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares had earlier set a record trading
level of 4,909.60 points before closing 20 points off the peak at
4,889.65, but still up 50.05 points or 1.03 percent on the day, a
rise of 173.7 points on the week.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that the market was boosted by strong liquidity as
investors switched out of bonds and they believed that the
5,000-point level is within reach.
</P>
<P>
The Paris CAC-40 index had earlier hit an intraday high of
3,589.23 before closing at 3,540.23, up 13.66 points or 0.39
percent, hitting a new closing high and 57.01 points higher on a
week ago.
</P>
<P>
The market was lifted by Renault's 10 percent surge on better
than expected 1997 results and advances on several Asian markets
overnight.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Praises Thai Leader in Fighting Economic Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton Friday
praised Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai for working hard in
bringing Thailand out of the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The president also said the United States would help the old
Asian ally in its combat with the financial troubles.
</P>
<P>
"We have... been very, very impressed with the leadership of
this prime minister, his willingness to make difficult decisions
to bring his country back to full and robust financial health,"
Clinton said at the start of a meeting with the Thai prime
minister at the White House.
</P>
<P>
"We want to do whatever we can to be a good friend and a good
partner because we have confidence in the prime minister's
leadership and because we value our partnership with Thailand," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Chuan, who arrived in Washington Thursday to reduce strains in
U.S.-Thai relations, which resulted from what was seen in Bangkok
as Washington's slow response to the economic crisis last July,
said he thanked Clinton for his concern for the crisis in his
country and his engagement in the Southeast Asian region.
</P>
<P>
But he emphasized the Thai people themselves will "do whatever
we can to overcome our crisis."
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that we will be able to regain economic
stability and be a force that can contribute to world peace and
progress," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has agreed to help Thailand out of a
contract to buy eight F-A-18 fighter jets as it could no longer
afford to buy because of the financial turmoils last July.
</P>
<P>
The United States will buy the fighter jets for use by its
Marine Corps, thus saving Thailand about 250 million dollars.

JOHANNESBURG, March 13 (Xinhua) -- South Africa will request
that a meeting be held to discuss detained South African
foreign affairs official Robert Mcbride.
</P>
<P>
Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi and Deputy
Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad said Friday that they would ask
their Mozambican counterparts for such a meeting.
</P>
<P>
Mcbride, a foreign affairs director, was arrested in
Mozambique Monday in connection with alleged gun running.
</P>
<P>
Mufamadi's spokesman, Andre Martin, said Friday the request
would be made through South Africa's High Commissioner in Maputo,
Mangisi Zitha.
</P>
<P>
"If everything goes well, the meeting will probably take place
next week," Martin said.
</P>
<P>
South African Press Association reported that Zitha, together
with Mcbride's wife Paula and a lawer, met detained Mcbride early
Friday evening shortly after a Mozambican magistrate finished
interviewing him.
</P>
<P>
Zitha quoted Mcbride as saying he had no arms in his vehicle
when he was arrested Monday. His vehicle was confiscated by the
Mozambican authorities.
</P>
<P>
South African authorities for now declined to comment on the
arrest. "We have to wait for the Mozambican police to complete
their investigation," Abdul Minty, Foreign Affairs Deputy
Director-General, said Thursday.
