<HEADLINE> Yeltsin's Entourage Purposely Ruin Him: Former Bodyguard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris
Yeltsin's former chief bodyguard Alexander Korzhakov said today
that if his advice to delay the presidential election in June had
been heeded, the president would not now be waiting for a heart
operation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his first news conference since being sacked as the
chief presidential bodyguard in June, Korzhakov claimed that
Yeltsin's health would not have deteriorated if the presidential
election had been delayed two or three months as he had advised.
</P>
<P>
Korzhakov said he was sure that "some people from the
president's present entourage wanted to wear him out in the
literal sense and lead him into what it has come to now."
</P>
<P>
He said allegations that his proposal was to stop the election
going ahead by force, was only "the invention of those who are now
in power."
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said this could be a reference to Presidential
Chief of Staff Anatoly Chubais, Yeltsin's key campaigner, who
accused Korzhakov of trying to derail the elections.
</P>
<P>
Korzhakov said he had had a confidential talk with Yeltsin
before publicly advocating his proposal to delay the election.
</P>
<P>
The president was very worried that he would be "unable to
withstand the election race," Korzhakov said, adding that a real
threat to the president's health emerged at that time as he was
exhausted from touring of Russian cities.
</P>
<P>
Korzhakov also spoke of his relations with national security
chief Alexander Lebed, whom he described as "the most promising
politician in the country."
</P>
<P>
Denying media speculation that Lebed needs him as a supporter
and fund-raiser in future presidential elections, Korzhakov said
Lebed is facing real dangers from his political opponents.
</P>
<P>
Korzhakov also said that he faced the threat of arrest and
physical violence against his family.

<HEADLINE> Russian Lawmakers Oppose Draft Budget in First Reading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Russia's lower house of
parliament today rejected the draft budget for 1997 and sent it
back to the government, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The draft was rejected by 280 votes to 33. Deputies must now
decide whether to order the government to present a new draft
within 20 days, or set up a conciliation commission with
representatives from the Duma, the Federation Council upper house
and the government to thrash out the differences.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Alexander Livshits, who presented the budget
to parliament, called on the lawmakers to cooperate with the
cabinet in finalizing the federal budget.
</P>
<P>
But Chairman of the Duma Committee for Budget, Taxes, Banks and
Finances, Mikhail Zadornov, said his committee would recommend
rejection of the bill, branding it "a budget of survival which
does not outline any prospects."
</P>
<P>
The draft envisaged spending of 524.34 trillion roubles (96
billion U.S. dollars), revenues of 433.64 trillion roubles (80
billion dollars) and a deficit of 90.7 trillion roubles (16
billion U.S. dollars), 3.3 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
The planned growth in tax revenues, fixed by the government at
405.3 trillion roubles (over 75 billion U.S. dollars) for 1997, is
"unrealistic," Zadornov said.
</P>
<P>
Overall income from all financing sources are planned at
425-445 trillion roubles (78-82 billion dollars), slightly more
than the 1996 level, he added.
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the Duma Committee for Economic Policy, Yuri
Maslyukov, told the Duma meeting that his committee proposed
rejecting the bill at the first reading and return it to the
Cabinet for improvement.
</P>
<P>
He said the draft did not offer sufficient and adequate
measures to boost industrial investment.
</P>
<P>
Other deputies said the budget did not satisfy social needs or
meet the needs of the under-funded armed forces.

<HEADLINE> 46 People Charged With Securities Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 11 (Xinhua) -- In a crackdown on stock
promoters who bribe brokers to buy stock in small companies,
officials of the Federal Bureau of Investigation have arrested 36
people, and 10 others are expected to be arrested in the next few
days, according to the New York Times today.
</P>
<P>
The arrests are said to have represented "the largest single
set of securities arrests ever made," and also spotlighted an
area of the securities market that gets little attention:
low-priced stocks of tiny companies, some of which hire promoters
to push their shares.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that those charged included officers of
companies whose stocks were being promoted. Most of the rest were
promoters, while some were brokers who are accused of having taken
bribes. They were charged with securities fraud and conspiracy to
commit securities fraud. The bribes, payments made to the brokers
to get them to purchase, were as much as 40 percent of the
purchase price, according to the charges.
</P>
<P>
Accusations reflect the fact the many people are willing to buy
speculative stocks, hoping to make a quick killing, the New York
Times commented.
</P>
<P>
If convicted on the charges, the defendants face maximum prison
terms of five to 50 years and fines of a much as 250,000 U.S.
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Dreekmann Knocked out in Beijing Open Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 11 (Xinhua/OANA) -- The top three seeded
players had been all out of the 320,000 U.S. dollars Beijing Open
as the third seed Hendrik Dreekmann of Germany was upset by
unseeded Thomas Johansson of Sweden in the quarter-finals on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
World No.80 Johansson came from first set behind to outplay
the German 2-6, 6-3, 6-1 and won a place in the semi-finals

<HEADLINE> US Wholesale Prices Up 0.2 Percent in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. wholesale prices rose
by 0.2 percent in September following a 0.3 percent increase in
August, the U.S. Labor Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that the increase in its Producer Price
Index (PPI), which measures inflationary pressures before they
reach the consumer, was moderate in last month.
</P>
<P>
The 0.2 percent overall increase in the PPI left wholesale
prices rising at an annual rate of 2.2 percent so far this year,
compared with a 2.3 percent increase for all of 1995 in the
country.
</P>
<P>
For September, food prices edged up a modest 0.2 percent, a
much smaller advance than the 1 percent increase in August. The
improvement reflected a turnaround in pork prices, which fell 7.5
percent, the biggest one-month decline in nearly nine years.
</P>
<P>
Outside the volatile food and energy sectors, the so-called
core rate of inflation climbed by 0.3 percent in September, a big
upturn from a 0.1 percent drop in August.
</P>
<P>
But even with the September increase, the core inflation rate
was still rising at an annual rate of just 0.8 percent so far this
year, down sharply from a 2.4 percent increase for the same period
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The worsening of the core inflation rate for September was
blamed in part on a 1.2 percent rise in new car prices, the
biggest one-month rise since a 1.3 percent rise in November 1993.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) has been keeping the short-term
interest rates unchanged since last January, apparently believing
that the U.S. economy will slow down on its own after soaring by
an annual rate of 4.7 percent in the second quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
Private economists are split on what will happen when the Fed
next meets on November 13.
</P>
<P>
Some argue that the Fed will continue to stay on the sidelines,
pointing to signs of a slowdown such as September's slight rise in
the unemployment rate to 5.2 percent. However, other economists
believe the Fed will finally begin raising rates, especially if
inflation shows signs of increase.

<HEADLINE> USDA Raises Corn, Soybean, Cotton Output Forecast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. corn output will
exceed 9 billion bushels (228.78 billion kg) this fall, giving a
little breath to supply and forcing down projected prices, the
U.S. Department of Agriculture said today.
</P>
<P>
Record ear counts in Illinois, Iowa and Nebraska, the nation's
top three corn states, helped increase the forecast to 9.01
billion bushels (229.03 billion kg).
</P>
<P>
If the forecast is realized, the corn harvest would be the
third largest, up 22 percent from last year's dismal harvest.
</P>
<P>
The forecast for the fall soybean crop was also lifted from
last month to 2.35 billion bushels (63.958 billion kg), a 3
percent up from the previous forecast and the second-highest crop
on record.
</P>
<P>
Changes in the forecast supply and demand indicate some corn
prices at around 3 dollars a bushel (25.42 kg) and soybeans, a key
livestock feed and food ingredient, below 7 dollars a bushel
(27.216 kg), the USDA's World Agricultural Outlook Board said.
</P>
<P>
Overall food price inflation has averaged 2.4 percent for the
last three years. Some economists have been predicting increases
of at least 3 to 4 percent this year and 5 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
The USDA latest forecast puts the cotton harvest at 18.2
million bales (3.966 billion kg), up 2 percent from last month and
last year. Late August rainfall in Texas caused the highest boll
counts in 10 years. California's crop turned out better than
expected.

<HEADLINE> UK Retail Sales Continue to Grow in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Retail Sales in Britain
continued to grow in September although at a slightly slower pace
than in August, according to the latest monthly survey of
retailers by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI).
</P>
<P>
The survey published today showed that orders placed by
retailers with their suppliers grew in September at the strongest
rate since July 1988, and retailers cut their stocks to the lowest
level for 13 years last month.
</P>
<P>
The CBI said that retailers viewed their business as above
average for the time of the year and that all types of shops saw a
rise in sales last month compared with a year earlier, and
Chemists reported the strongest rise in sales since December 1993.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, sectors most closely linked to the housing market
thrived, with strong growth in sales of hardware, china, furniture
and carpets.
</P>
<P>
However, clothing shops reported a slowdown in sales following
growth in the previous three months.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the slowdown in overall sales growth will
ease fears that the pick-up in high street activity is stocking
inflationary pressures.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The Organisation of African Unity
(OAU) and the government of Mali have rejected a U.S. proposal
for further sanctions against Nigeria's military government, a
local newspaper said here today.
</P>
<P>
"We have to be very careful about isolating Nigeria," said OAU
spokesman lbrahim Dagash at the OAU headquarters in
Addis Ababa, according to the Daily Guardian.
</P>
<P>
The OAU spokesman was commenting on the proposal made by the
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher who is at present on
his eight-day African tour.
</P>
<P>
The OAU prefers "diplomatic pressures" to sanctions, added
Dagash.
</P>
<P>
Christopher has been seeking African support for imposing more
strict sanctions against the Nigerian military government, which,
according to him, is violating human rights and not sincere over
handing over to an elected civilian government at an early date.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. secretary of state arrived at the Ethiopian capital
on Thursday after completing his visit to Bamako, capital of Mali
which was the first leg of his five-nation African tour.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Malian Foreign Minister Dioncounda Traore, was also
cool to Washington's new proposal, according to the Guardian.
</P>
<P>
Traore said Mali would condemn human rights violations in
Nigeria and elsewhere, but would not believe that an embargo was
the right solution.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian military government, led by Head of State General
Sani Abacha, has made clear that it would hand over during the
general elections scheduled for October 1998.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 11 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's former
Defense Minister Magnus Malan, charged with ordering the murder
of 13 people in Kwazulu/Natal Province in 1987, were today
acquited by the Durban Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen people died on the night of January 21, 1987 when

</P>

Handing down the court verdict, Justice Jan Hugo ruled that
the so-called Liebenberg Report which proposed the training of
IFP supporters did not constitute a conspiracy to murder.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Malan, Hugo said there was no evidence that he
had envisaged hit squads or Kwamakutha type operations.
</P>
<P>
However, the acquittal of Malan and his co-accused in the
Kwamakutha massacre trial drew mixed reaction from the political
parties.
</P>
<P>
President Nelson Mandela said in Cape Town today that he
"fully accepted" the Durban Supreme Court's decision to acquit
Malan and others accused of murder, adding that he would
not interfere in the judiciary process.
</P>
<P>
The African National Congress (ANC) said it would study the
judgement before issuing a detailed response.
</P>
<P>
The IFP, which was allegedly involved in the massacre, was
pleased with the court judgement as its supporters held a
jubilant celebration outside the Court.
</P>
<P>
The opposition National Party (NP) leader and former President
F. W. De Klerk said justice had prevailed in the Malan trial.

<HEADLINE> Ozone Hole Covers 90 Percent of Antarctic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The ozone layer over the
Antarctic is currently undergoing similarly severe destruction as
observed in the last four years, with the ozone hole now covering
about 90 percent of the continent, the World Meteorological
Organization (WMO) said today.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest data collected by the WMO from its
monitoring stations in the Antarctic, the area where ozone has
been depleted by 50 percent from the pre-ozone-hole values, a
phenomena which first appeared as a small area in the 1991
Antarctic spring, is now covering more than two thirds of the
Antarctic since mid-September.
</P>
<P>
For a fourth week in a row, the ozone in the atmospheric layer
from 17 kilometers to 22 kilometers, where the temperatures are
lower than minus 80 degrees Celsius, is completely annihilated,
the WMO said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. weather agency monitors the amount of ozone depletion
during September and October each year. Cold air temperature over
the Antarctic and the sun's rays combine to create the maximum
ozone depletion at this time of year.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have said that the dramatic ozone declines over the
Antarctic provide evidence that the Earth's ozone layer is being
eroded by man-made chemicals including chloroflurocarbons. The
ozone layer is vital for the lives on the Earth as it absorbs
harmful solar ultraviolet radiation.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa Passes Revised Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The Constitutional
Assembly (CA) today passed the revised version of South Africa's
final constitution which would be signed into law by President
Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
 The new constitution was supported by all major political
parties in the CA except the opposition of the African Christian
Democratic Party, the abstention of the Freedom Front and the
boycott of the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP).
</P>
<P>
It incorporates changes negotiated after the Constitutional
Court rejected eight sections of the document approved by the CA
on May 8 this year, including provincial powers and local
government, labour relations, protection of the attorney general
and public protector, and the powers of the public service
commission.
</P>
<P>
The constitution would be effected by July 1 next year, but
the deadline for the implementation of certain budgetary and
financial clauses is January 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Referring to IFP's boycott of Friday's CA sitting after
tentatively having participated in the re-drafting process,
Ramaphosa said it was a great disappointment that the IFP had not
taken its seats.
</P>
<P>
"Today we can say we have done the job," he said, referring
to the passing of the new constitution.

<HEADLINE> British Soldier Dies After IRA Double Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 11 (Xinhua) -- A British soldier, who was
seriously injured in the bombing attack in Northern Ireland
Monday, died from critical injuries earlier today, according to
official sources.
</P>
<P>
Warrant Officer Class One James Bradwell was the first British
soldier who was killed by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) over the
past two years.
</P>
<P>
A British Army spokesman reportedly said this morning, "We can
confirm that he has died from injuries received in the bombing."
</P>
<P>
Bradwell, 43, of the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers
received 60 percent burns when the two bombs exploded some 20
minutes apart.
</P>
<P>
Nine other soldiers and 21 civilians were also injured in the
double car bomb attacks at a British Army base in Lisburn,
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the death of the soldier, British Prime Minister
John Major poured fierce verbal attacks upon Gerry Adams, leader
of the IRA's political wing Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
"Don't tell me this has nothing to do with you. He (Bradwell)
was murdered in cold blood in the United Kingdom," Major said.
</P>
<P>
"Bombs will not bring Sinn Fein into the (multi-party peace)
talks. All they mean is that Sinn Fein has slammed the door on
themselves," he added.
</P>
<P>
The British government has repeatedly made it clear that Sinn
Fein will be banned from attending the peace talks forever unless
they call a new cease-fire.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Concerned About Zaire Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 11 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali today again urged all
sides involved in new clashes in eastern Zaire to restrain and
resolve their conflicts in a peaceful manner.
</P>
<P>
In a new statement issued here today, the U.N. chief urged the
conflicting parties to restrain and to exercise their "utmost
caution" in protecting the civilian population of the affected
areas.
</P>
<P>
The situation in eastern Zaire, especially in South Kivu, is
deteriorating still further, with serious fighting having been
reported between Zairian authorities and groups of Banyamulenge,
according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
Ghali also showed his concern about a new allegation against
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), which
was reportedly involved in "aggression against Zaire."
</P>
<P>
Similar accusations led the secretary-general to dispatch a
special envoy to the region late last month. But the government of
Zaire later admitted that the UNHCR had not been involved in any
such activities.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief called on the Zairian authorities to withdraw
these "baseless and outdated" allegations.

<HEADLINE> Russian Lawmakers Reject Government's Draft Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The State Duma, lower house of
the Russian parliament, today rejected the government's draft of
the 1997 budge, with most of its deputies thinking some targets of
the bill are "unrealistic."
</P>
<P>
The drawback of the bill, which does not differ much from
drafts in the previous years, is that "it is a budget of survival
which does not outline any prospects," said Chairman of the Duma
Committee for Budget, Taxes, Bank and Finances Mikhail Zadornov.
</P>
<P>
Now, the deputies are debating what to do with the draft:
either the draft will be submitted to a conciliatory commission or
the government will be offered to submit a renewed draft to the
Duma within 20 days.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the bill to the Duma at its session, Russian Finance
Minister Alexander Livshits said the version of the budget drawn
up by the government was not an ultimate truth, and he called on
the lawmakers to cooperate with the government in finalizing the
bill.

<HEADLINE> Belarus Parliament Refuses to Change Referendum Date </HEADLINE>

<P>
MOSCOW, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Belarus's parliament today
rejected the proposal of President Alexander Lukashenko on
holding a nationwide referendum on November 7 instead of November
24, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
In a secret ballot on whether to reschedule a referendum on the
presidential-proposed constitution, 88 deputies voted against, 84
expressed support and six ballots were declared invalid.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before the parliament earlier today, Lukashenko
recalled his proposal to advance the referendum from November 24
to November 7 and insisted that only his draft constitution go
before the referendum.
</P>
<P>
However, he edited out three parliament-proposed questions from
the ballot paper. The questions concern an alternative
constitution, financing of all branches of power from one budget
article, and election of regional leaders by local residents.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko said he had exhausted all possible ways of
compromising with the deputies. "Only the people will be able to
put the full stop in this dispute of politicians," he added.
</P>
<P>
Both the president and the lawmakers have been involved in
several months of a dispute over whether it is necessary to give
more powers to the head of state. The issue will be decided in the
forthcoming referendum.

<HEADLINE> Major Shows Confidence at Coming Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 11 (Xinhua) -- British Tory Party leader John
Major today called on his members to work "hard and soul" to
secure a fifth consecutive term of office for the Tory at the next
election.
</P>
<P>
In his closing address to the Tory party conference, Major
unveiled his commitment of an "Opportunity For All" manifesto that
he hopes will boost the morale of the party.
</P>
<P>
For the sake of showing the Tory's unity before the coming
election, the prime minister said, "The well-being of the
Conservative Party is more important than any member of it."
</P>
<P>
Major told the delegates, "It has been the week the Tory family
came together -- to renew the family contract with the British
nation."
</P>
<P>
While praising his own party as a "straight, honorable and
true" one, Major painted the opposition Labor as a "party of
opportunists" with no firm principles.
</P>
<P>
Unlike Labor, Major said, "We haven't abandoned our
principles." "We haven't had to reinvent ourselves... because
we've changed Britain for the better," he added.
</P>
<P>
An observer who attended the conference said, "Judging from
Major's address this morning, Tories are rebuilding their
confidence. The conference has undoubtedly gone well."
</P>
<P>
Britain's financial markets also reacted positively. Chief
economist David Coleman from Wood Gundy said, "The conference as a
whole has gone much better than anyone expected."
</P>
<P>
The big unanswered question was whether the new found unity on
the European single currency would last past the weekend, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Another analyist said it's hard to comment on Major's closing
address at the moment. "It looks great for now, but can it last?
It's by no means certain that it can," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Justice Department
announced today that U.S. law enforcement authorities, with joint
efforts from other countries, smashed a major drug trafficking
ring.
</P>
<P>
The investigators have seized more than 26 million U.S. dollars
of heroin since 1995 and charged 44 people with drug-related
offenses in the United States and abroad. Thirty-four people were
arrested today in Chicago, New York and Detroit of the United
States, Thailand and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The smuggling ring, involving Nigerian nationals, operated from
Southeast Asia to the streets of major American cities, including
Boston, Chicago, Detroit and Milwaukee, Attorney General Janet
Reno told reporters at a Justice Department news conference.
</P>
<P>
The ring began 15 years ago as a group of Nigerian women
smuggled heroin in small amounts for organized crime groups, said
Thomas Constantine, director of the Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA) under the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
The ring directed heroin smuggling from Singapore, Bangkok and
other Far East points to Amsterdam and Paris, Constantine said.
The drugs were then transshipped by boat to Central America and
taken over land through Mexico to the United States.
</P>
<P>
"This is a graphic example of the new organized crime in the
United States," he said.
</P>
<P>
Reno and the DEA chief praised foreign law enforcement
agencies, including the Royal Thai police, for their crucial
cooperation in the operation.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 11 (Xinhua) -- President Benjamin Mkapa
today called on the United States to support peace iniatives
being taken in the Great Lakes Region to end hostilities in
Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a Luncheon in honour of the visiting U.S.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher in Arusha, northern
Tanzania, President Mkapa said that the economic embargo imposed
by Great Lakes countries on Burundi was an effective strategy in
pressing for a negotiated political settlement of the crises in
the Central African nation.
</P>
<P>
Christopher is in the country for a six-hour visit ahead of
the Great Lakes leaders summit in Arusha tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The luncheon was also attended by President Daniel arap Moi of
Kenya and President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda.
</P>
<P>
According to the government newspaper, "Daily News", President
Mkapa said, "the sanctions explained the unanimous position taken
by the leaders of the Great Lakes region to refuse to welcome or
underwrite the usurpation of power in Burundi through illegal
means."
</P>
<P>
He said the move should also serve as a lesson to those
seeking to seize power by military coup.
</P>
<P>
"We believe, by way of sanctions, we can trigger a renewal of
a negotiated political settlement of the problems in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time (we are) sending out a powerful signal on
the proper role of the military in Africa as we approach the next
century," said the president.
</P>
<P>
President Mkapa commended the U.S. government's policy on
Africa, saying the continent deserved more attention, especially
in getting rid of poverty.
</P>
<P>
He said democraic and political reforms could only be
sustained by equal progress on the economic front and the
improvement of people's life. enditem

<HEADLINE> Situation of Refugees in Yugoslavia Deteriorates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The situation of more than
650,000 refugees sheltering in Yugoslavia has drastically
deteriorated over the past season due to insufficient relief aid,
the Serbian Red Cross has said.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of the Serbian Red Cross Radmila Cvetkovic said today
that the situation was most difficult in July when international
humanitarian organizations had delivered only 2,727 tons of relief
aid.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of the civil war in neighboring Bosnia late last
year, international humanitarian aid has been reduced to the
former Yugoslavia as the economic situation in these countries is
getting better.
</P>
<P>
Cvetkovic said donors both at home and abroad have reduced
relief aid shipments, driving the refugees in Yugoslavia to
terrible conditions.
</P>
<P>
In the July-September period, the only aid delivered through
efforts of the Serbian Red Cross was 15 tons of medicine from
France and 14 tons of flour and powdered milk donored by a foreign
church charity organization, she added.
</P>
<P>
However, despite the unfavorable conditions, the Serbian
government, the Serbian refugee commissioner and the Red Cross are
doing all they can to secure the minimum humanitarian aid to the
refugees.
</P>
<P>
The Red Cross called on all international humanitarian
organizations to continue their humanitarian aid to the refugees
in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Although conflict in the former Yugoslavia has ended with the
signing of the Dayton peace agreement last December, most of the
1.2 million Bosnian refugees outside the country are still unable
to return home because living conditions in the place of their
origin are poor or they are not allowed to return to their
hometowns which are now under the control of their former enemies.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Premier to Meet Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The reliable anonymous source said that Hariri's visit to
Washington, the first of the 52-year-old Lebanese prime minister
since his triumph in Lebanon's parliamentary election last month,
was arranged by Lebanese Acting Finance Minister Fuad Sinyoura,
who returned from the U.S. capital earlier this week after
attending annual meetings of the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Hariri will reiterate Lebanon's demand for
Washington's lifting of a ban on American citizens' travel to his
country, which has constituted a major obstacle to substantial
investment of U.S. businessmen, the source noted.
</P>
<P>
The ban was imposed by then Ronald Reagan's administration
following a series of terrorist attacks against U.S. interests in
Lebanon and other places in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hariri will seek more financial assistance from
Washington for Lebanon's ambitious reconstruction plan
masterminded by the billionaire-turned prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The talks between Hariri and Clinton will also deal with the
stalled peace process in the Middle East, according to the source.
</P>
<P>
Hariri had originally hoped to go to the U.S. capital for a
meeting of international funders of Lebanon's reconstruction
scheme, known as the "consultative committee for Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
The funders group had been set up under a cease-fire
understanding brokered by the U.S. between Lebanon and Israel,
which ended a 17-day Israeli blitz in south Lebanon in April.
</P>
<P>
The meeting has been postponed due to an American
preoccupation with the November presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Winning a seat for himself and becoming the head of one of the
biggest parliamentary blocs, Hariri has been regarded as the
most-favored candidate for the premier of the next government,
which is to be formed after the new parliament is opened on
October 22.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Supports Sanctions on Burundi, Christopher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher today reiterated support for sanctions on
Burundi imposed by leaders of the Great Lakes region in efforts
to restore democracy in the tiny central African nation.
</P>
<P>
Christopher was in Tanzania for a six-hour visit on the eve of
the Great Lakes leaders summit scheduled for tomorrow in the
northern town of Arusha.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held in Arusha this afternoon, the U.S.
secretary of state urged the warring parties in Burundi to stop
the killings and start peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The official "Daily News" newspaper quoted Christopher as
saying that his country wanted democracy to be restored in
Burundi soon.
</P>
<P>
He underlined that peace in Burundi could not be achieved by
armed force or imposed by one group of Burundians over another,
the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. calls on both sides in the conflict to suspend their
hostilities and to begin all-party negotiations," said
Christopher.
</P>
<P>
"Our responsibility is to press for both sides to reach an
agreement that allows all the people of Burundi to live together
in a secure and democratic country," he added.
</P>
<P>
Christopher described as encouraging the recent decision by
the military Junta led by Major Pierre Buyoya to re-open the
national assembly and lift the ban on political parties.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. believed that peace in Burundi was attainable, he
said.
</P>
<P>
However, he warned, "should the situation deteriorate further,
the international community should be prepared to act quickly to
prevent the humanitarian catastrophe."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. secretary of state also confirmed that he had met
with the Organization of African Unity (OAU) Secretary General,
Salim Ahmed Salim, on the need to establish an African crisis
response force.
</P>
<P>
Christopher today held separate talks with the main mediator
for Burundi Mwalimu Julius Nyerere, Uganda President Yoweri
Museveni, Kenyan President Daniel Arap Moi and the Chief
Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda,
Louise Arbour.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. was in support of the Rwanda Tribunal and
appreciated its role which was not only to punish culprits of
genocide in Rwanda, but to deter similar incidents in Burundi and
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. secretary of state pledged 650,000 U.S. Dollars
additional contribution by his government to the tribunal, which
would be tied to improvement of its management.
</P>
<P>
Christopher left Arusha this evening for South Africa.

<HEADLINE> Greenpeace's Ship Leaves After Lebanon Rejects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 11 (Xinhua) -- A Greenpeace ship left the
Mediterranean water near Lebanon's coast today after Lebanese
authorities refused its entry, a spokesman of the international
environment-monitoring group said in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Fuad Hamdan, spokesman of Greenpeace's Mediterranean Office,
expressed a "regret" for the Lebanese government's decision to
prevent the ship Artic Sunrise from entering Lebanese ports.
</P>
<P>
The Greenpeace ship had to anchor 12 miles off Lebanon's
territorial waters for 24 hours before returning to Cyprus where
it had first come from, the spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese Central News Agency said Friday night that the
ship's captain had called the Beirut Port authority through radio
for several times, asking for permission to visit the ports of
Jounieh and Saida but "the answer was negative."
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Minister of Environment Pierre Pharaon clarified that
the reason for prohibiting the ship's entry was "Greenpeace's
negative policy toward Lebanon," stressing that the "positions
taken by the organization have made Lebanon hurt."
</P>
<P>
He asked Greenpeace "to go to other countries in order to make
public its information on the environment."
</P>
<P>
The minister added that the government took the decision at
his request.
</P>
<P>
"As a minister of environment I can't ban the ship's entry and
I hoped the government will do so and the government adopted my
suggestion," the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese government has been annoyed at Greenpeace's
repeated accusation in the past two years on the government's
alleged failure to process toxic waste dumped by Italian
companies on Lebanon's land during the country's 1975-90 civil
war.
</P>
<P>
In September 1995, the Lebanese authorities forced the
Greenpeace ship Altair to leave the Beirut Port, preventing it
from giving more information on the Italian industrial waste.

<HEADLINE> UK Customs Seizes Heroin in Polish Football Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 11 (Xinhua) -- British customs officials found
over 100 kilograms of heroin worth 8 million pounds (about 13
million U.S. dollars) in a coach taking Polish football fans home
after Wednesday's match against England in London, said British
customs sources today.
</P>
<P>
The 10 football fans and two drivers on the coach were detained
but were subsequently released without charge and they returned to
Poland earlier today, an official of the Customs' National
Investigation Service said.
</P>
<P>
The heroin was discovered in two cylinders running the length
of the coach chassis during a routine search at Dover docks in
southeast England, the official said.
</P>
<P>
"Investigators have so far uncovered no evidence to directly
connect any of the 12 men to the heroin on the coach, which
travels widely throughout Europe. The inquiry will continue now
both at home and abroad," he added.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Defense Minister: Islamic Fundamentalism, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Extreme Islamic
fundamentalism and the attempt to acquire nuclear weapons by
certain countries are two dangers in the Middle East, Israeli
Defense Minister Mordechai said today.
</P>
<P>
In a wide-ranging interview published on today's Jerusalem
Post, Mordechai said Israel was one of the main goals of Islamic
fundamentalism which also targets the whole Western world.
</P>
<P>
The second danger in the Middle East is the ability of certain
nations to get nuclear weapons, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai singled out Iran for being "a source of Islamic
fundamentalism and has the great desire to make or purchase
non-conventional weapons."
</P>
<P>
"Imagine what would have happened if Iraq had nuclear weapons
during the Gulf war," he said, referring to Iraq's missile
attacks on Israel in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Israeli destroyed Iraq's nuclear reactor in 1987 in a
surprise air bombing operation. Israel is regarded to be the
single country in the region that has nuclear capability, and
experts suspected it had owned 100 nuclear heads. Israel has
neither denied, nor confirmed the allegation.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai also expressed Israel's concern about the powerful
conventional weapons that some Arab countries are trying to
acquire.
</P>
<P>
"The other danger is the arming of Arab nations, with an
emphasis on surface-to-surface missiles with long ranges of over
500 kilometers so they can fire at Israel from afar like in the
Gulf War," he said.
</P>
<P>
During the interview, Mordechai also talked about Israeli
relations with Syria, Egypt, Turkey and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the recent military tension with Syria
following Syrian troop movements in Lebanon, Mordechai ruled out
the possibility that Syrian President Hafez al-Assad would launch
an attack on Israel in a short period of time.
</P>
<P>
"Assad is a cool-headed calculating man and if he does an
operation he wants to know what dangers it involves. Therefore, I
don't believe that Assad will make a grave mistake," he asserted.
</P>
<P>
The minister warned Syria that any provocation could cause "a
very grave, extreme and immediate reaction" from Israel.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mordechai reiterated that Israel has "no intentions
for war and I will make all efforts to prevent war." Two days
ago, Mordechai sent a message to Assad inviting him to visit
Israel in order to resume peace talks that have been stalled so
far.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the recent tense relations with Egypt, which
conducted a large-scale military exercise mocking Israeli
attacks, Mordechai said Israel has no intention of harming
Egyptian sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
"We have peace with Egypt, I think the Egyptians have to put
forth all efforts to refrain from verbal attacks which don't help
anyone," he said, adding he would like to pay a visit to Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country making peace with Israel, has
escalated its criticism of Israel recently for the lack of
progress in the peace process on all tracks.
</P>
<P>
Mentioning Israel's strategic relations with Turkey, Mordechai
said he hoped Turkey would continue to be a democratic Western
state even after the formation of an Islamic government.
</P>
<P>
"We have welcomed military relations for our benefit and
Turkey's benefit. I hope these ties will continue. We both have
an interest in strengthening the moderate elements in Turkey," he
said.
</P>
<P>
In February, Israel and Turkey signed a controversial treaty
on military cooperation which allows Israeli pilots to conduct
training flights in Turkish airspace. It aroused protests from
Arab countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
Talking about his upcoming visit to the U.S. next week,
Mordechai said it would "create a personal chemistry and a common
ground for strengthening the relations with the Americans."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he admitted the existence of "different opinions"
between the two close allies, including those on peace talks
with the Palestinians and Syrians, as well as "certain
differences regarding the special needs of Israel to answer the
threats."
</P>
<P>
Mordechai added Israel did not intend to reduce the 1.8
billion U.S. dollars in annual U.S. aid to Israel in face of the
threats it is facing.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Holds First MMP Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, October 12 (Xinhua) -- New Zealanders go to polls
today in the first national election under the new Mixed Member
Proportional (MMP) system.
</P>
<P>
Voting started at 9 a.m. (20:00 GMT Friday) in all the 3,235
polling places throughout the country and will close at 7 p.m.
(06:00 GMT) today.
</P>
<P>
The preliminary results are expected to be announced around 11
p.m. (10:00 GMT), one hour later than in the 1993 election,
because more votes will be counted this year.
</P>
<P>
Under the MMP, the first in the country since 1853, a voter
casts two votes instead of one as in the previous election in 1993
under the First-Past-the-Poll system.
</P>
<P>
Apart from ticking a MP candidate for his or her electorate,
each voter selects a party on another vote, known as the party
vote.
</P>
<P>
A party names its electorate candidates and prepares a party
list. In the current election, a total of 611 candidates from 34
parties are competing for the 65 electorate seats, including five
reserved for the Maori people. As the next parliament will
increase the number of parliament members for the present 99 to
120, the other 45 MPs will be filled by parties from their party
lists.
</P>
<P>
However, of the 34 parties, only 21 have submitted their party
lists to the Electoral Commission.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the election, parties will have their parliament
seats in proportion to the votes they receive. But only parties
getting more than five percent of the votes or winning a
constituency seat are qualified for seats from its party list.
</P>
<P>
It is generally believed that no party will be able to win a
majority from the 2.65 million eligible voters and the next
government will be a coalition.
</P>
<P>
The National Party and the Labor Party, which ruled alternately
in the past, are tipped to remain the two largest parties, and the
new coalition may well be led by one of them.
</P>
<P>
Right after the election, bargains will unfold among political
parties on forming a government. Radio NZ quoted chief electoral
officer Phil Whelan this morning as saying that it could be weeks
before the country knows who will form the next government.

<HEADLINE> Israel Develops New Drug to Ease Alzheimer's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 11 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli hospital has
developed a new drug that is effective in treating Alzheimer's
patients by improving their memory and cognitive abilities.
</P>
<P>
A research team in the Kaplan Hospital told this week's
Jerusalem International Conference on Alzheimer's Disease that
the drug had been proven to be effective in treating the disease,
The Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
To test its effects, 96 patients were given the drug named
AL-Telect three times a day, while a control group received a
placebo.
</P>
<P>
Researchers found that the daily functioning of those who
received Al-Telect deteriorated less than the control group. The
dementia of those taking the pills was slowed, and in some cases,
there was even an improvement.
</P>
<P>
They also found that the effect was most marked in patients
in the early stages of the Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of those on AL-Telect wanted to continue taking
the pills, while no one taking the placebo wanted to continue,
the report said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Europe's major stock markets
reversed Thursday's losses and all finished the week in positive
territories today, with London ending above the 4,000 level once
again, buoyed by U.S. economic figures today showing prospects of
subdued interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The London market ended the trading week on a high note after
the latest U.S. figures prompted gains in the gilts market, with
the FTSE 100 index up 33.4 points at 4,028.1, 3.3 points higher
than a week ago.
</P>
<P>
The market was also cheered by Wall Street which moved sharply
higher after U.S. producer prices showed subdued growth despite a
higher-than-expected increase in U.S. retail sales.
</P>
<P>
German shares in Frankfurt made modest gains and closed
slightly higher today as weakness in the German bonds market
weighed on shares, with the DAX-30 share index 5.28 points up at
2,686.03, still 2.75 points higher than last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Dealers in Frankfurt remained cautious as the market closed
before the release of the U.S. inflation data.
</P>
<P>
The Paris bourse also ended the session higher on benign U.S.
economic data although trade volumes were thin as many traders had
remained on the sidelines awaiting the U.S. figures. The CAC-40
index closed up 11.49 points at 2,147.12, 5.57 points lower from
last week.
</P>
<P>
London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading
British shares closed 33.4 points up at 4,028.1. The Frankfurt

<HEADLINE> China Stresses UN's Role in Promoting Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador Wang
Xuexian said here today that only the U.N. treated development
issues in the same way as it did international conflicts could the
organization prove itself worthy of its name in the 21st.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the General Assembly on the Report of the
Secretary-General on the Work of the Organization, Wang said that
the U.N. had made a lot of efforts in the past year in alleviating
regional conflicts, bringing to the attention of the international
community the question of social development and pushing forward
its own reforms.
</P>
<P>
"However, there is also a disturbing trend that the question of
development fails to get due attention, the financial difficulties
of the U.N. are on the rise and the role of the U.N. is weakened,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
In the current international situation, the question of
development, particularly in the vast number of developing
countries, had increasingly come to fore, he said.
</P>
<P>
Preventing conflicts, restoring stability, eradicating poverty
and achieving the objectives of social development were with no
exception, closely linked with economic development, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. had a unique and important role to play in the field
of development, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
However, the recent years had witnessed a further decline in
the position of the U.N. in the economic and development areas as
marked by shortage of funds and shrinking operations of U.N.
development agencies.
</P>
<P>
In the past year, the level of resources made available for
development, including through the U.N. system had continued to
drop while the official development assistance from developed
countries declined to only 0.27 percent of GDP, far below the U.N.
target of 0.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed concern at the chronical financial crisis of
the organization as the arrears stood at 2.9 billion U.S. dollars
in September, with 1.6 billion owed by the biggest contributor.
</P>
<P>
On reform of the organization, he stressed that the reform
should enable the U.N. to better adapt itself to the changes and
development in the world situation, more effectively achieve the
purposes and principles of the Charter and play a more positive
role in promoting peace and development rather than simply cutting
expenditures and reducing staff.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Winner of 1996 Noble Prize in Economics Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 11 (Xinhua) -- William Vickrey, who won the
Nobel Prize in economics of 1996 three days ago, died near New
York City today.
</P>
<P>
Vickrey, 82, who had been traveling to an academic conference
in Boston, was found being slumped over the wheel of his car
Thursday night and was pronounced dead on arrival at a hospital
early today, a spokeswoman for Columbia University said.
</P>
<P>
His car was on a parkway in Harrison, about 30 miles north of
New York City, she said
</P>
<P>
At the family's request, the cause of death was not immediately
released.
</P>
<P>
Vickrey was a professor emeritus and had taught at Columbia
University for nearly 60 years. He shared the economics Nobel
Prizes with James Mirrlees of Britain's Cambridge University for
their separate work on "asymmetric information." That field seeks
to maximize economic efficiency when two sides have incomplete
information about each other.
</P>
<P>
Vickrey had focused on practical matters like efficient use of
public transportation.
</P>
<P>
He also had greater success at implementing his theories on
auctions, another example of asymmetric information. In the form
of auction now known as a "Vickrey auction," bids are sealed, but
the person who submits the highest bid pays only the price stated
in the next-highest bid--a system the Nobel committee called
"socially efficient."
</P>
<P>
Some elements of Vickrey's theories were used last year when
the U.S. Federal Communications Commission auctioned licenses for
use of slices of the nation's airwaves.
</P>
<P>
Vickrey, a Canadian-born American citizen, grew up in New York,
Switzerland and New Jersey and studied mathematics at Yale. He
earned a master's in economics from Columbia in 1937 and a
doctorate in 1948.

<HEADLINE> Irish Government Unveils Plans to Combat Drug Addiction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The Irish government today
unveiled a detailed report on cracking down on the epidemic of
drug addiction in an effort to tackle the worsening drugs problem
in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Irish government promised in the report that a
14-million-punt (about 23 million U.S. dollars) package would be
allocated to resolve the problem and extra resources were also
available to treat addicts and improve the run-down urban areas,
according to press reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
The government report also contained plans for greater
co-operation among state agencies on the issue, as well as the
creation of local drugs task forces in partnership with community
groups in areas facing the most acute problem.
</P>
<P>
Pat Rabbitte, an Irish government minister, told a press
conference today: "This report is an important step in tackling
the drugs problem from the demand side, with its focus on
treatment, education, research into the causes of drug addiction."
</P>
<P>
Ireland is increasingly become a hub of international drugs
trafficking as its miles of remote coastline are ideal for
smuggling in drugs for trans-shipment to the rest of Europe.

WASHINGTON, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Friday that Washington will go forward with sale of F-16
jet-fighters to Indonesia while congratulating two Timorese on
their receiving the 1996 Nobel peace award.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the sale of the f-16s is appropriate,
considering Indonesia' security and defense needs," State
Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
He said the Untied States has to act in the interest of the
American people with regard to the relationship with Indonesia,
that he said is very important in its "multi-faced" aspects,
</P>
<P>
"It is political, it is economic and it's military," he said.
</P>
<P>
Burns was answering a reporter's question that the Nobel peace
award, which this year was granted to East Timor Bishop Carlos
Belo and resistance leader Jose Ramos-Horta, has vindicated
Timorese resistance against Indonesia' occupation of the former
Portuguese colony in 1975.
</P>
<P>
Washington congratulates the two Timorese who have been given
the Nobel peace award, and has long encouraged efforts to
achieve peace in East Timor, Burns said. "We've strongly
supported direct discussions between Indonesia and Portugal on
this problem."
</P>
<P>
The United States hopes that the action by the Norwegian
Nobel Prize Committee would "contribute to on-going efforts to
resolve the conflict in East Timor, Burns said.
</P>
<P>
Reports here said that Indonesia reacted angrily to the peace
award that has given to Ramos-Horta, whom Indonesia's Foreign
Minister Ali Alatas called a "political adventurist".
</P>
<P>
"It is quite a surprise and quite regrettable that such a
reputable institution has decided to give this prize to a person
like Ramos-Horta, who has quite clearly been involved in the
manipulation of the people of East Timor for his own interests,"
said Indonesia's foreign ministry.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution today, urging
both Angolan Government and the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) to accelerate peace process.
</P>
<P>
Emphasizing the importance of a continued U.N. presence in
Angola, the Security Council decided to extend the mandate of the
United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III) until
December 11.
</P>
<P>
The council acknowledged as positive steps the arrival in
Luanda of UNITA generals for the duty in the Angolan Armed Forces
(FAA), the registration of over 63,000 UNITA troops in quartering
areas, the surrender of additional heavy weapons in September, the
selection of nearly 10,000 UNITA troops for incorporation into the
FAA, and the beginning of the demobilization of underaged
personnel and the proposal regarding the special status of the
leader of UNITA.
</P>
<P>
The council urged the Angolan president and the leader of UNITA
to meet at the earliest opportunity in Angola to resolve all
outstanding issues.
</P>
<P>
After expressing disappointment with UNITA for delaying
implementation of the Lusaka Protocol, the council called upon
UNITA to fulfill the following tasks:
</P>
<P>

soldiers for incorporation into the FAA;
</P>
<P>
-- stem the flow of deserters from quartering areas and
continue to return those who have deserted;
</P>
<P>
-- register in the quartering areas UNITA policemen who have
remained in the areas vacated by UNITA military forces;
</P>
<P>
-- dismantle all command posts of UNITA military forces;
</P>
<P>
-- issue a formal, written declaration that all UNITA soldiers
have been quartered and that UNITA has no more weapons and
military equipment in its possession;
</P>
<P>
-- cooperate fully with UNAVEM and the Joint Commission in the
extension of State administration throughout Angola;
</P>
<P>
-- make available other generals and senior officers for duty
in the FAA, the UNITA officials designated to take up posts in the
state and local administrations;
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> ECE: Future of Coal Depends on Electricity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The future of coal will
increasingly depend on the electricity industry, as demand from
other user sectors is expected to continue declining, the United
Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN/ECE) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to a ECE survey issued Friday, coal is currently the
dominant fuel for electricity, providing close to 45 percent of
the world's electricity. It is also the second most important
source of primary energy after the oil in the world.
</P>
<P>
But the survey stated that the commitment of an increasing
number of countries worldwide to improving environment and climate
protection is expected to challenge the use of coal in all parts
of world, especially the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change
will be a strong driving force for coal substitution.
</P>
<P>
Now that clean coal technologies are available to restrict the
harmful impact of coal production and use, their urgent
application will be essential for asserting a role for coal in a
sustainable energy development, the ECE said.
</P>
<P>
However, it also admitted that since without technical and
financial assistance, for many countries in the world clean coal
will remain a luxury which they cannot afford.
</P>
<P>
According to the ECE survey, by the year 2000, the Asia-Pacific
region is expected to be the major coal growth market in the
world. The growing import demand will be met chiefly by exporters
from the region. Australia is expected to remain the world's top
coal exporting country.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serb President Sees No Conditions for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Bonsian Serb President Biljana
Plavsic said on Friday conditions did not exist at this time for
normal municipal elections to be held in the Serb entity Republika
Srpska.
</P>
<P>
Plavsic made the remarks in Banja Luka, the largest Serb city
in northwestern Bosnia, after holding a closed-door meeting with
Robert Frowick, chief of mission of the Organization of Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to Bosnia-Herzegovina. OSCE is
responsible for organizing and monitoring the elections in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The general elections in Bosnia were held on September 14,
during which most of the 2.9 million eligible voters cast their
ballots to choose the three-member presidency, the house of
representatives of Bosnia, the parliaments of Republika Srpska and
the Muslim-Croat Federation and the Republika Srpska President.
</P>
<P>
But OSCE has decided to postpone the municipal elections until
November 23-24 as it has been aware of possible voting
manipulation in local elections.
</P>
<P>
The Serb president said some Muslims made forced entries into
Serb areas, thus complicating the situation and making it
impossible for local elections to be held in time.
</P>
<P>
"If the election procedure is to be normal, then normal
conditions must be created," Plavsic stressed, adding she believed
that Frowick, too, would come to share this view once he received
precise information from the ground.
</P>
<P>
Before her talk with Frowick, Plavsic had met, also behind
closed doors, with General John Sullivan, Deputy Commander of the
ground troops of the multinational peace Implementation Force
(IFOR) over issues concerning the implementation of the Dayton
agreement.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Friday
refuted a senior French official's remarks that criticized U.S.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher's African tour as a mere
pre-election ploy.
</P>
<P>
French Cooperation Minister Jacques Godfrain said on Wednesday
that Christopher's visit to five African nations was an effort to
gain favor with American black voters.
</P>
<P>
"I welcome the fact that, after Washington cut development aid
by 15 percent and after President Clinton has not been once to
Africa, after he made no mention of Africa in his address to the
U.N. General Assembly, a few weeks before presidential elections,
Africa becomes a priority of the A,erican government," Godfrain
said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department attacked the comments as "outrageous" and
"unfounded", saying the French minister should "rethink them".
</P>
<P>
"On behalf of our government, I should tell you that these are
outrageous, unfounded and unjustified remarks by a minister of the
French government," said State Department spokesman Nicholas
Burns.
</P>
<P>
"These are disappointed remarks and the French minister who
made them ought to rethink them," he added.
</P>
<P>
France is often in a prickly relationship with the United
States and has been opposed to U.S. sanctions against Cuba, Iran
and Libya. Most recently, It expressed differences over The U.S.
missile attacks on Iraq, and declined to endorse extension of the
no-fly zone in southern Iraq.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves New Three-Year ESAF Loan for Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) today approved a new three-year loan of totaling some
127 million U.S. dollars under the enhanced structural adjustment
facility (ESAF) for Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
The loan is provided to back the Government's medium-term
economic and reform program for 1996-1999. The first annual ESAF
loan, in an amount of about 42 million dollars equivalent, will be
disbursed in two equal installments, the first of which is
available immediately.
</P>
<P>
Under the eastern African country's medium-term development
program, the main macroeconomic objectives are to achieve 6
percent growth in real GDP, limit the rate of inflation to about 2
percent, contain the external current account deficit at about 9.2
percent of GDP, and maintain gross official foreign reserves at
the equivalent of 7.5 months of imports. Within the medium-term
strategy, the program for 1996-97 aims at real GDP growth of 6
percent, to limit the inflation rate to 1.2 percent, to contain
the external account deficit at about 10.5 percent of GDP, and to
maintain gross official foreign reserves at the equivalent of
eight months of imports.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia joined the IMF in December 1945. Its quota is about
141 million dollars equivalent and its outstanding use of IMF
credit currently totals about 71 million dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Argentina today smashed a
drug trafficking ring in an operation that included 50 search
warrants in southern Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
In the crackdown, 48 suspects, including 10 policemen, were
detained and about 10 kilograms of cocaine, together with 22
rifles, two grenades and several vehicles, were confiscated.
</P>
<P>
Federal Judge Raquel Morris Dloogatz, who ordered the
operation, was specially concerned about the involvement in the
ring of the policemen and a primary school teacher.
</P>
<P>
The judge said the 10 Buenos Aires policemen went from main
officers to low-ranking officials, and their roles in the band
were diverse. Most of them were bodyguards for the drug lord, and
others were couriers.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the band has international connections,
mainly with drug traffickers in neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Police sources said the ring received drugs from Bolivia.
</P>
<P>
The investigations into this band were started more than a year
ago, said Morris Dloogatz.
</P>
<P>
In another operation in several other parts of the capital
city, 14 suspects were arrested and 50 kilograms of cocaine was
seized.

<HEADLINE> All Social Sectors in Ningxia Mobilized to Aid Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Wang Shuiying, now earns the
same as when she worked in the Yinchuan Leather Shoe Factory
which went bankrupt last year.
</P>
<P>
Wang, 43, runs a small grocery in downtown Yinchuan, the
capital of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
She said, "Because I receive relief from the government, I am
exempted from some taxes. I earn 400 to 500 yuan a month. My
family now has no financial trouble."
</P>
<P>
She is one of the beneficiaries of a project launched by all
sectors of society in Ningxia to aid urban residents living below
the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, some urban families have become
financially strapped because of losses incurred by their
employers, mostly state-owned enterprises, as well as inflation.
</P>
<P>
The autonomous regional government decided last June to
mobilize all social sectors to aid the poor in towns and cities.
</P>
<P>
Ren Qixing, vice-chairman of the Ningxia Autonomous Regional
Government, said that a leading group has been set up to plan,
organize, guide and coordinate projects to aid the poor in urban
areas.
</P>
<P>
He said that various government departments have formulated a
minimum wage standard, a minimum living expense standard for
displaced workers, and minimum living expense for urban residents.
</P>
<P>
Departments have introduced the system under which regular
relief and allowances are issued to relatively poor families in
urban areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
Yu Gesheng, assistant to the chairman of the regional
government, noted that a fund to aid urban poor families will be
founded later this year.
</P>
<P>
The fund will come from appropriations by governments at all
levels, revenue from personal income tax, and earnings from the
transfer of state-owned assets.
</P>
<P>
Urban residents, enterprises and institutes are being
encouraged to contribute to the fund, he said.
</P>
<P>
The autonomous regional government has also decided to provide
grain subsidies to low-income urban families, to exempt or reduce
taxes for self-employed members of poor urban families, and grant
preferential treatment to those families in medical care.

BRASILIA, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Brazil will take measures to
cut the public budget deficit from 5 percent of GDP in 1995 to 2.5
percent in 1997, Finance Minister Pedro Malan said here today.
</P>

Malan told a press conference that the measures include cutting
spending in the fields of finance, state enterprises, social
security, and public employment, and increasing federal taxes to
balance the public budget.

<P>
The government will take a measure, among others, to add 2,000
new financial personnel with the aim of improving tax assessment
and tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
Malan said the reduction of deficit from 5 percent to 2.5

<P>
BEIJING, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Some 42,000 small factories
which were causing serious environmental pollution had been shut
down by October 7, in accordance with an order from the State
Council, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The factories make up nearly 80 percent of the total ordered
to be closed by September 30 by the State Council.
</P>
<P>
The closed factories were engaged in 15 seriously polluting
industries like chemical paper pulp-making, leather processing
and dye production.
</P>
<P>
The polluting factories were targeted because of their
primitive manufacturing techniques and equipment, excessive use of
resources, discharge of untreated waste and damage to the
environment.
</P>
<P>
The National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA) issued a
circular to each province, autonomous region and municipality last
month, requiring them to ensure the enterprises listed were shut
down.
</P>
<P>
So far, 24 provinces and municipalities have provided reports
to Nepa on the number of enterprises shut down in accordance with
the order, according to China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Of these 24 provinces and municipalities, five had shut down all
their listed enterprises. These were Beijing Municipality and
Jilin, Fujian, Hainan and Gansu provinces.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 12 (Xinhua) -- By the end of October or before
winter, all earthquake-displaced people in Baotou of Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region will be able to move into well-equipped
homes, and patients into hospitals, according to today's China
Daily.
</P>
<P>
Reconstruction also includes restoration of production
facilities and efforts to fulfill all economic targets set for
this year.
</P>
<P>
The earthquake, measuring 6.4 on the Richter scale, shook
Baotou on May 3, leaving 26 dead, about 400 injured and some 4.1
billion yuan ($493 million) in direct economic losses.
</P>
<P>
Some 135,000 homes for 500,000 people as well as 233 schools
and medical buildings totalling 124,000 square metres were damaged
along with water, gas and heat supply systems, infrastructure
facilities and factories.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Hu Zhong said that the rebuilt houses completed before
winter will be exempt from local taxes in a bid to quicken the
pace of home construction.
</P>
<P>
By the end of October, 1.35 million square meters of houses
will have been turned over to users and more than 3.5 million
square metres of houses consolidated.
</P>
<P>
The operation of urban infrastructural facilities including
water, gas, heat and electricity supplies is now normal, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
Most residents have moved into their houses. All students will
be accommodated in houses rather than in temporary shelters before
winter, with 660,000 square metres repaired or constructed by the
end of September.
</P>
<P>
Despite tight finances and a shortage of reconstruction funds,
local governments' priority investment was 22 million yuan (2.7
million US Dollars) in school construction.

Indurain, five-time winner of the Tour de France, retired from

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Government Regrets Situbondo Riots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
Friday expressed regret over riots in the East Java town of
Situbondo and its surrounding areas Thursday in which five people
were killed and 27 buildings burned down.
</P>
<P>
"The government hopes that religious leaders would continue to
nurture religious adherents," the Antara News Agency today quoted
State Minister/State Secretary Moerdiono as saying.
</P>
<P>
A crowd of nearly 3,000 people Thursday burned down churches,
office buildings, schools and orphanages in the riots which broke
out when people attending the trial of Saleh got angry as the
suspect was accused of humiliating Prophet Muhammad.
</P>
<P>
The riot began after the crowd was outraged by a court verdict
which sentenced Saleh, the leader of an obscure sect, to five
years in jail. Saleh was reported to have said Muhammad is not a
prophet.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Situbondo, 800 kilometers east of Jakarta, is
now under control, Moerdiono said.
</P>
<P>
The government would take measures against those involved in
the rampage, he added.
</P>
<P>
Freedom of religion was a basic human right, he said, calling
on the people not to be easily influenced by acts of provocation
and rumors.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Jobless Rates Goes Up to 9.9 Percent in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The employment decline, combined
with an increase of people in the labor force, drove up Canada's
jobless rate in September, Statistics Canada said today.
</P>
<P>
In September, 47,000 jobs vanished, leaving the national
jobless rate up to 9.9 percent from 9.4 percent in August. A total
of 1.51 million people were officially without work.
</P>
<P>
All of the employment losses were in the service industries,
the federal fact-gathering agency said. A drop of 70,000 jobs in
community, business and personal services wiped out all of the
employment gains so far this year in this industry.
</P>
<P>
However, employment increased by 20,000 in finance, insurance
and real estate, offsetting losses since last May.
</P>
<P>
The employment in manufacturing sector were virtually unchanged
in the month, the agency said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Exploratory talks between the
Philippine government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF)
have been tentatively set for November, The local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Anthony Dequina, vice chairman of the government peace panel,
said the panel was ready for the exploratory talks with the MILF
"in three weeks."
</P>
<P>
Al Haj Murad, the MILF's vice chairman in charge of military
affairs, said the front's central committee will meet this week to
form its own peace panel and submit the panel list to the
government.
</P>
<P>
The government has decided that the venue of the meeting would
be either in Cagayan De Oro city in the southern Philippines or
Cebu city in the central Philippines. The first was the MILF's
choice while the latter was Dequina's.
</P>
<P>
Dequina said that during the exploratory talks both panels
would draft "ground rules" which will be the basis for the
negotiations. He said he would stress the need to first enter
into a formal ceasefire agreement with the MILF before the formal
talks could start.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is a breakaway faction of the Moro National Liberation
Front (MNLF) and now the largest rebel group in the Philippines.
It has rejected a peace agreement signed between the government
and the MNLF last month to end a 24-year-old war in the main
southern island of Mindanao.

<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The Peruvian Congress passed a
bill today extending for one more year the role of faceless judges
in terrorist cases.
</P>
<P>
Oscar Medelius, president of the Commission of Justice of the
Congress, said there are still vestiges of terrorism that create
uneasiness in the population although terrorism is no longer a
factor of instability for the democratic system.
</P>
<P>
He said, therefore, faceless judges have not completed their
mission.
</P>
<P>
Besides, some terrorists have turned fugitives and as a result,
it is necessary to guarantee the security of the judges involved
in their trials.
</P>
<P>
This is the second extension of the role of faceless
judges. Some congressmen criticized the government for limiting
the mandate of the law, saying it shall be extended indefinitely.

<HEADLINE> Government Urged to Cut Spending on Tours </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Budget Bureau is
urging governmental bodies to spend less on arranging overseas
study tours for state officials to help curb government
expenditure and cut the country's huge deficit.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is suffering a significant current account deficit
partly because the government spent huge sums of money funding
overseas study tours for officials, said Seri Suksathaporn,
director of the bureau under the prime minister's office.
</P>
<P>
The Public Health, Education and University Affairs Ministries
as well as the House of Representatives ranked top on the list in
terms of the number of staff per trip, Sri was quoted as saying by
local newspapers.
</P>
<P>
The number of officials on overseas study tours should never
have reached 50 and 80 per trip, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry is proposing a plan to lower expenditure
for the fiscal year 1997 to 984 billion baht (about 39.4 billion
U.S. dollars), as the government's tax revenues may fail to reach
the target due to an economic slowdown in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry and the Budget Bureau are also considering
whether to cut the budget for military procurement, seri said.

<HEADLINE> Central American Countries Harden Criminal Penalties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Alarmed by an increase in
crimes, some Central American countries have decided to harden
penalties against criminals.
</P>
<P>
The El Salvador Legislative Assembly Wednesday approved the
capital punishment for perpetrators of assassination, kidnapping,
and rape, and life imprisonment for those who commit other
felonies.
</P>
<P>
The decision reflects the growing concern over the wave of
crimes that has struck the country in recent years.
</P>
<P>
In many cases the lawbreakers are former soldiers of the armed
forces and the guerrillas who find it difficult to return to civil
life after the end of the war that once divided the country for
more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
A Costa Rican legislative commission also approved this week an
amendment to two articles of the Constitution to apply life
imprisonment to certain crimes.
</P>
<P>
Public opinion revealed a general support for a hardening of
the penalties for hideous crimes.
</P>
<P>
Death penalty was the theme of an intense controversy in
Guatemala when two farm workers were convicted and executed for
raping and killing a four-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts attributed the increase in crimes directly to the
decline in the living standards of most people in the region.

<P>
WELLINGTON, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The first New Zealand
election under the Mixed Member Proportional system has drawn
enthusiasm from voters who flocked to polling stations shortly
after the stations opened this morning.
</P>
<P>
Over 3,000 stations are set up throughout New Zealand for the
2.65 million eligible voters. This means each station will receive
over 800 people during the voting hours running from 9 a.m. to 7
p.m. (20:00 to 06:00 GMT).
</P>
<P>
At the Northland School station for Wellington Central
electorate, staff said they had received about 40 voters in the
first half hour after the opening.
</P>
<P>
Not far away, the voting station in the Ward Memorial Church
Hall seemed to be busier. Staff there said in less than one hour,
around 100 people turned out. They included people over 70 years
of age, people walking with the help of their friends or relatives
and some arriving in wheelchairs.
</P>
<P>
Each voter is given a form with two lists on it, one for a
constituency candidate and the other for a party. The voter ticks
the lists on a booth with a screened table.
</P>
<P>
Grant Strachan from the Ministry of Justice said the polling
was supervised by his ministry and he was the deputy supervising
officer for the Ward Memorial Church Hall station.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the staff were volunteers, he said they were paid
by the ministry. "To be exact, by the taxpayers," he added.
</P>
<P>
The voting is also being monitored on spot by major political
parties. Present at the Ward Memorial Church were representatives
from the National Party, the Labor Party, the Alliance Party, the
Christian Coalition and the ACT New Zealand party. Some were also
visible at the Northland School station.
</P>
<P>
Wellington Central is expected to see a close battle among the
candidates from National, Labor and ACT NZ.
</P>
<P>
At the Pomare School station in the Rimutaka electorate, some
40 km north of Wellington city center, only representatives of
Labor and Alliance were monitoring the voting around noon time.
</P>
<P>
In less than five minutes, about a dozen people cast their
votes, most Maoris. Many of the residents in nearby areas are
Maoris, and the Labor candidate is considered to be the hopeful of
this electorate.
</P>
<P>
Radio NZ reported that nationally, voters started voting
earlier than expected. Probably they wanted to beat the bad
weather throughout the country today. Voter turnout seems to be
high with queues appearing at some stations, it said.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Hopes to Export More Textiles to ASEAN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Garment
Manufacturers Association is urging Thai textile exporters to turn
to ASEAN markets for the next five years due to low duties in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The call came following a slowdown in the country's textile and
garment exports and amid global economic growth during the first
six months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit Nimla-or, the association's president, said ASEAN has
huge potentials due to increased purchasing power. Singapore and
the Philippines have the potential to buy Thai goods.
</P>
<P>
He added that the free trade areas of ASEAN (the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations) provide low duties to member countries
and Thai goods can gain access to ASEAN markets without import
duties in the next five or 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The association and the government's Export Promotion
Department have drawn up three measures to help exporters make the
most of ASEAN markets.
</P>
<P>
The measures include identifying problems faced by exporters,
particularly by small and medium-sized enterprises; inviting
special ASEAN trade missions to Thai garment fairs; and providing
incentives to exporters who produce high-quality and high-end
products.

LONDON, October 11 (Xinhua) -- British Jon Jo Irwin won the
vacant Commonwealth featherweight boxing title here on Friday when
he outpointed Smith Odoom of Ghana in twelve rounds.
</P>
<P>
However, Irwin considered his half a point advantage, enough to
win the title, was not the right scoring in the bout against the
African southpaw champion.
</P>
<P>
But for the 27-year-old Briton, it was a sweet compensation for
his defeat in a British featherweight title showdown early.

<HEADLINE> China to Strengthen Supervision of Chinese Labor Working Overseas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 12 (Xinhua) -- China will strengthen
management of Chinese workers in the Commonwealth of Northern
Mariana Islands (CNMI).
</P>
<P>
Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation Minister Wu Yi made the
remarks in Beijing Friday when meeting with CNMI governor Froilan
Tenorio, according to today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
The Pacific islands are under the jurisdiction of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Of the 300,000 Chinese working in 180 countries and regions,
6,000 work in contracted projects in the islands.
</P>
<P>
"I feel sad that a small group of Chinese workers practise
misconducts in CNMI," the paper quoted Wu as saying.
</P>
<P>
She said that China would increase supervision of Chinese
workers through an enterprise association China established there,
educating the workers to perform under the laws of CNMI and the
United States, otherwise they will be sent back to China.
</P>
<P>
Tenorio said most Chinese workers did very good work and that
the "small group" were not those engaged in contracted projects
but were doing business in the islands.
</P>
<P>
CNMI welcomes more Chinese enterprises to invest there, he
says, adding that several Chinese firms are contracting the
construction of a five-star hotel which will bring an additional
1,400 workers to the islands.

YANGON, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar leader Maung Aye
stressed that endeavors are being made to ensure uniform progress

said on an inspection of Rakhine state in western Myanmar
Thursday.
</P>

government's goal.

<P>
Twelve national objectives have already been laid down
explicitly as the guidelines for developing the nation, he added.

He charged that "some individuals and organizations could not
bear to see progress and stability in the country because of their
craving for power or of personal hatred."

"The nation's own internal might must be firm and strong to
ward off and turn aside some big nations' bullying and

<HEADLINE> Companies and Distributors Pledged to Fight IPR Piracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Some 400 audio and video
companies and distributors have pledged to fight intellectual
property rights (IPR) Piracy, and it is already having an effect,
according to today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
"The ratio of copyright audio and video products in the market
has been improved," said Li Yuanchao, vice-minister of culture,
which monitors the audio and video market.
</P>
<P>
Last month, audio and video manufactures promised not to sell
copyright numbers. Distributors agreed to abide by IPR protection
laws and not to deal in illegally produced or illegally imported
and pirated products.
</P>
<P>
The industry's pledge to clean up its image was made at a
National Fair of Audio and Video Products in September.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, Chinese courts have adjudicated 90 percent of the
18,637 IPR cases, 2,551 of their 3,025 patent cases, and nearly
20,000 trade-mark infringement cases including 1,362
foreign-related ones.
</P>
<P>
China's customs have also helped to protect famous foreign
trademarks.
</P>
<P>
As a result of effective curbing of IPR piracy, most
state-owned audio and video manufacturers and distributors who
used to be badly affected by violations enjoyed an improved
marketing situation.
</P>
<P>
In the past two months, the Zhejiang Literature and Art Audio
and Video Publishing House distributed 59,000 tapes and 10,000
video compact disks, nearly half of those distributed all of last
year.
</P>
<P>
"By protecting intellectual property rights we protect our own
interests," Li said.

<HEADLINE> Thai Officials Said to Cause Business Delays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's bureaucratic system
is the first thing the new government must reform to improve the
country's business climate, according to a Thai Chamber of
Commerce survey.
</P>
<P>
About 80 percent of respondents to the chamber's questionnaire,
distributed to 500 provincial chamber members, complained that
government officials were the main cause of delays in getting
things done.
</P>
<P>
The respondents complained that government officials normally
ignore many cabinet decisions because they know government changes
frequently.
</P>
<P>
To avoid delays, the chamber suggested, ministerial
announcements could be used to change many laws related to
business, rather than the more time-consuming process of formal
amendments.
</P>
<P>
Chamber Secretary Jirayuth Vasurat said the private sector
wanted the government to urgently solve problems affecting
exports, which account for more than 70 percent of the national
economy.
</P>
<P>
The chamber also urged the government to review a regulation
that requires exporters to place bank guarantees with the Customs
Department when importing raw materials.
</P>
<P>
The money is not refunded until they export finished products.
</P>
<P>
This regulation caused cash-flow problems for small and
medium-sized companies, taking away capital which they could have
used to expand business.
</P>
<P>
The chamber also urged the new government, to be formed after
the November 17 general election, to reduce tariff rates on
imported raw materials to between zero and 5 percent and to cut
costs of export-oriented products.

<HEADLINE> Strong Ukraine Conducive to Peace: Communique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, October 11 (Xinhua) -- A Europe and Atlantic-bound,
strong, flexible and independent Ukraine is conducive to peace,
prosperity and stability, a communique of a U.S.-Ukraine
consultative committee said today.
</P>
<P>
The communique, which was released after a two-day meeting of
the committee in Kiev, included concerted views of the two sides
on European security, proposals of the two governments on
enhancing relations between Ukraine and NATO and priorities in
Ukraine's economic reform, foreign trade and investment policy.
</P>
<P>
It urged the Ukrainian government and parliament to form an
unequivocal stand on NATO and set down Kiev's principles as a
neutral state.
</P>
<P>
The document stressed the necessity of deepening Ukraine's
economic reform.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the committee, Zbigniew Brzezinski, told a news
conference that his committee has changed Washington's indifferent
attitude toward Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
A Ukrainian Foreign Ministry official said the committee has
urged the U.S. to offer more aid to Kiev.
</P>
<P>
The committee was established in 1994 under the suggestion of
Brzezinski, former assistant to U.S. president on national
security affairs. It is aimed at designing blueprints for
Ukraine's transfer to the market economy and the establishment of
democracy and enhance "strategic partnership" between the two
countries.

<HEADLINE> US Court Order Not to Harm Thai Shrimp Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 12 (Xinhua) -- It is good news for Thai shrimp
farmers and exporters when the US clarified that its imports of
Thai farmed shrimp will not be affected.
</P>
<P>
US embassy officials have clarified that the Tuesday decision
of the US Court of International Trade will prohibit only the
import of wild shrimps as a measure to protect endangered sea
turtles.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday the US National Fisheries Institute said that the
court order would affect imports of both wild and farmed shrimps
from Thailand, where the claim caused enormous concern.
</P>
<P>
Thailand exports about 17 billion baht (680 million US dollars)
of farmed shrimps and 5 billion baht (200 million dollars) of wild
shrimps to the US annually.
</P>
<P>
Thailand hopes to be able to export wild shrimps to the US soon
as Thai ships are in the process of installing turtle excluder
devices to assist turtles to escape from nets once they are
caught.
</P>
<P>
Thailand now loses about 300 million baht (12 million dollars)
a month because of the wild shrimp import ban.
</P>
<P>
The court ruled on October 8 that the US will ban importation
of wild shrimp unless the US has certified that the exporting
country has a sea turtle protection program.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Nepali Parliament Concludes 10th Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali parliament has
concluded its 10th session after ratifying a landmark Nepal-India
water sharing treaty and witnessing a minister's resignation.
</P>
<P>
The session of the 265-member legislature, starting nearly four
months ago, was hailed Friday as a success by parliament and
government leaders mainly for its approval of the Mahakali Border
River Development Treaty between Nepal and India.
</P>
<P>
Concluding the parliament session, Lower House Speaker Ram
Chandra Poudel said that the ratification of the Nepal-India
treaty is an important achievement not only for the parliament
session but also in the history of the country.
</P>
<P>
The treaty has paved the way for the development of the
country's abundant water resources, he told parliament.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba in his speech to the powerful
Lower House spoke highly of the national consensus reached between
major political parties in parliament over the ratification of the
treaty.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his belief that this precedent would help build up
future national consensus on issues of national interest, Deuba
called for cooperation from opposition parties in formulating the
forthcoming ninth development plan and keeping the country's
administrative and educational sectors free from politics.
</P>
<P>
The Nepal-India treaty on integrated development of the
Mahakali river was ratified by both houses of the Nepali
parliament on September 20 after it was signed in New Delhi by
Deuba and his then Indian counterpart P.V. Narasimha Rao last
February.
</P>
<P>
Nepali officials have hailed the treaty as a watershed in water
resources development cooperation between Nepal and India, arguing
it lays down principles of cost and benefit sharing in the border
river development on an equal basis.
</P>
<P>
Despite strong voices against the treaty in and outside
parliament, the main opposition Communist Party of Nepal (united
Marxist Leninist, CPN-UML) played a crucial role in ratifying the
treaty with a majority of the party's MPs voting for it.
</P>
<P>
However, CPN-UML president and parliamentary party leader Man
Mohan Adhikari Friday regretted that the treaty was ratified in
the current session.
</P>
<P>
"I still have strong reservations over the way the Mahakali
treaty was so hastily put to vote. The treaty is more of a
priority for India than for Nepal," he told parliament.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-UML party had demanded for more time for parliamentary
discussion on the treaty but the government insisted on presenting
it to parliament for ratification during the session.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali parliament during the just concluded session also
saw the resignation of finance minister Ram Shan Mahat on moral
grounds as demanded by opposition MPs after the revelation of his
secret personal dollar account in a US bank.
</P>
<P>
Nepal's foreign exchange regulations act prohibits any Nepali
national living in the country from holding foreign bank accounts
unless permitted by the central bank.
</P>
<P>
During the over 100-day session, parliament passed 32 bills
including the bill on consumers' rights and one to end the dual
land ownership in the country, parliamentary sources said.
</P>
<P>
But the much-debated bill on women's equal property rights was
not even tabled during the session due to the government's delay
in completing the draft papers, they said.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Deuba Friday promised that the property rights
bill would be introduced to the next parliament session expected
to be convened by next March.

TOKYO, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Japanese digital satellite
broadcasters and receiver manufacturers have been asked by the
telecom ministry to adopt common receiver, a business daily

<P>
PerfecTV started providing its service this month through about

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Malaysia's CPO, Tin &AMP; Rubber Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Crude palm oil
(CPO), tin and rubber markets closed this week mixed with CPO
lower, tin higher and rubber mixed.
</P>
<P>
CPO physicals ended the week sharply lower in a listless market
as players were sidelined ahead of the Palm Oil Registration and
Licensing Authority's (PORLA) production and stock figures to be
released next week.
</P>
<P>
The market was flat for three consecutive days as trading was
focused on the performance of futures contracts traded on the
Kuala Lumpur Commodity Exchange (KLCE).
</P>
<P>
Prices were almost unchanged and hovered around the 1,180
ringgit (about 472 U.S. dollars) per ton range on absence of
players and fresh leads.
</P>
<P>
October South was traded at 1,170 ringgit (about 468 U.S.
dollars) per ton against 1,190 ringgit (about 476 U.S. dollars)
last week.
</P>
<P>
However, the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM) closed higher this
week on improved buying support but gains were limited in the
absence of significant market indicators.
</P>
<P>
The presence of Japanese buyers in the market on Friday, served
as additional support to aid the market's uptrend coupled with the
better performance on the London Metal Exchange (LME) which had a
spillover effect on the local front.
</P>
<P>
The metal rose seven sen to 14.93 ringgit (5.972 U.S. dollars)
per kg from 14.86 ringgit (about 5.944 U.S. dollars) per kg last
week, after starting flat this week with demand and supply at par.
</P>
<P>
Accumulative turnover narrowed to 370 tons from 411 tons last
week.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Malaysian rubber market closed mixed this week
with players sidelined and cautious with the uncertainty looming
with forecast of rainy weather until next month dampening
sentiment.
</P>
<P>
November RSS One dropped 2.5 sen to end the week at 310.50 sen
(about 124.2 U.S. cents) per kg while SMR 20 perked half-a-sen to
306 sen (about 122.4 U.S. cents) per kg.
</P>
<P>
The rubber market started on a weaker note and continued its
bearishness for two consecutive days, in tandem with softer
regional markets. But, sentiment rebounded on short covering
activities on the back of a technical correction as prices had
almost bottomed out.
</P>
<P>
Expectations that prices would from now on begin to pick up
prompted active buying.
</P>
<P>
Enquiries for SMR grade rubber emanating from China helped
values recover but gains were limited with the closure of Japanese
markets for a holiday on Thursday.

to be a favorite for Japanese fund managers as other markets in
the region were not doing very well.
</P>
<P>
On the Main Board, turnover decreased to 706.041 million
shares valued at 4.710 billion ringgit (about 1.884 billion U.S.
dollars) against last week's 733.461 million shares worth 5.308

<HEADLINE> Germany to Reduce Federal Assembly Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The German parliament today
adopted a resolution calling for a 10.6 percent cut of the Federal
Assembly (Bunderstag) members, which will reduce its parliament
members from 672 to 598 as of the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
This move was passed by a majority of the ruling coalition,
including the Christian Democratic Union, the Christian Social
Union and the Free Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
The ruling coalition said that this reduction will help both
save expenditure and make the Federal Assembly more efficient.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Federal Assembly is the largest among the lower
houses of all Western countries. Britain's House of Commons has
651 members, Italy's Chamber of Deputies 630, France's National
Assembly 577, Canada's House of Commons 295. and even the U.S.
House of Representatives has only 435 lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
The German press welcomed this reform, describing it as "a
small step in the right direction". Some critics said that the
overstaffed legislative body should have been simplified earlier.
</P>
<P>
Under the German Constitution, the Federal Assembly is the
supreme legislative body of the country and consists of 672
lawmakers, among which 372 are produced by direct election.
</P>
<P>
However, many controversial problems concerning parliamentary
reform, such as election system and the division of
constituencies, have remained unresolved.

<HEADLINE> FAO Makes Progress in Drafting Summit Documents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 11 (Xinhua) -- A committee of the United Nations
Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) today claimed progress in
drafting the final documents for the World Food Summit.
</P>
<P>
The proposed documents are known as the Rome Declaration and Plan
of Action, which will be adopted by heads of state and government
when they gather in Rome on November 13 for the five-day summit.
</P>
<P>
"Significant results have been achieved," the Chairman of the
Committee on World Food Security (CFS), Pedro Rojas, told the FAO
Council.
</P>
<P>
Rojas said that the CFS, designated as the preparatory body for
the summit, has made "important progress" in preparing the
documents.
</P>
<P>
FAO Director-General Jacques Diouf said that the committee
managed to reduce the number of brackets in the texts still in
question from almost 800 to 176 in nine working days.
</P>
<P>
The council agreed to meet again at the FAO headquarters in
Rome on October 28-30 to complete work on the documents.
</P>
<P>
Diouf urged countries and regional groups to carry out active
consultations to remove the remaining obstacles.
</P>
<P>
The CFS are drawing on recommendations from FAO members,
non-governmental organizations' regional consultations and various
other U.N. agencies to prepare the texts of the declaration and
plan of action.
</P>
<P>
By adopting the two documents, world leaders will reaffirm
their commitment to the goal of "food for all" and agree to
specific actions involving all sectors of society for achieving
the goal.

WELLINGTON, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Polls closed for New
Zealand's first election under the new Mixed Member Proportional
(MMP) system at 7 pm (0600 GMT) today and counting began
immediately afterwards.
</P>
<P>
Radio New Zealand said reports from the returning offices
around the country indicate a high turnout with over 90 percent of
the voters having cast their ballots.
</P>
<P>
However, counting could take a longer time this year than in
the last election in 1993 because of each voter cast two votes
this time instead of only one in the previous elections.
</P>
<P>
The reports said the final results are expected to come out
much later than before, possibly after midnight.
</P>
<P>
The high turnout is seen as good news for the left-wing parties
as traditionally they had problems to get their voters out. As a
result, the Labor Party and the Alliance could benefit.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves Two-Year Stand-By Credit for Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The international Monetary
Fund (IMF) today approved a 24-month stand-by credit for Egypt
equivalent to some 391 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The credit is offered in support of the Government's economic
and financial reform program.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Government's 1996-98 program is aimed at achieving
a further increase in real GDP growth to about five percent in
1997-98, a further decrease in inflation to about six percent, and
maintenance of a viable external position. The external current
account deficit is projected to shift from approximate balance in
1995-96 to a deficit of about one percent of GDP in each of the
program years, reflecting the anticipated strong growth of imports
driven by the recovery and higher investments.
</P>
<P>
However, in view of Egypt's present strong international
reserve position, the Government does not intend to draw on the
stand-by credit, said an IMF press release.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is a founding member of the IMF, signed the Articles of
the Agreement on December 27, 1945. Its quota is about 976 million
U.S. dollars equivalent and its outstanding use of IMF credit
currently totals about 24 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Corporate India Faces Cash Crunch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Indian businesses have been
facing a cash crunch since last year and such a situation is
expected to continue for some time to come.
</P>
<P>
Economic experts in the country said that in the short run,
there might not be any way out from the current situation and due
to lack of growing fund requirement, industrial growth is likely
to further slow down.
</P>
<P>
Analyzing the present scenario, Indian Council for Research on
International Economic Relations Chairman R. N. Malhotra said that
although growth in money supply was substantially higher at 3.9
percent in 1996 as against the 1.4 percent last year, the tight
cash situation in the market would continue for the next few
months.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the overall situation has become more complex
now and the Reserve Bank of India could not tackle it by simply
providing more money.
</P>
<P>
Expressing a similar view, chief economist at the National
Council of Applied Economic Research Shashnka Bhinde said
corporate India would have to burn their fingers for the next six
to seven months.
</P>
<P>
"There is no easy way out at this moment because the huge fund
requirement from the government and high interest rate will create
more liquidity problems," he said.
</P>
<P>
The industrial growth in the first four months of the current
financial year ending March 31, 1997, took a tumble, registering a
growth of only 5.8 percent, less than half the 13.2-percent
increase a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Under this situation, the government started reassessing the
prospects for achieving the targeted 6.6-percent growth in GDP in
1996-97.

HARARE, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe fully supports the
strengthening of African cooperation in defence through joint
training and exchange of information among defence forces of the
region.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a graduation ceremony held here on Friday,
Zimbabwean Defence Minister Moven Mahachi said the development of
defence forces will make it easy for the United Nations and the
Organisation of African Unity to assemble a pan-African army for
peacekeeping in the region.
</P>
<P>
Joint training and exchange of information among the defence
forces of the region will help to create mutual understanding
which is a key element in the establishment and promotion of
regional cooperation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Twentysix people from defence forces of Zimbabwe, Zambia,
Botswana, Namibia and Tanzania were awarded certificates after
completing a 12-week junior staff course held at the school of
academic and staff training.
</P>
<P>
Mahachi said that the joint participation in the course by
junior staff from the five countries means that a uniform
approach to defence issues is being fostered in the region and
such a move is central to the creation of a common region
approach to defence issues.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Mexico Reach Agreement Over Tomato Trade Disputes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The United States and Mexico
today reached an agreement over tomato export into this country,
defusing a major trade dispute between the two neighboring
countries of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Commerce announced the proposed
agreement, which suspends an anti-dumping case brought by U.S.
tomato growers and the Florida Department of Agriculture. However,
a final agreement should be announced by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
The proposal will allow continued shipments of Mexican tomatoes
into this country, especially during the winter months, but at a
price floor comparable to the minimum that Florida growers say
they need to make a living.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Mexican tomatoes cannot enter this country
at less than 21 cents a pound.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement will provide strong relief to the tomato growers
in Florida and other states, and help preserve jobs in the
industry," stated U.S. Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor, adding
that "Mexican growers will have continued access to the U.S.
market, but only on fair terms."
</P>
<P>
Floridian growers complained that Mexico was flooding the
market with cheap tomatoes, undercutting U.S. prices and putting
domestic growers out of business. They made an anti-dumping case
to the Department which could cause trade sanctions.

<HEADLINE> 7 Arrested on Charges of Militia Bomb Plot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) Friday detained seven members of a West
Virginia militia group for allegedly plotting to blow up the
bureau's complex and transporting explosives.
</P>
<P>
The bureau said the seven planned to blow up the FBI facility
in Clarksburg, West Virginia, that houses its fingerprint and
background records and employs some 2,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the anti-government West Virginia Mountaineer
Militia, Floyd Raymond Looker, was arrested Friday morning and
charged with transporting explosives across the West Virginia
state line from Pennsylvania, conspiring to manufacture
explosives, and for targeting the FBI's sprawling Clarksburg
facility for destruction.
</P>
<P>
The FBI said the other six were arrested in West Virginia, Ohio
and Pennsylvania after 16 months of investigation into the head of
the militia group.
</P>
<P>
The arrests were the latest in a series of episodes involving
militant anti-government groups since 1995.
</P>
<P>
Timothy McVeigh, a Gulf War veteran who has been linked to
right-wing militia groups, and his Army friend Terry Nichols have
been charged with the 1995 bombing of the Oklahoma City federal
building that killed 168 people.
</P>
<P>
In June, the FBI negotiated the end of a long standoff with the
anti-government Freemen group, which had been holed up on a
Montana ranch.
</P>
<P>
In July, the federal authorities charged 12 members of an
Arizona group with conspiring to blow up federal and local
government buildings in the Phoenix area.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Imports Fuel To Meet Domestic Demands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government will
spend 60 billion Kwacha (48 million U.S.Dollars) to import
petroleum products from abroad to meet the national requirements.
</P>
<P>
this was revealed by Minister of Energy and Water Development
Edith Nawakwi in parliament on Friday.
</P>
<P>
She said that the recently persistent fuel shortage in the
country was caused by the marooned crude oil in Tanzania's Dar es
Salaam Port and the planned closure of Zambia's Indeni Oil
Refinery.
</P>
<P>
Nawakwi told parliament that a committee headed by secretary
to the cabinet Aldridge Adamson has been formed to monitor the
imports expected to cover a period of 45 days beginning October
14 when Indeni shut down.
</P>
<P>
A tanker with petroleum to Zambia has been stuck at the Dar es
Salaam Port since August 23 not off-loaded because of the repair
works being carried out on the off-loading single point mooring
by the Tanzania Harbor Authority.
</P>
<P>
The imports of 45 stock days are required to sustain normal
supply to consumers, nawakwi said.
</P>
<P>
Zambia railways and TAZARA have been mobilized to uplift
imports from South Africa, Zimbabwe and Tanzania and rail tankers
ill be used to ensure large quantities of fuel are brought into
the country at a lesser cost, according to the minister.

<HEADLINE> New Ethics Fostered in China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, October 12 (Xinhua) -- University lecturer Li Changzu
in east China's Zhejiang Province was amazed when a series of
weekend lectures were organized on the weighty subject of ethics.
</P>
<P>
So popular is his newly-opened course at Zhejiang Industrial
University, that it has attracted crowds of students.
</P>
<P>
Even the weekend timeslot is no deterrent, with the lecture room
full and some of the audience having to stand in the corridors.
</P>
<P>
"Basic knowledge of socialist ethics and protocol will help
students with self-cultivation, and establish good relationships
with other people," said Li Changzu, the lecturer who is excited
at the success of the course, and the large audience it has
attracted.
</P>
<P>
According to Li, the education in ethics, which is being
increasingly popularized in major cities, profiles the country's
cultivation of new ethics, by combining traditional ethics of
having a strong sense of obligation and paying little attention to
personal interest, with the practical economic results under a
socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
Li's course mirrors the call at the most recently-held Sixth
Plenum of the 14th Central Committee of the Communist Party of
China (CPC). The plenum wants to see marked progress in socialist
ethics among the population at large.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Fazhen, deputy dean of the department of philosophy and
sociology at Hangzhou University, and member of the Chinese
Society of Ethics, said that the new view of values, including
fair competition, an enterprising spirit, and survival of the
fittest, has become the main trend in the ideology and morality of
Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
"This indicates that the moral accomplishments of Chinese
people have been improved," he said.
</P>
<P>
A sample survey in Zhejiang Province showed that 98 percent of
the people questioned agreed that proper profit gained by
individuals through fair competition is irreproachable.

<HEADLINE> Over 10 Southern Lebanese Villagers Wounded in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 12 (Xinhua) -- More than 10 civilians were
wounded in a fierce Israeli bombardment on southern Lebanese
villages opposite the Israeli self-proclaimed "security zone"
Friday night, the official Radio Lebanon reported.
</P>
<P>
In its last news broadcast for Friday at midnight (22:00 GMT),
the state-run radio said that the Israeli occupation forces in the
border strip shelled a number of villages, especially Safad
Al-Batikh.
</P>
<P>
"More than 10 citizens in Safad Al-Batikh were wounded in
the bombardment, in addition to three houses destroyed and
over six others damaged in the same village," the radio
noted.
</P>
<P>
"Those seriously wounded were hospitalized in the southern
Lebanese port city of Saida when others were sent to a
hospital in Tibnin," it added.
</P>
<P>
Israeli military helicopters hovered over the vicinities of
Kfar Yatir, Serbin and Wadi Beitlif around 11:00 p.m. (21:00
GMT), according to the official Lebanese National News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He said that Israeli warplanes also carried out frequent
reconnaissance flights over the middle sector of south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The government-owned radio said that the Jewish state, by
carrying out the bombardment, violated an April cease-fire
understanding.
</P>
<P>
Brokered by the United States, the understanding put an end to
a 17-day Israeli blitz against guerrillas of the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah, or Party of God, in south Lebanon. According to the
accord, both the Israeli forces and Lebanese guerrillas are
banned from attacking civilians.
</P>
<P>
The bombardment could very likely draw retaliatory attack from
Hezbollah guerrillas against the Israeli forces in the occupied
buffer zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In response to the Israeli bombardment, the Lebanese
government is expected to lodge a complaint with a cease-fire
monitoring committee comprising the United States, France, Syria,
Lebanon and Israel, which was set up by the April cease-fire
understanding.
</P>
<P>
Hit-and run attacks by Moslem guerrillas on the one hand and
Israeli bombardments and air strikes on the other have
constituted a daily scene on the last active battlefront of the
Arab-Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
Twenty Israeli soldiers have been killed by Hezbollah
guerrillas in south Lebanon since the beginning of this
year.

<HEADLINE> New Ethics Fostered in China  (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nevertheless, not all the people accept the new ethics.
</P>
<P>
Chen Huiqin, a retired teacher in politics in Shanghai, still
cherishes the fond memory of the good old days in the 1950s, when
people helped each other, showed a high public spirit, and paid
little interest in fame and gain.
</P>
<P>
"I do not wish China to become a society where money comes
first, just like in a number of Western countries," she said.
</P>
<P>
To form a new ethics system, which reflects the nature of
socialism, such as equality, unity, mutual help, friendship and
progress, and the pattern of market economy, the Chinese
Government has placed the development of advanced socialist
culture and ethics as important as economic growth.
</P>
<P>
It has launched a package of activities, including the "Hope
Project", "Young Volunteers' Action", "Selection of Families which
have harmonious relationships among family members and neighbors
and made contributions to the society", and "Promise of Social
Service."
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of people have attended the activities, which
have benefited both citizens and society.
</P>
<P>
The "Hope Project" has received approximately 700 million yuan
in donations, and built more than 2,000 schools, enrolling 1.2
million dropout school children over the past six years.
</P>
<P>
More than 10 million young people have joined "Young
Volunteers' Action", which started in 1993, and taken care of the
orphaned and disabled.
</P>
<P>
But, according to sociologists, there is still a long way to go
in the improvement of ethical accomplishments in the Chinese
nation as a whole.
</P>
<P>
"The urgent matter at present is to critically inherit the
traditional ethics of the Chinese nation, to boldly absorb the
cream of the world's civilization, and to streamline the sense of
values to form a standard of ethical behaviors in compliance with
the development of socialist market economy," one sociologist
said.

DAR ES SALAAM, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Great Lakes Regional
leaders will meet in the Tanzanian city of Arusha later today to
review the impact of the economic embargo imposed on Burundi since
last July.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's "Daily News" today quoted a senior official from
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation as
saying that the summit is likely to decide to maintain sanctions,
saying easing the sactions could backpaddle developments in
Burumbura.

<P>
"This is the right time to tighten the noose and force the
military junta in Bujumbura comply with all the terms before the
sanctions are lifted," said the official in Arusha on Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said the sanctions had already sent right signals to the
military junta led by Major Pierre Buyoya which seized power on
July 25, this year.
</P>
<P>
The re-opening of the Naional Assembly and unbanning of
political parties were not enough, said the official. "What is
needed is unconditional return to a constitutional government,"
he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Corporate India Faces Cash Crunch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Recent Industry Ministry
figures show that except for capital goods and intermediates, 24
major industries are on a downward path.
</P>
<P>
A wide range of industrial sectors including power, steel,
fertilizers, crude oil, sugar, jute and ferro-alloys recorded a
slowdown in growth rate.
</P>
<P>
The industrial circles feel that there will be difficulty in
maintaining industrial production growth at over 12 percent this
year.
</P>
<P>
While the slower growth in industrial production is largely
attributed to the cash crunch, another noted economist D.
Panandikar, however, viewed the entire episode from a different
angle.
</P>
<P>
The real problem lay in the inaccessible creditable fund, he
argued. Money is available from banks and financial institutions,
but because of the high cost of credit, industry is not able to
utilize that fund, thus creating problems.
</P>
<P>
He added that although bank credit to some extent has been
eased in the last few months, the government could bail out
corporate India only by taking long-term measures.
</P>
<P>
V. R. Panchmukhi, a research and information director, said one
of the measures would be a declining rate of cost of credit and
the Reserve Bank of India would have to take some immediate
measures in this respect.
</P>
<P>
As the rising cost of funding has led to shrinking avenues of
corporate financing and adversely affected the growth and
competitiveness of Indian industry, Secretary General V.
Raghuraman of the Associated Chamber of Commerce and Industry of
India suggested that the domestic savings rate should be increased
for a better cash flow in the market.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested additional measures toward easing the
monetary policy by further reducing the cash reserve ratio and the
statutory liquidity ratio.

The paper quoted a diplomat at the Ukrainian Embassy here as
saying that the relations between Ukraine and Turkey were good,
but Turkish businessmen had yet to find their way into the huge
market in Ukraine.
</P>

The official said that the trade volume between Turkey and
Ukraine in 1995 totaled roughly one billion U.S. dollars by
official figure, but that the unofficial figure (which included
suitcase trading) put the trade volume twice as big.
</P>
<P>
He said that European countries were investing in Ukraine,
indicating that the country was in the process of
privatization and that Turkish firms had to act quickly if
they wanted a share of the developing market in Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine has aspired to join the European Union and signed a
cooperation and partnership agreement to that end. The country is
planning to establish a Ukrainian free trade area with the EU.

said.
</P>
<P>
Lord arrived here on October 10 for a three-day visit aimed at
coordinating policy on the DPRK with South Korean officials.
</P>
<P>
South Korea has said that a group of armed DPRK people
"infiltrated" into the country's Kangwon province from a grounded
submarine in the East Sea (Sea of Japan) on September 18.
</P>
<P>
So far, 11 DPRK men were found to have killed themselves, 11
were killed by South Korean troops and one was captured alive.
Three are reportedly still missing.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK has said that the submarine, while on a training mission,
drifted after having an engine trouble and hitting a rock in the sea.
</P>
<P>
However, Seoul claimed that the case of the intrusion was not
an "inadvertent incident that occurred during routine training" as
Pyongyang said, but was a "carefully premediated act of provocation."
</P>
<P>
The DPRK has repeatedly threatened to take retaliatory steps
against South Korea for the killing of DPRK people who "landed
ashore in South Korea due to the engine trouble of the submarine."
</P>
<P>
The Gong-Lord statement said that both sides agreed to stay
"vigilant against any further provocation" from the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
In the meeting on Friday, Gong and Lord claimed that
the DPRK has to "pay the price for its submarine infiltration."
</P>
<P>
In another development, the South Korean National Assembly
adopted a resolution here today, urging Pyongyang to immediately
stop "provocation maneuvers" against Seoul.
</P>
<P>
Today's resolution is the second of its kind after the parliament
passed a previous one on September 23, five days after the submarine
incident took place.

TIANJIN, October 12 (Xinhua) -- A record 1.65 billion US
dollars was funneled into the Tianjin Development Zone in northern
China during the first nine months of this year.

From the very beginning this year, the zone has placed priority
on improving its investment environment. It spent 500 million yuan
(60 million US dollars) to expand the capacity of a
water-processing plant and an electric power plant, and complete

country.
</P>

During the '96 Urumqi Economic Fair held in the Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region in early September, the zone signed 108 project
contracts with investors, and did a business volume of 800 million
yuan involving 300 types of products. A majority of the goods went

KUWAIT CITY, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The Kuwaiti National
Assembly is expected to have a new speaker, local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Editor-in-Chief of Local English daily Arab Times, Ahmed
Al-Jarallah, wrote an article carried in the paper today, saying
that the next speaker of the National Assembly will be Jassem
Al-Khorafi, who has so far been the only challenger to incumbent
speaker Ahmad Al-Saadoun.
</P>
<P>
Al-Khorafi owns a vast business empire and served as finance
minister for several years.
</P>
<P>
The next period is very sensitive in terms of the Kuwaiti
economy because it may need the adoption of some decisions that
could affect people's income and job opportunities, observers here
noted.
</P>
<P>
The small but oil-rich emirate now faces economic problems such
as the eradication of budget deficit, tax adjustments,
privatization, diversification of revenue sources.
</P>
<P>
Islamists and their supporters as well as pro-government
moderates emerged as the major winners in Monday's
elections. Liberals have suffered a crushing defeat with only
four winning the elections compared with 9 seats in the previous
elections.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti next parliament, the eighth and second post-Gulf War
parliament, would be the most conservative parliament in the
nation's short democratic history, observers here noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Medical teams in China's
capital, Beijing, have found a new way of beating traffic jams as
they head to the homes of their patients.
</P>
<P>
They have introduced tricycles for their home visits around the
narrow hutongs (or lanes) of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The pedal-power doctors and nurses use their three wheelers to
carry medical equipment and instruments on their daily rounds.
</P>
<P>
The new service has been launched by Beijing Beixinqiao
Hospital for nearby residents, especially elderly people.
</P>
<P>
The tricycle medical teams have already treated some 1,000
patients in their homes since the service started.
</P>
<P>
Their services include internal medicine, surgery, bone
injuries, acupuncture, traditional Chinese medicine, massage,
electrocardiograms and ultrasonic tests.
</P>
<P>
With the number of elderly people rising, many patients
expressed the hope that medical workers can offer treatment at
home.
</P>
<P>
A survey carried out by the Beixinqiao neighborhood committee
has shown that more than 3,000 out of the 10,000 people above the
age of 60 want to receive medical treatment in their own homes.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Amir Appoints Crown Prince to Form New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Crown Prince and
former Prime Minister Sheikh Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah was
appointed today by Kuwaiti Amir Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah to
form the next cabinet five days after the legislative elections in
the country.
</P>
<P>
The former cabinet resigned Tuesday in the wake of declaration
of the parliamentary elections' results in line with the
constitution of the country, but has kept running the affairs of
the country.
</P>
<P>
It has been an established norm in Kuwait that the crown prince
holds at the same time the post of the prime minister. This has
not been changed since Kuwait's independence and start of
parliamentary democracy in 1962.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti cabinet includes 16 members. They enjoy the right to
take part in discussions and vote on all important issues in the
50-member parliament.
</P>
<P>
Official sources earlier said that consultations showed some
new faces may join the cabinet as a number of former cabinet
ministers who joined the government a short while before the Iraqi
invasion in 1990 will be called to participate in the new cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The new cabinet, according to the sources, will include fewer
politicians than the previous one. The formation will most likely
respond to the aspirations of the people who want to have a strong
and practical government concentrating more on economic
matters.

<HEADLINE> Mozambicans Urged To Be Cooperated in Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano has called on the Mozambican people to cooperate with
the police in fighting and checking the rampant crimes in the
country.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with the representatives from the Mozambique
Labourers' Organization on Friday, President Chissano noted that
the crime rate had reached an alarming extent in Mozambique,
especially in the capital Maputo.
</P>
<P>
The president praised the patrotics showed by the police in
combating crime, saying the Mozambican police, defying material
and financial difficulties facing them, had done a great job in
combating and checking crimes, reported the local paper
"Noticias" today.
</P>
<P>
But the president said that corruption has eroded the image
of the police and the confidence from the people.
</P>
<P>
According to President Chissano, the high crime rate in the
country has rendered the investment in and foreign cooperation
with Mozambique suspended.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, the Labor Committee of the Mozambique Economic
Association sent a ultimatum to the government, warning that it
would call for a nationwide workers' strike if the government
fails to take emergent steps to combat crime.

<HEADLINE> IMF Endorses Egypt's New Economic Reform Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) has endorsed Egypt's new two-year economic reform program,
which takes effect today.
</P>
<P>
The board of directors of the IMF approved the program at a
meeting in Washington Friday, the Cairo press reported today.
</P>
<P>
With the endorsement of the program, which is the third stage
of Egypt's economic reform, the Paris Club will write off Egypt's
third part of its foreign debts to Western creditor nations, which
is about 4 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The new economic reform program is aimed at encouraging
investment, expanding the role of the private sector in the
country's economic development, providing job opportunities and
increasing the economic growth rate, according to a statement
issued by the board of directors of the IMF.
</P>
<P>
The statement hailed the Egyptian economic reform since its
inception in 1991, saying that Egypt has managed to make a headway
in consolidating its financial position and building an open,
market oriented and decentralized economy.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1996-98 program, the statement said, Egypt will try
to raise the annual growth rate of gross domestic product (GDP) to
about 5 percent and cut down inflation to about 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
To support the implementation of the program, the IMF will
appropriate 271.4 million SDR (391 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Egypt has carried out two stages of its economic reform since
1991, when it signed an agreement with the IMF on the economic
reform, achieving positive results in reducing inflation and
budget deficit as well as developing economy.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Agricultural cooperation is
increasing between Taiwan and the remote Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
Statistics through the end of June show that there were 71
agricultural projects by Taiwan investors in Guangxi, and
agreements involving about 74 million U.S. dollars of investment.
</P>
<P>
Investment areas ranged from crop planting, breeding of aquatic
products, animal husbandry and the processing of agricultural
products.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said that the increased agricultural
cooperation between the two areas across the Taiwan Straits has
been encouraged by frequent agro-scientific exchanges, and also
because the two areas have the same sub-tropical climate and the
agricultural cooperation of Guangxi and Taiwan is complementary.
</P>
<P>
Other areas for cooperation and development listed by the
Taiwan investors include sugarcane planting and sugar processing,
freshwater and offshore breeding, fruit growing, and high-tech
programs involving storage and transportation and processing of
fresh items.

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The election in New Zealand
today will not produce a new government and bargains among
political parties will probably take days to complete.
</P>
<P>
Although the final results have not come out, the progress of
vote counting largely confirms the projection of the latest
opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
With about 30 percent of the party votes counted, the
indication is that the National Party will remain the largest
party in parliament by winning over 40 seats, followed by the
Labor Party with around 35 seats.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand First will capture about 15 seats, and Alliance
will take a few less seats than NZ First.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on TV, NZ First leader Winston Peters, who will play
the key role in forming the next coalition government, again
declined to name his party's future partner.
</P>
<P>
He told his supporters that NZ First will work for the best
interest of New Zealanders, and a NZ First team led by himself
will start negotiations from tomorrow.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Policy on DPRK to Remain Unchanged: Lord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The United States will not change
its policy towards the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
(DPRK) despite Pyongyang's threats of retaliation against South
Korea in connection with the recent submarine incident, a visiting
U.S. official said here today.
</P>
<P>
"We see no reason to overhaul our opinion because it has been
consistently balanced and firm over many decades. It is also
within our self-interest to see North Korea (DPRK) take a more
constructive course," said U.S. Assistant Secretary of State
Winston Lord at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
There is no difference in the perception and policy towards the
DPRK between Washington and Seoul, Lord claimed.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official arrived here on October 10 for a three-day
visit aimed at coordinating policy on the DPRK with South Korean
officials in the aftermath of the "infiltration" of a DPRK
submarine into South Korea.
</P>
<P>
South Korea has said that a group of armed DPRK people
"infiltrated" into the country's Kangwon Province from a grounded
submarine in the East Sea (Sea of Japan) on September 18.
</P>
<P>
During the three-week search operations, 11 DPRK people were
found dead, 11 were killed by South Korean troops and one was
captured alive. Three are reportedly still at large.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK has said that the submarine, while on a training
mission, drifted after having an engine trouble and hitting a rock
in the sea.
</P>
<P>
However, Seoul claimed that the case of the intrusion was not
an "inadvertent incident that occurred during routine training" as
Pyongyang said, but was a "carefully premediated act of
provocation."
</P>
<P>
The DPRK has repeatedly threatened to take retaliatory steps
against South Korea for the killing of DPRK people who "landed
ashore in South Korea due to the engine trouble of the submarine."
</P>
<P>
Lord said at the press conference that despite the recent
tension on the Korean Peninsula, both the U.S. and South Korea do
not wish to isolate the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Lord met with South Korean Deputy Prime
Minister and National Unification Board Minister Kwon O-kie,
Foreign Minister Gong Ro-myung, Senior Presidential Secretary for
Foreign Affairs and National Security Yoo Chong-ha and
Vice-Speaker of the National Assembly Oh Se-eung.
</P>
<P>
In a joint press statement released here today after the second
meeting between Gong and Lord, South Korea and the U.S. expressed
deep concern over the recent submarine incident and Pyongyang's
threats of retaliation against Seoul.
</P>
<P>
However, both sides reconfirmed the importance of maintaining
"the strength of the alliance and its joint defense readiness in
the face of the repeated threats" by the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
In their first meeting here Friday, Gong and Lord claimed that
the DPRK has to "pay the price for its submarine infiltration."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Makes Apology For Delaying Nigerian FM's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The United States Department of
State expressed regrets on Friday for delaying the Nigerian
foreign mainsiter 30-minute in his arrival in New York.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian foreign minister Tom Ikimi arrived at the John
F. Kennedy Airport on September 26 to attend the United Nations
General Assembly meeting, but was delayed under unclear
cirgumstances by U.S. immigration officers.
</P>
<P>
The Department of State said in a statement issued on Friday
that the delay was " regrettable and unitended".
</P>
<P>
The statement received from the U.S.Informatin Service here
said: ''the U.S. government has assured the Nigerian government,
through its mission at the United Nations, that it was not the
intention of the U.S. government to embarrass the foreign
minister upon his arrival.''
</P>
<P>
Local press reports quoted Nigerian Permanent Representative
at the U.N., Ibrahim Gambari, as saying in protest ''Ikimi was
told that immigration officers were trying to get State
Department clearance following their observation that the visa
issued to the minister and his entourage had restrictions on
their movements
</P>
<P>
while in the U.S., Nigerian diplomats are restricted from
travelling outside 40 km radius of New York and Washington DC as
part of U.S. sanctions prompted by the alleged human rights abuse
and lack of democracy in Nigeria following its execution of nine
Ogoni men last November.
</P>
<P>
And observers here noted the U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher has launched a fresh call for sanctions against
Nigeria in Mali recently to begin his current tour of five
African countries.
</P>
<P>
The latest diplomatic offensive is against the backdrop of
Washington's earlier soft-pedalling on Nigeria when it lauded
early this year some of Nigeria's human rights records with the
release of some political detainees, they said.

<P>
SEOUL, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Several hundred South Korean
citizens and overseas Chinese gathered in Pusan, South Korea's
largest port city, today to condenm Japan's ruling Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP) for claiming sovereignty over South Korean
and Chinese islands.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution adopted at the meeting, the participants said
that the LDP's move reflected the revival of the Japanese
militarism and urged the party to make an apology to South Korea
and China.
</P>
<P>
The LDP, in its election platform for the general elections to
be held on October 20, recently laid claim to South Korea's Tokto
Island and China's Diaoyu Islands.
</P>
<P>
Japan ruled the Korean Peninsula as a colony from 1910 until
its World War II defeat in 1945.
</P>
<P>
The Seoul-Tokyo territory dispute erupted last February when
Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihito Ikeda said that Tokto, called
Takeshima in Japanese, is part of Japanese territory, triggering
angry response from South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Ikeda's remarks followed South Korea's announcement that it
will build a wharf on Tokto Island, an outcropping rock in the
East Sea (Sea of Japan) about midway between South Korea and
Japan. The rocky islet has an area of 0.186 square kilometers.

<TEXT>
<P>
Reports from southern port of Kismaio said that the shootout
began after the two sides collided over the
revenue which would come from the seaport in Kismaio following
the arrival of a commercial vessel chartered by businessmen.
The commercial vessel is the first to dock in Kismaio Port
since the U.N. left the town in early 1995.
</P>
<P>
Heavy and small machine guns
were used during the fighting which terrified aid agencies
operating in the town, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Clan elders from the town had intervened the fighting and
managed to contain the hostility between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Unconfirmed reports said Hussein Aidid's Deputy President,
Mohamed Hagi Aden has also been involved in the start of
the fighting. Aden is a rival of General Morgan who maintains
two painted technicals inside the town controlled by
General morgan.
</P>
<P>
General Morgan, the son in-law of Somalia's
late dictator Mohamed Siad Barre, is currently allied with
Ali Mahdi Mohamed controlling north Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
This is the first such internal conflict between the supporters
of General Morgan in Kismaio, 500 km south of the capital Mogadishu,
since April this year when officials from the European Union
were caught in the middle of shooting between rival militiamen
at the airport.
</P>
<P>
The fighting had forced many other fleets to refrain from their
cocking to Kismaio Port which had good hopes for commercial vessels
as Mogadishu Port still remains closed.

central and western parts, a senior official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Many leading banks and enterprises in the inland areas have
established branches in Macao, especially after the Macao
International Airport was completed, and personnel, trade, and
information links are getting closer than ever, said Ng Fok, a
member of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).
</P>
<P>
Ng Fok, who is leading a group of members of the CPPCC National
Committee from Macao on a tour of southwest China's Sichuan
Province, made the remarks in an interview with Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
Ng said that China's central and western areas have been
establishing relations with European countries through Macao for
quite some time, creating more favorable conditions for expanding
their economic cooperation and trade.
</P>
<P>
China's central and western areas are abundant in minerals,
energy, land, and labor resources, and have a fairly good
industrial foundation, all of which are attractive to overseas
industrialists and entrepreneurs, he noted, expressing hope that
the central and western areas will increase their ties with Macao,
making good use of their advantages and increasing co-operation in
investment and trade.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Condemns Japan's Claim Over Islands' Ownership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, October 12 (Xinhua) -- A leading official newspaper
of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) today
condemned Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party for claiming
sovereignty over a small group of islands in the Sea of Japan.
</P>
<P>
The LDP, the biggest party in Japan's ruling coalition, has
claimed in its platform for the forthcoming general election that
the Tokdo islands, known as Takeshima in Japanese, belongs to
Japan.
</P>
<P>
But an article carried by Rodong Sinmun said, "The islets
undisputably belongs to the DPRK in view of both the principles of
discovery and prior occupation, which have been recognized by
international law."
</P>
<P>
In further support of the DPRK's claim to the islands, the
editorial cited the legally binding international accords which
were adopted at the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese authorities must not seek a foolish design to
realize their re-invasion of Korea and gratify their ambition for
territorial expansion by means of taking away one islet after
another from Korea," the article noted.
</P>
<P>
Japan has claimed sovereignty of the group of rocky islands
since 1905 when it signed an agreement with Korea that paved the
way for colonization. Korea says its claim to the islands date
back to the year 512 and are well-documented.
</P>
<P>
The islands lie in the south of the Sea of Japan. The barren
outcrops cover a total land area of only 250 square meters, but
the waters around them are a rich fishing ground and the land
beneath them is believed to be rich in mineral resources.

<HEADLINE> Gulf Fuel Prices to Maintain at 112-115 Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Prices for tankers' fuel
produced in the Gulf refineries, which sharply increased during
the past two years, would maintain the current rates at 112 to 115
U.S. dollars per ton until the end of the year, a Kuwaiti expert
said today.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti state-run United Arab Shipping Company Assistant
Chairman for purchasing and contracts Hajjaj Bukhadour said fuel
prices in the Gulf refineries increased by 11.5 percent in the
first half of 1996 to reach 106 U.S. dollars per ton.
</P>
<P>
Because of the increasing cost of oil refining in the Gulf
region, fuel prices rose to 112 and 115 dollars per ton, he said,
adding that indicators show that the prices would maintain the
current rates until the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
He said the prices were also subject to the supply and demand
situation as the demand on fuel was expected to increase due to
the increasing number of giant tankers.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1941 cargo ships of various types were under
construction until August 1996. As soon as the new ships enter
into service, an increasing demand for fuel will be reported,
Bukhadour said.
</P>
<P>
The fuel prices increase led to the increase of shipping
prices from 11.3 percent to 14 percent during 1996.

<HEADLINE> Thousands Protest Against Defense Industry Lay-offs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Some 10,000 defense industry
workers from all over France converged on the capital today to
protest government plans for a massive lay-off of nearly a third
of the industry's 250,000 workers over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators, arriving in the capital by train, coach and
private car, gathered in the morning at the Place de la Republique
in central Paris, holding banners proclaiming, "United for full
employment, collective status and guarantees, and the withdrawal
of the Millon plan," referring to Defense Minister Charles Millon.
</P>
<P>
The main unions, including Force Ouvriere (FO) and
Confederation General du Travail (CGT) from the naval dockyards of
Cherbourg, Brest, Lorient and Indret, where 6,600 workers are
facing the sack, sent 5,000 workers to the capital to take part in
the demonstration.
</P>
<P>
The armament factories of Saint-Etienne chartered a "train of
anger and hope" carrying 800 workers to Paris and thousands of
workers from companies with military contracts in Bordeaux,
Bourges, Charente, Vienne and Toulouse also joined the protest.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Charles Million has come up against widespread
opposition to his proposal to cut 75,000 jobs in the defense
industry in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
Trade unions have claimed that although the minister promised
to avoid "massive lay-offs," every one defense industry job shed
would indirectly put another three workers out of a job.
</P>
<P>
Naval dockyards will be worst hit. Many are expected to be
laid idle after the building of the nuclear-powered
aircraft-carrier "Charles de Gaulle" at the Brest dockyard and a
number of other navy warships are completed next year.
</P>
<P>
President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Alain Juppe are
coming under increasing pressure from public sector employees
opposed to their austerity plans designed to increase the
competitiveness of the French economy and make it eligible for
joining the single European currency in 1999.
</P>
<P>
A recent poll said that most French people believe Juppe's
government will live through another "hot autumn" and a "hot
winter" this year, following similar troubles last year when there
were massive strikes by public employees in the transportation
sector.

<HEADLINE> Over 90 Pc of Votes Counted in NZ Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The result of the 1996 New
Zealand election came as no surprise with the National Party
leading in the election followed by the Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
With over 90 percent of the votes counted by 02:10 a.m. (1310
GMT, Saturday), National won over 34 percent of the total votes
and Labor 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
Under the Mixed Member Proportional system, this gives National
44 seats in the 120-member parliament, and Labor 37 seats.
</P>
<P>
In proportion to the votes they received, New Zealand First
will have 17 seats, Alliance 13, ACT NZ 8 and the United Party 1.
</P>
<P>
National and its coalition partners, ACT and United, will only
be able to form a minority government, and they will need support
from NZ First if they wish to have a parliament majority.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Labor also needs backing from NZ First if it wishes
to come to power.
</P>
<P>
Such a situation puts NZ First in a strong position in the
post-election negotiation to form a government.

JOHANNESBURG, October 12 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela said today that the initiative for an African
peacekeeping force to deal with conflicts on the continent should
come from the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Mandela made the statements to the press after talks with
visiting U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher who came here
to drum up support for the creation of an American-funded African
peace-keeping force.

peace-keeping force, the South African president noted.
</P>
<P>
Christopher, who is on a five-nation African tour, arrived in

Christopher told reporters the United States will work closely
with African Governments to develop such a force that will make
Africa better prepared to deal with crises.

<HEADLINE> Record Grain Production Expected in Central China </HEADLINE>

<P>
ZHENGZHOU, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Grain production in China's
Henan Province is expected to hit a record high of 38.5 billion
kg, an increase of 11.1 percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
The rise in grain production is mainly attributed to an
increase in the area planted, an increase of 160,000 ha, to eight
million hectares this year. The increase will add 620 million kg
of grain output this year.
</P>
<P>
The spread of science and technology is another important
factor. Various output-raising techniques have been used, 1.3
million ha of wheat is planted in high-yield strains, and one
million ha of low- or medium-yield fields have been improved.
</P>
<P>
Per-ha grain production has increased significantly, with
farmer's awareness of technology increasing, and provincial
government incentives developed, along with favorable weather
conditions.

<HEADLINE> Fighting Erupts in Northern Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Fighting erupted between the
Afghan Taliban religious student militia and troops loyal to the
ousted Kabul government in northern Afghanistan today.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Afghanistan said the fighting was between the
Taliban fighters and a raiding guerrilla group of the former
government in Charikar, capital of Parwan province 65 kilometers
north of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
No further details were available so far from the city which
was captured by the Taliban on September 29, two days after it
took over the country's capital of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Taliban today claimed victory over the former
government troops, saying it had regained control of some areas
north of Kabul and killed and wounded scores of rebels.
</P>
<P>
"The situation has changed drastically in our favor over the
last two days," acting Information and Culture Minister Amir Khan
Mutaqi was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Radio Kabul echoed Mutaqi's claim that the Taliban were again
fully in control of Kabul and its surroundings, saying that former
government troops had suffered serious casualties in their clashes
with the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
Fighting between the Taliban and former government troops has
forced closure of the main road 20 kilometers north of Kabul
today, which indicated that fighting had crept closer to Kabul.
</P>
<P>
"The road is closed. We have a clean-up operation to clear the
area of Masood fighters," a Taliban commander said, referring to
Ahmad Shah Masood, military commander of the former government.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the fighting was about 40 kilometers from the
capital.
</P>
<P>
Masood on Wednesday launched a series of commando-style attacks
on the Taliban in their newly captured territory north of Kabul.

<HEADLINE> 200 Couples In Beijing Plant Trees To Mark Their Special Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Cheng Baoqing, an employee of
the Beijing Branch of the Agricultural Bank of China, went to
suburban Beijing's Huairou county with his new bride, Zhang Fang,
in the early morning to plant a tree there to mark their wedding
along with nearly 200 other couples.
</P>
<P>
The village is the site of China's first "Wedding and Happiness
Memory Forest" officially opened today by Chen Muhua, vice
chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress, and president of Green China Fund.
</P>
<P>
Cheng and his wife used a word from each of their names and
called their tree "Fang Qing", meaning fragrant and
pure. According to the official policy, they will own the tree and
have their names on it.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time for us to create something together,"
Zhang said, smiling, "we'll remember this very special moment for
the rest of our lives."
</P>
<P>
Zhang Jun, who works for the Huairou Construction Enterprises
Group, and her husband, also participated in today's event, and
remarked that she had never been so excited and happy, explaining
that, "when the apple tree we planted together blossoms and bears
fruit, we will feel that today is the meaningful beginning of our
new life."
</P>
<P>
A government official, Liu Kun, and his wife married during
wartime 50 years ago, and today joined the group to plant a "Gold
Marriage Tree".
</P>
<P>
They said that this is good for both their health and their
sentiments, and that the common work had given them a greater need
for each other.
</P>
<P>
A college teacher from Beijing, Zhou Qingyuan, together with
his wife, planted an "Affection Tree" today, and said, "Today we
plant a tree for love, tomorrow we will continue to plant trees
for our children. Today we plant a tree for our own new family,
tomorrow we will continue to plant trees for society, the family
of all of us."
</P>
<P>
They suggested that a new practice of planting trees to mark
important events, such as weddings and birthdays, be established.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-year-old Wang Yucheng is a primary school teacher who
came to the "Wedding and Happiness Memory Forest" with all eight
members of his family, including his two-year old grandson.
</P>
<P>
"We named the tree our family planted `Gardener Tree', because
seven members of our family are all primary school teachers, a job
that is just like that of gardeners," he explained.
</P>
<P>
For eleven-year-old Xie Yuliang, today was also a memorable
day. He came with his grandfather, who planted a "Good-wish Tree"
for him, and for whom he planted a "Long-life Tree".
</P>
<P>
The manager of the forest explains that it covers a area of
more than 170 hectares, a space enough for more than 50,000 trees.
</P>
<P>
Chen Muhua said the planting of wedding and happiness trees is
a part of socialist ethical and cultural progress, and that each
person should feel proud of making the country greener and a
better place.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-minister of Forestry Zhu Guangyao who also
attended today's event said that his ministry will make an effort
to make this kind of forest available in the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
China has a long history of emphasizing afforestation and a
tradition of attaching a special meaning to trees. March 12 has
been established as a national tree planting day.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban militia
said today that its fighters severely beat and detained a Red
Cross official in Kabul because he tried to escape a night patrol
after curfew, said reports from Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted Taliban acting Minister for Information and
Culture Amir Khan Muttaqi, as saying that "the foreigner was
walking outside after curfew."
</P>
<P>
"When he was stopped, he panicked and tried to escape," Muttaqi
added.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban soldiers thought that the foreigner was a dangerous
man, he said, noting that "if he had not panicked and ran away, he
would have been kept with dignity."
</P>
<P>
Many working staff members of the UN organizations in Kabul
have started to flee from Kabul to Islamabad, as fighting between
the Taliban and the ousted government troops crept closer to the
Afghan capital.

ISLAMABAD -- Fighting erupted between the Afghan Taliban
religious student militia and troops loyal to the ousted Kabul
government in northern Afghanistan today.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Afghanistan said the fighting was between the
Taliban fighters and a raiding guerrilla group of the former
government in Charikar, capital of Parwan province 65 kilometers
north of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
No further details were available so far from the city which
was captured by the Taliban on September 29, two days after it
took over the country's capital of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Taliban today claimed victory over the former
government troops, saying it had regained control of some areas
north of Kabul and killed and wounded scores of rebels.

JOHANNESBURG -- South African President Nelson Mandela said
today that the initiative for an African peacekeeping force to
deal with conflicts on the continent should come from the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
Mandela made the statement to the press after talks with
visiting U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher who came here
to drum up support for the creation of an American-funded African
peace-keeping force.
</P>
<P>
The initiative would have to be discussed with the organization
of African Unity and the Southern African Development Community to
win widespread support for the proposed peace-keeping force, the
South African president noted.
</P>
<P>
Christopher, who is on a five-nation African tour, arrived in
South Africa earlier today.

SEOUL -- The United States will not change its policy towards
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) despite
Pyongyang's threats of retaliation against South Korea in
connection with the recent submarine incident, a visiting
U.S. official said here today.
</P>
<P>
"We see no reason to overhaul our opinion because it has been
consistently balanced and firm over many decades. It is also
within our self-interest to see North Korea (DPRK) take a more
constructive course," said U.S. Assistant Secretary of State
Winston Lord at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
There is no difference in the perception and policy towards the
DPRK between Washington and Seoul, Lord claimed.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official arrived here on October 10 for a three-day
visit aimed at coordinating policy on the DPRK with South Korean
officials in the aftermath of the recent "infiltration" of a DPRK
submarine into South Korea.
